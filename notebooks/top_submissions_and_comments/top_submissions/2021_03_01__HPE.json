        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, March 3rd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-3-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow futures jump after Tuesday\u2019s early gain fizzles and reverses\n\n&gt; * The Dow is set to rise 200 points Wednesday after late-day selling reversed strong gains earlier in Tuesday\u2019s session. Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.\n\n&gt; * The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street\u2019s open. U.S. companies are expected to have added 225,000 new jobs in February compared to January of gains 174,000 positions. The ADP lately has not been the best predictor of the government\u2019s monthly jobs report, which comes out Friday.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Senate to begin debate soon on $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill\n\n&gt; * The Senate is expected to start debate as soon as Wednesday on its version of the House-passed, $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for \u2018every adult\u2019 by end of May\n\n&gt; * The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate \u201cevery adult in America\u201d by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. The announcement came as the administration works to increase production of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s newly cleared single-shot vaccine, and rival Merck agrees to pitch in.\n\n&gt; * The Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi both announced Tuesday that they\u2019re lifting mask mandates in their states and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity even as the decline in new daily Covid-19 cases slows. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Monday warned states against lifting public health restrictions too quickly.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. America\u2019s biggest firms push for path to citizenship for \u2018Dreamers\u2019\n\n&gt; * America\u2019s biggest companies are urging Congress to establish a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. In a letter Wednesday, a coalition of more than 100 companies and trade associations \u2014 including Facebook, General Motors, Marriott, Target, Visa and Uber \u2014 asked Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to pass the bipartisan Dream Act of 2021. The move comes as Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill look to immigration as a major legislative priority.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Stocks to watch: Rocket Companies, Las Vegas Sands, Oscar Health\n\n&gt; * Rocket Companies fell 6% in Wednesday\u2019s premarket trading after more than doubling over the past three sessions. On Tuesday, the Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage parent surged over 71% on no apparent news. The heavily shorted stock appears to have garnered bullish interest from day traders on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum.\n\n&gt; * Casino operator Las Vegas Sands said Wednesday it would sell its Vegas real estate and operations to private equity giant Apollo Global Management for about $6.25 billion. The properties include the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Shares of Las Vegas Sands were up almost 3% in the premarket. Apollo fell nearly 1%.\n\n&gt; * Oscar Health is set to debut Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The health insurance startup backed by Google-parent Alphabet priced its initial public offering Tuesday evening at $39 per share, above the already-raised expected range of $36 to $38. The IPO gives Oscar Health a market value of $7.7 billion ahead of trading.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mFJEZLD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DZktsvp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/Yq2hHN9S/econcal1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FFV78Chq/econcal2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/zRvHdP7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/PbURZ3R.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oqzviWR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HGdMXO8.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/978P5c5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/2Ltoqja.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/d0wfH06g/upgradesdowngrades1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/52wGSzBw/upgradesdowngrades2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/nh8gm2DF/upgradesdowngrades3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/85n5bWw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3PemF5S.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/0YIFXZl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lyft-las-vegas-sands-wendys-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lyft (LYFT)** \u2013 The ride-hailing company said that last week saw the highest level of ride volume since the pandemic took hold last March.

        "selftext": " \n\nI imported SIMM (Single Inline Memory Modules), between 1994 and 2006, for my branded computers.\n\nIn that time period, I watched the \"chip\" market more than I did the precious metals market - they moved daily and prices for each type of module was set by noon, each day.\n\nMy companies imported tens of thousands of SIMMs from Singapore, Taiwan, China, Spain, and a few other countries. The paperwork required at customs, in Anchorage, was due to an \"Anti Dumping Tax\". This was to prevent North Korean manufactured chips to be imported (as it should be). At the time, Goldstar became a producer of IC (Integrated Circuitry), chips as it could not keep up with the television innovations. BUT... Goldstar was a SOUTH Korean company, with no embargo, yet monitored closely. Thy produced a great product, however, they were also counterfeited easier and therefore, \"a radioactive\" product.\n\n&gt;***Side Note:***\n\nLG Semicon LLC, was a producer, specializing in IC chips. One company bought the other and both Goldstar and LG Semicon became what we now know as LG.\n\nBack in those days tracking the manufacturing of chips was crucial (no pun intended), because of the daily swing of the prices. The determining factors (which I looked at), were :\n\n* Production capacity of each factory.\n* Daily production numbers of computers.\n* Intel ($INTC), AMD, ($AMD), Microsoft ($MSFT), Compaq, HP ($HP - Hewlett Packard, at one time, \"absorbed\" Packard Bell Computers), and other mass consumers/assemblers of IC chips for PCBs (Printed Circuit Board), including details of motherboard designs and IC requirements.\n* Mother Nature and her wrath \"overseas\".\n\nThe computer makers, DELL ($DELL), Gateway, and Compaq always had first choice of available chips, due to their deep pockets and demand.\n\nA few companies in Asian countries figured out that by closing a factory, for a day or a week, they could, effectively, increase their profits quickly. This effected the entire \"Technology Sector\", although it did not exist yet.\n\n&gt;**Points:**\n\n* Always ask \"Why\".\n* \"Due Diligence\" is not just 2 levels deep. Sometimes you have to find out who is selling the sand/silica, first.\n* In this market, \"What goes down, usually comes up\". Write that down.\n* VIVA LA #REDDIT AND FREE TRADE !!",

(that's my own understanding.) for  example,\n\n&gt;Hydrogen  opportunities were investigated during the quarter and continue with a  growing interest in the space from industry and government. The  synergies between wave energy and hydrogen production strengthen  productionstrengthen the case and Carnegie has been particularly focused  on opportunities that encompass existing target markets such as  islands,  remote areas, and marine energy consumers including fish  farming. In parallel, enabling technologies are being developed by a  variety of companies that are complementary to Carnegie\u2019s activities.   For example, electrolyzers,  the  devices  that  produce  hydrogen  from   water and  electricity,  are being developed can now use seawater as  their hydrogen source rather than freshwater  \nHydrogen   is most likely to play a  role as long/medium-term storage or as a   fuel source for vessels and generators. Carnegie\u2019s role in the Blue  Economy CRCis providing good insight into the topic of hydrogen in the  marine space and opportunities will continue to be identified.\n\nthis  is basically a long-term play and they will specify it in there as  well. Imo I see the demand for renewable energy. I feel like there will  be heavy reform on how Companies and consumers use energy in the  following 50 years. they specify that in the report.\n\n&gt;Carnegie  continues to seegrowing vision and support for offshore renewables  around the world as demonstrated by actions such as the European  Commission publishing a dedicated EU strategy on offshore renewable  energyin November 2020(An EU Strategy to harness thepotential  of   offshore  renewable  energy  for  a  climate  neutral  future). The EU\u2019s  strategysupports an objective of achievingat least1 GW of ocean energy  by 2030 and 60 GW of oceanenergy  by  2050.

Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.\n\n&gt; * The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street\u2019s open.

However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for \u2018every adult\u2019 by end of May\n\n&gt; * The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate \u201cevery adult in America\u201d by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. The announcement came as the administration works to increase production of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s newly cleared single-shot vaccine, and rival Merck agrees to pitch in.\n\n&gt; * The Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi both announced Tuesday that they\u2019re lifting mask mandates in their states and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity even as the decline in new daily Covid-19 cases slows. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Monday warned states against lifting public health restrictions too quickly.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. America\u2019s biggest firms push for path to citizenship for \u2018Dreamers\u2019\n\n&gt; * America\u2019s biggest companies are urging Congress to establish a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. In a letter Wednesday, a coalition of more than 100 companies and trade associations \u2014 including Facebook, General Motors, Marriott, Target, Visa and Uber \u2014 asked Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to pass the bipartisan Dream Act of 2021. The move comes as Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill look to immigration as a major legislative priority.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5.

On Tuesday, the Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage parent surged over 71% on no apparent news. The heavily shorted stock appears to have garnered bullish interest from day traders on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum.\n\n&gt; * Casino operator Las Vegas Sands said Wednesday it would sell its Vegas real estate and operations to private equity giant Apollo Global Management for about $6.25 billion. The properties include the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Shares of Las Vegas Sands were up almost 3% in the premarket. Apollo fell nearly 1%.\n\n&gt; * Oscar Health is set to debut Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The health insurance startup backed by Google-parent Alphabet priced its initial public offering Tuesday evening at $39 per share, above the already-raised expected range of $36 to $38.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, March 3rd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-3-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow futures jump after Tuesday\u2019s early gain fizzles and reverses\n\n&gt; * The Dow is set to rise 200 points Wednesday after late-day selling reversed strong gains earlier in Tuesday\u2019s session. Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.\n\n&gt; * The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street\u2019s open. U.S. companies are expected to have added 225,000 new jobs in February compared to January of gains 174,000 positions. The ADP lately has not been the best predictor of the government\u2019s monthly jobs report, which comes out Friday.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Senate to begin debate soon on $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill\n\n&gt; * The Senate is expected to start debate as soon as Wednesday on its version of the House-passed, $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for \u2018every adult\u2019 by end of May\n\n&gt; * The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate \u201cevery adult in America\u201d by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. The announcement came as the administration works to increase production of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s newly cleared single-shot vaccine, and rival Merck agrees to pitch in.\n\n&gt; * The Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi both announced Tuesday that they\u2019re lifting mask mandates in their states and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity even as the decline in new daily Covid-19 cases slows. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Monday warned states against lifting public health restrictions too quickly.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. America\u2019s biggest firms push for path to citizenship for \u2018Dreamers\u2019\n\n&gt; * America\u2019s biggest companies are urging Congress to establish a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. In a letter Wednesday, a coalition of more than 100 companies and trade associations \u2014 including Facebook, General Motors, Marriott, Target, Visa and Uber \u2014 asked Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to pass the bipartisan Dream Act of 2021. The move comes as Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill look to immigration as a major legislative priority.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Stocks to watch: Rocket Companies, Las Vegas Sands, Oscar Health\n\n&gt; * Rocket Companies fell 6% in Wednesday\u2019s premarket trading after more than doubling over the past three sessions. On Tuesday, the Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage parent surged over 71% on no apparent news. The heavily shorted stock appears to have garnered bullish interest from day traders on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum.\n\n&gt; * Casino operator Las Vegas Sands said Wednesday it would sell its Vegas real estate and operations to private equity giant Apollo Global Management for about $6.25 billion. The properties include the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Shares of Las Vegas Sands were up almost 3% in the premarket.

        "selftext": " \n\nI imported SIMM (Single Inline Memory Modules), between 1994 and 2006, for my branded computers.\n\nIn that time period, I watched the \"chip\" market more than I did the precious metals market - they moved daily and prices for each type of module was set by noon, each day.\n\nMy companies imported tens of thousands of SIMMs from Singapore, Taiwan, China, Spain, and a few other countries. The paperwork required at customs, in Anchorage, was due to an \"Anti Dumping Tax\". This was to prevent North Korean manufactured chips to be imported (as it should be). At the time, Goldstar became a producer of IC (Integrated Circuitry), chips as it could not keep up with the television innovations. BUT... Goldstar was a SOUTH Korean company, with no embargo, yet monitored closely. Thy produced a great product, however, they were also counterfeited easier and therefore, \"a radioactive\" product.\n\n&gt;***Side Note:***\n\nLG Semicon LLC, was a producer, specializing in IC chips. One company bought the other and both Goldstar and LG Semicon became what we now know as LG.\n\nBack in those days tracking the manufacturing of chips was crucial (no pun intended), because of the daily swing of the prices. The determining factors (which I looked at), were :\n\n* Production capacity of each factory.\n* Daily production numbers of computers.\n* Intel ($INTC), AMD, ($AMD), Microsoft ($MSFT), Compaq, HP ($HP - Hewlett Packard, at one time, \"absorbed\" Packard Bell Computers), and other mass consumers/assemblers of IC chips for PCBs (Printed Circuit Board), including details of motherboard designs and IC requirements.\n* Mother Nature and her wrath \"overseas\".\n\nThe computer makers, DELL ($DELL), Gateway, and Compaq always had first choice of available chips, due to their deep pockets and demand.\n\nA few companies in Asian countries figured out that by closing a factory, for a day or a week, they could, effectively, increase their profits quickly. This effected the entire \"Technology Sector\", although it did not exist yet.\n\n&gt;**Points:**\n\n* Always ask \"Why\".\n* \"Due Diligence\" is not just 2 levels deep. Sometimes you have to find out who is selling the sand/silica, first.\n* In this market, \"What goes down, usually comes up\". Write that down.\n* VIVA LA #REDDIT AND FREE TRADE !!",

The  synergies between wave energy and hydrogen production strengthen  productionstrengthen the case and Carnegie has been particularly focused  on opportunities that encompass existing target markets such as  islands,  remote areas, and marine energy consumers including fish  farming. In parallel, enabling technologies are being developed by a  variety of companies that are complementary to Carnegie\u2019s activities.   For example, electrolyzers,  the  devices  that  produce  hydrogen  from   water and  electricity,  are being developed can now use seawater as  their hydrogen source rather than freshwater  \nHydrogen   is most likely to play a  role as long/medium-term storage or as a   fuel source for vessels and generators. Carnegie\u2019s role in the Blue  Economy CRCis providing good insight into the topic of hydrogen in the  marine space and opportunities will continue to be identified.\n\nthis  is basically a long-term play and they will specify it in there as  well. Imo I see the demand for renewable energy. I feel like there will  be heavy reform on how Companies and consumers use energy in the  following 50 years. they specify that in the report.\n\n&gt;Carnegie  continues to seegrowing vision and support for offshore renewables  around the world as demonstrated by actions such as the European  Commission publishing a dedicated EU strategy on offshore renewable  energyin November 2020(An EU Strategy to harness thepotential  of   offshore  renewable  energy  for  a  climate  neutral  future). The EU\u2019s  strategysupports an objective of achievingat least1 GW of ocean energy  by 2030 and 60 GW of oceanenergy  by  2050.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, March 3rd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-3-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow futures jump after Tuesday\u2019s early gain fizzles and reverses\n\n&gt; * The Dow is set to rise 200 points Wednesday after late-day selling reversed strong gains earlier in Tuesday\u2019s session. Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.\n\n&gt; * The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street\u2019s open. U.S. companies are expected to have added 225,000 new jobs in February compared to January of gains 174,000 positions. The ADP lately has not been the best predictor of the government\u2019s monthly jobs report, which comes out Friday.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Senate to begin debate soon on $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill\n\n&gt; * The Senate is expected to start debate as soon as Wednesday on its version of the House-passed, $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for \u2018every adult\u2019 by end of May\n\n&gt; * The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate \u201cevery adult in America\u201d by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, March 3rd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-3-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow futures jump after Tuesday\u2019s early gain fizzles and reverses\n\n&gt; * The Dow is set to rise 200 points Wednesday after late-day selling reversed strong gains earlier in Tuesday\u2019s session. Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.\n\n&gt; * The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street\u2019s open. U.S. companies are expected to have added 225,000 new jobs in February compared to January of gains 174,000 positions. The ADP lately has not been the best predictor of the government\u2019s monthly jobs report, which comes out Friday.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Senate to begin debate soon on $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill\n\n&gt; * The Senate is expected to start debate as soon as Wednesday on its version of the House-passed, $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for \u2018every adult\u2019 by end of May\n\n&gt; * The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate \u201cevery adult in America\u201d by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. The announcement came as the administration works to increase production of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s newly cleared single-shot vaccine, and rival Merck agrees to pitch in.\n\n&gt; * The Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi both announced Tuesday that they\u2019re lifting mask mandates in their states and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity even as the decline in new daily Covid-19 cases slows. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Monday warned states against lifting public health restrictions too quickly.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. America\u2019s biggest firms push for path to citizenship for \u2018Dreamers\u2019\n\n&gt; * America\u2019s biggest companies are urging Congress to establish a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. In a letter Wednesday, a coalition of more than 100 companies and trade associations \u2014 including Facebook, General Motors, Marriott, Target, Visa and Uber \u2014 asked Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to pass the bipartisan Dream Act of 2021. The move comes as Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill look to immigration as a major legislative priority.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Stocks to watch: Rocket Companies, Las Vegas Sands, Oscar Health\n\n&gt; * Rocket Companies fell 6% in Wednesday\u2019s premarket trading after more than doubling over the past three sessions. On Tuesday, the Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage parent surged over 71% on no apparent news. The heavily shorted stock appears to have garnered bullish interest from day traders on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum.\n\n&gt; * Casino operator Las Vegas Sands said Wednesday it would sell its Vegas real estate and operations to private equity giant Apollo Global Management for about $6.25 billion. The properties include the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Shares of Las Vegas Sands were up almost 3% in the premarket. Apollo fell nearly 1%.\n\n&gt; * Oscar Health is set to debut Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The health insurance startup backed by Google-parent Alphabet priced its initial public offering Tuesday evening at $39 per share, above the already-raised expected range of $36 to $38. The IPO gives Oscar Health a market value of $7.7 billion ahead of trading.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mFJEZLD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DZktsvp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/Yq2hHN9S/econcal1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FFV78Chq/econcal2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/zRvHdP7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/PbURZ3R.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oqzviWR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HGdMXO8.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/978P5c5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/2Ltoqja.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/d0wfH06g/upgradesdowngrades1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/52wGSzBw/upgradesdowngrades2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/nh8gm2DF/upgradesdowngrades3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/85n5bWw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3PemF5S.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/0YIFXZl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lyft-las-vegas-sands-wendys-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lyft (LYFT)** \u2013 The ride-hailing company said that last week saw the highest level of ride volume since the pandemic took hold last March.

        "selftext": " \n\nI imported SIMM (Single Inline Memory Modules), between 1994 and 2006, for my branded computers.\n\nIn that time period, I watched the \"chip\" market more than I did the precious metals market - they moved daily and prices for each type of module was set by noon, each day.\n\nMy companies imported tens of thousands of SIMMs from Singapore, Taiwan, China, Spain, and a few other countries. The paperwork required at customs, in Anchorage, was due to an \"Anti Dumping Tax\". This was to prevent North Korean manufactured chips to be imported (as it should be). At the time, Goldstar became a producer of IC (Integrated Circuitry), chips as it could not keep up with the television innovations. BUT... Goldstar was a SOUTH Korean company, with no embargo, yet monitored closely. Thy produced a great product, however, they were also counterfeited easier and therefore, \"a radioactive\" product.\n\n&gt;***Side Note:***\n\nLG Semicon LLC, was a producer, specializing in IC chips. One company bought the other and both Goldstar and LG Semicon became what we now know as LG.\n\nBack in those days tracking the manufacturing of chips was crucial (no pun intended), because of the daily swing of the prices. The determining factors (which I looked at), were :\n\n* Production capacity of each factory.\n* Daily production numbers of computers.\n* Intel ($INTC), AMD, ($AMD), Microsoft ($MSFT), Compaq, HP ($HP - Hewlett Packard, at one time, \"absorbed\" Packard Bell Computers), and other mass consumers/assemblers of IC chips for PCBs (Printed Circuit Board), including details of motherboard designs and IC requirements.\n* Mother Nature and her wrath \"overseas\".\n\nThe computer makers, DELL ($DELL), Gateway, and Compaq always had first choice of available chips, due to their deep pockets and demand.\n\nA few companies in Asian countries figured out that by closing a factory, for a day or a week, they could, effectively, increase their profits quickly. This effected the entire \"Technology Sector\", although it did not exist yet.\n\n&gt;**Points:**\n\n* Always ask \"Why\".\n* \"Due Diligence\" is not just 2 levels deep. Sometimes you have to find out who is selling the sand/silica, first.\n* In this market, \"What goes down, usually comes up\". Write that down.\n* VIVA LA #REDDIT AND FREE TRADE !!",

The  synergies between wave energy and hydrogen production strengthen  productionstrengthen the case and Carnegie has been particularly focused  on opportunities that encompass existing target markets such as  islands,  remote areas, and marine energy consumers including fish  farming.

For example, electrolyzers,  the  devices  that  produce  hydrogen  from   water and  electricity,  are being developed can now use seawater as  their hydrogen source rather than freshwater  \nHydrogen   is most likely to play a  role as long/medium-term storage or as a   fuel source for vessels and generators.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, March 4, 2021**\n\nStocks slumped Thursday once again, continuing the recent sellof. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) led the selloff, falling 1.64%. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 1.24% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 1.07%. At session lows, both the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 erased 2021\u2019s gains. \n\nThe moves lower came even after a new report on weekly unemployment claims came in better than expected, pointing to improving employment trends. \n\n* **Initial jobless claims:** 745,000 vs. 750,000 expected and a revised 736,000 during the prior week. \n* **Continuing claims:** 4.295 million vs. 4.300 million expected and 4.419 million during the prior week\n\nDuring a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be \u201cpatient\u201d in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, \u201cIf we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.\u201d\n\nAs Treasury yields continue to rise, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-growth names that led the markets in 2020. Technology stocks came under exceptional selling pressure as traders turned their focus to stocks poised to benefit more directly from an impending economic reopening. At the same time, the recent, rapid rise in Treasury yields has also deterred investors from growth stocks, with interest rates closely tied to borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to around 1.544% at the time of writing. \n\nIn other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits. Republicans do not support the bill because of its size, but through a process called reconciliation, Democrats will be able to pass the bill without support from the other side of the aisle.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The decisions by Britain and the United States to suspend retaliatory tariffs will create space for negotiations on an ongoing dispute between Boeing (BA) and Airbus, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday. \n* President Biden said his administration expects to have enough COVID-19 vaccines for any adult that wants it by the end of May, pulling the targets two months closer than the previous government estimate.\n* U.S. mortgage rates extended their recent leg higher to break above 3% for the first time since July 2020, raising concerns that the housing market's breakneck growth last year may sharply lose momentum.\n* Square (SQ) announced it took a majority stake in music platform Tidal that is owned by rapper Jay-Z. Jay-Z will be added to the board of directors at Square. \n* **Please note that the stock price was written in the morning and does not account for intraday changes.**\n* Airbnb (ABNB) with a host of target raises just over the $200 mark.

        "selftext": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/kj2uu8/some_noob_dd_for_some_interesting_canadian/\n\n(Link is deleted now, but I posted this when PyroGenisis was around $3/share and HPQ was around 85c.)\n**Here's the deleted post**\n&gt;Some noob DD from me. I think these stocks are a great long term hold. Don't use this as advice, do your own DD. Informative purposes only\n\n&gt;I've been looking at PyroGenesis (PYR.TO) ever since they announced they were looking to uplist on NASDAQ. PyroGenesis Canada Inc. designs, develops, manufactures, and commercializes advanced plasma processes and systems in Canada and internationally. They are involved in Metals, Waste management, Innovation &amp; Custom Process development (HPQ-Silicon), Plasma Torches (see previous DD by /u/Greasyfork\n\n&gt;Two of their main products piqued my interest- \n\n&gt;1)- Plasma torches\n\n&gt;These plasma torches are an environmentally friendly alternative to using fossil fuels in the Iron Pelletization industry. Currently PyroGenesis is the only company that has a patent for such a process in the industry. \n\n&gt;Just recently, they announced they had a contract with a major iron ore supplier equaling $3.6M\n\n&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-signs-initial-plasma-torch-213000493.html &gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-signs-additional-1-1mm-133500724.html\n\n&gt;It also mentions there that \"The Client, which has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions, has over ten (10) plants, each possibly requiring up to 50 plasma torches.\" - That's approx $500-600M future revenue that the client has committed to purchase exclusively from PyroGenesis. PyroGenesis will also be providing after sale services to this client for additional revenue\n\n&gt;That is just ONE contract with one company. Expect many more contracts over the years as more companies decide to ditch fossil fuels and go with a more green solution\n\n&gt;2- Innovation &amp; Custom Process development (HPQ-Silicon)\n\n&gt;That brings to the second company on my radar, HPQ Silicon Resources (HPQ.V, OTC:URAGF) They are involved in the exploration, mining, and production of silicon metals, solar grade silicon metals, and porous silicon wafers.\n\n&gt;A few months ago, PyroGenesis &amp; HPQ Silicon signed an agreement to develop The PUREVAPTM NSiR process. Once up and runing, HPQ NANO can deliver to advanced materials companies and battery manufacturers a cost competitive, tailor-made product, that can replace graphite in batteries and thereby allow the deployment of truly powerful next generation Li-ion batteries\n\n&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hpq-silicon-pyrogenesis-sign-nano-170500452.html\n\n&gt;PyroGenesis then sold the IP rights of the PUREVAP\u2122 NSiR process which included a 10% royalty for any sales which PyroGenesis can convert into a 50% ownership of HPQ\n\n&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-signs-3m-contract-hpq-174600535.html\n\n&gt;Before they even started any production, they already have an order for the material from a major Car manufacturer \n\n&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hpq-nano-receives-first-order-190300952.html\n\n&gt;And earlier today, they announced that their first reactor has been commissioned and is ready to start production. \n\n&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hpq-nano-reaches-major-milestones-141000141.html\n\nSince that post- there have been a number of developments- PyroGenesis stock price is now at $7.7ish (peak of $12) (which IMO is a great buy-in point) &amp; HPQ price is around $1.1 (peak of ~$1.6)\n\nJanuary 12- they announced implementation of a NCIB- When the company thinks their share price is undervalued, they can opt to buy back some shares thus reducing supply &amp; increasing value for shareholders\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-announces-implementation-ncib-133500312.html\n\nJan 21- HPQ announced that their Gen1 Nano Silicon Reactor Exceeds Expectations\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-announces-implementation-ncib-133500312.html\n\nFeb 02- PyroGenesis filed form 40-f with the SEC\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-files-form-40-f-204300768.html\n\nFeb 18- Nasdaq application all but approved\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-provides-listing-application-nasdaq-192500547.html\n\nLast time the market had a bit of a correction (Feb 23) and the stock price went from around $11 to $7ish, the company put put a press release specifically stating that everything was on track, no financing planned, company has cash, etc\n\nYesterday, they announced a new appointment to the board of directors-Mr. Ben Naccarato who has over 30 years of experience in the sector. BUT what I found interesting was tucked away at the end of the press release- \n\n\"Separately, the Company is pleased to announce today that it has entered into a lease agreement for an additional 31, 632 sq. ft. which will almost double its existing manufacturing footprint in Montreal, QC, Canada.\"\n\nSo they are planning on doubling their manufacturing capability\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-pleased-announce-appointment-mr-212000379.html\n\nAll in all, I think this is a very good long term investment- they are the only leaders in the Plasma industry and they have 2 (other) products that I havent mentioned, they are the only non-US based company to have their equipment on US navy aircraft carriers and have a lot of other things going for them\n\nAs always, I am not a financial advisor, I just like the stock. do you own DD",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, March 4, 2021**\n\nStocks slumped Thursday once again, continuing the recent selloff. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) led the selloff, falling 1.64%. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 1.24% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 1.07%. At session lows, both the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 erased 2021\u2019s gains. \n\nThe moves lower came even after a new report on weekly unemployment claims came in better than expected, pointing to improving employment trends. \n\n* **Initial jobless claims:** 745,000 vs. 750,000 expected and a revised 736,000 during the prior week. \n* **Continuing claims:** 4.295 million vs. 4.300 million expected and 4.419 million during the prior week\n\nDuring a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be \u201cpatient\u201d in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, \u201cIf we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.\u201d\n\nAs Treasury yields continue to rise, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-growth names that led the markets in 2020. Technology stocks came under exceptional selling pressure as traders turned their focus to stocks poised to benefit more directly from an impending economic reopening. At the same time, the recent, rapid rise in Treasury yields has also deterred investors from growth stocks, with interest rates closely tied to borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to around 1.544% at the time of writing. \n\nIn other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits. Republicans do not support the bill because of its size, but through a process called reconciliation, Democrats will be able to pass the bill without support from the other side of the aisle.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The decisions by Britain and the United States to suspend retaliatory tariffs will create space for negotiations on an ongoing dispute between Boeing (BA) and Airbus, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday. \n* President Biden said his administration expects to have enough COVID-19 vaccines for any adult that wants it by the end of May, pulling the targets two months closer than the previous government estimate.\n* U.S. mortgage rates extended their recent leg higher to break above 3% for the first time since July 2020, raising concerns that the housing market's breakneck growth last year may sharply lose momentum.\n* Square (SQ) announced it took a majority stake in music platform Tidal that is owned by rapper Jay-Z. Jay-Z will be added to the board of directors at Square. \n* **Please note that the stock price was written in the morning and does not account for intraday changes.**\n* Airbnb (ABNB) with a host of target raises just over the $200 mark.

Then you may ask: \u2018When is the time to buy low?\u2019 The answer is: When there is maximum pessimism.\u201d - Sir John Templeton",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, March 3rd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-3-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow futures jump after Tuesday\u2019s early gain fizzles and reverses\n\n&gt; * The Dow is set to rise 200 points Wednesday after late-day selling reversed strong gains earlier in Tuesday\u2019s session. Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.\n\n&gt; * The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street\u2019s open. U.S. companies are expected to have added 225,000 new jobs in February compared to January of gains 174,000 positions. The ADP lately has not been the best predictor of the government\u2019s monthly jobs report, which comes out Friday.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Senate to begin debate soon on $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill\n\n&gt; * The Senate is expected to start debate as soon as Wednesday on its version of the House-passed, $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for \u2018every adult\u2019 by end of May\n\n&gt; * The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate \u201cevery adult in America\u201d by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. The announcement came as the administration works to increase production of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s newly cleared single-shot vaccine, and rival Merck agrees to pitch in.\n\n&gt; * The Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi both announced Tuesday that they\u2019re lifting mask mandates in their states and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity even as the decline in new daily Covid-19 cases slows. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Monday warned states against lifting public health restrictions too quickly.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. America\u2019s biggest firms push for path to citizenship for \u2018Dreamers\u2019\n\n&gt; * America\u2019s biggest companies are urging Congress to establish a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. In a letter Wednesday, a coalition of more than 100 companies and trade associations \u2014 including Facebook, General Motors, Marriott, Target, Visa and Uber \u2014 asked Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to pass the bipartisan Dream Act of 2021. The move comes as Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill look to immigration as a major legislative priority.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Stocks to watch: Rocket Companies, Las Vegas Sands, Oscar Health\n\n&gt; * Rocket Companies fell 6% in Wednesday\u2019s premarket trading after more than doubling over the past three sessions. On Tuesday, the Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage parent surged over 71% on no apparent news. The heavily shorted stock appears to have garnered bullish interest from day traders on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum.\n\n&gt; * Casino operator Las Vegas Sands said Wednesday it would sell its Vegas real estate and operations to private equity giant Apollo Global Management for about $6.25 billion. The properties include the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Shares of Las Vegas Sands were up almost 3% in the premarket. Apollo fell nearly 1%.\n\n&gt; * Oscar Health is set to debut Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The health insurance startup backed by Google-parent Alphabet priced its initial public offering Tuesday evening at $39 per share, above the already-raised expected range of $36 to $38. The IPO gives Oscar Health a market value of $7.7 billion ahead of trading.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mFJEZLD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DZktsvp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/Yq2hHN9S/econcal1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FFV78Chq/econcal2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/zRvHdP7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/PbURZ3R.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oqzviWR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HGdMXO8.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/978P5c5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/2Ltoqja.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/d0wfH06g/upgradesdowngrades1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/52wGSzBw/upgradesdowngrades2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/nh8gm2DF/upgradesdowngrades3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/85n5bWw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3PemF5S.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/0YIFXZl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* OCGN\n* KMPH\n* RKT\n* TRXC\n* UWMC\n* OVID\n* FUBO\n* DIA\n* HZON\n* GENE\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lyft-las-vegas-sands-wendys-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lyft (LYFT)** \u2013 The ride-hailing company said that last week saw the highest level of ride volume since the pandemic took hold last March.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, March 3rd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-3-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow futures jump after Tuesday\u2019s early gain fizzles and reverses\n\n&gt; * The Dow is set to rise 200 points Wednesday after late-day selling reversed strong gains earlier in Tuesday\u2019s session. Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.\n\n&gt; * The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street\u2019s open. U.S. companies are expected to have added 225,000 new jobs in February compared to January of gains 174,000 positions. The ADP lately has not been the best predictor of the government\u2019s monthly jobs report, which comes out Friday.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Senate to begin debate soon on $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill\n\n&gt; * The Senate is expected to start debate as soon as Wednesday on its version of the House-passed, $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for \u2018every adult\u2019 by end of May\n\n&gt; * The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate \u201cevery adult in America\u201d by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. The announcement came as the administration works to increase production of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s newly cleared single-shot vaccine, and rival Merck agrees to pitch in.\n\n&gt; * The Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi both announced Tuesday that they\u2019re lifting mask mandates in their states and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity even as the decline in new daily Covid-19 cases slows. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Monday warned states against lifting public health restrictions too quickly.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. America\u2019s biggest firms push for path to citizenship for \u2018Dreamers\u2019\n\n&gt; * America\u2019s biggest companies are urging Congress to establish a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. In a letter Wednesday, a coalition of more than 100 companies and trade associations \u2014 including Facebook, General Motors, Marriott, Target, Visa and Uber \u2014 asked Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to pass the bipartisan Dream Act of 2021. The move comes as Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill look to immigration as a major legislative priority.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Stocks to watch: Rocket Companies, Las Vegas Sands, Oscar Health\n\n&gt; * Rocket Companies fell 6% in Wednesday\u2019s premarket trading after more than doubling over the past three sessions. On Tuesday, the Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage parent surged over 71% on no apparent news. The heavily shorted stock appears to have garnered bullish interest from day traders on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum.\n\n&gt; * Casino operator Las Vegas Sands said Wednesday it would sell its Vegas real estate and operations to private equity giant Apollo Global Management for about $6.25 billion. The properties include the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Shares of Las Vegas Sands were up almost 3% in the premarket. Apollo fell nearly 1%.\n\n&gt; * Oscar Health is set to debut Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The health insurance startup backed by Google-parent Alphabet priced its initial public offering Tuesday evening at $39 per share, above the already-raised expected range of $36 to $38. The IPO gives Oscar Health a market value of $7.7 billion ahead of trading.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mFJEZLD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DZktsvp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/Yq2hHN9S/econcal1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FFV78Chq/econcal2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/zRvHdP7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/PbURZ3R.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oqzviWR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HGdMXO8.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/978P5c5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/2Ltoqja.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/d0wfH06g/upgradesdowngrades1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/52wGSzBw/upgradesdowngrades2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/nh8gm2DF/upgradesdowngrades3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/85n5bWw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3PemF5S.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/0YIFXZl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* OCGN\n* KMPH\n* RKT\n* TRXC\n* UWMC\n* OVID\n* FUBO\n* DIA\n* HZON\n* GENE\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lyft-las-vegas-sands-wendys-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lyft (LYFT)** \u2013 The ride-hailing company said that last week saw the highest level of ride volume since the pandemic took hold last March.

        "selftext": "DISCLAIMER: Please do your own research - no investment is without risk, and may lose value.\n\nMarket Cap = 146M. Share price at close = $7.91\n\nSECTOR: Information Technology, INDUSTRY: Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals\n\nSummary: One Stop Systems, Inc. designs, manufactures, and markets custom **high-speed computing systems** for high-performance edge computing applications in the US and internationally. Its GPU expansion units add hundreds of computing cores and teraflops of computing performance to virtually any original equipment manufacturer server. OSS' flash storage arrays provide hundreds of terabytes of storage and **millions of input/output operations per second** (see applications, below). It also offers servers for PCI express-over-cable expansion; desktop expansion appliances in various configurations that add input/output flexibility to any user's desktop system; **PCIe expansions,** and ruggedized mobile high-performance compute devices to meet specialized requirements for devices deployed at the edge in **various environmental conditions**. One Stop Systems, Inc. was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Escondido, California. \n\nAPPLICATIONS \\- buckle in, exciting stuff.\n\nWith wide-ranging applications like AI, autonomous cars, and military technologies we don't even know exist yet (laser tech, threat detection, missile targeting), \"edge computing\" is sure to expand and meet growing demand for high-performance computing able to provide millions of actionable data points every second. In January 2021, OSS announced their 4th military contract via project \u201cOrange Gear,\u201d an AI system that enables U.S. Navy aircraft to conduct real-time AI-powered threat detection. Shooting down enemy assets, what guides the weapon? OSS enables the second-to-second calculations to achieve such precision. \n\nInteresting fact: OSS chief sales and marketing officer Jim Ison says they are going to \u201cexpand the support of wartime theater applications for [land, sea, air and space](http://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2021/01/05/2153506/0/en/OSS-Wins-Fourth-Program-with-Major-Military-Contractor.html).\u201d ***SPACE***. What an incredible hint of things to come! The final frontier, space exploration represents a vast yet untapped potential area of edge computing expansion. Heck, the previous administration just created a new *branch of the military* specifically for protecting America\u2019s interests above the stratosphere. Also consider that the USA, with a defense budget of $700 billion annually, will likely purchase American-made edge computing tech in-house, avoiding adversaries like China. OSS seems here to stay.\n\nWhile military contracts might not whet your appetite, consider autonomous driving. OSS\u2019 ingenious \u201cAI on the Fly\u201d enables in-vehicle \u201cruggedized\u201d autonomous driving. Here is a company rep, much smarter than myself, excited to provide more detail on [OSS' computing devices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAagBi_j4cA&amp;ab_channel=InsideHPCReport) in self-driving vehicles.\n\nSo what is a PCIe? The PCIe is the motherboard site that interfaces with a computer's graphics cards, hard drive adapter, SSDs, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet hardware connections. In June 2020, OSS introduced the [world\u2019s first](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/22/2051412/0/en/OSS-Introduces-World-s-First-PCIe-Gen-4-Expansion-System-for-NVIDIA-A100-PCIe-GPUs.html#:~:text=(Nasdaq%3A%20OSS)%2C%20a,20X%20over%20the%20previous%20generation) PCIe Gen4 Expansion System that fully supports NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, which can boost computing performance up to 20X over the previous generation. The OSS Gen4 Expansion System allows system developers to scale out almost any Gen4 server by adding up to eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The system is ideal for boosting the performance of compute-intensive applications like **AI training, AI inference, video analytics and XR rendering**. What is XR rendering? X is just a placeholder! Virtual, Mixed, or Augmented reality (VR, MR, or AR, respectively) experiences include those where users generate new forms of reality by bringing digital objects into the physical world and those that see the bringing physical world objects into the digital world. Yes, OSS also powers augmented reality applications.\n\nINDUSTRY - is there growth to \u201cEdge Computing\u201d as a field? \n\n[MarketsandMarkets](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/edge-computing-market-133384090.html#:~:text=Edge%20computing%20can%20be%20used,%2C%20healthcare%2C%20and%20many%20others) projects the global edge computing market to grow from **$3.6 billion in 2020 to $15.7 billion by 2025**, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 34.1% during the forecast period. Factors such as the growing adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) across industries; rising demand for low-latency processing and real-time, automated decision-making solutions; and a need for surmounting exponentially increasing data volumes and network traffic.\n\nPARTNERSHIPS\n\nOSS is diversified in its partnerships with the big boys - Apple, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Boeing, IBM, Lenovo, HP, and [many others](https://www.onestopsystems.com/partners).\n\nMEAT AND POTATOES - finances \n\nFollowing IPO in 2018, OSS already generates $60 million in revenue, increasing 45% YOY. \n\nHow about its market share? To find a company\u2019s size, or \u201cmarket cap,\u201d multiply the current share price by the number of shares. OSS clocks in with 16,620,000 shares x $7.91 = 131M. For a company with a 130M market cap, $60M in revenue represents very strong revenue (46%) to its size. For comparison\u2019s sake, NVDA market cap is 335B and generates 16.7B annually (5%). With 31% institutional ownership \u2013 and [increasing](https://fintel.io/so/us/oss) \u2013 this is certainly on the radar of the big players.\n\nA note about earnings per share (EPS) - OSS\u2019 earnings announcement is coming between March 19 and 25. Based on two analyst forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $0.04 with 12.17M revenue. Indeed, OSS has quickly transformed itself into a profitable enterprise with [consistent revenue beats](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OSS/earnings) to boot. \n\nBALANCE SHEET\n\nIn short, OSS has 40M in assets, 11M in liabilities and 2M total debt. \n\n*Processing img 0357jvc0uok61...*\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nFormerly the interim head, now-CEO [David Raun](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/25/2053412/0/en/OSS-Appoints-David-Raun-Technology-Industry-Veteran-as-President-CEO.html) has two decades of experience in the PCIe area, and led PLX Technology to record revenue and profits before getting acquired by Broadcom (AVGO).\n\nCOMPETITORS\n\nForget the stellar partnerships, what about the competition? Within the well-differentiated industry of Hardware, Storage, and Peripherals are 40 companies ranging from Apple to Ricoh. The direct competitor to watch for is Supermicro (SMCI). SMCI, however, makes no mention of cloud-readiness in its press release (coincidentally publicized merely hours after OSS, on the very same day - nervous, perhaps?). \n\nOn the other hand, the OSS 4UV can connect almost any Gen 4 server to eight A100 PCIe GPUs and two NICs, also offering a complete NVIDIA GPU **cloud-ready solution** with the OSS 4UV pre-installed in an OSS 2U-EOS-4a Gen 4 server.\n\nOFFERING\n\nPremarket Tuesday, March 2nd, OSS announced a 1.5M share offering to an institutional investor. Remarkably, OSS showed strength into the mid-morning, after opening at $7.56 it hit a high of $8.79 before succumbing to general market weakness and closing at $7.91, down 11% (see daily chart below). A green candle the day after an offering? Sounds like a great dip to buy. \n\nTECHNICALS\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tf412r4quok61.jpg?width=1522&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d061155dc969bb6663af3fd38c9d1014ed799264\n\nVolume has been readily coming in. A stock that previously traded around 40k volume is now averaging big volumes, over 1M+ daily. What happened? I think institutions are beginning to catch on. Currently above the 5, 20, and 50 moving averages, OSS bounced nicely off the 20 MA during a big intra-day rally (40%+) on March 1st, 2021 hitting a fresh 52-week high of $9.50 without apparent news. \n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nInvestors should ask the question, \"where could this company be in 2 to 3 years?\" With OSS, we have a case study in a profitable company meeting big revenue expectations relatively soon after IPO, invaluable partnerships, military contracts, and anticipatory growth in the industry and beyond.\n\nPOSITIONS: I am in for 1300 shares at $8.60.",

You could say... I LIKE the mod team.*\n\nWhy did we not get transparency about how g\u00e6mstonk megathreads were going to be handled, ahead of time?\n\nFirst, the thread wasn't made.\n\nThen the threads made by users were being manually deleted.\n\nThen we got a comment stickied to the top of the daily thread saying words to the effect of \"no more g\u00e6mstonk daily threads, more news later.\"\n\nThat comment got deleted.\n\nThen we're told \"it's because interest in g\u00e6mstonk has died down\" (???????? Do you people LOOK at your own subreddit?)\n\nThen RKT gets a sticky. It gets MASS brigaded by the rightly fucked off g\u00e6mstonk pushers.\n\nThen we get told that the mods simply \"forgot\" to make the g\u00e6mstonk thread.\n\nThen finally, it was because Opinion forgot to set an alarm.\n\n...\n\nWhat. The. Fuck. Is. Going. On?\n\nYou don't want people to believe in conspiracies? Act homogeneously and transparently.\n\nI haven't seen ANY good DD on g\u00e6mstonk for DAYS even though there is TONS of important movement going on with it. Somehow RKT is the ONLY majorly mentioned DD ticker on Monday? Somehow *that alone justifies a sticky?*\n\nThat precedent is extremely dangerous. I hope you have highly competent tools that protect against vote manipulation and spam... because if all it takes is a single highly rated post and ticker the day before to earn a sticky the following day... you leave the entire subreddit vulnerable.\n\nAs a side note... Everyone believes 3/19 is the MOASS date... BUT OPEN INTEREST IN g\u00e6mstonk IS HIGHER THIS FRIDAY. THIS. FRIDAY.\n\nI am extremely bullish on GME and in my opinion this is the second best time to buy. It can't only go up. But if momentum is there... it can. I doubt MM's have delta'd for 200. 250. 300. 350... for this Friday, because right now it's limping at 115. And there are 24,000 calls at 800 for Friday. That is just ASTRONOMICAL.\n\nMovement is best THIS WEEK.\n\nNobody knows it... because all the front page g\u00e6mstonk text posts are just straight dumpster garbage. Zero information. All fluff. And people wonder why they think it's a dead play, a dumb play. \n\nI don't want to believe asinine theories like top-down manipulation. So some clarity on this is going to deeply alleviate that poisonous sentiment.\n\nEdit: there is a mod reply, please don't downvote it.\n\nEdit 2: this is a really good time to remind retail that... we are a significant force. Decoherent, stupid, self destructive... but sometimes even a room full of monkeys all throw their shit in the same direction. So just be more conscious of what that direction is.\n\nEdit 4: I censored the ticker to avoid spam from bots. Guess it worked. Had hardly any (like one?) Emoji/stupid comment.",

        "selftext": "I have no idea how to write one of these, I just like the stock, and I don't want you Apes to miss out on this. Also i've been suffering with this bad boy as it has been oversold and shorted for the past month. Yes $RKT is absolutely mooning right now. Did you miss the RKT Rocket? Don't FOMO on the way back down to earth. Great news, theres another one on the tarmac ready for liftoff. It's name is $UWMC. $UWMC got a little bit of traction a month or so ago leading up to its earnings report after a massive SPAC deal. Guess what? It absolutely crushed its earnings. UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively.  This company is just getting started and has massive opportunity for growth. It was trading around $11 and got as high as $12 leading up to the earnings report? What happened after they released news that they absolutely crushed it? The stock plummeted, and it kept plummeting. It had maybe 4 green days out of 30 in the month after its earnings report. Why? Shorts. Who do we hate? The shorts! \n\nAdditionally, its a great income stock! UWMC declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021. Do you like free money? Load up on this bad boy prior to March 10th! \n\nThere are plenty of other catalysts and reasons to long this. It is getting added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 index by the end of this month, and it will absolutely crush its earnings again this quarter. Tomorrow, contracts will be pretty expensive as IV will go thru the roof in the AM, but as of market close there were still very reasonable prices for March, April, and May (post earnings) calls.  \n\nLook at this activity aftermarket, it is up $1.30 (\\~15%)! Do you wanna be staring from the sidelines as this stock rockets like $RKT? \n\n\\*Disclaimer\\* I am Long UWMC and have calls for both April and May.  This is not financial advice I just like the stock!!",

Jay Farner, the CEO is going live with Morgan Stanley during a TECH conference to have a fireside chat.\n\nYou're going to tell me that they just happened to have this scheduled smack in the middle of the week of hell for RKT shorts? You're going to tell me that there's no way they might drop a bomb that truly sends RKT to the stratosphere?\n\nI have no fucking idea. But I trust in Dan Gilbert &amp; Co. to win. Because that's all they've done for the past 35 fucking years. WIN.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo make things even sweeter, more dry powder is coming in tomorrow- market makers making new options tomorrow. Remember the first time new options came out for GME? If you bought even the farthest OTM one, it printed.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8MM WILL HAVE TO REMAIN DELTA NETURAL WITH THEIR NEW OPTIONS \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8, THUS THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY SHARES. THEREFORE, THE MORE NEW OPTIONS BOUGHT TOMORROW, THE MORE FUEL IS LOADED FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE. \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo close things up, recall that RKT had 40% interest going into this week. Look at today's graph.\n\n\\[LINK 2\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotice those two drops where it halted? See the STRONG support that immediately followed? This is a textbook example of a ladder attack. The SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, AT A NEW PRICE. Shorts ATTEMPTED to shake the \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 , but failed. Retail is NOT ALONE on this \ud83d\ude80. The DIP is being purchased, even while at an ATH.  Someone is on the LONG side buying up shares with retail.\n\nIn my opinion, after today, short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40%. Look at the candles during those short ladder attacks. Shorts had to have borrow MILLIONS of shares to attempt to short ladder today. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Melvin &amp; CO's latest play to dig themselves out of their Gamestop loss porn either.\n\nMORE SHORTING = MORE SHORTS TO CHOKE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that's reason 1. There's a nonzero chance Jay Farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere. But what's reason 2?\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8MY PRICE TARGET FOR RKT IS $73.5 \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\nLet's go through the numbers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRKT's projected EPS for this year is \\~ $2.45. \n\n\\[LINK 3\\] \\~ (SOURCE IS ON SA, REMOVED LINK BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING MY POST DELETED)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo get P/E, take the price and divide by earnings. Thus, we can use this to calculate the forward P/E for RKT. RKT closed at $41.79, which divided by $2.45 is \\~17.05. Thus, RKT currently trades at about a 17Forward P/E. Companies in this sector trade in between 15-30 P/E, and since I strongly believe RKT is a growth stock, I think it should trade at 30x P/E.\n\nThus, 30 x $2.45 is $73.5.\n\nTherefore, my PT for RKT is $73.5. RKT is a fintech company, and is a PROFITABLE one. Think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and aren't even profitable?\n\nYou know what that means?\n\nIT'S NOT FUCKING OVER. IF SUITS ARE BUYING AT ATH, IM BUYING AT ATH. IF SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZE. THE SUITS AGREE. RKT IS WORTH MORE THAN $40.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: SHORT INTEREST HAS PROBABLY GONE UP, SUITS ARE BUYING. CURRENT P/E is 17, GROWTH PE IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE AT LEAST 30. RKT IS STILL UNDERVALUED, AND MY PRICE TARGET IS $73.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember, \ud83d\ude80 fundamentally a great company. They are still NOT priced as a growth stock. They are still NOT considered Fintech by the suits. There is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ATH.\n\nI LIKE THE STOCK.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy PT is $73.5. NO \ud83e\uddfb\ud83d\udc50\n\nNot financial advice. I don't know anything.\n\nPositions: 150 shares, 50 $23 C 3/5 EXP. I will be exercising almost all my calls as I am LONG.\n\nI will be purchasing OTM calls tomorrow at open \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Ok look apes, I have been following the GME trends since before the first squeeze. Needless to say, much like the rest of you, I have spent hours upon hours looking at the trends, shorts, and data since the day of reckoning last month. \n\n**And with the jump last week there has been a lot of paper hand BS/ Misinformation being spread** (especially with RKT)\n\n**To simply put it,** in my opinion, **we are on the verge of something big**... \n\n**TL:DR at the bottom for the most atuist**\n\nHere is why my fellow tards,\n\n1) **We have proven the community strength**, A LOT I MEAN A LOT of us have held and held until we were finally seeing some **green** for the first time in weeks. I mean serious green, despite the quote on quote \"**Lackluster day**\" we are still up **162.5%** the past WEEK!\n\n2) **A stock with relatively little discussion on this page (RKT) is suddenly piking 50,60,70% increase???** Not to knock any fellow apes who invested (hopefully we will see a dump in GME soon after) but **it is so suspicious that a large movement into RKT aligns with the GME rise.** Don't take my word on this, but we have seen in the past other **\"GAMMA SQUEEZE\" for fill in the blank as soon as GME has spiked, and what happens after? They fall and fall hard.** \n\n3) The HF are scared, bad. With news breaking about Melvin and Citadale breaking over the past week, we know **that they have lost billions.** Not only that , they have continued to short the stock with heavy volume. Now with naked shorting, no one knows what the present of the float is exactly, but the estimate remains high. \n\nSOURCE: Wall Street Journal, 5 days ago. \n\n*Processing img v59kaj2xapk61...*\n\n**Now why you might ask losing roughly 50% of your entire capital important? If you are an autist, and I know you are, let me explain.** I mentioned this in my last post, but essential without capital, **how can HF run effective short latter attacks as we saw after the enormous initial spike? They can't- or at least we hope- with what we have seen over the past few days, GME has not seen any significant short latter attacks, heck we have gone up $20 alone this week!!! (EVEN WITH THE MARKET SHITTING ITS PANTS)** \n\n4) **With contracts being exercised last week at around $55 dollars, we saw a gamma squeeze occur.** Now I have seen 5+ people on here explain wildly differing theories ranging from, if we hit 130 it will trigger the next squeeze, or on 3/15 the squeeze will happen! Now we can all take this with a grain of salt, after all, we are apes. **But what we can do is hold and continue to break resistance, yesterday was $113, today it was $120.** In my opinion, if we continue to rise steadily we can trigger another ITM call and see another squeeze. \n\n[F ROBINHOOD](https://preview.redd.it/w55we4o6dpk61.png?width=933&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e211a49e42220b19f3998f6c764a4dbd428c5bb0)\n\n5) **I know that to your paper hands this will kill you, but if the squeeze never happens GME is a great long-term hold. Here is why:** \n\n\\-They have landed a **huge** multi-year deal with micro soft.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7dvfklepdpk61.png?width=993&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5b6fb6667ffa99e41bb73b473f9ecb0f25e8f9d\n\n\\-**They fired their insanely incompetent CFO Jim Bell,** seriously look him up dude was a douche.\n\nthis shows seriously **promising financial redevelopment for GME.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[STILL F ROBINHOOD](https://preview.redd.it/q5m4zzdjepk61.png?width=939&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44bddf0d683a160630575ae539c13438fff57204)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-**New wave of modernization in the gaming world. As a gamer myself, not to brag, I would love to see GME rise and take over as the ultimate streaming platform, and with the new push for the future and deals that just landed, I think that there is a pretty good chance this will happen.** \n\n**TL:DR- IMO I think we have this. There is clear panic on the HF sides, we are up $20 from Monday with a shit ass entire market, there have been no outstanding short latter attacks, HF is down billions with high interest, there is a flood for a \"NEW SQUEEZE RKT\" (DISTRACTION), we have been stable and we are holding. IMO if we break resistance at 130, there will be some serious momentum.**   \n\n\n**IN SORT HOLD THE MF LINES RETARDS- I am not an advisor we just like the stock.**",

        "selftext": "**The Key to Success has Been Underneath Your Nose the Entire Time**\n\nThe key detail that every new trader seems to miss is that volume ultimately controls price movements because the presence of adequate volume validates the price movement. If a price movement fails to be validated by adequate volume , then there is going to be an equal an opposite reaction. There exists a variable that satisfies both quantitative and fundamental analysts. That is the Volume Weighted Average Price ( VWAP ) and it is complemented by the Volume Weighted Moving Average ( VWMA ). When you do not consider the weight of volume in price movements, you are at the mercy of manipulative, high volume whales that seek to sink Simple Moving Averages ( SMAs ) during times of low volume in the interest of accumulation of the asset.\n\nVWAPs can be treated as the \"true\" price of an asset on any given resolution, but become less sensitive to change as you zoom out. These ever-shifting values can be treated as floors, in bullish times, and ceilings, during a bear market. You can always expect a \"bounce\" off of the VWAP in the opposite direction at least once as price attempts to cross over it. These resistance lines are useful to every audience, the soon-to-be long holders who would like to plan a decent entry, the short sellers trying to make a quick buck, and the swing traders who like to make money regardless of who controls the market. One should always keep in mind that price never strays too far from the VWAP before attempting to violently correct itself in the other direction.\n\nThere is a measure of movement around the VWAP , which we'll call volatility , and it masks the true price of the asset and its direction. By following the VWAP , you can see accurately whether the asset is going high or low. I'm using these customized bands to look for long entries (in the green or below) and short entries (in the red or above) to make short term profits to be accumulated in my spot balances. Ultimately, by building your position you can ensure a long-term profit but it doesn't mean too much if one simply never takes profit.\n\nLongs can be slept on. Shorts must be monitored. Set a budget, craft a plan, and stick to it. Remember to remove your principal investment at some point to reduce your risk.\n\nIn a bull market, buy at the monthly VWAP (Purple Line) and in a bear market, sell there.\n\nHappy Hunting!- Patch Hemlock\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GME/ApPTU3cw-Keep-Your-Eyes-on-the-Volume-Behind-the-Movement/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GME/ApPTU3cw-Keep-Your-Eyes-on-the-Volume-Behind-the-Movement/)\n\nProof of Institutional Use of VWAP: WATCH LIVE: GameStop hearing: Robinhood, Citadel and Reddit CEOs testify \u2014 2/18/21 by CNBC Television on YouTube (Timestamp 4:55:34)\n\nEDIT: For any would-be quants out there, I've developed an open-source pine script to act as a springboard for you\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/script/kJqBZ6s8-Realtime-All-Time-High-and-All-Time-Low-Tracker-WIP/](https://www.tradingview.com/script/kJqBZ6s8-Realtime-All-Time-High-and-All-Time-Low-Tracker-WIP/)\n\nDECLARATION OF BIAS:\n\npurchased GME at $13 and AMC at $4\n\ndoubled down after the crash at $50 and $6 respectively\n\nnever sold",

This is a place for more than one stock, and the rules explicitly go against any coordinated p/mp and dump.

I was here for the first GME round, and from what I saw of the past before this all started, it was so much better than this bullshit right here and I wish the mods would do more to redirect the dumb mob mentality. It was all gung-ho after GME dropped and the bagholders suddenly saw the light and started acting normal, but some random sustained spike in price with a slight potential of an actual squeeze really whipped y'all back into the Qstonk type shit and now y'all don't know how to act right again.\n\nAnyways, for those of you wondering I have 44.6@$37 $RKT (bought in at 29 then averaged up) but am planning on selling tomorrow at the post-open high before things tank and potentially buy back into GME or buy into UWMC. Regardless of this post, I do still like GME.

That\u2019s going to be our rocket, that\u2019s going to be this forum and it\u2019s going to be pandemonium.**\n\nI do believe and admire the collective wisdom (this is the reason why all the DDs we have read are amazing and all of them has been improved or refuted by their peers or a bunch of apes, for what it matters is the same).\n\nHowever, I do also believe in mass panic, and panic and fear are really strong emotions.\n\nEvery single person who has been playing in this casino known as stock market is aware that most of time **logic, intelligence and incredible well done DDs are thrown out the window the moment emotions like fear and greed take control**. (Just remember that people started to stockpiling toilet paper a year ago...)\n\nGreed is what put the HF in this situation. Fear is what we lost when the stock went from almost $500 all the way down to $40\u2019s range.\n\nIn this game, when people lose fear all that is left is greed, and it can be really powerful if we use it correctly (we can EASILY surpass the 100K) but it can be our demise as well. \n\nDon\u2019t forget **it\u2019s not the same a HF having a \u201ccivilized\u201d fight trying to get out of this mess or passing the hot potato to someone else when the stock is worth only $120+ and they are losing billions than when they are cornered and the stock is passing the 1,000\u20265,000\u2026.10,000.**\n\n**In that moment is when they are going to take the gloves off and the real fight is going to start.**\n\nSo, be prepared that everything and anything can happen; and when hell broke loose all camaderry might stop and it might be every man for himself. \n\nAnd I'm not telling you to let's stay together until the end, fuck no, we are here to become rich and if we make some friends along the way, great, but if not I'll cry alone on top of my pile of money.\n\nHowever, what I'm really trying to tell you is to keep emotions in check, don't be a fool thinking it's going to be a smooth ride, be as greedy as fuck (translation: hold like your life depends on it, cause it does) and please.... \n\n **tl;dr:** **DON\u2019T PANIC AND CARRY A TOWEL.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo we recently got NIO's 2020 Q4 and full year financial results. Some highlights include:\n\n1) $2.5 billion reached for annual revenue \n\n2) Gross margins grew to 17.2%\n\n3) Positive full year operating cash flow \n\n4) $6.5 billion in the war chest as of 31st of December 2020\n\n5) Q1 deliveries expected to be above 20,000 EVs \n\nOverall, NIO has shown amazing improvements; they've definitely come a long way, and to anyone who can look at the results honestly, it's evident that NIO will be much higher in the future. One of the reasons I say this is because of what we're seeing from the media trying to spin this situation negatively; and while it is true that anxiety regarding semiconductors and batteries can limit NIO's production, from the information we have, it doesn't appear it will have much of an effect.\n\nIn the earnings call, NIO's CEO Willie Li Bin (NIOgang's homeboy) said that NIO will be producing 7,500 EVs in the second quarter 2021 until July wherein the production capacity will increase to 12,500--meaning an annual 150,000 EV production; it's also knows that this will potentially double again to 300,000 in 2022--meaning 25,000 NIO EVs produced a month.\n\nIt should also be knows that yes NIO's deliveries were down in February, but this is due to the Lunar new year holiday; literally people were not at work. But interestingly, NIO delivered 5,578 in February, beatings Xpeng's 2,223. \n\nIf you go to some of the forums like Stocktwits or Twitter, there's bears/shorts deliberately trying to scare people to sell--as if what's written above is bad news. Here's the [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/chinese-tesla-rival-nio-chip-shortage-will-hit-electric-car-production.html) for the 'bad news' these fearmongers are dragging out. \n\nTake the supposed EPS miss by NIO: as the analyst Edison Yu points out, the EPS miss is misleading because it was actually due to the FX loss (the weak USD hurting NIO's cash balance). Basically not NIO's fault. Here's the [link](https://twitter.com/edison__yu/status/1366538414271660032) to his statement. \n\nThe fact that NIO is ramping up production (remember that even at 7,500 this is more than their monthly deliveries in 2020); the fact that NIO has openly said they're entering Europe in H2 ([link](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/03/19912404/nio-to-begin-exporting-evs-to-europe-in-second-half-of-2021-report)); the fact they have $6.5 billion now; the fact that production will be 12,500 from July, and 25,000 in 2022--all of these show how much of a winner NIO is, and why NIOgang will stay strong. \n\nBut watching all the negativity, it definitely reminds me of last year around this time, before NIO went up over 1,000%. I think it could happen again. I think about it while I'm at work; and I remember that it was Reddit where I first found NIO, and NIOgang\n\nWe've gotten fantastic news recently; don't let the haters drag us down. \n\nI like the stock.",

        "selftext": "Alright so let me start off by mentioning that i'm a long time lurker, first time poster in WSB, and thought it time to make my first contribution. I know, I know, I didn't think my first contribution would be about a Jim Cramer Boomer Stock... but yea, it really is. But just follow along with me here.\n\nI first began the day planning out my next moves for when I start jumping off the tech train (like right about now), and begin embracing the market for post pandemic retail/life (and once the CPI begins to bump, the moves for making money in the market during inflation). This led me to look at commodities and companies which deals with commodities.\n\n**ENTER COSTCO**\n\nI then pull up COST and wonder what the heck am I looking at. Why is there such a dip!?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fs582ukeerk61.png?width=501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd299c206740f45dbfec2923e2483ee9e4fd46cd\n\nThere must have been some terrible news right? Being an avid costco shopper to feed my family of 5, I begin researching what terrible thing happened to Costco to cause such a rapid selloff. But the more I looked the more I realized that this selloff is really just weird...and it could be an opportunity to get some tendies...(or rotisserie chickens...see what I did there?)\n\n**Researching Possible Causes**\n\nCould it be massive shorting like we all see with other stocks? No, its only running 0.98% of shares shorted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b6jtyoyferk61.png?width=505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52d06efbe13966d7ee2d559e5a7c4fd0d7f6a106\n\nWas there any news of accidents or management issues? None that I could find on google.\n\nThen I come across an article about warren buffet which may explain some things\n\n**Warren Buffet Sells his shares of Costco**\n\nhttps://www dot yahoo dot com/lifestyle/warren-buffett-dumps-all-his-costco-stock-3-reasons-why-that-is-a-big-surprise-235600486.html\n\nWell, considering that he sold it off prior to November 16th 2020 (could it have been him doing that huge red candle on nov 9-10th?) shouldn't the stock have begun to drop from there? It should have, but it didn't. So I looked some more and found that Costco announced a special $10 dividend (which is pretty high...I mean RKT announced a $1.11 div and thought that was amazing). My first thought was that damn, Costco made a lot of money to do a $10 dividend, and second, that this drop isn't justified if Costco is making a ton of money.\n\nhttps://finance dot yahoo dot com/news/supermarket-chain-costco-declares-special-222312149.html\n\nHere's a chart with the dividend marked (you can also see that big red candle right before it which could have been buffet?).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7nnd0trherk61.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=063271b9d3c38f3b13c8d7296a83c7e1171f5f18\n\nAs you can see, right after the dividend has passed, the stock begins a slow bleed until you see the final crazy selloff at the end, and with that $10 dividend in the back of my head, im already thinking that this sell off is all sentiment without any real reason.\n\nSo I do some due diligence and look at the financials, earning calls, etc. I then mark them on the chart to see what kind of effect those things had on the price. They seemed to help or negate the stock even during this time of speculative hype.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9hpvqcjerk61.png?width=998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=830afac11cd00a1ba28c1822105e29a3b5ae78c3\n\nEach blue vertical line marks an earnings call, where if you zoom in close enough you can easily see the market respond negatively or positively to the results in a pretty normal fashion within a week or so afterwards. Each call is followed by a swing of about 10 points up or 10 points down. Typical moves for a stock trading in the hundreds. This confirms to me that without a trigger to drop the price of Costco, there really isn't any reason why the stock is dropping and that any positive earnings should push it back up and any negative earnings should drop it further (or remain the same).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztl2qhukerk61.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5c4a01bd3fa1ea890684719df463cccf602b57a\n\nAs you can see, the stock is just completely oversold, trading outside the bollinger bands which tells me that it might be a good time to catch a falling knife (you know, buy the dip)...but what could slow the downfall and even reverse it?\n\n**Enter the earnings call March 4th and why I am Bullish**\n\nLooking through the financials, Costco has continuously beat its earnings.\n\n&gt;This warehouse club operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.04%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For the most recent quarter, Costco was expected to post earnings of $2.04 per share, but it reported $2.29 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.25%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.85 per share, while it actually produced $3.13 per share, a surprise of 9.82%.\n\nhttps://news dot yahoo dot com/costco-cost-beat-estimates-again-171005710.html\n\nAnd looking at its previous 2 years of March earnings, it has always beat its December earnings (for all you call options people). I didn't do a screen capture as its a long scroll. But the data is on the link below. Just look at all the March earnings vs the one reported before it.\n\nhttps://www dot marketbeat dot com/stocks/NASDAQ/COST/earnings/\n\nThe most recent price target estimate I could easily google (ALL above where its trading now)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4obvitmerk61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5196871a95da03e36cea4ad3f807545f3397fb50\n\n**Fundamentals (if they matter anymore) have not changed, AND WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.**\n\n**They make a ton of money (selling tendies):**\n\n&gt;In FY 2020, ended August 30, 2020, Costco posted year-over-year (YOY) gains in revenue, net income, and other metrics. Total revenue increased by 9.2% YOY while net income attributable to Costco climbed by 9.4% YOY.3\ufeff The company said that its e-commerce business saw a 50% YOY increase in sales for FY 2020 as a result of gains in grocery deliveries, prescription medications, electronics, and office supplies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.4\ufeff  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Costco posted revenue of $43.2 billion and net income attributable to Costco of $1.2 billion in its Q1 FY 2021, ended November 22, 2020. Revenue rose 16.7% while net income attributable to Costco grew 38.2% compared to Q1 FY 2020.\n\n**They are growing their online business (growing and selling rotisserie chickens):**\n\nContinuing its sales strength during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company reported net sales across all segments of $19.1 billion for the five-week period ending January 3, 2021, a 12.3% YOY improvement overall as e-commerce sales jumped 62.5%.\n\n**They are international (also making tendies):**\n\n&gt;Besides the U.S. and Canada, Costco operates membership warehouses in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Spain, Australia, France, China, and Iceland, and these latter countries are represented in the Other International Operations segment. Together, the non-U.S. and non-Canadian countries represent roughly the same amount of revenue and operating income as the company's Canadian business. For Q1 FY 2021, Other International Operations generated total revenue of about $5.9 billion, a 21.8% YOY increase. Other International Operations also posted Q1 FY 2021 operating income of $289 million, a 46.0% YOY increase. This makes this segment the fastest-growing in terms of both total revenue and operating income. It comprises 13.7% of revenue and 20.2% of operating income.\n\nhttps://www dot investopedia dot com/how-costco-makes-money-5094774\n\n**Why Costco post pandemic will still retain its customers (Article from 2020):**\n\n&gt;Nearly all the members who had the opportunity to cancel their subscriptions last quarter declined to do so. A full 91% of its U.S. shopper base chose to renew, in fact, which marks a slight increase from the 90.9% that Costco reported in each of the last three quarters. Costco counted 55.8 million member households at the end of Q3, up 500,000 compared to the prior quarter. Its global renewal rate was unchanged at 88.4%.\n\nhttps://www dot fool dot com/investing/2020/06/01/why-almost-no-one-canceling-costco-membership.aspx\n\nCostco is a solid business with much upside. Despite buffet selling (he also dumped AAPL), the fundamentals of the business have not changed. Seeing as that the majority of its profits come from the membership itself, and that most people do not cancel their memberships, I dont see why Costco would suffer post covid. At the recent price its currently at, it signals an overly sold stock which will very likely bump up in the next earnings call to stabilize the price and bring it back into traction.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\nI like this stock for both a long hold, and will supplement with $340 March 19th (sound familiar?) Calls. Ill have 60 shares come market open tomorrow.\n\nedit: fat fingered march 5th instead of march 4th earnings call.\n\nedit 2: i wrote horizontal line instead of vertical line when referencing the plotted earnings calls (too much writing!).",

        "selftext": "Hi fellow WSB,\n\n$GM has some real potential to bring me some generational wealth. $500 PT. Yes, you heard that right. \n\n1.\tGM is insanely undervalued, trading at only 12.5 P/E currently and $75bn market cap. GM is the largest automaker in the USA selling over 8,000,000 cars per year. In comparison, Tesla is trading at over 1,500 P/E and $750bn+ MC. Tesla only sells 500,000 cars a year. They make tons of money on their existing ICE lineup through popular brands like Chevy, GMC, Cadillac, Corvette and reinvesting it into Autonomous Vehicles, Electric Vehicles and Flying Vehicles. \n\n2.\tGM currently has many government contracts and will continue to win more contracts. Government agencies use Chevy's SUVs and President Biden's limo is a modified Cadillac Limo. Biden has committed to turning the entire government fleet of 650,000+ vehicles (light trucks, SUVs, semi-trucks, etc...) into fully electric. and built in America, I expect an announcement soon and GM to be awarded some, if not a majority of the contract. Other startup EV companies simply do not have the scale to produce the government contract. Ford has EV production in Germany which is not made in America. Tesla recently purchased $1.5bn in cryptocurrency which the Treasury Secretary Yellen is against. I think $GM is the best bet to win a majority of the government's work.\n\n3.\tGM has committed to selling 30 new EV by 2025, selling ONLY EV by 2035, and being fully carbon neutral by 2040.\n\n4.\tGM owns Cruise Automation. Initially, bought the startup for only $1bn and most recent funding round of $2bn by Microsoft/ Honda has valued the startup at $30bn. Currently in the lead of Autonomous vehicle technology and continuing to grow massively in the technology hub of the world, SF Bay Area. This technology is being massively discounted.\n\n5.\tGM has Utium Battery technology and a $2.3bn factory in Lordstown, Ohio churning out their proprietary battery technology. 50-200kWh battery packs that will push the cost per Kwh under $100 (current cost for Tesla is over $230) in the next few years. These batteries will power the new Cadillac Lyriq and Hummer EV coming out later this year. The  cars are not weak, truly cutting edge! \n\n6.\tApple has rejected Hyundai, Kia, Tesla, Nissan in their bid to find a manufacturer for building an EV. $GM is still in the running and could be a nice surprise. They are cutting edge, mature with manufacturing capability, and made in America.\n\n7.\tFamous investors like Warren Buffett, Leon Cooperman, Joel Greenblatt all piling into $GM in the billions.\n\n8.\tPresident Joe Biden will likely renew the EV tax credit in his upcoming stimulus bills which will cut the price of $GMs EVs by $7,500 and spur sales significantly.\n\n9.\tChip Shortage Fear will be over soon and is only temporary. $TSMC has is in the process of building a huge factory in Arizona which will keep chip manufacturing in the US. Biden will sign executive orders to ease this issue through defense production act.\n\n10.\tNewly released Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV is the hands down most affordable and best value EV on the market today. Bolt starts at $31,995 - Bolt EUV starts at $33,995. Both more range than Tesla Model Y and EUV has $GM's version of Tesla Autopilot, SuperCruise already installed (versus Musk's $10,000 for this upgrade).\n\nMegabullish on this to double or triple once the media/ mainstream investors discover what $GM can really do! Position below. Cheers guys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kw0hi639kqk61.png?width=595&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=220549adeb676f1397f61406fd6566b7720cffcd",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo we recently got NIO's 2020 Q4 and full year financial results. Some highlights include:\n\n1. $2.5 billion reached for annual revenue\n2. Gross margins grew to 17.2%\n3. Positive full year operating cash flow\n4. $6.5 billion in the war chest as of 31st of December 2020\n5. Q1 deliveries expected to be above 20,000 EVs\n\nOverall, NIO has shown amazing improvements; they've definitely come a long way, and to anyone who can look at the results honestly, it's evident that NIO will be much higher in the future. One of the reasons I say this is because of what we're seeing from the media trying to spin this situation negatively; and while it is true that anxiety regarding semiconductors and batteries can limit NIO's production, from the information we have, it doesn't appear it will have much of an effect.\n\nIn the earnings call, NIO's CEO Willie Li Bin (NIOgang's homeboy) said that NIO will be producing 7,500 EVs in the second quarter 2021 until July wherein the production capacity will increase to 12,500--meaning an annual 150,000 EV production; it's also knows that this will potentially double again to 300,000 in 2022--meaning 25,000 NIO EVs produced a month.\n\nIt should also be knows that yes NIO's deliveries were down in February, but this is due to the Lunar new year holiday; literally people were not at work. But interestingly, NIO delivered 5,578 in February, beatings Xpeng's 2,223.\n\nIf you go to some of the forums like Stocktwits or Twitter, there's bears/shorts deliberately trying to scare people to sell--as if what's written above is bad news. Here's the [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/chinese-tesla-rival-nio-chip-shortage-will-hit-electric-car-production.html) for the 'bad news' these fearmongers are dragging out.\n\nTake the supposed EPS miss by NIO: as the analyst Edison Yu points out, the EPS miss is misleading because it was actually due to the FX loss (the weak USD hurting NIO's cash balance). Basically not NIO's fault. Here's the [link](https://twitter.com/edison__yu/status/1366538414271660032) to his statement.\n\nThe fact that NIO is ramping up production (remember that even at 7,500 this is more than their monthly deliveries in 2020); the fact that NIO has openly said they're entering Europe in H2 ([link](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/03/19912404/nio-to-begin-exporting-evs-to-europe-in-second-half-of-2021-report)); the fact they have $6.5 billion now; the fact that production will be 12,500 from July, and 25,000 in 2022--all of these show how much of a winner NIO is, and why NIOgang will stay strong.\n\nBut watching all the negativity, it definitely reminds me of last year around this time, before NIO went up over 1,000%. I think it could happen again. I think about it while I'm at work; and I remember that it was Reddit where I first found NIO, and NIOgang\n\nWe've gotten fantastic news recently; don't let the haters drag us down.\n\nI like the stock.",

May get a lil cheaper first , so watch it a little b4 you buy. Ceo projected 20 billion dollars revenue 2022. Market cap is under 15. You do the math\n\n\nIm here to tell you all what play im currently holding 30 shares in and plan to double down on in the morming because the price is insanely good, and tbh may even get better in coming days from a buyers perspective. It is currently down 43% from its ath, only reached due tl INTERIM p3 results. \nLets start with the bad. \n\nIn 33 years theyve never reached full fda approval for anything. Close but no cigar every time. \n\nIt has held a steady slightly pessimist short interest of 10% for the entire time ive been invested, but in that time institutional ownership has climbed from 49% to about 88% now. I have strong reason to believe this short interest is now much larger. Please read on. \nWhen the nasdaq is down and theres no good news for the stock, it sinks. When theres mildly good news, the stock sinks. Shorts? Maybe.\n\nMany big money vaccines already approved. US market share likely holding mass inventory of big pharma and baby oil vaccines by the time FDA approves. This doesnt matter too much, the united states has a contract with nvax for 100 million doses at 16 a pop that they buy on fda approval, period.  The big pharma vaccines efficacys vs variants and transmission are laughable. The world is a  breeding ground for variants right now. A problem novavaxs platform will easily develop quadralent boosters for. \n\nHonestly, theres not a whole lot of bad imo. These bad things seems good to me. \nThe good.\nIts absurdly cheap right now, almost as cheap as before p3 interim data. This is because the ceo sucks at talking and people dont like the 1 to 2 month timeline he mentiomed on nbc yesterday for approvals. That same morning he told new york times \"he loves burning shorts\".\nLast week, boris johnson said novavax approval was coming soon. \nThe market price never reacted to the covax deal of 1.1 billion doses because we dont know the price yet, and shorts are trying to say the 3 dollars poor countries will pay is what nvax will get per dose. Thats not how donation and subsidization works. Nvax is getting way more than 3. At least 10. \nIts efficacy is first class, please look it up, the scientists online have already explained it better than i can. \nToday the price tanked , due to his interview yesterday RIGHT AFTER SAYING HE LOVES BURNING SHORTS. Yes he said fda is 2-3 months out.\nThey have rolling approvals in dozens of places happening! And their final phase 3 data can drop anytime!. The short interest has been 10% for a while and i just KNOW its higher now.\nInstitutional holdings hasnt dropped. The name novavax is appearing in the news more and more. Its happening this month. Idk how long shares will be near 200, i wouldnt be surprised if you can pick some up for 180 tomorrow. But theres a squeeze coming. Not like gme was, this isnt hundreds of percent short. Its in the teens. That will still be a nice spike to an already large biotech spike.\n\nB.riley eoy price target : 398. \nI think we see more than that. Weve already seen 330.\nThe news that propels us could happen any day. But dont leave gme. Im in there too. But if any of the squeezes your in do their thang, and nvax is still down, double check to make sure nothing bad happened with the stock and then bring those tendies over for more tendies!!!",

        "selftext": "Hi all\n\nA bit of a background about myself. I started buying up SPAC commons/units around June/July 2020, back when Id guess most of the folks here had yet to know what a SPAC was. \n\nPractically everything could be bought for around $10. Many SPAC commons/units could be bought for less than $10. In fact, I still remember buying the following units on IPO day for these prices (yes Im a weirdo who remembers what he pays for everything, be it stocks or groceries):\n\nQell units: $10.1\nBtwn units: $10.1\nIPOB (now OPEN for the newcomers here): $10.8\nIPOE units: $10.5\nIPOF units: $10.3\n\nThese are examples of the most popular and priciest SPACs.\n\nI bought into SPACs before they went mainstream based on a Seeking Alpha author\u2019s simple thesis: When bought at/around $10 (NAV), SPACs offer an asymmetric risk/reward: Heads you win, tails you tie. \n\nI loaded up on SPACs based on this simple premise. I had my doubts at first as this was a completely different world vs the stocks I normally buy (growth/value etc), and I was concerned I may be underestimating the risks of these then obscure and possibly shady instruments. This was especially because the structure and risk-reward seemed too good to be true, which for any investor should always raise the question: Perhaps I am missing something which the Market is aware of. \n\nFast forward to Feb 2021, and the above led me to more than double my portfolio with nothing but spac commons/units. I realize alot of people here did way better than that. Kudos to you. \n\nWhy the long rant about the story of my life with SPACs? Especially during weeks like this one, you must always remember why you got into this in the first place. You did so in pursuit of the asymmetric risk-reward (which undoubtedly became less asymmetric and more risky as more money flowed into SPACs). However, the very correction we are having right now is serving to eliminate this problem. Dont get me wrong, I hate to see my portfolio decline in value day after day like everyone else, but by far one of the most common mistakes traders commit in stocks more generally (not just SPACs) is to feel maximum greed and bullishness near tops and conversely to be most fearful/bearish at the bottom, both at the worst possible times. Why/what causes us to get these misleading feelings? The answer is extremely simple: prices. We see a trend (whether up or down) and expect it to continue. Sounds too stupid to be true? Yes, but it is true. \n\nLong story short: I\u2019m personally keeping things in perspective and giving SPACs the benefit of the doubt for all the gains they\u2019ve given me and so as not to fall prey to my own misleading emotions. Started buying warrants for the first time ever, all around $1.3.\n\nYou can\u2019t make money without risking it, but SPACs offer much better risk-reward vs normal stocks, especially thanks to the recent correction (and not despite the recent correction).\n\nI realized some people have started losing faith in SPACs and perhaps quitting altogether, including a close friend of mine who I was able to convince to buy into SPACs with great difficulty at the end of December, so I thought of writing this. \n\nHappy to hear others\u2019 thoughts. \n\nTLDR: SPACs have become more attractive as the recent correction brought average prices down to very reasonable levels. Buy the dip (and buy cheap warrants).",

It was my first career, and then I moved on to own several small businesses simultaneously. \n\nWhen I saw the GME trade last month, I believe I saw it the same way that many WSB outsiders saw it: a new era in trading. \n\nI instantly joined your forum and was pleasantly surprised at the intelligence carefully concealed under the constant barrage of circle jerking, banana eating, tendie getting, cursing, and obscure references.... But I could read in between the lines, started paying attention, and thanks to some excellent DD by a few of you, I executed the best trade of my life on RKT today. That said.... There's still space. Here's why:\n\nThe dividend announcement should get everyone's attention. At $23-24, it was basically giving away 5% to shareholders. Big institutions will pile in for the free money. That run will probably continue through Friday.  This is the first dividend the company has announced.\n\nRKT financials are actually BLOWING AWAY the industry. Check them out. This is not a company that MIGHT become profitable someday. This is the real deal on earnings. \n\nShare price has been historically suppressed since inception of the ticker. Check out the trading range for yourself. \n\nIn comparison to trading multiples of competitors, they are trading at prices that are lower than normal. \n\nFinally, I believe we have huge momentum and attention from today's trading. Take a good look and do what you feel. \n\nThanks guys for letting me play along. I wish my great grandfather, an old school New York banker, who grew up a poor black child in Bulgaria, could see this...\n\nOnward apes.",

        "selftext": "My first DD. There are a number of upcoming catalysts for UWMC, as well as positive sentiment about long term prospects. Figured I would help provide snippets of info for people just now hearing about the company. \n\n- March 22, UWMC will be included in the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 indices. This was announced this morning. These inclusions always mark a price increase. Furthermore, there is potential for this to be added to the S&amp;P 500. \n\nMore info on a possible index squeeze here: https://yetanothervalueblog.com/2021/01/quickie-idea-uwmc-squeezing-higher-post-despacing.html\n\n- March 9 is the Ex-div date. May see a small run up. The company also stated that it may provide a special dividend in the future, like RKT is doing. Even more potential profits/price increase if that happens. \n\n- Pretty good 0.4 dividend over the course of the year. \n\n- Analyst EOY ratings range from $10.50 to $14. Average is $12.33. All are bullish. \n\nhttps://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/do-analysts-agree-tuesday-on-uwm-holdings-corp-uwmc-stocks-target-price\n\n- 13% of float is shorted. This is high. There has been much less squeezing here then in RKT. More room to run.\n\n- UWMC is projected to have a better 2021 than 2020, and see an increase in EPS. This is opposed to RKT, which is expected to see a large drop. \n\n- Interest rate fears are overblown, and the fed continues to reiterate this fact. However, if rates do go up, UWMC is projected to hold up much better than RKT. Their business model does not rely on refinancing to the extent that RKT does.\n\n- Trades at a much lower P/E than RKT, and has done so for months. \n\n- Is still trading far below previous valuations, without any real reason for dropping down so low. This drop happened after blowout earnings, on interest/housing market fears. I believe the stock was also pushed down intentionally to allow for accumulation before index additions that wouldn\u2019t allow the stock to drop so low again. \n\nThis is a good company that should see growth beyond current valuation. I don\u2019t think RKT presents the same opportunity after today. There are some bear cases to be made, especially regarding the large float and possible interest rises, but I don\u2019t see these concerns as significant right now. And I want to keep this DD short. \n\nMy position: 1402 shares at $7.79 average. Screenshot can be found in my last YOLO post.",

I thought it would trade sideways and then a crazy afterhours.  Seems the covering occurred early for an explosive afternoon.  I believe the stock will still squeeze more, even to triple digits, as all the ITM call options get exercised this Friday.  **Additionally, there are 03/19 call options up to $50, which mean additional gamma squeeze from options still exists**.  \n\nInterestingly, the despite the short covering, **shorts have increased bringing the total up to 46% or 46% float (data from S3:** [**https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1366857867416993801**](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1366857867416993801)**).**  \n\n**All Catalyst events:**\n\n1) Blowout earnings, and excellent forecast to be successful even when, eventually the interest rates go up.  Remember at the end of the day this is a **profitable** company.\n\n2) Special dividend of 1.11 on 03/08/20.  Other than bleeding the shorts for this dividend, people may recall their shares back to get this true dividend.\n\n3) Increased publicity tomorrow  [https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx) \n\n4) Large institutional ownership and unlikely that the majority shareholders will sell at this point.  They want to trigger a squeeze\n\n5) Rising short interest with a 50% borrowing fee.  There were no shares left to borrow by 11 am and that's why the stock quickly 'rocketed up'.  Currently there are only 15000 shares left to borrow at this time (and none for the few hours after market close) and they will probably be borrowed first thing AM.\n\n6) I have heard more OTM options may be written by the end of this week.\n\nGiven the huge runup this week, I'm much more conservative and suggest buying shares or ITM debit spreads, but for the more cavalier of you can buy some OTM 03/19 or, if they make new options this week, some OTM 03/05 options.\n\n**Addendum:** I am not a bot, HF, shill, or a professional investor.  I am not anti-GME and do not think we should all jump ship to RKT.  However, this play, in the short term, appears the most promising.",

        "selftext": "Alright, learn to read fuckers because this is gonna be a long one.\n\nBefore I get started, can you morons who are shitting all over $RKT buyers shut up? WallStreetBets is about making money, doesn't matter what play. And yes, there will be some bagholders on that one. But everyone playing it knows the risk. There's only two appropriate responses if someone tells you the bought into $RKT. 1)If they lose money, you troll them and call them a retard. 2)They make money, and you congratulate them and tell them to fuck themselves.\n\nNow, none of you are wrong to be skeptical about the play. It does in fact seem too easy, doesn't it? Well, as noted in the below post, at LEAST two of the hedge funds we're fighting on the GME front are in on the $RKT play:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw0g1g/the\\_industry\\_players\\_again\\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw0g1g/the_industry_players_again_gme/)\n\n(Credit to u/Dadri88 and u/skifunkster)\n\nBut what if I told you it didn't matter that they were profiting off that play? I'm serious, it doesn't matter. Even if they personally asked the Board of Rocket to declare the special dividend, and planned to mobilize WSB in pursuit of profit (They didn't do this), we should still be lining up to kiss them. They're hanging themselves in front of our eyes? Here's why:\n\n$GME needs a catalyst. We've known this is still a legitimate play, but most posts are in agreement. We needs whales, we need hedge funds on our side, and we need catalysts. We now have SEVERAL catalysts. In case you've forgotten, the catalysts for GME occuring this month are: Earnings, The Quadruple Witching Day, and now $RKT.\n\nWhy is $RKT a catalyst for GME? We're not quite at the finish line yet. How will we know when we're close? They'll pull out our controllers again (Limiting Buying). How do they wind up defeated if they do this? Big money on our side. $RKT will get us that money. If you're still too retarded to picture it, let me provide an example.\n\nImagine you're Papa Elon. You want to shoot your SpaceX Rockets to the Moon and beyond. So far, you've loaded the ships with apes and bananas, but you need some ACTUAL astronauts on board. How do you earn the trust of the real astronauts (AKA BIG MONEY)? You launch a test flight. $RKT is the SpaceX test flight, retards. It doesn't matter if you like the play, if you're in on the action, or not. You SHOULD be cheering it on.\n\nIf it works, we have proof of concept. Imagine it: A Massive short squeeze on a company where the short interest is only 30-40%. What do you think will prove our point that squeezes can be squoze, better than seeing a real live squeeze in public view? It's literally the best thing that could happen.\n\nSo, moral of the story: Sit back, shut the fuck up, and cheer those other retards on! If that play works, it will help send our own to the goddamn moon! Smile apes, and I'll see you on the Moon!",

        "selftext": "# Let's start a little about AMC [Last Year Especially]\n\nAMC is an old American company made in 1920 and it has been around for over 100 years. This is not a company that only the older generation/younger generation can connect with. We all have had some kind of experience in movie theaters and most likely have run into an AMC at some point in our lives. \n\nNow over the past few years AMC has begun to drop in stock value \\[steadily\\]. Most of the drops is due to poor money management and over expansion, recently however it was due to Covid-19's forced closures and streaming services taking over.\n\nEarly last year, AMC bought more cinemas in Europe \\[now AMC has the **most theaters** of all companies\\] but instead of bringing it more revenue it gave AMC a blow due to the costs of property purchase and closures due to Covid and cutting of revenue. This has caused AMC to be a prime target for short sale attacks last year dropping the price significantly and at one point hitting **1.91$** which is an all time low. \n\nSo to sum up why it was low last year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Streaming services being used more\n* Cinemas closed due to Covid.\n* No vaccine in sight \\[uncertainty for its future\\]\n* Bankruptcy possibility\n* Free reign hedge fund short selling \n* No one buying the stock\n\n# Now this year is different\n\nWe all know what happens here. I wont go in and explain this to heavily, GME hype led to retail investors investing in other heavily shorted companies and AMC being one of them. AMC sold off shares to retain funds and rule out bankruptcy for the next 4 years.\n\n# Overvalued or Undervalued?\n\nFor the most part, the media has been completely bearish on AMC. The price many media outlets tossed out for AMC has been 1-3$. Now let me explain why I believe that number is completely idiotic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* ~~Streaming services being used more~~ This may be true for the most part, at the minimum pent up demand will have people skipping Netflix night and going out with friends to the cinema. It has already began with people renting out cinemas for person use. If people are willing to pay 100$+ to rent out a cinema for their family, I doubt they wouldn't be willing to go and watch the next blockbuster hit with a crowded reactionary theater.\n* ~~Cinemas closed due to Covid.~~ New York announced 25% capacity theaters come early March. This alone made the stock shoot up. Imagine a 50%-75% or complete re-opening of AMC theaters? Cinemas are being open soon so this should be another reason to drive up bullishness.\n* ~~No vaccine in sight \\[uncertainty for its future\\]~~ Multiple vaccines have been approved by FDA. Recently Johnson &amp; Johnsons single dose vaccine. Dr Fauci has told reporters recently that vaccines will be made available to **all Americans** by April of this year.\n* ~~Bankruptcy possibility~~ Completely ruled out for the next 4 years due to funds acquired during January rise in prices and stocks being sold off.\n* ~~Free reign hedge fund short selling~~  Unlike last year, this year AMC is the most held stock on Robinhood and Webull. For a hedge fund to bet against AMC when it is the most held stock imo is just moronic. Hedge funds had free reign last year with no one holding it and could barely get AMC to drop to 1.91$ before it began to rise past 2$ again. Now that it is one of the most \\[if not most\\] held stock in existence right now, I could not see a legitimate reason to short the stock or at minimum expect it to be valued at below 5$ which many media outlets have been doing.\n* ~~No one buying the stock~~  Not only are people buying it, they are also holding it. All of AMCs rivals are smaller companies with little to no retail investor interest compared to AMC. They are all above 20$, how AMC is not valued at 10$ minimum by analysis completely proves my point that this stock is just being forced low and is only being held back no by hedge funds.\n\nNow I understand hedge funds who shorted AMC last year had valid reasons. I am not disagreeing here but what they failed to do is adapt to a change in stock market culture. A 2$ stock could be worth 1,000s of dollars if enough people believe it to be that much. Tesla stock right now has higher value  then every single auto-maker stock in existence combined. If enough people hold a stock, the stock wont fail and hedge funds should have closed their positions on AMC a long time ago.\n\n# Now Lets Talk About March\n\n[\\[ironically except last year due to Covid closures lol\\]](https://preview.redd.it/na1tpsauepk61.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fe18aa7de5242b29f9393bc332d6c58b8d24f56)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* March in general has always been a good month for AMC. If you noticed that many of the peaks began in mid March, in some instances a continued rise with new blockbusters being released in the summer time. The best thing you can get from this chart is understanding that winter is bad but March and beyond is good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Another reason pointing to a possible spike in price is Vanguard purchasing more shares, Wanda Group still 50% ownership of shares\n\n[Wanda Group converts stock in order to sell, preparing for a rise in price to sell off?](https://preview.redd.it/0fuvle80gpk61.png?width=1048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d1e6f32c67b9ef97febcb47764085f8744c6d33)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/chinas-wanda-group-converts-amc-stock-to-permit-sales-of-its-shares.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/chinas-wanda-group-converts-amc-stock-to-permit-sales-of-its-shares.html) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# March 5th-11th? Yeah. I believe so.\n\nA lot of people come up with dates and when the date fails expectations drop and people get annoyed when nothing happens. This one is different. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* March 5th \\[this Friday\\] theaters will reopen in NY \\[ over 25% of AMC revenue comes from NY and California\\]. The volume of people entering AMC theaters Friday-Tuesday could drive prices up leading to Thursday, especially with posts on social media showing packed theaters.\n\n[https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* March 9th short interest report will be released. In my opinion the stock had been shorted all of February but that is just my opinion. We will see come next Tuesday but if AMC is heavily shorted \\[my belief it is\\] this will drive the price up farther.\n\n*Processing img ecj12fvpjpk61...*\n\n* AMC earning are confirmed to be released on **March 10th AFTER HOURS.**\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html)\n\nNot only are they confirmed to be March 10th but they are expected to **beat expectations**\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4)\n\n*Speculative but: Not only are they expected to beat expectations but earnings tend to be followed up with good news. I am speculating about the Amazon buy but it is entirely possible AMC would come up with some thing for its investors to bring its value up. They made a fortune in January and I see no reason for them not to try and drive the price up farther come March 10.*\n\n* So this leads to me believing from the re-opening this Friday \\[March 5th\\] to Short interest report \\[March 9th\\] and Earning report \\[March 10th after hours into 11th\\] we will see a large price spike in AMC. Can I be wrong? Yes. Will I be wrong? I don't know. What do I think? I like the stock and I will hold the stock. I am not telling any of you to do anything I am just sharing information and my thoughts.\n\n# My positions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img ei5kbec8lpk61...*\n\n*Processing img 8xn45ngbnpk61...*",

        "selftext": "I've bought the falling knife. I enjoy high risk. Let me run you down some fundamentals on why this is an advanced long. Pun intended. (My screen name.)\n\nLet's get to the meaty part first. \n\nLesson #1 Fraud is the most bullish word on Wall street, but even better is Monopoly, and Antitrust. Which is why retail weak fingers are getting walked down. (Regulation is the most feared btw.) If it wasnt for Clover health pulling some strings behind the scenes I dont think they would exist. Clov was caught running a red light, so take the fine, and get back in your Tesla. If not for fraud they wouldn't last a year. United health, and Blue cross would've destroyed them right outta the gate.  Look at the most fraudulent companies in the world. They're sporting the highest market caps. Ask Tesla bear scrubs Einhorn, and Gordon Johnson about how Tesla is a fraud. Apple, Msft, Amzn,  seen fraud litigations. Bring in Vivek, and Chamath. Accused of fraud. Get the point? Fraud is bank as long as your the fraud.\n\nWho cares about Last year? You've heard this right?\n\n\"**Past performance** is **no guarantee** of future **results**\"\n\nA. Grew membership by 36.3%\n\nB. Increased revenue by 45.6%\n\nC. Gross profit increased to 12.2% of revenue\n\nThis means absolutely nothing. Again. **\"Past performance is never an indicator of Future results.\"**\n\n**4 F's  - Future Fun Facts &amp; fundamentals. Speculative Statistics.**\n\nA.  The number of Americans ages 65 and older will more than double over the  next 40 years, reaching 80 million in 2040. The number of adults ages  85 and older, the group most often needing help with basic personal  care, will nearly quadruple between 2000 and 2040.  \ud83d\udc48  (Try search engine)\n\n***Those statistics come true. Minimum +200% customers***\n\nB. Government Medicare spending is set to increase from 15% to 19% \ud83d\udc48  (Try search engine)\n\n***More revenues from the budget.***\n\nC. Medicare for all. \ud83d\udc48  (Try search engine)\n\n***\"Medicare for all\" would push our potential customer base to the moon. (Full Population)***\n\nD.. Clover health's competitors have over a trillion dollars in market cap to swipe.\n\n***Always good to have healthy competition. UNH, ANTM, HUM, CI, plus private ones like Aetna***\n\nE,F,G Highly Speculative. It's a healthcare insurer that's only medicare, and not yet in the workplace.\n\n***If Clover health enters the entire health insurance market whole different valuation is coming.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; For those that are patient. This could be a really great long term growth investment. Clover health currently has less than 1% of available participants in healthcare marketplace.\n\nAside from the celebrity status of certain board members I'm going to tuck this one under the mattress, set a recurring investment, and probably have fun losing everything if tit's go up.",

Almost the market cap currently. The orders will keep coming and the technology will be proven. \n\n\nAnalyst are attacking this stock for reasons I havent figured out yet. Morgan Stanley downgraded there price target due to not believing in Hub motor technology. How often do you think a guy at morgan stanley works on cars!? One of his concerns was running coolant lines to the wheels.... You know like where your brake lines go, and your wheel speed sensor harness, and vacuum lines... this guy had never even changed a flat tire.\n\nThey are also now reprinting old articles of a very early \u201cskateboard\u201d(thats what lordestown calls the underlying design) on fire. Shit happens, the car was so early at that point it didnt even have the pickup body it comes with at that time. Also thats why they do these test. Go on there twitter and watch the test they put the hub motors through and the rest of the truck.\n\nAnother fear is ford, does anyone even know any other type of ford besides an F-150? So ford is gonna make and electric truck to compete against the only thing keeping them in business?! Im not saying ford wont have a nice electric truck but I do think they arent a good long play.\n\nSteve Burns the CEO has entered the Lordstown Endurance into a 290 mile Baja race in Mexico to prove the concept. \n\nThe race is in April, Earnings are next week, the moon this year. \n\nThis isnt investment advice, I am clearly retarded and I wrote this all while I was licking the windows on the short bus \n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80",

That's right if you need tendies, you    need to get semiconductors. Demand for semiconductors is high and  supply   is low, so what does that mean? Free trip to the moon with  tendies and  extra sauce.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Good Stuff\n\n$ON    Semiconductors, manufacture and sell semiconductor components for    various electronic devices worldwide. Their semiconductors are used in    automotive, industrial computers, robots, and appliances.\n\n\"Other    manufacturing companies are getting left behind in the semiconductor    shortage. We still need automotive robot arms to build new cars,  whether   they're green or gas. We still need logic and power solutions  for  every  manufacturing or appliance part that needs to move. That  means  assembly   line robots, it means motor controls for CNC machines  and  shop   equipment, it means the power solution for your oven and   microwave. It  even means the GFCI controller that stops you from ending   it all after  you lost it on GME when you tried to bathe with the   toaster, which uses a   power switch, which are made by $ON. \"\n\nThey create [new electronic parts](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210217005026/en/ON-Semiconductor-Announces-New-650V-Silicon-Carbide-MOSFETs) for the market as often as I dream of making tendies.\n\nEven innovating new technology.

Matter of  fact, their CEO recently came out and affirmed that  he     wants to  maintain a balance between outsourcing and in-house.

Here's the evidence:\n\n**Valuation:** The CAPE smoothed P/E multiple has [expanded](https://ycharts.com/indicators/cyclically_adjusted_pe_ratio) for six straight months. It bottomed at 24.8 in March at the price index trough, closed December at 33.7, then to 34.5 in January, and now to 34.8 in February. *By way of comparison, the multiple was 32.3 in March 2001, as the tech wreck bear market really got going; and 32.6 in September 1929*. Investors always think they can get out before the peak is in. History rhymes.\n\n**Leverage:** Margin debt has soared 42% from a year ago (+115% at an annual rate over the past three months alone). This is exactly what the trend was in August 2007 and September 2000. *Right near the market peaks.*\n\n**Positioning:** The put-call volume ratio has been below 0.60 with near consistency since the middle of November. It\u2019s a stretch we haven\u2019t seen in over eight years. The BofA survey shows that global portfolio managers are running with the lowest cash levels in eight years, and have the highest exposures to equities and commodities in a decade.\n\n**Technicals:** The fact that the S&amp;P 500 is now 13% above its 200-day moving average is an extreme gap worth noting and monitoring \u2014 it was 11% back in February 2000, just ahead of the tech mania bust and 7% in October 2018, ahead of the near-20% drawdown heading into the end of that year.",

(It's used to determine a stock's value based on trailing earnings while also taking the company's future earnings growth into account, and is considered to provide a more complete picture than the P/E ratio). The PEG ratio enhances the P/E ratio by adding in expected earnings growth into the calculation.\n\no\tA lower PEG may indicate that a stock is undervalued. According to well-known investor Peter Lynch, a company's P/E and expected growth should be equal, which denotes a fairly valued company and supports a PEG ratio of 1.0.

        "selftext": "\n**Let It Be Known**\n The SPAC game is changing. That\u2019s common knowledge. Now a days, I see 17 year olds on TikTok and YouTube pumping their own SPACS with their biased due dilligence. The worse part? People fall for it. \n\n**Solution**\nSo how do we get ahead of the mess and be ahead of the shoeshine kids and actually get quality SPACS? I\u2019ll show you.\n\nMost people know this by now; 2nd SPAC filings is an indicator to the first SPAC\u2019s DA. I will show you why this is an accurate indicator.\n\n**Statistics**\n[Past SPAC DA\u2019s with 2nd filings ](https://imgur.com/a/LqkhmXr)\n\nIf you look at the section \u2018Days after filing\u2019, that\u2019s how many days it took for the prequel SPAC to find a merger after the 2nd SPAC S-1 filing. You can also see on the right hand side: standard deviation, average, high, and median. \nFor this DD, I will be using the Median statistic to dilute outliers. \n \nBefore I go on, I\u2019ve noticed users here are often met with scrutiny when they mention this indicator. And I have to admit, I love predicting so I\u2019ll try to predict what users that think this doesn\u2019t work have to say. \n\nMelvin: You only showed the SPACS that had a DA, what about the ones that haven\u2019t announced a DA after filing the second SPAC?\n\nDFV: As you can see in the spreadsheet, the longest time it took for a SPAC to announce a DA after 2nd filing is 73 days. So why am I not showing the SPACS that haven\u2019t had a DA within 73 days of their 2nd SPAC filing? Because there are NONE. \n\nSo you might ask why this is the case? Because, every SPAC that have filed their 2nd filing always merge within 73 days or lower. Read that again. \n\nNote: please disregard this 73 day high, I was just trying to be unbiased and show you these outliers. As I\u2019ve said the average time it takes for SPAC\u2019s are 32 days. \n\nMelvin: What about Churchill, Gores, or Chamath\u2019s SPACs? They have multiple SPACs but their prequel SPACs haven\u2019t merged.\n\nDFV: They don\u2019t apply here because each of their target focus and trust size vary. If you still have a hard time understanding that, I recommend you read u/fastlapp analysis about 2nd SPAC filings. \n\n**What Now?**\nNow, we have a decent amount of statistics that we can use to predict future DA\u2019s.\n\nThe spreadsheet I\u2019m about to show you contains SPACs that are predicted to have a merger within a set date based off of the median. This spreadsheet is a mic drop of sorts and just more evidence that this works. \n\n[Future prediction DA\u2019s](https://imgur.com/a/hjqMx02)\n\nAs you can see, I listed 8 SPACs. I made this spreadsheet Sunday, two days ago. And three of them have already found DAs. \n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the elephant in the room. 2/3 SPACs that have merged listed in the spread are in the red prior to DA. But mind you, I am here to provide quantity and more importantly, quality. \n\n**Quality**\nSpring Valley is the only SPAC that is targeting sustainability that has a second SPAC filing. The market has an attention span of a rat and sustainability related companies are cocaine. Other users like myself purchased TWND/W. It\u2019s a solid company with good prospects but that\u2019s a story for a later date. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t take much of a hit and it\u2019s my job now to recoup my losses. \n\nAnd please keep in mind about the median days it takes for a SPAC to merge after 2nd filing. 32 days. Although, the last three SPACs that have merged took 10-20. And note that SV has taken 12 days since filing. \n\n**$SV**\nLike many other SPACs, the management team has years of experience; not only in private equity but renewable energy. Chris Sorrells, the director of the team is very active on LinkedIn. Based off of his activity and experience, the merger is likely to be a bio energy company. \n\nChris has also been the director of Renewable Energy Group for the past 12 years. \n\nBest part about this is the price. Warrants are at $2 with an ATH of 3.450 and commons at $10.4 with an ATH of $12.27. \n\n**Bear Cases**\nHave you guys read the email yet from corporate? We now have to post bear cases for our dd to be unbiased. \n\n2 month old SPAC. That\u2019s all I know for now. Please add if I missed something.\n\nTL;DR\nBased off of past DA\u2019s, the median days it takes for a SPAC to merge after having their second SPAC files is 32 days. SV which is targeting an ESG company has taken 12 days. Their management team is experienced and prices are cheap.\n\nObligatory Disclosure: not financial advice. Holding TWND warrants and will enter in SV warrants once my capital settles tomorrow.",

This stick was a bargain around 37-38 but now it's just free money when this thing rebounds back to 45 where it was less than a month ago.\n\nHere are the highlights of the earnings call today in case you missed it:\n\n* Net sales increased by 23.1% to $806.8 million, which includes $53.3 million from the 53rd week.\n* Comparable store sales increased by 7.9% on a 13-week basis over a 5.1% increase in the same period last year.\n* The Company opened eight new stores ending the quarter with 380 stores in six states.\n* Net income increased 146.8% to $24.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share.\n* Adjusted net income(1) increased 46.1% to $24.2 million, or $0.24 per non-GAAP diluted share.\n* Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased 24.7% to $51.2 million.\n\nThis is all good news for us and only proves that after the sell off after earnings this thing is going TO THE FUCKING MOON!\ud83d\ude80\n\nHere are some highlights from 2020 compared to 2019:\n\n* Net sales increased by 22.5% to $3.13 billion.\n* Comparable store sales increased by 12.7% on a 52-week basis compared to a 5.2% increase in the comparable period last year.\n* The Company opened 35 new stores and closed two stores during the year.\n* Net income increased 592.1% to $106.7 million, or $1.08 per diluted share.\n* Adjusted net income(1) increased 86.9% to $112.7 million, or $1.14 per non-GAAP diluted share.\n* Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased 32.4% to $222.9 million.\n\nAND if that wasn't good enough here is what things are looking like moving forward for us.The Company currently expects to open between 36 and 38 stores this year with one closure. They anticipate that comparable sales for the first quarter will decline in the negative high-single digits reflecting the impact of cycling the initial demand surge related to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Excluding the impact of discrete items, they anticipates a normalized fiscal 2021 tax rate of 28%.apital expenditures, net of tenant improvement allowances, are estimated to be approximately $130.0 million.\n\nThis is an extremely cyclical stock and moving into spring and summer are the biggest months for GO as cooking and overall grocery shopping increases.

        "selftext": "Look, we all know companies with Rocket in the name Moon. This is the next next ship to take off; Rocket Labs. Not investment advice.\n\nTL;DR Rocket Labs is actually going to the moon, confirmed. [I shit you not.](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/lunar/)\n\nIf you didn\u2019t read into the news, company deck and analysis out there, here is the important shit.\n\n**TAM**\n\n* Forecasted to be 1.4T in 2030\n* Space is the next frontier, unforeseen TAM expansion\n\nI know your smooth brains can't even predict where you'll wake up tomorrow morning, but this is like trying to forecast how big the internet was going to be in Stanford's basement.\n\n**Backers**\n\n* Solid names like Lockeed and Blackrock. When you say Blackrock and Rocket in the same sentence, you know it's game over\n* Auntie Cathie is probably eye balling this company hard, probably trying to come up with excuses on why it should be added to each ETF\n* SpaceX only allowed 69 investors in for the last raise, people are hungry to throw money at it. The line to get in is longer than the unemployment line. Where do you go when you can't get in?\n\n**Revenue growth**\n\n* Easily beat 2021 forecast, already 90% booked, this is straight out of their pitch deck. Yes, companies lie, but go look at [this man's face](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-ceo-peter-beck-explains-why-the-company-needs-a-bigger-rocket-and-why-its-going-public-to-build-it/), would he lie to you?\n* Government (not just US) space spending will increasing YoY. Biden wants to leave a mark, and not the kind of shit on the backwall of his toilet bowl.\n* Space Startups increasing YoY, and everyone needs a ride to orbit. This is like 2 am when the club closes, everyone wants an Uber but there ain't enough drivers. RL's launches are already booked out.\n* Satellites as a service is a new business model, making it accessible for a lot more companies, already picking up traction. Ryan Cohen with his own GME satellites? Hell, this sub can probably pool together for WBS satellite.\n\n**CEO**\n\n* Does actual rocket engineering like Elon, you don't want some bean counter.\n* Guy is a genius, multiple records and awards, [he has actually sat on a rocket and set a land speed record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-06-29/at-18-he-strapped-a-rocket-engine-to-his-bike-now-he-s-taking-on-spacex)\n* Elon has is a busy man, he's looking after 4 different companies. This is Peter's only focus.\n* Let's be honest, better accent, and bigger belly. This is good.\n\n**Moat**\n\n* Vertically integrated entire Rocket and Satellite manufacturing process. They make their own shit.\n* Already becoming a supplier for component ingredients. They supply people their shit.\n* Patents build up of 3D printed rocket engine designs, battery integration, etc. Had me at 3D printing.\n* Private, government back launch sites dedicated to RL. This is the new hot real estate.\n\n**Brand**\n\n* Proven track record. They've launched 97 Rockets to date, this is more than 69 for those of you that can't count.\n* Multiple government contracts, NASA level shit\n* Elon tweets @ em, we all know what Elon's tweets can do\n* Their logo is a \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Competition**\n\n* Only 2 companies consistently making it to orbit: SpaceX and RL\n* SpaceX dead set focused on Mars colony with Starship, (retired F1, likely F9). RL will happily take that piece of the pie. RL is going to the Moon [and Venus](https://www.space.com/rocket-lab-private-venus-mission-2023.html). To me, we're are going to another fuckin planet, don't care which one.\n* Everyone else either is showing no results, and/or struggling with failures, delays and change in management. Rockets are hard, who knew, even Bezos' Blue Origin is laggin.\n\n**Short term catalysts**\n\n* Moon mission is going to going to make waves, but I don't need to tell you that.\n* ARK will add, just a question of for how many ETFs.\n* Look, they can do up to 120 launches a year, the viewership for these launches are trending up, the only different is, there will now be a stock ticker watermarked to screen. This is GME billboards on steroids.",

        "selftext": "This sub is getting close to 10 million apes now, and with the influx of traffic from all the shit going on I figured most of you need to hear this.\n\nThere was a post recently by u/Aydenn7 that really epitomized the mind boggling dumbassery I'm seeing. He said to hold GME to 100k, and then proceeded to label anyone who had an opposing opinion a shill or a bot.\n\nThis sub is not supposed to be a red-arsed chimpanzee circle jerk but that's what it's turning into. Truthfully, Idgaf about your opinions or beliefs or values. I don't care if you worship satan or jerk it to pictures of Pelosi ten times a day or sleep with an Elon Musk body pillow. All I care about here is making money. That's what this sub is about. Solid, factual DD, high-risk bets, and trying desperately to get yachts and lambos while losing our life savings.\n\nPersonally, I think the idea that GME will get to 100k is the dumbest shit I've seen in my life. But what do I know? I'm a fucking moron. And the vast majority of you bunga-bunga spouting degens are morons too. I have a better chance of making successful trades throwing my hot shit at a wall with BUY/SELL written on it than I do listening to most of you.\n\nThere are a few crease-brained individuals here: the mods, DFV, the people who post solid DD and actually know what the fuck they are talking about. But all of the people telling you to hold, to buy, to do ANYTHING, are not only fucking retards like me, but are retards with THEIR best interests in mind. Not yours.\n\nThere is no trust in the stock market. It's me vs you. Anyone who says \"we all win if we all hold ooh wee\" is just waiting to turn around and sell in a fucking second, leaving you holding the bag. Because they are just trying to make money, which is what they should be doing if they're investing.\n\nI don't want this sub to be an echo chamber. Confirmation bias may help you sleep at night, but it also makes you a stupid cunt. Differing opinions are a necessary part of trying to make informed trades. Think GME will hit $1m per share? Cool. Think it'll crash back to $3? Cool too. Post your PROOF or your POSITIONS, or go dip your balls in nitric acid you fucking donkey.\n\nDo your own research, set your own limits, and stop calling people shills or bots if they have something different to say. At the end of the day, we are just a big bunch of peanut butter brained monkeys trying to make money. That's what it is all about.",

        "selftext": "To start this off, I know I messed up. I made a choice out of pure emotion, and it has proven to be monumental for my portfolio. I have learned my lesson, but want some advice on what you guys would do given my situation.\n\nI had a decent amount of money on some LEAPs in CVS going into earnings a few weeks ago, expecting reports to give it a nice boost. Well, that was the opposite of what happened. In all honesty, I didn't lose that much looking back. For some reason this triggered me though. I have been swing trading for the past couple months and have been up about 90% in my IRA, so I was used to some losing trades that resulted in minus 1-3% here and there. The CVS trade however had me down about 5% on the day, and it just put me in a bad mindset, as I was very confident in that trade working out. \n\nLater in the day after CVS earnings, I liquidated my whole portfolio. I guess out of fear of losing that money from the failed trade, forever? I don't know. I got greedy. I decided that NIO was a good pick to put all my money into OTM calls on. I wanted to make that money back. I worked hard for it. So that's what I did. Well, I just happened to buy these calls the day that NIO went on it's first 6 day losing streak in what seems like forever. I was already down so much as it was, and was holding onto earnings as my only saving grace. Well, that didn't work as earnings weren't as prosperous as the market wanted. \n\nFast forward to today, and my 05/21 $75 C that I bought for $7.10 apiece, are now worth $1.60 apiece. I know I have a couple months until expiry, but I am lost. I know it was literally the last thing I should have ever done, but is there any hope? Just want some opinions on whether you would hold this out for a bit hoping NIO can rally back, or sell now for the \\~78% loss? \n\nI have most definitely learned from this mistake, and in hindsite I am glad it happened. I am glad it happened when my portfolio worth was not in the tens of thousands, and that I am young (23) enough to learn from it and move on. Any advice is appreciated!",

So by using the VWMA (Yellow - Volume weighted moving avg) and VWAP (Blue - Volume weighed avg price - this is intraday) we can see where the volume expects the price to be. Essentially, these indicators can identify a sort of \"true\" price for the stock, where the market wills it to be. Since these follow an avg. they are not reactive to volatility in the same way the active trade price is. In other words, **price at close today was artificial** to some extent, a result of wild volatility or whatever else. Particularly important is price below VWMA since this covers 20 periods rather than VWAP which is strictly session (intraday). Price below both is still a good sign.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR This is a bullish signal. Price &lt; VWMA &amp; VWAP = Correction towards those indicators.\n\n**Meaning if we closed today where volume expected the price to be, and where it will likely correct to - $124 . A $4 and 3.32% gain on the day at close**\n\nNot financial advice, just having fun\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: since it seems relevant, I don't mean artificial in a literal sense. All I'm trying to show is that these indicators are bullish because typically price corrects back to those lines.",

If you play commons near NAV during frothy periods, you can manage downside to buy cheap today.\n\nFor example, NSH was a SPAC I found interesting. I have been hammering the warrants around $2.

        "selftext": "Several months ago, I was reading up on the various eVOLT companies with an intention to invest in a private market. With Archer, and now Joby, going public, I have conviction that both Lilium and Volocopter will merger with SPAC's imminently to not be left behind in funding. I thought I would share the notes I gathered, in the hopes someone might put them to use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n[https:\\/\\/evtol.news\\/joby-s4\\/](https://preview.redd.it/nfcfy0kg9qk61.png?width=275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54598ffb932c8c35693392ab4aa4c49dc61a8473)\n\n# Joby Aviation\n\n* **Founded:** 2009\n* **Management:** Mix of engineers and entrepreneurs\n* **Pre-merger Funding &amp; Valuation:** $796 mln, $2.9 bln (Dec 2019)\n* **Location/Focus Areas:** California, near major metro hubs (LA); other metro areas\n* **Notable Deals:** US Airforce approval for military use\n* **Acquisitions:** Uber Elevate\n* **Working Prototype:** Yes\n* **Backers:** Most notable is Toyota (also the largest), a company known for it's manufacturing capability and assembly line process. Also Uber.\n* **SPAC comments: $**RTP management is in the top tier of SPAC's. There is a reason it traded significantly above NAV up until the deal announcement. Their management has significant entrepreneur and investment experience, including exposure to the entertainment fields and social aspects. Management is incentivized more than others to see price appreciation in the stock (see the DD's of others). My opinion is RTP's management compliments the engineering-heavy Joby exceptionally well.\n* **Equity Value at $10/share:** $6.6 bln\n\nComments: Toyota's backing is one of the most reassuring attributes of the company, since they definitely have an intimate knowledge of hardware specifics and saw something they liked. The connection and learnings from Uber would also likely help them expand in their focus area, and help them demonstrate the concept before eVOLT's take off. The company seems to have a strong engineering focus, which is well complimented by RTP's management who can work on the promotional front and networking (getting partnerships). The military use approval can lead to another revenue stream.\n\n# \n\n[https:\\/\\/www.ainonline.com\\/aviation-news\\/business-aviation\\/2021-01-12\\/fiat-chrysler-backs-archers-evtol-aircraft](https://preview.redd.it/uz3g0o3c9qk61.png?width=321&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1a6a463cce05c5297a96bc00094ef34b3f1b5f8)\n\n# Archer\n\n* **Founded:** 2020\n* **Management:** They highlight Wisk and Airbus, but I believe they also have employees from other eVOLTS\n* **Pre-merger Funding &amp; Valuation:** They only had one seed round while private (they are very new) and the information was not disclosed\n* **Location/Focus Areas:** California and New York; other metro areas\n* **Notable Deals:** United Airlines has the option to buy $1 bln in orders.

United Airlines. UPDATE: Fiat Chrysler; Marc Lore (Walmart's ecommerce chief)\n* **SPAC comments: $**ACIC management consists of former investment bankers and consultants. The team can probably help with financing debt (in the future) and probably have at least some good contacts for making deals in the financial world.\n* **Equity Value at $10/share**: $3.75 bln\n\nComments: This company is green, so they will need to spend a lot of money to catch up to their competitors. One could view their poaching of managers from other companies as combing the best learnings of their competition. We do not know the full story of the deal with United, except that it was announced in the final hour. Could be similar to the one between GM and NKLA that was skewed to GM's benefit. The small investment United made is not convincing. We also do not know why Cathie Wood invested in ACIC; it could have been because it was the first eVOLT company to go public. The stock price will likely fluctuate more on any news since it is so green and is built almost entirely on speculation at this stage. I do not see the SPAC team helping much.\n\n# \n\n[https:\\/\\/electrek.co\\/2019\\/05\\/16\\/lilium-electric-fiveseater-airtaxi\\/](https://preview.redd.it/uqqlnvw79qk61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1166ff7bb0fc1207f8905a91d08fb29635809210)\n\n# Lilium\n\n* **Founded:** 2015\n* **Management:** The founders are young and primarily only have academic experience; most of the top management does not appear to have operational aviation experience and some have backgrounds that are more geared to ramping up start-ups.

They had some issues is the past with their prototype catching on fire, and many have said that what they claim to accomplish with their prototype is physically impossible. They could either be pushing vaporware, or their pie in the sky ambitions could drive them into strong contender status in the eVOLT space.\n\n# \n\n[https:\\/\\/www.forbes.com\\/sites\\/jenniferhicks\\/2019\\/06\\/05\\/theres-no-single-best-air-taxi-concept-and-heres-why\\/](https://preview.redd.it/pa9ngmb19qk61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d203ec03ec3d4bce88d7c76f8d7068467191f616)\n\n# Volocopter\n\n* **Founded:** 2011\n* **Management:** Definitely more seasoned than some of the others on the list.

Mature company with mature people.\n* **Pre-merger Funding &amp; Valuation:** \u20ac168 mln; no guesses on valuation; UPDATE: now \u20ac368 mln\n* **Location/Focus Areas:** Middle East and Asia; based out of Germany\n* **Notable Deals:** Government approval/permit to fly in 2016. Partnership with John Deere for their VoloDrone. Working with Grab.\n* **Acquisitions:** None\n* **Working Prototype:** Yes\n* **Backers:** DB Schenker (global logistics company), Zhejiang Geely Holding Group\n* **SPAC comments:** They seem sound technically and are more seasoned with various people from the aviation industry, so they would do well with a SPAC that can promote them well, and give them access to new deals. SPAC management teams with ties to Asia/Middle East would be useful since Volo seems to want to focus there.\n* **Equity Value at $10/share:** n/a; their last fund raise was for their Series C (UPDATE: now Series D) venture round. They would not be valued as highly as Joby, but should be above Archer/Lilium.\n\nComments: Besides their eVOLTs, they are also focusing on Voloports and customer experiences. Their craft, in my opinion, is a bit ugly, but the company at least seems to know what they are doing.\n\n# \n\n[https:\\/\\/gallery.vtol.org\\/image\\/GHyeS](https://preview.redd.it/r82bnt3t8qk61.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeceb5aed5d3637e9978e8b57890e436482e1666)\n\n# Ehang\n\n* **Founded:** 2014\n* **Management:** Founders mainly only had academic backgrounds.\n* **Pre-merger Funding &amp; Valuation:** Note sure\n* **Location/Focus Areas:** China, Asia\n* **Notable Deals:** A number of deals. Their drones have been used a number of times, including the 2018 winter Olympics in Beijing. They now have deals for their eVOLTs to be used for aerial tourism.\n* **Acquisitions:** None\n* **Working Prototype:** Yes\n* **Backers:** GGV Capital, GP Capital, and public market investors\n* **SPAC comments:** No SPAC; they IPO'ed: ticker $EH\n* **Equity Value:** currently at $2.5 bln @ $45/share\n\nComments: By far the most advanced eVOLT company on this list. If this company was located in the US, it would be worth far, far more based on the pricing of Archer and Joby. Unfortunately, distrust of the Chinese market is pervasive and not likely to change soon due to all the high profile scams (e.g., Luckin); this company will trade at a discounted multiple for the foreseeable future. I think this company is interesting and their is no shortage of congested metro areas in Asia (especially China), as well as affluent people to pay for services like air taxis. They have a diversified range of products from drones to air taxis to medical use crafts. Being located in China also means their manufacturing and labor are going to be cheap compared to their competitors (albeit the quality might suffer). I will not comment on the short report because it does not appear convincing.\n\n# \n\n[https:\\/\\/blade.flyblade.com\\/p\\/miami](https://preview.redd.it/jvhinrkm9qk61.png?width=275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1446c7c19c3c689685f29db90d8d00986d234ade)\n\n# Blade\n\n* **Founded:** 2014\n* **Pre-merger Funding &amp; Valuation:** $50 mln; Series B VC round before SPAC merger\n* **Location/Focus Areas:** New York, East Coast, Chicago\n* **Notable Deals:** They have operations already in New York, are starting operations in Chicago. They transport organs and transplant teams.\n* **Acquisitions:** None\n* **Backers:** Cathie Wood through her Ark fund. Also Airbus.\n* **SPAC comments:** $EXPC. Travel and leisure related. They have overlap with the company, which is good.\n* **Equity Value at $10/share:** $0.825 bln\n\nComments: They make revenue now so have a safer floor without eVOLT adoption, but also significantly less upside than a eVOLT company if adoption does make a giant leap. They offer a platform, and that is something that is fairly easy to replace based on changing tastes (\"brand\" among small group vs \"brand\" among a large consumer base). They will have a network of contacts before other companies, but contractors typically go to the highest bidder, so you need to hope they will be profitable before there are new entrants by companies with larger pockets. Not sure if the data they gather at this stage is worth anything before they scale operations. It is concerning their revenue growth was slowing despite being so new. Their growth could scale with the ultra-wealthy that is rising steadily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther players I did not research: Dufour (Switzerland), Vertical Aerospace (UK), and Kitty Hawk (USA, linked to Boeing).\n\nI was highly interested in investing in Joby or Volocopter in the private market, but no offer ever came up. I plan on watching RTP and EH but have no short term plans to make any purchases. Note that if you want to play it safe, Boeing and Airbus will likely capture at least some of the upside of eVOLTS if they do indeed take off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinal comments:\n\nI will say upfront that I do not trust any of the revenue projections by most SPAC's, since they can basically pull the numbers out of the sky. Anyone that has worked on short-term forecasts for a public company knows how difficult it is to forecast a year ahead, much less 2-5 years ahead. So I would not use those projections as the basis for anything.\n\nIf you want to invest in one of these companies, you are acting as a venture capital firm, except with no real input into the company's strategy. These companies are very \"green,\" and you might need to wait several years before anything noteworthy happens. The companies going public will have to spend a lot of time keeping investors engaged while they burn through cash and while other industries might have more advanced technological or consumer-acceptance breakthrough's (e.g., electric cars/trucks). There is a reason why many of the most successful companies stayed private until they had proof of concept. Musk wanted to take Tesla private for a reason. Going public means spending a lot of time fire fighting and smooching Wall Street, whereas it is much easier to keep a more personal connection with your VC backers, who will likely be more forgiving of short-term stumbles. Overall, going public could prove bad for many of these companies (and I apply that generally to most SPAC's).\n\nPeople are fascinated by eVOLT companies because the technology seems cool, but that does not mean these businesses will be attractive investments vs other businesses for a long time. There is also a risk if share price dips sufficiently, a company will be bought out before seeing any of the upside that long term bag-holders are hoping for. That said, if you have strong conviction, and are inspired by a company you think will make the world and society better, then by all means go for it.\n\nBest of luck everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor... do your own DD.\n\nDisclosure: I have small positions in QELL and ZNTE that I have held since inception.

        "selftext": "Hello together, \n\nSee below the Text of the Website - http://counterfeitingstock.com/\n\nTo the \u201eExperts\u201c : Could you agree on the Input here?\nWhat risks you see here, that the Hedgefonds could use to scam us again?\n\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\n\nIllegal naked shorting and stock manipulation are two of Wall Street's deep, dark secrets. These practices have been around for decades and have resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American public by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been put out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short sellers attack a company. It will also show how all of the participants; the short hedge funds, the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC) \u2014 make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated.\nWhy is This Important? This problem affects the investing public. Whether invested directly in the stock market or in mutual funds, IRAs, retirement or pension plans that hold stock \u2014 it touches the majority of Americans.\nThe participants in this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make Enron look like child's play, have been very successful in maintaining a veil of secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and the SEC have unknowingly (?) helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely knows when its pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock price get chalked up to \u201cmarket forces\u201d when they are often market manipulations.\nThe stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who went to the stock market to raise start\u2013up capital. Small business brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. Over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short sellers.\nIt is important to understand that selling a stock short is not an investment in American enterprise. A short seller makes money when the stock price goes down and that money comes solely from investors who have purchased the company's stock. A successful short manipulation takes money from investment in American enterprise and diverts it to feed Wall Street's insatiable greed \u2014 the company that was attacked is worse off and the investing public has lost money. Frequently this profit is diverted to off\u2013shore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This national disgrace is a parasite on the greatest capital market in the world.\nA Glossary of Illogical Terms \u2014 The securities industry has its own jargon, laws and practices that may require explaining. Most of these concepts are the creation of the industry, and, while they are promoted as practices that ensure an orderly market, they are also exploited as manipulative tools. This glossary is limited to naked short abuse, or counterfeiting stock as it is more correctly referred to.\nBroker Dealer or Prime Broker \u2014 The big stockbrokers who clear their own transactions, which is to say they move transacted shares between their customers directly, or with the DTC. Small brokers will clear through a clearing house \u2014 also known as a broker's broker.\nHedge Funds \u2014 Hedge funds are really unregulated investment pools for rich investors. They have grown exponentially in the past decade and now number over 10,000 and manage over one trillion dollars. They don't register with the SEC, are virtually unregulated and frequently foreign domiciled, yet they are allowed to be market makers with access to all of the naked shorting loopholes. Frequently they operate secretively and collusively. The prime brokers cater to the hedge funds and allegedly receive eight to ten billion dollars annually in fees and charges relating to stock lend to the short hedge funds.\nMarket Maker \u2014 A broker, broker dealer or hedge fund who makes a market in a stock. In order to be a market maker, they must always have shares available to buy and sell. Market makers get certain sweeping exemptions from SEC rules involving naked shorting.\nShort Seller \u2014 An individual, hedge fund, broker or institution who sells stock short. The group of short sellers is referred to as \u201cthe shorts.\u201d\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 The SEC is the federal enforcement agency that oversees the securities markets. The top\u2013level management is a five\u2013person Board of Governors who are Presidential appointees. Three of the governors are usually from the securities industry, including the chairman. The SEC adopted Regulation SHO in January 2005 in an attempt to curb naked short abuse.\nDepository Trust Clearing Corp \u2014 Usually known as the DTCC, this privately held company is owned by the prime brokers and it clears, transacts and holds most stock in this country. It has four subsidiaries, which include the DTC and the NCSS. The operation of this company is described in detail later.\nShort Sale \u2014 Selling a stock short is a way to make a profit while the stock price declines. For example: If investor S wishes to sell short, he borrows a share from the account of investor L. Investor S immediately sells that share on the open market, so investor S now has the cash from the sale in his account, and investor L has an IOU for the share from investor S. When the stock price drops, investor S takes some of the money from his account and buys a share, called \u201ccovering\u201d, which he returns to investor L's account. Investor S books a profit and investor L has his share back.\nThis relatively simple process is perfectly legal \u2013 so far. The investor lending the share most likely doesn't even know the share left his account, since it is all electronic and occurs at the prime broker or DTC level. If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner.\nDisclosed Short \u2014 When the share has been borrowed or a suitable share has been located that can be borrowed, it is a disclosed short. Shorts are either naked or disclosed, but, in reality, some disclosed shorts are really naked shorts as a result of fraudulent stock borrowing.\nNaked Short \u2014 This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation \u2013 the lynchpin of this massive fraud.\nReturning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share \u2014 instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.\nFails\u2013to\u2013Deliver \u2014 The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a \u201cbuy\u2013in,\u201d and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.\nMarket makers have special exemptions from the rules: they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to twenty\u2013one trading days before they have to borrow a share. When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buy\u2013in does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a fail\u2013to\u2013deliver (of the borrowed share).\nOptions \u2014 The stock market also has separate, but related markets that sell options to purchase shares (a \u201ccall\u201d) and options to sell shares (a \u201cput\u201d). This report is only going to deal with calls; they are an integral part of short manipulations. A call works as follows: Assume investor L has a share in his account that is worth $25. He may sell an option to purchase that share to a third party. That option will be at a specific price, say $30, and expires at a specific future date. Investor L will get some cash from selling this option. If at the expiration date, the market value of the stock is below $30 (the \u201cstrike price\u201d), the option expires as worthless and investor L keeps the option payment. This is called \u201cout of the money.\u201d If the market value of the stock is above the strike price, then the buyer of the option \u201ccalls\u201d the stock. Assume the stock has risen to $40. The option buyer tenders $30 to investor L and demands delivery of the share, which he may keep or immediately sell for a $10 profit.\nNaked call \u2014 The same as above except that investor L, who sells the call, has no shares in his account. In other words, he is selling an option on something he does not own. The SEC allows this. SEC rules also allow the seller of a naked short to treat the purchase of a naked call as a borrowed share, thereby keeping their naked short off the SEC's fails\u2013to\u2013deliver list.\n\nHow The System Transacts Stocks \u2014 This explanation has been greatly simplified in the interest of brevity.\n\nCustomers \u2014 These can be individuals, institutions, hedge funds and prime broker's house accounts.\nPrime Brokers \u2014 They both transact and clear stocks for their customers. Examples of prime brokers include Goldman Sachs; Merrill Lynch; Citigroup; Morgan Stanley; Bear Stearns, etc.\nThe DTCC \u2014 This is the holding company that owns four companies that clear and keep track of all stock transactions. This is where brokerage accounts are actually lodged. The DTC division clears over a billion shares daily. The DTCC is owned by the prime brokers, and, as a closely held private enterprise, it is impenetrable. It actively and aggressively fights all efforts to obtain information regarding naked shorting, with or without a subpoena.\n\nStocks clear as follows:\nIf customer A\u20131 purchases ten shares of XYZ Corp and Customer A\u20132 sells ten shares, then the shares are transferred electronically, all within prime broker A. Record of the transaction is sent to the DTC. Likewise, if Investor A\u20131 shorts ten shares of XYZ Corp and Investor A\u20132 has ten shares in a margin account, prime broker A borrows the shares from account A\u20132 and for a fee lends them to A\u20131.\nIf Customer A\u20131 sells shares to Customer B\u20132, in order to get the shares to B\u20132 and the money to A\u20131, the transaction gets completed in the DTC. The same occurs for shares that are borrowed on a short sale between prime brokers.\nAs a practical matter, what happens is prime broker A, at the end of the day, totals all of his shares of XYZ owned and all of the XYZ shares bought and sold, and clears the difference through the DTC. In theory, at the end of each day when all of the prime brokers have put their net positions in XYZ stock through the system, they should all cancel out and the number of shares in the DTC should equal the number of shares that XYZ has sold into the market. This almost never happens, because of the DTC stock borrow program which is discussed later.\n\nWho are the Participants in the Fraud? The participants subscribe to the theory that it is much easier to make money tearing companies down than making money building them up, and they fall into two general categories: 1) They participate in the process of producing the counterfeit shares that are the currency of the fraud and/or 2) they actively short and tear companies down.\nThe counterfeiting of shares is done by participating prime brokers or the DTC, which is owned by the prime brokers. A number of lawsuits that involve naked shorting have named about ten of the prime brokers as defendants, including Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch; UBS; Morgan Stanley and others. The DTCC has also been named in a number of lawsuits that allege stock counterfeiting.\n\nThe identity of the shorts is somewhat elusive as the shorts obscure their true identity by hiding behind the prime brokers and/or hiding behind layers of offshore domiciled shell corporations. Frequently the money is laundered through banks in a number of tax haven countries before it finally reaches its ultimate beneficiary in New York, New Jersey, San Francisco, etc. Some of the hedge fund managers who are notorious shorters, such as David Rocker and Marc Cohodes, are very public about their shorting, although they frequently utilize offshore holding companies to avoid taxes and scrutiny.\nMost of the prime brokers have multiple offshore subsidiaries or captive companies that actively participate in shorting. The prime brokers also front the shorting of some pretty notorious investors. According to court documents or sworn testimony, if one follows one of the short money trails at Solomon, Smith Barney, it leads to an account owned by the Gambino crime family in New York. A similar exercise with other prime brokers, who cannot be named at this time, leads to the Russian mafia, the Cali drug cartel, other New York crime families and the Hell's Angels.\nOne short hedge fund that was particularly destructive was a shell company domiciled in Bermuda. Subpoenas revealed the Bermuda company was wholly owned by another shell company that was domiciled in another tax haven country. This process was five layers deep, and at the end of the subterfuge was a very well known American insurance company that cannot be disclosed because of court\u2013ordered sealing of testimony.\nMost of the large securities firms, insurance companies and multi\u2013national companies have layers of offshore captives that avoid taxes, engage in activities that the company would not want to be publicly associated with, like stock manipulation; avoid U.S. regulatory and legal scrutiny; and become the closet for deals gone sour, like Enron.",

So yes, he knows his shit. This isn't some fake bullshit game. They have working trucks.\n\nMy price target is anywhere from 20 to 30 short term, potentially more if we look at how bullish Lion got.

        "selftext": "**Estimated reading time: 5 mins**\n\n**Most helpful if your idea of investing is \"finding the next best stocks\"**\n\n**TLDR: Not investing is bad because you lose money to inflation. Picking individual stocks probably bad because you can't beat market for 20-50 years. Is researching stocks fun to you? Maybe do invest in individual stocks then. If it's a chore, then probably bad to invest in individual stocks you pick, potential extra gains not worth thousands of hours of your life. Invest in market tracking ETF instead.**\n\nMost people when they think of investing, they think of picking out the next best stock like the Teslas or the Amazons. They think it requires a lot of time, commitment, and research. In reality investing requires none of those things.\n\nThe best thing to do is buy a relatively diversified ETF (or similar product) such as one that tracks the S&amp;P 500. If you don't, then there's a pretty good chance that what you're doing is speculating (aka gambling) rather than investing. Investing, to me at least, has a connotation of \"being guaranteed to make a return in the long run\". By long run I mean 20-50 years depending on how old you currently are and when when you will retire. The economy is pretty much guaranteed to grow in that sort of time frame and with it the ETF.\n\nDoing anything else, especially trying to pick out the next best stock will pretty much guarantee that you will lose money in that timeframe. Of course, you CAN get lucky and win big on certain stocks, but that's rare and then you must also control the urge to not gamble all your gains away for the rest of your life. You'd most likely invest those gains in somekind of ETF if you were smart. The point is though, that scenario requires a lot of luck, and that classifies it as speculation/gambling and not investing, but despite that, that's what most people think investing is anyways.\n\nThis is all good and everything, probably something you've probably heard a million times by now. But, I'll try to put it into perspective in a way that you might not have heard before.\n\nThe reason you are practically guaranteed to lose money doing anything else other than investing in a diversified ETF (or similar product) is because of two things - inflation and opportunity cost.\n\nInflation is, as you probably know, the increase in price of goods and services. If you keep your money in cash then you are losing money due to inflation. Everything gets more expensive and you can buy less with the same amount of cash. Even if you invest your money and make 1% that's not necessarily cause for celebration. If inflation was higher than 1% that year, you made money on paper, but you lost money in reality to inflation (and opportunity cost as I'll explain later). Getting above 0% returns does not automatically mean you made money.\n\nLet's say you made more than inflation was that year. There's still a chance you lost money due to opportunity cost. Opportunity cost is the \"cost of not choosing something that would have been a better option\". For example, if you buy stock A and it goes up 10%, but stock B which you didn't buy goes up 25% then theoretically you lost 15% because you could have bought stock B instead of stock A. That's a simple example. Obviously you could't have known that stock B would rise that much. You can't tell the future. Those scenarios are the ones you can't really compare yourself to bevause there's too much uncertainty. However, there are certain stock choices you can make which you can be reasonably certain will go up. That choice is a diversified market ETF as we were talking about. You can be reasonably certain it will go up in the next 20-50 years. For this reason, this acts as a benchmark to measure your performance.\n\nHistorically, the S&amp;P 500 has returned about 5-7% annually on average, I don't know the exact number. When you begin investing you have let's say 2 options (for simplicity's sake so I can illustrate opportunity cost):\n\n1. Invest in the ETF and never touch it again. The most research you will ever have to do it picking out which ETF to invest in.\n2. Try to picking out the next best stocks and building your own portfolio.\n\nIf you go with option 2 then your goal is to beat the S&amp;P 500 or whatever you used as a benchmark. If you don't beat it then you lost money to opportunity cost. You also lost probably a lot more hours of your life researching individual stocks. Hopefully, you at least had fun researching stocks and it was worth it. If you beat the S&amp;P 500 or whatever benchmark you used, then congratulations, you made money!\n\nBut, that was only in year 1. Since you probably plan to invest for the rest of your life until you retire, you must repeat that accomplishment 20-50 more times. You are far from done yet. You won the battle in year 1 but there's a long war ahead.\n\nMost people are not able to repeat that 20-50 more times. Sure, some might get lucky, but again, that's speculation/gambling at that point not investing.\n\nYou'd better be prepared to put in thousands of hours of work because that's what it takes to consistently beat the market for 20-50 years. You'd better enjoy learning and doing research otherwise it will be a chore.\n\nLet's say you don't enjoy doing thousands of hours of research. And let's also say you accomplished the gargantuan feat of beating the market consistently for 20-50 years. How much did you beat the market by in the end of that 20-50 years? 1%, 5%, 10%? Whatever it is, you'd better hope that it was worth the thousands of hours of work that felt like a chore to you. \n\nThese are some of the things to consider when deciding about where to put your money. Again, if you find it fun to speculate or spend thousands of hours on research, then it's probably worth it even if you lose money to opportunity cost of not investing in an ETF after 20-50 years. Determine whether you'd enjoy it and know what to expect.\n\nAlso I don't think speculation/gambling is necessarily a negative, it can be fun. However, I'd recommend setting aside a smaller sum to do that with, and then invest the majority of your money in an ETF or similar product.",

        "selftext": "#  Summary\n\nAkebia  Therapeutics was founded in 2007 and it\u2019s primary goal is to achieve  better outcomes for people with kidney disease. AKBA currently has a  drug released globally called Auryxia that controls the serum phosphorus  levels in adult patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis and  also treats iron deficiency for these patients. AKBA is currently  developing a new **game changing drug** called Vadadustat that treats anemia  due to CKD and this drug is vastly superior to the current injectable  ESAs (Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents). Vadadustat makes it easier to  treat anemia by allowing patients to skip the clinical visit and orally  ingest a pill daily. This not only makes it easier for patients but also  can help limit patients exposure to coronavirus by allowing them to  treat their anemia from the comfort of their home. In addition to anemia  due to CKD, Akebia believes Vadadustat has the potential to treat other  serious conditions, like preventing and lessening the severity of acute  respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs), a complication of severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), or COVID-19, infection.  The DoD awarded Akebia with 5.1 million in funding to expand the Phase  II clinical trial at the University of Texas Health Science Center.\n\n# Vadadustat- The game changer\n\n**Current Treatment**\n\nThe  current standard of care for anemia due to CKD is treatment by  injectable recombinant human ESAs, such as EPOGEN\u00ae (epoetin alfa) and  Aranesp\u00ae (darbepoetin alfa), or blood transfusion. Based on publicly  available information on ESA sales and market data compiled by a  third-party vendor, global sales of injectable ESAs for all uses were  estimated to be approximately $6.1 billion in 2018. The vast majority of  these sales are believed to have been for the treatment of anemia due  to CKD. The current model requires a large percentage of patients to go  to a clinic and receive the injection- something that puts these  patients at risk of covid infection.\n\n**Why Vadadustat?**\n\nVadadustat  replaces the injection model ESAs use and allows patients to orally  administer the drug from the convenience of their home. Here is a quote  from AKBA that resonates with me:\n\n\u201cAccording  to the U.S. Renal Data System, or USRDS, 2020 Annual Data Report, there  were approximately 556,000 patients in the United States on dialysis in  2018, of which 88% were on in-center hemodialysis and the remainder on  home dialysis, which includes both peritoneal dialysis and home  hemodialysis. Injectable ESAs are administered by dialysis center staff  to approximately 90% of in-center hemodialysis patients and 75% of home  dialysis patients. Although the significant majority of dialysis  patients are cared for in-center, recently, several factors including  the COVID-19 pandemic, changing patient preferences, government  initiatives, and reimbursement changes are supporting a shift toward  home dialysis . We believe as an oral therapeutic, vadadustat has  potential to be a convenient treatment alternative to injectable ESAs  not only for in-center dialysis patients, but also for the growing  number of home dialysis patients and patients transitioning to home  dialysis.\u201d\n\nAKBA has a unique  opportunity to position itself as the clear leader in treatment of  anemia in kidney disease patients with the potential of Vadadustat to be  used to treat Covid patients with lung problems.\n\n# Facts\n\n\u25cf NDA is due Q2 of this year\n\n\u25cf  Vifor struck a deal to get a priority review voucher (PRV) setting up  Akebia for a fast review at the FDA when they file for approval of  Vadadustat\n\n\u25cf Akebia granted Vifor  Pharma an exclusive license to sell vadadustat to FKC and Third Party  Dialysis Organizations, which combined manage up to approximately 60%\n\nof the dialysis patients in the United States\n\n\u25cf Injectable ESA global sales are approximately $6.1 billion as of 2018\n\n\u25cf Institutional ownership over 70%\n\n\u25cf Recent acquisition of stock by institutions and employees of AKBA\n\n\u25cf  DoD Funding for Vadadustat as it will have major implications for  treatment in U.S. military and civilian covid patients with lung  problems\n\n\u25cf Akebia is hiring like crazy\n\n# Catalysts\n\n\u25cf  The other phase 3 HIF-PH inhibitor drug called Roxadustat had a review  by the FDA and it was delayed. This leaves Akebia in an interesting  position especially with the\n\npriority review voucher they have\n\n\u25cf NDA is due this quarter\n\n\u25cf Possible FDA approval 3rd quarter this year\n\n# Technicals\n\nThere  was an overreaction sell off after AKBA missed earnings but now the  stock is cheap and has plenty of catalysts ahead. It\u2019s been trading in  this range since October. The stock  currently resides in the bottom band of the pitchfork pictured below  and presents an attractive low risk high reward trade.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jivjtonpwpk61.png?width=1753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0af0d1836485feedd0b8fce4aec3ed31b8cc0af\n\n#  The Gap Up\n\nAkebia  Therapuetics announced their top-line results from the phase 3 studies and the stock drops substantially. The test resulted in Vadadustat  reaching the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints while missing  on the primary safety MACE endpoint. Akebia has had time to iron out the  deficiencies in the safety endpoint and looks like they are on track  for the NDA. Also the mass hirings, institutional acquisitions and  employee stock acquisitions make me confident that AKBA believes in  Vadadustat. The NDA alone is a catalyst to help fill this gap and with  FDA approval, AKBA stock is GONE. With FDA approval at Vadadustat, there  is a potential 164% gain on the gap.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04n551muwpk61.png?width=1624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42cf21642e44dd9154ce06a8d64f2cd843de46c8",

I\u2019m just expressing myself...\n\nWith that being said, I honestly don\u2019t think that RKT is a shill tactic. RKT is probably a short squeeze separate to the GME and AMC squeezes. Is it distracting, it sure as hell is. Me personally, I think a squeeze is happening as we speak and so maybe it\u2019s worth investing in, maybe not.\n\nI personally do not have a position in RKT and I won\u2019t go into it because I have my cash invested into GME (as well as my other blue chips). I\u2019m still -45% but I very strongly believe that we are gonna see this squeeze come into play some time around 15th March - 19th March. This would be due to: the second GME hearing 17th leading to an increase in media attention, Quadruple Witching day (extreme volume trading) 19th, with GME Q4 reports coming around the 25th. If the squeeze is to happen, mostly likely it will happen around mid to end March. \n\nNow back to RKT, i think that with this volatility that I personally wouldn\u2019t sell my GME shares to free up capital to invest into RKT, why would I lock in losses and then further risk being a bag holder for the RKT squeeze because the moment to invest in would\u2019ve been 2 days ago before we saw the jump and chances are that the squeeze will be finished very soon. If you are going to invest into RKT then I suggest you deposit more cash into you account and use that instead. \n\nAt the end, it\u2019s your choice. I know we all love GME and AMC but we can\u2019t fool ourselves by calling RKT a shill. My only advice I wish you do take from this is to never get too emotional and never let seeing a stock rally make you feel greedy that you think you\u2019ll get lucky and ride that squeeze. There\u2019s no telling when it will end. But when it does it\u2019ll crash back to earth. On the other hand, GME is a squeeze entirely of its own class. One that we cannot comprehend just yet. If the squeeze happens, which I believe it will. It will be historic. One that will be on movies and taught in economics classes for the future generations.\n\nOf course you do not have to listen to me. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m saying. But, if we all keep holding our GME shares, then we will inevitably squeeze the greatest of all squeezes. HODL (and GL to all you RKT squeezers I guess, I hope you put some of that profit  into GME or put your losses back into GME and be ready for its \u201cRocket Gamma Squeeze\u201d \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "I started investing back in march of 2020 when the market was tanking. I had no idea what I was doing. Although, I did know a little about ETFs. So I decided to buy VTI and a couple of other ETFs at around the $120/$200mark. With some leftover cash, I pumped money into stocks that I read in news articles. That's right, I would look up \"the best stocks of march 2020\" and basically buy the first thing on the list on some random article. I guess I got lucky and made about 4k - a 30% return overall. \n\nThen comes GME, BB, AMC, etc. I basically lost about $2500 total because of FOMO. That chewed up a lot of my profits, but it was okay because it was money I could lose. I'm glad that it wasn't worse. It was a huge eye-opener though because I realized that I had around 5-8k in certain stocks that I did absolutely 0 research on besides using the google search bar. Likely these investments could've dropped to 0 but thankfully didn't.\n\nThe moment I lost that amount of money on the speculative stocks, I liquidated all my positions except for some ETFs. It didn't matter if I was up or if the stock was likely to get gain xx%. I decided that as a DYI investor, I needed to understand fundamentals: reading and analyzing statements, industrial comparison, etc. I also needed to have a general understanding of the economy, and maybe even understand Technical Analysis. I needed to become a prudent investor and not invest unless I understood every aspect of the company. \n\nI missed out on a lot of gains these past X months (besides my ETFs), but I have no regrets. I will continue learning each and every day until I'm confident enough to invest again. Even then I could lose money but at least I'll know I tried my best. I would also like to encourage anyone else that doesn't have a sense of what's going on to take a step to the side and look at the situation. If you are reading someone's DD and 1/2 of the terms don't make sense, it's probably a good idea to take a step to the side to learn about them before doing blind investing (gambling).",

        "selftext": "What people don\u2019t understand is that stuff reopening is exactly why bond yields are going up. Our velocity of money will spike up and we\u2019ll get the inflation from the 22% of our monetary supply we printed in 2020. And bonds have to compete with inflation. So yields will go up making the algos we use favor value instead of growth now. A simple way to put it is If bonds are 2.5% that\u2019s like a 40 P/E ratio and the s&amp;p(the stock market) is at 39. Then you have to have compression in the markets. I know most people don\u2019t understand how inflation can lead to lower stock prices in the medium term but it\u2019s all over the news now if you watch so I\u2019m not making things up. It erodes the future purchasing power and eroding the growth potential until the inflation hits the real economy boosting their bottom line. But until then bond yields will rally on our reopening and stocks will have to have multiple compression of the pe\u2019s or  price to sales ratios if they have no earnings. The reason we have had this bull run was low yields and rates due to how bonds and stocks constantly compete for investor dollars so if rates are low they have nowhere to go other than equities. I know that a lot of you have been born in this bull run. as in haven\u2019t seen a market that doesnt only go up. This multiple compression will happen if we get the new stim bill and open up like Texas. Thus overstimulating the economy and causing inflation that bonds will react to faster than the inflation hits companies bottom lines. it also effects the multiples of growth names due to yield competition.",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow apes,\n\nBeen ruminating about creating this post for a while but thought it would be a good one to share with you wonderful r-tards before our rocket flies to Alpha Centauri.\n\nSo we are all patiently waiting for our well-earned tendies to come our way now. For many of us, this will most likely be the most money we have ever had, which is fantastic. I for one can't wait to see this massive wealth transfer happen.\n\nObligatory \"I am not a financial advisor, this is based on my own experience, knowledge etc\". I work with cash rich investors and find them property investment opportunities so I have HAD to learn about money and investments.\n\nI would caution everyone here a few things when you have your dragon's hoard of tendies:\n\n* **Take a deep breath.**\n\nAnd resist the immediate urges that come with the notion of having a lot of money. Now read the rest of this post you smooth-brained ape.\n\n* **Remember you might have to pay tax on this money.**\n\nChances are, you will have to pay tax on your earnings. MAKE SURE YOU PUT ASIDE MONEY FOR THIS. And speak to an accountant if you are unsure about any of this.\n\n* **Don't tell anyone that doesn't need to know.**\n\nSome people changes when it comes to money. The more people you tell, the more random friends you haven't talked to in years will come your way. Hell, even family members might come to you and start asking for monetary favours and chances are you will start running relationships into the ground because of it. DO NOT TELL ANYONE THAT DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW.\n\n* **Put money aside as saving to tide you over for 3-6 months.**\n\nI don't care that you have a shit-ton of money. What are your living costs? Now make sure you have 3-6 months of that stashed for rainy days (hopefully we won't have any of those).\n\n* **Re-invest most of your money.**\n\nSeriously. Don't withdraw all of it and for fuck's sake do not let all that money sit in a bank. They are currently considering negative interest rates here in the UK, and currently interest rates sit at about 0.01% FUCK ALL. Re-invest it! There are a shit-zillion ways you can do that and I guarantee you all of them will be better than sticking it all in a bank account. I love property! 10-15% returns in the UK, easy peasy. Maybe that's your thing, maybe it isn't.\n\nAlso consider this, if you hold a Stocks &amp; Shares ISA, you are LIMITED to only put in \u00a320K per financial year. HOWEVER, all the GAINS you make in that account are free to use AND you don't pay taxes on withdrawals. If you took it all out however you would be limited by the 20K. So maybe you re-invest it in other stocks you like?\n\nMaybe you stick it in a Lifetime-savers account where you benefit from compound interest (if you don't know how powerful this is, look it up!) You could be a millionaire in 30 years by just putting in a couple of thousand every year.\n\n* **Do not upgrade your lifestyle (too much).**\n\nOkay so you want your Lambo, I understand. We all do. We've been living off pot-noodles and crushed up paracetamol for so long now.\n\nDid you know that ONE THIRD of lottery winners usually declare bankruptcy within three to five years? Do you have any idea how many professional athletes go BROKE? (Spoiler, it's a lot).\n\nWhy? Because these people have little-to-no financial education. We aren't taught this stuff in school. No one is going to take you hand, you have to teach yourself this stuff.\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes people who aren't used to money make, is to immediately buy a massive house, buy gifts for friends &amp; family, buy expensive cars, start hiring staff and so forth. See where I'm getting at?\n\nAsk yourself, do you really need all these luxury goods? Absolutely treat yourself, but understand it can be a VERY slippery slope that you might not be able to sustain. Which is why it is so important to have ASSETS (see point above). That shit will pay you back. Your Lambos and gifts for friends &amp; family, however nice, won't.\n\n* **Treat yourself!**\n\nRead everything above? Good. You can treat yourself now. Otherwise, what's the point? Get that Lambo, you deserve it. After all, you've got money stashed now and you've put most of it into investments that will pay you back and keep you living the sweet life of never having to work again.\n\nThat's all for now folks.\n\nOnce again, this is NOT financial advice. Do your own research etc. Just be careful with them tendies.\n\nPeace.",

I'm going to try to avoid bringing my own opinion into this as that doesn't matter. With the millions of new members that have recently joined, there has been a lot of known and unknown misinformation and I've really noticed that it's primarily been in the comments section. \n\nNow I know the spotlight has been on GME for the past 3ish months but you all really have to remember that this is NOT a GME subreddit. It's awesome that we have people YOLOing their money into GME but the few quality posts on this sub have been swamped by GME content.\n\n**INFO**\n\nThere has been hysteria about bots that have been on the sub creating fake content. Now I have no idea whether this is true or not, however, please do not go spreading info around if you are not informed. There have also been posts and comments about \"tactics that short-sellers\" use to manipulate the stock  (that I'm not going to name), which aren't even real tactics. Please, don't just take posts or comments about certain info with a \"grain\" of salt or even a \"pinch\". Take the info you see with a **fist full of salt**. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!!! PLEASE!\n\n**\"\\_\\_\\_\\_ is a distraction from \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\"**\n\n(this section is where I am mostly biased on) Please. Not everything is a distraction from GME or whatever is the hottest play on WSB. There are literally thousands of other stocks that can be bought or sold. I've seen some people say that they are suspicious of RKT because it came \"out of nowhere\" when there have been dozens of DDs since the stock came onto the market. I've seen comments like \"nIcE tRY heDGieS\"....okay right manipulate and trick retail traders to trade over 350M+ shares of RKT so we forget about the past 3 months of GME? Trust me, when you open this subreddit, you almost only see GME. There is no need to remind everyone of the GME short-squeeze. \n\n**\"Where do you get these plays from?\"**\n\nYou can filter the spam and the memes by filtering by DD mode from the daily thread. There are some AMAZING DDs on this sub, you just have to look for them. Remember to do your own research. DDs should not be your only source of info and make sure the DD has some links to their sources or you can ask the OP. You should primarily look at DDs as simply bring awareness to a company for you to look at, and after further research, you can then decide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you. Have a good day :)",

        "selftext": " \n\nHello fellow apes,\n\nBeen ruminating about creating this post for a while but thought it would be a good one to share with you wonderful r-tards before our rocket flies to Alpha Centauri.\n\nSo we are all patiently waiting for our well-earned tendies to come our way now. For many of us, this will most likely be the most money we have ever had, which is fantastic. I for one can't wait to see this massive wealth transfer happen.\n\nObligatory \"I am not a financial advisor, this is based on my own experience, knowledge etc\". I work with cash rich investors and find them property investment opportunities so I have HAD to learn about money and investments.\n\nI would caution everyone here a few things when you have your dragon's hoard of tendies:\n\n* **Take a deep breath.**\n\nAnd resist the immediate urges that come with the notion of having a lot of money. Now read the rest of this post you smooth-brained ape.\n\n* **Remember you might have to pay tax on this money.**\n\nChances are, you will have to pay tax on your earnings. MAKE SURE YOU PUT ASIDE MONEY FOR THIS. And speak to an accountant if you are unsure about any of this.\n\n* **Don't tell anyone that doesn't need to know.**\n\nSome people changes when it comes to money. The more people you tell, the more random friends you haven't talked to in years will come your way. Hell, even family members might come to you and start asking for monetary favours and chances are you will start running relationships into the ground because of it. DO NOT TELL ANYONE THAT DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW.\n\n* **Put money aside as saving to tide you over for 3-6 months.**\n\nI don't care that you have a shit-ton of money. What are your living costs? Now make sure you have 3-6 months of that stashed for rainy days (hopefully we won't have any of those).\n\n* **Re-invest most of your money.**\n\nSeriously. Don't withdraw all of it and for fuck's sake do not let all that money sit in a bank. They are currently considering negative interest rates here in the UK, and currently interest rates sit at about 0.01% FUCK ALL. Re-invest it! There are a shit-zillion ways you can do that and I guarantee you all of them will be better than sticking it all in a bank account. I love property! 10-15% returns in the UK, easy peasy. Maybe that's your thing, maybe it isn't.\n\nAlso consider this, if you hold a Stocks &amp; Shares ISA, you are LIMITED to only put in \u00a320K per financial year. HOWEVER, all the GAINS you make in that account are free to use AND you don't pay taxes on withdrawals. If you took it all out however you would be limited by the 20K. So maybe you re-invest it in other stocks you like?\n\nMaybe you stick it in a Lifetime-savers account where you benefit from compound interest (if you don't know how powerful this is, look it up!) You could be a millionaire in 30 years by just putting in a couple of thousand every year.\n\n* **Do not upgrade your lifestyle (too much).**\n\nOkay so you want your Lambo, I understand. We all do. We've been living off pot-noodles and crushed up paracetamol for so long now.\n\nDid you know that ONE THIRD of lottery winners usually declare bankruptcy within three to five years? Do you have any idea how many professional athletes go BROKE? (Spoiler, it's a lot).\n\nWhy? Because these people have little-to-no financial education. We aren't taught this stuff in school. No one is going to take you hand, you have to teach yourself this stuff.\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes people who aren't used to money make, is to immediately buy a massive house, buy gifts for friends &amp; family, buy expensive cars, start hiring staff and so forth. See where I'm getting at?\n\nAsk yourself, do you really need all these luxury goods? Absolutely treat yourself, but understand it can be a VERY slippery slope that you might not be able to sustain. Which is why it is so important to have ASSETS (see point above). That shit will pay you back. Your Lambos and gifts for friends &amp; family, however nice, won't.\n\n* **Treat yourself!**\n\nRead everything above? Good. You can treat yourself now. Otherwise, what's the point? Get that Lambo, you deserve it. After all, you've got money stashed now and you've put most of it into investments that will pay you back and keep you living the sweet life of never having to work again.\n\nThat's all for now folks.\n\nOnce again, this is NOT financial advice. Do your own research etc. Just be careful with them tendies.\n\nPeace.",
