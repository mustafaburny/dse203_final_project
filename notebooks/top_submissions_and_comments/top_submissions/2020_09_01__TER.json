        "selftext": "Tesla's exclusion from the S&amp;P 500 index on Friday was a surprise to many, given that the mega-cap electric-vehicle manufacturer ticked off all the eligibility requirements.\n\nTesla on Tuesday fell 21% from Friday's close as investors digested the S&amp;P 500 exclusion amid a tech-heavy market sell-off.\n\nBut the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices index committee's decision to exclude Tesla despite its eligibility for inclusion was a \"brave\" one, DataTrek cofounder Nicholas Colas said in a note on Wednesday.\n\nThe decision by the committee could \"only have come from a collective and committed view that Tesla is profoundly overvalued,\" Colas said.\n\nTesla traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 913x on Wednesday, according to data from YCharts.com. The S&amp;P 500 traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 21.7x, according to JPMorgan.\n\nIn addition to a steep valuation, the committee likely thinks Tesla \"sits on shakier fundamentals\" than its August 31 market capitalization of $465.2 billion may indicate, DataTrek said.\n\nThat might refer to the fact that much of the profit Tesla has recorded over the past few quarters derives from the sale of green EV regulatory credits to other carmakers that don't meet the mandated annual EV production quota, and not from Tesla's main business of building and selling cars and solar panels.\n\nTesla will remain eligible for inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 index if it continues to stay profitable in future quarters.\n\nInstead of Tesla, the committee added Etsy, Teradyne, and Catalent to the S&amp;P 500 index.\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-stock-sp500-exclusion-index-overvalued-profoundly-datatrek-committee-why-2020-9",

        "selftext": "I firmly believe that SPY will gap up on Tuesday for the following reasons:\n\n1. They recently added three new companies to the S&amp;P500. S&amp;P Dow Jones added three companies - Etsy Inc. ETSY, Catalent Inc. CTLT, and Teradyne Inc. TER. \n\nSince we have been in a hyper bull market, investors are definitely going to hop into these three stocks on Tuesday. This should add a significant value to the index fund.\n\n2. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8 percent after clawing most of the way back from a 3.1 percent skid earlier in the day.\n\nThis is good! This shows that people only sell on the morning due to fear, yet the overall market is still a bull market. If this trend continues, I expect a lot of investors buying in the pre market. \n\n3. President Trump announced that the third quarter GDP is expected to be the \u201cgreatest year we\u2019ve had\u201d\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: We appreciate it. And we\u2019re doing very well. We\u2019re very, very proud of what\u2019s happened with respect to the economy. And I think that before the election, you\u2019re going to see a third quarter announced. The third quarter will be at a level that our country has never seen before. Next year, we\u2019re going to have a year that was better than last year. And I feel very certain it\u2019ll be better than last year. It\u2019ll be the greatest year we\u2019ve had.\n\nAnd the whole reason this is working out this way is because we set a foundation for this country like we\u2019ve never had before. So next year is going to be a fantastic year.\n\nBut remember this: The third quarter is going to be announced sometime prior to the election \u2014 by a few days, actually \u2014 and I think it\u2019s going to be record-setting-type numbers on GDP and other things.\n\nThank you all very much. Thank you.\n\nWe all know that President Pump won\u2019t let us down.\n\n4. JPOW said interest rates are likely to be low for years and US added 1.4 million jobs in August.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you but currently I have\n\n128 $355 SPY calls expiration 9/9 \n\nThese are going to PRINT!!!",

        "selftext": "For all of you that lost money this week , I have a longer term play that can gain you back some of that money in a few months. Now, I am also as disappointed as most of you that TSLA did not get added to the index  - however I am sure they will make their way in. Teradyne TER is an absolute beast of a company and it was just announced that they have been added to the S&amp;P. They are the leading company in the Semiconductor testing space - their customers are the biggest names in the space TSMC, Intel, etc. They have been growing revenue and earnings at an incredible pace in recent years, and they have a rock solid balance sheet. They have made their way into the automation space mostly through solid acquisitions of companies that produce robots for industrial, warehouse, and other operations which just further diversifies them and moves them into another space set for explosive growth in the next 5 years.\n\nThey made a big run up leading into early August but have now slowed a bit even before the pullback this week which makes this play perfectly timed for a solid run-up leading into their next earnings and continue through the end of the year. Look at the 3-5 year chart this is unstoppable.\n\nI have not seen too much talk about them on WSB other than some DD leading up to their last earnings which was blockbuster but the stock dropped for a few days before continuing to run. \n\nI would suggest calls several months out so look for the Jan 15 2021 expiry's and a maybe C$90 or C$92.5 strike price. The stock typically drop after earnings but quickly reverse and keep going up.",
