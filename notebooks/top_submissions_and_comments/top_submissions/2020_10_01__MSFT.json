        "selftext": "U.S. equity valuations have become a \"total nightmare\" fueled by \"young and dumb\" investors, according to Cole Smead, president and portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management.\n\nAt present, investors are paying 22 times forward earnings to purchase stocks on the S&amp;P 500, 50% higher than the 10-year average valuations across the index.\n\nThe forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divides the current share price of a company by its estimated future earnings per share (EPS).\n\nMuch of the market rally which took the U.S. benchmark from correction territory in March to an all-time high in August was driven by tech megastocks and a bullish options market.\n\n\"The buying that went on in August and September is a 10-year phenomenon the likes of which we have never seen, among millennials and in the risk-taking among people that don't want to own bonds and want to own overpriced U.S. quality businesses, it is of record proportions,\" Smead told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Thursday.\n\nHe added that current valuations were an example of \"stock market failure\" driven by millennials speculating in the stock market for the first time. Smead projected that markets could be in for a nosedive since despite its monetary policy shoring up credit markets, the Federal Reserve \"can't save a stock market.\"\n\n\"They are buying bullish call options that expire inside two weeks. There was ($500 billion) of bullish call options bought in a four-week stretch by small retail traders,\" Smead said.\n\nA call option is a contract between the buyer and seller of the call to exchange a security, in this case a stock, at an agreed price.\n\n\"In '99 it was $100 billion, in '07, it was $100 billion. That is what young, dumb investors are doing and when the market makers see those (call buying) out there, they sell that call to that person and they buy the stock,\" Smead added.\n\nHe suggested that the willingness of wealthy investors and the baby boomer generation to \"ride the index to a fault\" and overpay for stalwart American businesses such as Costco and Microsoft was also detrimental.\n\n\"Microsoft is a wonderful company, but at 40 times earnings, there is a 0% chance of that producing wealth for someone over the next 10 years that will meet their needs.\"\n\nDespite a sharp tech sell-off in early September, Microsoft shares remain 40% higher since the turn of the year, while fellow tech titans Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix have all been on a tear since March's crash.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/smead-nightmare-us-stock-valuations-driven-by-young-dumb-investors.html)",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Puts on ZM, TSLA\n\nYou probably have heard the phrase or even shit posted it yourself: \"It's priced in\". Usually, it's used to easily dismiss someone else's well-crafted DD, however today let's use it to actually do something useful with it. Let's find out, how much growth is priced in in the current price of Zoom and Tesla. As a comparison I also included Microsoft and P&amp;G.\n\nNow follows the detailed description of how I calculated that. If you are only interested in the results, scroll to the bottom.\n\nHow would you even calculate something like that? I will do it with the so-called [Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow). The intuition behind it is that by buying stock you essentially lose out on the returns the cash you used to buy the stock could yield somewhere else, like if you invested it in bonds or an S&amp;P 500 ETF (or of course in FDs, whatever floats your boat). So, this model takes this into account by treating the cash you pay today (or more accurately, its current market cap) as a discounted cash flow of the future returns.\n\nTo be able to use this model, we need to make several assumptions. First, we need to decide on a time-frame in which we expected the company to completely earn its current valuation. I will use 10 years here as a very generous value.\n\nSecond, we need to decide what the cash flow actually will be. For this very simplified application of the DCF model I used the Net Income of the last quarter. I will call this N. In the end we want to have a growth rate as a result which tells us how much the quarterly earnings will need to increase every quarter to earn its entire valuation in the given time-frame. I will call this q.\n\nTo account for the equity a company already has, its current equity E must also be included in its future returns. Again, as a very generous estimation, I will assume that the equity will appreciate like the average returns of the S&amp;P 500 in the last 10 years which is 16.3%.\n\nFinally we need wee need the discounted cash value. This is the current market cap M of the company. We also need to decide on an interest rate to discount M. Again, very generously, instead of assuming that M should also be assumed to have the average S&amp;P 500 returns, we will instead only use the much lower, essentially risk-free returns of the 10Y US bonds, which currently is 0.75%.\n\nTo summarize, we made the following assumptions:\n\n* Time frame of 10 years\n* Equity E appreciates by average S&amp;P 500 returns of 16.3% every year\n* Cash flow is given by the net quarterly income N\n* Current market cap M is discounted by 10Y US bond yield, which is 0.75%\n\nNow, we can formulate the following equation that puts the expected growth of N into relation with the other variables:\n\n    E * 1.163^10 + N * (q^(4 * 10) - 1) / (q - 1) = M * 1.0075^10\n\n(Equity in 10 years plus quarterly earnings of the next 10 years that grow by q every quarter must equal discounted market cap )\n\nNow we only need to select a company and solve the equation for q. This can be done by using approximation methods like Newton's method, or just plug it into Wolfram Alpha.\n\nAs mentioned in the title, let's first start with Zoom and Tesla. All values are in Million USD:\n\n##Zoom:\n\n    E = 1198.81\n    N = 185.99\n    M = 160400\n\nThis gives us q = 1.12575 as a result. So, for Zoom, its current market cap has a yearly growth of q^4 - 1 = 60.61% priced in *for every year in the next 10 years*. Note that this already includes the Q2 earnings which were almost 7 times higher than Q1 earnings.\n\n##Tesla:\n\n    E = 9855\n    N = 11202\n    M = 1658500\n\nThis results in q = 1.17685. So, for Tesla, its current market cap has a even larger yearly growth of q^4 - 1 = 91.82% priced in *for every year in the next 10 years*.\n\n##Microsoft and P&amp;G:\n\nFor comparison, let's also calculate this for less meme-y stocks. I chose Microsoft and P&amp;G, let me know if you want to know the results for other stocks.\n\nMicrosoft:\n\n    E = 118304\n    N = 11202\n    M = 1658500\n    =&gt; q = 1.04679\n    =&gt; q^4 - 1 = 20.07%\n\nP&amp;G:\n\n    E = 46521\n    N = 2800\n    M = 358600\n    =&gt; q = 1.02179\n    =&gt; q^4 - 1 = 9.01%\n\n\nDisclaimer: This is a very simplified calculation which makes many assumptions: We only look at a companies net income of the last quarter, its current equity and its market cap, nothing else. Also, this looks at a rather large time-frame of 10 years, so is not that useful for short-term stock price predictions.\n\nTo summarize: By using the DCF model we can calculate that Zoom and Tesla have priced in into their current market cap outrageously high growth rates already for the next 10 years. Around 60% and 90%, respectively.\n\nPositions: [ZM](https://i.imgur.com/Rae9FzS.png), [TSLA](https://i.imgur.com/ybVcZ1M.png)",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR** While no one knows what future generations of science will hold, I will say with certainty that companies peddling green energy products are in situation closely akin to the Dot Com Bubble.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, all of the electric vehicle stocks are massively overvalued at the moment. A brief list:\n\n[Tesla\u2019s](https://www.bing.com/search?q=tesla+stock&amp;qs=HS&amp;pq=tesla&amp;sc=6-5&amp;cvid=644717105441413197B46E27908A7CB9&amp;FORM=QBRE&amp;sp=1) PE Ratio is 1,170 in spite crashing recently. The average PE is around 18, and Tesla has gained the largest market cap of any auto maker in history, in spite only accounting for around 1.5% of all vehicle sales. As awesome as their team has proven over the years, there\u2019s no way they could meet the market\u2019s expectations anytime this decade.\n\n[NIO](https://www.bing.com/search?q=nio%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=nio%20stock&amp;sc=7-9&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=BA8D2A8B783F46319BE31B9956890EC8) is a Chinese electric car company. Note Chinese consumers are mostly poor and overwhelmingly prefer small personal transportation like scooters, motorbikes, ebikes. They have been losing money but that doesn\u2019t stop their price from rising over 1,200% in the past year.\n\n[Nikola](https://www.bing.com/search?q=nikola+stock&amp;qs=LS&amp;pq=nikola+stock&amp;sc=6-12&amp;cvid=DC098EE074A6496FACCDC7B02BFDCE2E&amp;FORM=QBRE&amp;sp=1) is trading below its IPO price being more and more revealed as a scam. They claim to have designed their own working truck, but all they have is CGI mockups and a faked video where they rolled the truck down the hill. Engineers have debunked a lot of the claims their founder Trevor Milton made, but in short he claims his stuff does literally double of everything Tesla does in spite having no product or design team or history of the long process of creating that. Plus Trevor Milton resigned in the face of lawsuits and investigations pending. And in spite Nikola itself saying they were \u201chighly dependent on their founder\u201d Trevor Milton, they are still on Robinhood\u2019s **100 Most Popular list!**\n\n[Arcimoto](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Arcimoto%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=arcimoto%20stock&amp;sc=6-14&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=8AB657D7B3D54A39BCE0C00777388A79) is a small company with 95 employees that makes small electric utility vehicles. They\u2019ve only been selling cars for a year, they\u2019re losing money, but they still have a market cap of 195 million.\n\n[Aryo](https://www.bing.com/search?q=ayro%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=ayro%20stock&amp;sc=6-10&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=C1CACD62DB384890B47989F02C5D2698) is an engineering sub-contractor specializing in EV. They have six employees, a revenue of zero the last two years, and a market cap of 68 million.\n\nThe trend extends to related industries, with nickel and lithium stocks rising alongside anticipation of contracts from EV companies (with disappointingly meager results). And consider that as large a market cap these companies have, they also compete with older motor companies that are making their own EV and hybrid vehicles. On the wind and solar side, they have seen similar growth over the same time period, which is even more telling.\n\n[SolarEdge](https://www.bing.com/search?q=SolarEdge%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=solaredge%20stock&amp;sc=7-15&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=881BEB5EA020452D8737355C25F7693B), an Israeli innovation company, has risen over 200% in the last year and has a PE of 74.\n\n[Vivent Solar](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Vivent%20Solar%20%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=vivent%20solar%20stock&amp;sc=6-18&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=EF6DB7BE434F4EFB9F3542386CA62018) has risen over 550% in a year, have under three thousand employees, are going into big debt with their investment, and have a market cap of 5.29 billion.\n\n[Vestas Wind Systems](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Vestas%20Wind%20Systems%20%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=vestas%20wind%20systems%20stock&amp;sc=7-25&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=D635DB0D4724467F9663C497DBAFF96B) has risen by 118% over the last year, has a PE of 57, a market cap of 32 billion, and only 25,541 employees.\n\nNote these are *utilities companies*, that have years long installation and maintenance contracts with cities who go into decades of debt to install these services. To show how slow the industry moves, my hometown still has a working coal power plant that was built in the late 1920\u2019s. Sure there\u2019s new windfarms being built, but this stuff was built to last and it costs a fraction as much to overhaul old stuff than buy new. Ergo the old stuff goes offline slowly, and new investments are made.\n\nThis means the rise of the wind and solar industry is **solely due to** **investor sentiment**, not the growth of the industry itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen science itself comes in.\n\nIn strictly performance and economic terms, gas is fundamentally better than renewables. [The main issue](https://youtu.be/Hatav_Rdnno) comes down to energy storage: A gallon of gas contains 13 times more energy by volume than the best lithium ion batteries Tesla has to offer. That same gas has 50 times more energy by weight than lithium ion batteries. Plus, gasoline just goes into a tank and sits there, while batteries are broken into many cells with connective wires and packaging that aren\u2019t space or weight efficient. Tackling this problem has been Tesla\u2019s greatest hurdle, as they\u2019ve had issue with [new batteries randomly exploding.](https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/a28687473/tesla-model-3-explosion/)\n\nOn top of that, electric motors offer a lot less horsepower for a given weight than a gas motor, along with a much lower top speed. Electric motors do offer instant torque, less maintenance requirements, and don\u2019t need to idle, but that means little to the average consumer. Altogether with current tech an EV user would be limited in the range, weight, and speed he can move things. Where I live I don\u2019t even have the garage to charge an EV in nor are there charging stations anywhere within 80 miles, and many people live likewise.\n\nThis is also why you don\u2019t see many electric airplanes. The range, speed, and payload are extremely limited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, you say \u201cBut the science is moving forward, and we\u2019re investing it that.\u201d Two problems:\n\nGas motor tech is also advancing as companies find ways to improve efficiency and reduce emissions. Of course they are, because not only is it a very good thing to do\u2026 It is a very Profitable thing to do. And why are we complaining when they raise efficiency on the type of vehicle that +95% of people drive?\n\nNext problem is that scientific progress is measured in decades and generations, not months and years. For instance, [projections](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/weve-long-waited-for-fusion-this-reactor-may-finally-deliver-it-fast/ar-BB19A6Xq) have put us 20 years away from fusion power\u2026 ever since the 1960\u2019s. Much progress has been made, like using giant magnets to force atoms together or complex math to compensate for instability issues, but they still only making marginal improvements when the problem is no one can make self-sustaining fusion. Fusion requires isotopes of hydrogen, the lightest gas in existence. Fusion requires ludicrously high temperatures and/or pressures to work. Fusion creates a nuclear flash. None of the above cooperate with each other at all.\n\nIn the case of solar panels, each decade has seen measurable improvement, but the base issues that were there over a century ago when it was just a laboratory novelty still exist. Namely, finite energy from sunlight even if they were 100% efficient (they aren\u2019t), and the fact each panel is a significant investment. Current research revolves around solving [mystery wear and tear](https://phys.org/news/2019-06-solar-cell-defect-mystery-decades.html) that makes panels lose productivity and also making the panels self-cooling so they don\u2019t lose efficiency at high temperatures. But still, the up-front costs are debilitating by any measure.\n\nSo not only has the market priced in a revolution in the car industry, it has priced in major revolutionary advances in science that can\u2019t happen anytime soon. I can\u2019t predict the future, maybe in 50 years new energy storage devises will hit the market using a currently unknown caveat of quantum physics.\n\nBut current scientific research reflects what will hit the market in 10-30 years. I mean it, even in military projects it takes that long for something to go from a concept to a weapon. Case in point, according to Ben Rich from Lockheed\u2019s Skunk Works, the experimental concepts of radar absorbing paint and a radar resistant shape of aircraft were known back in the 1960\u2019s. His book detailed some of the immense list of tricky technical issues involved in making an actual stealth plane, however.\n\nWhat generates this bubble? Look at 5 year charts of these stocks and you\u2019ll see the pattern. The started going up last winter, dipped with the Coronavirus crash, and then immediately soared. I ask Why?\n\n1. [Essentials.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/16/focus-on-essential-companies-that-can-get-through-to-the-other-side-jim-cramer-says.html) Institutional investors are looking for high growth stocks safe from Covid induced bankruptcy.\n\n2. [Autists.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/08/17/robinhood-valuation-soars-to-112-billion-with-new-funding-and-record-growth/#282f7699663d) Discount brokers, from Webull to TastyTrade to ThinkorSwim to Interactive Brokers, all have grown a lot, especially in the last year with quarantined and bored people looking for a way to make some money. Even r/wallstreetbets have seen their membership rise significantly over this period. Nothing wrong with that, but what do all these inexperienced investors consider good growth positions in ethical industries? That\u2019s right, tech stocks and renewables, and the average number of stocks held is two per account. In some circles I follow, I\u2019ve had to explain that day to day changes in the market price does not always reflect the business itself. And I\u2019ve literally seen this question: \u201cWhich should I invest in, Tesla or Apple?\u201d (FACEPALM)\n\n3. [Hedge Funds.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-fund-darlings-vs-tesla-204030211.html) These guys seek out high risk high reward schemes, and it is known that several capitalized in Tesla\u2019s meteoric rise and were among the first to bug out. While it varies wildly how these guys make money, the high volumes surrounding the \u201cmeme stocks\u201d would present them with many opportunities.\n\n4. [Venture capitalists.](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-is-a-billionaire-who-doesnt-care-about-money-2020-5) Rich people are no different, and several corporate heads in renewables said they were more concerned about science than making money. Nothing wrong with that, but you see where the market has gone with this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut not all hope is lost for those of you who want to invest in renewables; Nuclear energy is seriously undervalued! Again, this is due to public perception effecting investments, and not the science itself. Progress continued to be made in the science even after Chernobyl caused the total halt of reactor construction, and now as old reactors start going offline and new reactors are cheaper, safer, and come in conveniently smaller packages they look more tempting than ever.\n\nNamely, Microsoft and General Electric are partnering to make [NuScale](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200828005299/en/NuScale-Power-History-Small-Modular-Reactor-Receive), a small modular nuclear reactor that can be produced in bulk, shipped as one piece on a semi, installed into bunkers with a crane, and integrated with as many other reactors as you want. The streamlined process brings costs down, and the small size allows for small remote installations to cut their overhead power costs to near zero. So far, only the Pentagon is buying, but it is also just passed a rigorous certification process last week.\n\nAlso, [thorium nuclear reactors](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/could-thorium-revive-the-nuclear-energy-industry-1029624977) are becoming a thing. These are a lot less energy efficient, but physically can\u2019t break down in a lot of the ways uranium plants have historically (I.E. coolant leaks). Technical hurdles remain, but this has been in the works since the 1980\u2019s and only slowly has it been getting attention.\n\nAnd yes, nuclear is definitely a great option. From the perspective of energy density, kw per dollar, initial installation costs, and manning costs nukes lead all others by a ridiculously large margin. In fact, one of the biggest costs are actually the extreme safety and security requirements. And used parts have to be disposed of in lead containers and buried deep in a remote desert.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my autist opinion, I give an emphatic sell recommendation to the whole renewable industry.\n\nDo I recommend dropping everything and going into nuclear? No, I\u2019m saying the damage is done with this human error. Someone has already bought at the top, and when the selling starts someone will lose money. This doesn\u2019t mean renewables are doomed, either. Recall that Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon all weathered the Dot Com Bubble, because the bottom line is the stock market DOES NOT REFLECT THE ECONOMY, it reflects investor confidence.",

        "selftext": " Alright Autists,\n\nYou've been hearing a lot about Gamestop. It is MASSIVELY shorted. There are roughly [\\~70 million shares](http://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/GME.htm) that have to be bought sooner or later.\n\nThere aren't many opportunities like this where a company is turning around, entering a new console super cycle with a healthy balance sheet, gaming and tech visionaries leading the turn around, and negative sentiment prevailing for years. This created one of the greatest short bubbles I've seen in the market. Rumor has it that a few Wall Street firms are on the short end of this trade.\n\nPeople have already posted about [Ryan Cohen](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-price-chewy-investor-plans-amazon-rival-ecommerce-2020-9-1029612504), [Reggie Fils-Aime](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/09/reggie-fils-aime-gamestop/), [Microsoft](https://www.businessinsider.com/xbox-deal-with-gamestop-includes-revenue-share-on-digital-sales-2020-10)...I'm going to talk a little about Gamestop's E-commerce. E-commerce is very important as it will massively increase its total addressable market and help continue optimizing its dense retail structure (increasing profitability.)\n\nNow that Gamestop is turning into an e-commerce gaming power house (\"Chewy of Gaming\"), it's good to track their e-commerce metrics. Gamestop's total addressable market went from purely relying on brick-and-mortar to include everyone with internet. Their website is very nice now and they also recently [updated the app](https://twitter.com/Reggie/status/1311802247114678273)\n\n. Covid has changed consumer shopping behaviors and forced companies to up their e-commerce games, subsequently putting [consumer loyalty up for grabs](https://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/articles/building-customer-loyalty-in-the-post-covid-19-retail-environment/) (Gamestop already has [55+ million loyalty members!](http://news.gamestop.com/fact-sheet-0))\n\nLet's see what their e-commerce has been doing. Referring to the charts below (data excludes the app; it's only web and mobile web traffic):\n\n1. [Gamestop web traffic is skyrocketing](https://www.similarweb.com/website/gamestop.com/)  \n from August to September. What's really interesting is that its Category Ranking (a measure against its own competitors) went from 83 to 38! This could mean that Gamestop is capturing market share from its e-commerce competitors (Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Newegg, etc.)\n2. Organic search is improving (less ad costs and means people are searching for Gamestop directly)\n3. Social media referrals are increasing (Twitter and Reddit leading the way)\n4. [Google searches](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=gme%20stock)  \n for Gamestop's stock are at all time highs! (Bonus...not directly related to Gamestop's e-commerce)\n5. Another big one that not many people know about yet is that Gamestop is penetrating PC Gaming Hardware. That is a [$40 billion industry](https://wccftech.com/pc-gaming-hardware-market-to-grow-by-3-6-billion-in-2020-thanks-to-covid-19/)  \n and growing! The overall industry is growing at roughly 10% a year and entry-level gaming hardware is growing at over 20%! I believe Gamestop has the advantage of being a dominant player in that industry compared to Newegg, Best Buy, Amazon, etc. As a comparison, roughly half of [Best Buy's revenue](http://s2.q4cdn.com/785564492/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/Best-Buy-Fiscal-2020-Annual-Report.pdf) (pg. 26) comes from Computing and Mobile (\\~$20 billion.) Gamestop is getting ready to attack that industry hard and get its piece of the pie. This could be a very fast growing and lucrative category!\n\nI've attached a screenshot of interestings graphs and metrics, and you'll find references to articles in the hyperlinks above. Enjoy :)\n\nTL:DR Gamestop e-commerce is killing it. Long GME\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8i101rnd5rt51.jpg?width=4656&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f834005a3da8de9426f1facf1e7e38de815952cb",

        "selftext": "Because Reddit seems to be good at picking out winners not only in the short term, but in 4-5 year time spans as well\u2026 I\u2019ve seen a lot of topics from 2016-2017 where people were bullish on companies like AMD (40x), MSFT (4x), NVDA (20x), TSLA (9x). Some were bullish on failures like GE, and Intel but even if you picked those as well, you still would\u2019ve been up tremendously over the market.\n\nThe stocks that Reddit were hyping 4-5 months ago and are still hyping up today, NET (1.8x), DKNG (2.5x), SQ (3x), ARKK (2x) have also done very well\u2026 And it\u2019s not like these are short term stocks either. They all have huge growth opportunities 5-10 years down the line.\n\nIn contrast on average it takes 7 years for an S&amp;P 500 ETF to 2x. Statistically, it would take 7+ years for my investment in VTI to reach the same % gains as the investment I made in DKNG 5 months ago. Furthermore you\u2019d have to wait 20+ years just for VOO and VTI to reach 8x valuations. Most of us would be in our late 40s, or early 50s by then.\n\nAs a young person I\u2019d rather take a medium risk, high reward opportunity, than a very-low risk low-reward opportunity.\n\nAnd yet over and over again, we\u2019re told that very few people are able to beat the market, and you\u2019re better off just dumping everything into an S&amp;P 500 index fund and holding. But the more I lurk on this subreddit and various other investing communities, the more I question that statement.\n\nI\u2019m thinking many people underperform the market because they make emotional decisions. They try to time the market, sell innovative companies for a measly 1.5x gain only to buy back again at a higher price due to fomo, liquidate everything on the slightest hint of bad news and so forth. Just like the statistic that got posted, where the Magellan Fund averaged 20% / year over 10 years, but the people who bought into the fund actually had a net negative. And overall there are far more investors like that in general rather than people who know to just buy and hold onto a stock with long term prospects.",

It means after you login with your normal password, your account is protected by a second authentication method. This is usually a text message, email, or Authentication app (Microsoft Authenticator, for example) where a one-time code is sent that you input to then complete logging in. This makes it more difficult for someone to access your account, even if they have your email &amp; password.\n\n**To enable:**\n\n1. Log into your account online or open the app\n2. Go to Account\n3. Go to Settings\n4. At the bottom is a section called Security\n   1. Turn on Two-Factor Authentication\n\nDon't be lazy.

I really hope I'm not breaking any rules but please don't remove this mods\u2764\ufe0f\n\nThis F/Y I created a relatively diverse portfolio and went from a nice and steady gain of around ~50% since May to about -50% from my initial investment as of tonight. I thought I was making the right calls until I wasn't. No I'm not gonna post loss porn but I've got for letters for you..  H Y L N \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udd2b. Got f'd so hard I can still feel it weeks later. So yeah feel free to keep reading cuz I'm a fucking idiot and you might get a kick out of this.\n\nSo. GME. If you're still reading...\n\n\nBULL CASE, NO SQUEEZE:\n\nif we consider the company's\n\n-cash in hand (i.e. ability to stay afloat)\n-sold out pre-orders on the new consoles\n-brand awareness (how many of us bought something from GameStop as a child? I bought a LOT of shit from GameStop as a kid and I want my fucking money back so I'm in as I'm sure a lot of others are in for a similar reason)\n-constant cost cutting by way of closing down locations which aren't making money\n-change of management \n-involvement of Michael Burry (i watched the Big Short and thats all the DD we really need here let's be honest..\n-institutional investors holding a signification amount of shares and not selling even after such ridiculous rallies\n-GameStop's attempt at pivoting to e-commerce\n-Microsoft deal\n-rumoured Sony deal\n-potential for further deal(s) with more big names\n-increasing retail interest\n-retail investors looking for the next success story\n-premium meme status\n\nI think the stock price (without any sort of squeeze action) will sit around $30 to $50 by the time earnings from the new consoles come into play. This puts the company at a market cap of around $2bn to $3.5bn, respectively - a fairly reasonable valuation compared to previous gaming cycles and taking all aforementioned factors into consideration (and assuming they all go in favour of GME i.e. no bad news, no scandals, no big investors selling off, smashing earnings reports etc, securing further deals).\n\nThis valuation MAY be achievable solely based on earnings from new consoles and other products, as well as a successful pivot to e-commerce. However, I personally believe the valuation of $2bn to $3.5bn is contingent on some sort of catalytic news (i.e. more deals with the likes of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo) carrying the price to the $20 to $25 range PRIOR to the console earnings coming into play. If such a catalyst occurs in time, it may provide the stock with a new floor around $20 to $25 (making the valuation sit at around $1.3bn to roughly $1.6bn) as more retail investors start to take notice.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nBULL CASE WITH SQUEEZE: assuming that a short squeeze actually takes place, God only knows where it could end up. I REALLY like that one guy's PT of $500 but that's probably not going to happen. With that being said, I can't even fathom what a short squeeze with 170% short interest could actually do to a stock like this.. Please, someone with ACTUAL knowledge of the market feel free to chime in here. \n\nSo... PT with the turnaround story, securing new deals/partnerships with big companies, increase in retail interest, AND some squeeze action on the side?? $100 to infinity. \n\n\n-----\n\n\nBEAR CASE: the company has been in decline for about 6 years. When we consider WHY the stock is trading so low, one wonders why would it suddenly become worth even $1bn, let alone $2bn to $3.5bn. The rise of e-commerce and now with the ultimate fuck you from the universe (covid) to brick-and-mortar stores.. it's really no wonder why the company is doing so terribly. They may continue to trade at these elevated prices running up to and through the console cycle, but it will not last. This is because making a breakout in the e-commerce sector will be nearly impossible because of Amazon (worldwide), eBay (worldwide) GAME (UK/Europe), and large supermarket chains like Tesco (UK), Asda (UK) and Costco (USA/UK) already having a pretty solid grasp on the market in their respective territories. \n\nAdditionally, as mentioned above, the bull case is contingent on so many factors that it is more likely to continue declining in the mid to long term rather than trending up by any significant measure. Contrary to what a lot of people are thinking, the bear case is actually supported by the ridiculous short interest. Why would so many people be betting against a stock with such passion (170% shorted ffs) if they didn't absolutely believe that they are right and that GME is done for? At least one really solid catalyst WILL be required to push the stock up significantly. It seems that the Microsoft deal was not a significant enough catalyst make the share price moon. So how far up is another deal REALLY likely to push the share price?\n\nAlso, If there is no such catalyst until new console earnings come into play, or if big investors start pulling out at ANY point, the stock MAY still spike as console earnings come into play, however, it most likely will not hold above $25 and will crash hard as fuck when people start taking profits/realise what's about to happen.\n\nAlso, why would this console cycle affect GME the same way as it previous cycles? We now have so many options to choose from when it comes to buying ANYTHING let alone games or consoles. Of course, Amazon won't be able to fulfil every single order. GameStop WILL pull in hella revenue as demonstrated by the selling out of BOTH waves of PS5 preorders. However, the effect on the share price will not be the same. We will most likely see some huge spikes leading up to/after earnings, but it will be short-lived as people will see that GameStop is one of MANY retailers offering competitive prices for the same items and as supply and demand meet an equilibrium. \n\nAlso.. what do most people do when they can't find something at their go-to store? Most people I know would look at Amazon or eBay rather than waiting it out. This will pull a lot of revenue away from GameStop as other retailors will fill the gaps and reduce the prospects of revenue growth over time. This, in turn, will make the stock price tumble once again, and probably harder than it ever has because this may be GameStop's last shot at turning it around.\n\nUltimately, I think if any sort of a bear scenario plays out, we could be looking at 52-week low within the next few weeks (I personally don't hold this opinion as I need to keep believing to remain sane).\n\n\n-----\n\n\nI could keep talking in circles about why the stock is/isn't gonna moon and who's gonna get fucked the hardest; bears or bulls, respectively. Every reason FOR either side can be easily followed up with an argument AGAINST it.\n\nI would personally really like it if someone could pump the stock so hard that shorts start covering, causing a domino effect of shorts covering their positions (and their asses), leading to ultimate short squeeze so I can finally make a little bit (or a lot) of money. But for all we know, this shit could crash so hard I might never be able to bring myself to trade again. \n\nPOSITIONS: all in on GME shares cuz I haven't learned a thing from HYLN.\n\nDISCLAIMER: it this goes tits up, one of you millionaire bears better help a brother out with cash flow or i WILL do it \ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc4b.\n\nGood luck to both sides \ud83d\udc2e\ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\udc3b See you all on the flip flop.",

        "selftext": "So everyone I got into GME on Thursday with 10/30 12.5c I bought at 1.6 and was up 120% Friday midday but like a degen I held. They are currently 1.63 so im not really in any pain besides unrealized gains guh. \n\nThe arguments against GME :\n\n1. They are just buying Microsoft tablets.\n\nNot true they are entering a multi year strategic partnership which allows them to get some royalties when customers sign up for Xbox live (which will be free for 2 years when customers buy from them.. worth af). Also Microsoft closed all their stores so they are positioned from a customer access and strategic physical standpoint. \n\n2. Hurr durr all games are online no need for physical store. \n\nAutist, have you tried to download cod on your Xbox? Most people buy the cheap consoles with the least amount of space. Cod literally takes up a third of my memory. Same with gta v and other big games like Skyrim. You can only store so many games. \n\nPs5 just said 80-90% of games are going to be backwards compatible meaning discs and pre owned games will still be important and a physical marketplace will continue to exist. \n\n(Hurr durr cloud gaming will take over) \u2014&gt; agreed but google stadia is at early adoption stage and Jedi for Microsoft won\u2019t be viable until a few years. \n\nAlso nerds buy their fanboy shit from stores, and GameStop is the strongest nerd merch store nationally. \n\n\nIf anyone has any other reasons why calls won\u2019t be printing let me know if not shut the fuck up and buy the dip f*******\n\nThank me later or now with platinum I\u2019m trying to give edgy posts some stickers or shit.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m sure everyone read enough of how management is going to turn this around but no one spoke about how the gaming console itself is going to benefit Gamestop since they deal with a lot of physical/disc sales/resale.\n\nI just want to talk about the second coming of Tesla that is Gamestop. I talk mostly about how Gamestop will boom with rise in physical game vs digital. What I talking about? I\u2019m talking about the coming of 4k gaming. While you bitches are trying to just play the short squeeze for a price target of 50$ you are completely missing the bigger picture. We are going to easily go above the company\u2019s all time record high made back in 2008 62.11$ without the squeeze when all said is done. (Don't forget our buddy Michael Burry managed to kill 1/3 of the outstanding shares through last years buyback) \n\nBack in 2012, anyone who was a gamer can tell you how big of a POS the console launches were because of one reason. The hardware were absolute trash, it was using AMD\u2019s CPU/GPU and everyone complained because you\u2019re paying a premium for low tier outdated PC parts. Intel cpu was what people wanted fitted with Nvidia graphic cards. You have 12 year olds rocking PCMR (PC MasterRace) logo everywhere making fun of peasants potato PCs. Look at AMD in 2012, it was trading at 2$. Company probably had Donald Trump at the helm making the calls running the company into the ground like his Casinos. \n\nAnyways, this time is fucken different and even better than it was back in 2008. In 2008, cpu/gpu improvements were still doing fucken leaps and bounds year after year. The game consoles were outdated within a year or 2. In 2020, CPU/GPU improvements slowed to an absolute crawl and parts cost a fucken arm and a leg. Moores law hit a wall and getting 2x performance over last year was no longer possible and the cost for parts kept going up. You want the latest and greatest? That\u2019ll cost you 2000$+ for PC gaming, hell no one is going to have that kind of money especially with this recession. \n\nNow here comes PS5 and Xbox Series X, giving you the latest top of the fucken line gaming hardware for 600$. M$ and Sony is losing money on this like back in 2008, you will hear every fucken reviewer praise this and tell you go out and buy it. Everyone and their mom\u2019s going to go buy new gaming console for their kids so they can fuck off while they have sex with her boyfriend in the other room.\n\nHow does any of this benefit Gamestop? Well with now the latest and greatest gaming console and top of the line hardware we will see an actual push for 4k gaming.\n\n4k gaming to say the least is very hardware intensive and also takes up a fuck ton of storage space. What takes up a lot of storage space? 4k fucken texture packs for 4k gaming alone takes up +20gb of space. Yes that fucken storage space is going to be huge. The last generation we never had any real push for 4k gaming, fucken hell they mostly ran below 1080p to even be remotely playable at 30 FPS. You think people are going download entire games when it takes days or weeks to download with their dial up connections. No they will buy physical discs 9/10 times. \n\nMoreover anyone who plays games on console will tell you 99% that they prefer disc over digital downloads because it cost the same as digital and \n\nLastly, we all know that with the new console release there is actually a lack of new games but that matters not. All games are backwards compatible, so where does Gamestop benefit from this? Well they are only the biggest used game reseller around the block. When people go to buy the new console they are going to go to Gamestop over Amazon or Bestbuy and buy used game to play when everyone goes back into lockdown. Everyone who was planning on spending 3000 on trips oversea will be buying games instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone who says they are going to go like Blockbuster and point to the last 2 quarters is trying to shill you. Everyone knew that a new super gaming console cycle was coming, they were holding off on their purchases and been saving their pennies for this. The next quarter for Gamestop is going to be its biggest.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBig push for 4k gaming will result in large files downloads incentivizing people to choose physical discs over digital.\n\nPositions. Shares and even more shares for now. After election IV Armageddon 01/15/21 30C or further out.\n\nTL;DR x2 Also for everyone saying that Gamestop will go out of business. Here\u2019s just a quick discussion on just simply why it makes sense for Microsoft/Sony to exist. https://youtu.be/8gEfHD\\_y7Pc?t=938\n\n Gamestop will be their showroom, so it makes sense for Gamestop to thrive and not run them out of business. Amazon/Bestbuy/Walmart sure as hell aren\u2019t going to advertise games for them since they aren\u2019t a gaming retail store primarily.\n\nPS.

As it turns out, DOMO Capital has confirmed that GameStop will be getting a cut of ALL downstream revenue related to systems they sell.\n\n\\-GameStop will share revenue of all digital content: DLC, full-game downloads, microtransactions, XBOX game pass, movies, etc.\n\n\\-Applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the Xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GS, they would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold\n\n\\-Incentivizes GameStop to push XBOX. What does this mean? If talks are not already underway, expect Sony and Nintendo to reach similar agreements so that Microsoft doesn't get preferential treatment. They certainly don't want to miss out with GameStop being the largest reseller of systems\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone really think GameStop is going to turn around? No, not likely. But the conditions for a squeeze are growing every day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Analysts are missing a lot of the potential upside here, even if only temporary.

        "selftext": "Look, I'll make it simple. Clearly I'm high. I fucked myself hard last week thinking ZM was going to drop. $4800 in losses later, I took out $1200 to pay bills and put everything else on JMIA. That shit printed and now I'm here. \n\nOn Friday, I only bought $3000 worth of $NOK Calls. On Monday at Open, I'll dump another $10k in. This is get fucked or get rich. If this doesn't print it's $ROPE for me. I'm poor, but i could be poorer. \n\nTwice a year, every year, Nokia sees a little bit of action. The moves aren't great, but just enough to take you to tendie town. \n\nThis year is fucking different champs. This year, $NOK is going to move up to a new ledge of $7. Print it. In the age of retail herp derps and people asking questions like \"WhY iS nOkIa A PeNnY StOcK?!?! -- $10 could happen before the end of the year. Shit sounds unbelievable? Welcome to 20jesusfuckingchrist20. Everyone in here fapped to Hertz again. Don't @ me with your bullshiit. \n\nHere's the Story, it's a long one. :\n\nI get that alot of shit has happened since 2000 to impact the price of the stock on a pure share value. That's not what I'm talking about. This is high thought shit coming out, check the username. \n\nIn 2000 - Nokia had a yearly high of $59.84 and a low of $14.91\n\nIn 2007 - The high was $40.42 and a low of $18.07\n\nIn 2014 - The high was $8.73 and a low of $6.36\n\nIn 2020 - The high has been $5.14 with a low of $2.34. Every year since 2008, $NOK has finished down, an easy visual of an oversold asset. 2020 challenged the bottoms and created new lows, but not yet new highs. How do i know? because the green bar is MASSIVELY green for 2020. Something that has only happened two other times in the last decade...except we have already outpaced TOTAL 2019 volume. And. Are. Still Climbing. \n\n$NOK has been locking down 5G Contracts all over the WORLD. All of those shiny new Iphones hopping on 5G for the first time will be connecting with Nokia. No one gives a shit that Tim Apple Cuck was last, just that they are here, and ready for Becky to hop aboard her live streams of trailer bitches opening clams for pearls. \n\n[100 5G Deals - for Nokia and a shit ton of other cool stuff.](https://www.rcrwireless.com/20201005/5g/nokia-reaches-100-5g-deals-after-signing-17-new-agreements-in-q3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot only the public sector, Nokia has already gobbled up the enterprise market for 5G. Deploying private deliverable 5G networks to companies, governments, and anyone who wants to pony up the cheddar. NO ONE ELSE IS DOING THIS. \n\n[Enterprise and Laser Beams](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252490469/Nokia-claims-big-win-in-small-cells-for-Chunghwa-Telecom-5G-net)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5G is the beginning of a new era of tech monsters. You will see apps, games, and technologies be born out of it. 10 years from now, it will add $8 TRILLION dollars to the GDP. Who came up with those numbers? --- NO FUCKING KIA. \n\n[$$$$$$$$$$$$$$](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/11/2106580/0/en/Nokia-5G-set-to-add-8trn-to-global-GDP-by-2030.html)\n\nNokia wanting to snag some of those Covid dollars too with a new Mask/Temp technology they have been using in India. People will gobble this up. Guaranteed. \n\n[I always feel like, somebodies watching meeeeeee](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nokias-covid-detection-system-automatically-131047248.html)\n\nOh yeah, $NOK is also PRINTING MONEY all of 2020. They haven't been down in any category. Here's the shiny stuff. \n\n\\- Operating income is up 903% YoY. -- THATS A REAL NUMBER. OI was up 392% in Q2 alone. It's only been better. \n\n\\- Net Income - up 103% YoY. 144% in Q2 alone. That. Is. INSANE. \n\n\\- Cash Flow - Dolla Dolla Bills -- Up 2375%. Seems like bullshit? I agree -- Let's see how the fuck they got there...\n\nA company like Nokia has a huge operating expense within IT. Wipe that shit out of your overhead when you migrate to Google Cloud and all of a sudden you got money in the bank. \n\n[Google Cloud Fluff](https://siliconangle.com/2020/10/14/nokia-moving-infrastructure-google-cloud/)\n\nNot only that, Nokia's partnership with Equnix for IoT, Cloud, and digital ecosystems shows a massive cost savings. Nokia is more than capable of creating their own, but outsourcing will drive down their cost and immediately increase margins. \n\n[Equinix IoT Fluff](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equinix-collaborates-with-nokia-for-global-iot-platform-and-edge-enablement-301136419.html)\n\nThe new CEO started September 1st and said his primary goal was to go cash positive. He wanted to do it in an aggressive approach and it's clear it's already started. Not only that, he has hinted multiple times at bringing back the dividend if he is able to get cash positive...they are cash fucking positive folks. At $24 billion, they are worth the same in 2013. \n\n[Everyone knows Nokia is worth a hell of a lot more](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/nokia-stock-is-worth-60-more-in-a-takeover-deal/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you find any bearish articles on Nokia, share them here. When i looked for them it was shit saying Microsoft or someone would buy them out. Ok. Still bullish. Ericcson is their biggest competition right now and they hit 100 contracts in August. Meh. Nokia is here to stay and everyone knows that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarnings for July 31st saw Nokia tank even after a strong Q2 performance. Q3 will make Q2 look like a blip on the map for performance and investors will react positive into what is now a fairly secure stock. The bottom of $2.34 in March is weatherable for a generational boomer company like Nokia. The Finns aren't fuck ups. \n\nEarnings is on 10/22/2020 and there will not be any sort of runup. Nokia hit a $3.72 bottom in the September drop and traded at $4.00 all of last week with the shenanigans. If charts are your thing, it's making those long awaited cross deals, just as earnings rolls in this week. If you like volume, 17.5k shares separated $4.00 and $5.00 at close. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions are lotto tickets. You'll see that below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*And this is why I'm probably wrong. Nokia is a shit ass penny stock that doesn't fucking move. I'd be better off dishing out my pathetic $13,000 to you degenerates, but I want to try and be fucking rich. I smoke alot of weed, I got alot of feelings. I'm feeling pretty fucking straight on this one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSPY DONT FUCK ME. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Positions: Any call you possibly want on Nokia. On Monday morning at open, I will own everything on up to $7 and expiring 11/20 or sooner, including 10/23s. Below is what I bought on Friday. $4.50 10/23C were a a scratchers ticket at .02 a pop. $5.00 were even better at the golden $.01\n\n$4.0 10/23 .10\n\n4.5 10/23 .02\n\n5.0 10/30 .03\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlame away.",

I figured it would be good to consolidate together a bunch of the DD and points I've seen on this sub over the last month\n\nI understand the short squeeze theory: right now \\~106% of shares outstanding and more like \\~150% of the public float is shorted.\n\nFor a short squeeze, you need one of these things to happen:\n\n* A large shareholder rapidly buying shares and then saying they are not going to lend these shares out (see what happened with Porsche-Volkswagen in 2008)\n* Merger &amp; acquisition rumors / speculation\n* Change in long-term prospects of the business that fundamentally changes the thesis of everyone short\n* Catalyst for capitulation of the shorts (i.e. they realize they are wrong / are losing too much money in the short-term and close out positions)\n\nIn the case of GME:\n\n* Shorts have not started capitulating - the short interest chart above shows short interest as % of shares outstanding actually increasing over the past several months \n* The Microsoft news is a bit of non-news, but could also be a positive:\n   * The partnership does not appear to have any meaningful economics for GME\n   * However, the positive signaling is that why would Microsoft announce a long-term partnership with GME if they don't think it will be around for at least a couple more years\n   * Longer-term, if the partnership is valuable for Microsoft, there could be more meaningful support / economics provided to GME\n* Ryan Cohen (Chewy Co-Founder) has taken a big stake\n   * Helps remove a large % of shares out of the public float\n   * If he gets more involved, perhaps he has a vision for how to transform GME in a more digital videogame world - this would be a big catalyst\n* Michael Burry still owned a large chunk as of 6/30/2020 - will be interesting to see what his holdings look like on the next report date\n* Most importantly, the thesis of hedge funds that are short has not changed - the medium-term prospects of GME are bleak, especially after the initial wave of foot traffic from the console sales\n   * Mall traffic is down - COVID only accelerated the decline of malls\n   * GME's footprint of 5,500+ stores seems like its unsustainable in the long-run - question is can they trim the footprint fast enough to a smaller, more profitable footprint that they will be around in the long-run\n* The short squeeze feels like it will be a battle of who has more conviction and a longer time horizon - the hedge funds who are short or the WSB traders who are long\n   * I love all of you guys, but I don't have much faith in WSB having more conviction / longer investment horizon than hedge funds (and by longer I mean who is willing to hold their position for a year to see it play out)\n\nI do agree with the members on this sub that you can make money trading GME in the short-term, potentially seeing a rally up - but this is probably not going to be a LT winner\n\nPlease add anything you think I have missed or where you think I am wrong\n\nPosition: $6c 1/15/2021 since mid Sep (screenshot attached)",

        "selftext": "Note: saw I have a lot of messages yesterday on my old username, MiltDavis. This is where I've been posting now cuz mods, so message me here.\nI'm not an expert or anything, but I see a lot of people in the Daily Thread comments slanging VXX around, and a lot of weird information out there. Just trying to be helpful, so here ya go:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**The most basic thing to know is that VIX (so VXX and UVXY by extension) is a measurement of market volatility, not SPY performance.**\u00a0 Let's say you buy a bunch of AAPL options of one month expiry at an implied volatility (IV) of 50 and FB at an IV of 20, but you have them ending up the same percentage higher at the strike price of your one month expiry--let's say 5% higher.\u00a0 The logic is that, due to historical and current factors, AAPL is expected to bounce around in much higher and lower swings to reach that 5%--a wilder journey, but the same destination.\u00a0 The volatility of that journey is what VIX represents, on an extrapolated level, for SPY as a whole.\u00a0 Think of it like this--VIX is the measurement of IV for the market as a whole, rather than for an individual equity. Because of this...\n\n**VIX does not have to always directly inverse SPY, but instead just often does\u201480% of the time.** VIX can rise with SPY--or fall with SPY--it's just not as common as inversing SPY.\u00a0 It can also do it's own thing entirely.\u00a0 Certain sectors can be performing one way, and SPY another, and these performances factor into the underlying measurements to prevent a break with SPY due to weighting and a shitload of other factors.\u00a0 SPY can climb rapidly, and volatility can rise with it, because the sharp movement creates just as much variation chaos in the underlyings as a precipitous drop would.\n\n**VIX is represented as an annualized standard deviation number within SPY.**\u00a0 If VIX is 25, for example, it is estimating movement of 25% in price action in SPY over the course of the next year.\u00a0 It was above 50 during the March crash, which, when you think about it in those terms, is nuts.\n\n\u00a0 **VIX is a monthly price estimation based on SPY options premiums.**\u00a0 SPY trades on it's underlyings and is also tradeable in and of itself, whereas VIX is vessel for trading a bundle of spreads, for lack of a better term.\u00a0 This is a mathematical--even theoretical--estimate on future market movement based on how much premium people are willing to pay for S&amp;P options, or in other words, it is an estimate of market volatility based on how much money people are willing to pay for insurance on their stocks.\u00a0\u00a0Equity prices are ONLY as important here inasmuch as they effect the pricing of the equity options. The more people are willing to pay for options, the higher VIX goes.\n\n**VIX is NOT the in-the-moment measurement of the underlying SPY put/call option spread\u2014it is\u00a0forward looking to the monthy expiration**.\u00a0\u00a0In the case of VIX this is a minimum of 23 days and up to 37 days out, with weighting favored toward the one month expiration.\u00a0 The math is crazy and intricate, on some Rainman shit, but the important thing to know is that VIX isn't a prisoner of the moment, but instead a look at the coming one month landscape taking in all factors over that course in time.\n\n*Real life example*: Many people have been expecting VIX to be much higher as we head into an election, but if we think of it in forward-looking, weighted terms, this moment may have passed--at least as far as the election is concerned.\u00a0 VIX is taking into consideration, at the moment,\u00a0 the perceived calmer times beginning toward the end of November after the election.\u00a0 If you go back and look at VIX values about one month prior to the election date, you can see that VIX was at it's peak on October 5th and 6th, reaching appproximately $30.\u00a0 This would correlate with the expected movement weighted one month from that day, or in other words, peak fear a day or two after the election.\n\n**Volatility is volatile, and therefore not a buy and hold: **VIX associates VXX and UVXY are known for making people rich on days like June 11th, or in September, when they suddenly climb 10, 15, 20% in a single day or a two day stretch.\u00a0 Yes, this a large part of it's appeal.\u00a0 But the real reason people get rich is that VIX IV can climb high--fast--because it's price movements are not considered lasting and great fluctuation becomes priced in.\u00a0 IV shoots up on these things like crazy, which means that the value of your VIX options shoots up like crazy.\u00a0 BUT, value also falls like crazy too, and it has intense theta burn (cost appreciation of the asset over time). So, while you are sitting around waiting to make your million dollar play with a VXX monthly you are losing a lot of money in the process.\u00a0 The VIX knows this, and it smells your weakness, and the day after you've dumped it because you've bled 50% it will rocket to new heights.\u00a0 Because of this...\n\n**VIX, VXX, and UVXY are meant as loss strategies and hedges, but not as outright plays.**\u00a0 Unless you are some Burry level TA specialist, or maybe my guy /u/winnning007, and you can pinpoint when certain events are going to happen or the market response within a day or two, you're best to keep a smaller amount as a hedge rather than go all in.\u00a0 The road to bagholding is short and full of terrors with volatility plays. B**UY SPY PUTS INSTEAD IF YOU ARE BEARISH**\n\n**VIX VXX and UVXY\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-**\n\nSo all that is cool, but VIX is a futures instrument and not a daily tradeable ETF/ETN; *enter VXX and UVXY.*\u00a0 To keep it simple, I'm going to lump the two together and just say that UVXY is a more levered version of VXX.\u00a0 So UVXY can climb higher than VXX when it rises, and fall lower than VXX when it falls.\u00a0 For the purposes of this explanation, I'm going to focus on VXX, but bottom line--if you don't really know what you're doing/aren't confident in your volatility move, stick with VXX rather than UVXY.\u00a0 The money is still good, don't be a hero.\n\n**VXX tracks the performance of VIX, but offers different expirations **(weekly ETF settlement dates like Friday/Saturday rather than the Wednesday of monthly futures), and tracks it at about a 50% level.\u00a0 In other words, if the VIX monthly futures have an 8% jump, expect about 4% for VXX monthlies.\u00a0 VXX is also an ETN, not an ETF--this is important because it means that it must have a direct tracking of the VIX unlike a fund which isn't beholden to a certain rate of correlation.\u00a0 In other words, VXX MUST track that ~50% of the VIX for efficacy.\n\nWhat's important here: VIX is the futures estimate bundle, and VXX is not VIX, but it is a\u00a0very reliable tracker of VIX price movements with few notable exceptions.\u00a0 UVXY is kind of like a levered version of VXX, meant to track with higher returns. These two can and do at times move out of sync with VIX due to something called contango.\n\n*If you want to go in depth on the intricacies of their relationship and contango and shit, I won\u2019t do that here, but this is a good resource:* https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/news/2015/02/04/the-messy-relationship-between-vix-and-vxx\n\n**Manipulation**\n\nWhenever VXX doesn't move with SPY, I bitterly joke that it's illegal and manipulated.\u00a0 This wayward movement is actually more due to the natural variance I pointed out earlier, but there is some truth to it.\u00a0 CBOE--the VIX providers--have been sued a few times over the past few years due to alleged manipulation of VIX.\u00a0 Of note, the \"Father of VIX\" as one article called it's creator, was one of the whistleblowers alleging fraud.\u00a0 The case was recently thrown out again, but the accusations speak for themselves.\n\n&gt;\tThe plaintiffs, traders in VIX-based products, filed a lawsuit alleging that certain features of the settlement process made it especially susceptible to manipulation but that Cboe chose not to enforce its rules against manipulation so it could continue to profit from the VIX products. Specifically, the complaint alleged violations of the Exchange Act antifraud provisions and the CEA and brought claims against both Cboe and anonymous \"Doe\" defendants that allegedly manipulated the settlement values for VIX options and futures by manipulating the two-zero-bid rule and employing a process analogous to \"banging the close.\"\n\nSo, ya know, innocent until proven guilty, but there is a lot of info out there to suggest that a lot of people invested in--and involved in the creation of--VIX through CBOE think it's manipulated.\u00a0 That can't be ignored.\n\n**Other tidbits to note:**\nA lot of little things matter with VIX; Quad witching dates, portfolio rebalancing dates, Congressional hearings with the FED, release of beige books, stress tests, and FOMC are all catalysts for VXX/UVXY activity if you're searching for short dated FD plays.\u00a0 Just look at the financial calendar on the FED website or Marketwatch, etc., before you make any moves against volatility. You're one JPOW speech to congress away from the big GUH.\n\n**Positions**: This was meant to be informative more than predictive.\u00a0\n\nThat said, I don't have a phenomenal read on this market--I'm not a TA guy generally, and a lot of the fundamentals are out the window as we approach the election.\u00a0 BUT, I expect anticipation of lame-duck political activity should there be a Blue Wave, PLUS uncertainty around COVID second wave restriction regression, PLUS the unveiling of a variety of coming tax changes in a Biden win, will likely bring higher pricing in option premiums and thus higher VIX.\n\n**UVXY 11/6 20c VXX 10/30 24c VXX 11/6 26c**\n**Earnings I like: NTGR, NOW, PYPL, MSFT, CVNA**\n**General shit I like: LMND, JD, DDOG**\n\n**TLDR: VIX does not always move with SPY, it may be manipulated, it is not meant to be held long term, and is future looking not day-to-day.\u00a0 Trade it thinking of a bigger picture rather than expecting it to react to every daily market event. Never go all in on a monthly, you\u2019ll theta bleed.**\n\nYou can message me and comment and stuff and I\u2019ll get to it.\u00a0\n\nI AM NOT AN EXPERT.\u00a0 A lot of the technical terminology you can probably argue with. This is just my own research and experiences.\u00a0 Do your own research.",

Facebook, Skype, and others come to mind. Regardless, the strong reaction from Microsoft to Slack's rise and Google's interest indicate that Slack is onto something valuable. \n\nSlack can still screw up badly and it has a small window to reinforce its position or become another casualty of big tech.

We all get the WFH trend, but most retail traders don't get WORK because the value is in the enterprise space; they think it's just another conferencing tool.

        "selftext": "Microsoft \ufffc reports September quarter results on Tuesday afternoon, and the story should continue to be a positive one for the software giant.\n\nStreet consensus calls for revenue of $35.7. billion, up 8.2%, with profits of $1.54 a share. In the June quarter, Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) posted revenue of $38 billion, up 13% from the year-ago quarter, crushing the Street consensus at $36.4 billion. Profits were $1.46 a share, ahead of the Street estimate at $1.38.\n\nMicrosoft provides guidance by business segment. For the September quarter, the company projects revenue for Productivity and Business Processes of $11.65 billion to $11.9 billion; Intelligent Cloud revenue of $12.55 billion to $12.8 billion; and More Personal Computing segment revenue of $10.95 billion to $11.35 billion. The company also has said that September quarter results will include a noncash benefit of $900 million due to an adjustment in the useful life of some hardware.\n\nStifel analyst Brad Reback writes in a research note that the company is likely to beat his own forecast, which calls for $35.6 billion in revenue and profits of $1.53 a share.\n\n\u201cWe expect upside to Street EPS and revenue forecasts, as we believe Microsoft\u2019s various properties (Azure/Office365/PC) should continue to benefit from accelerated digital transformation due to the pandemic and a rebounding worldwide economy driving better-than-expected transactional revenue,\u201d Reback writes. \u201cWe expect the strong results to set the stage for a solid 3Q earnings season for the broader software group.\u201d\n\nReback also expects strong December quarter guidance, based on the same factors, plus Office 365 pricing and volume gains, Azure market share expansion, and the pending release of the new generation of Xbox consoles. \u201cGiven these dynamics and consistent capital return (&gt;$20 billion in annual buybacks and dividends), we remain buyers,\u201d he writes. Reback recently upped his target on the stock to $245, from $220.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives likewise sees a strong quarter for the company\u2019s Azure business. \u201cThis current work from home environment is further catalyzing more enterprises to make the strategic cloud shift with Microsoft across the board,\u201d he writes.\n\nAdds Ives: \u201cWe continue to believe Microsoft is the core cloud name to play this transformational secular trend as well as for the other side of this dark valley.\u201d He keeps his Outperform rating and $260 target price on Microsoft shares.\n\nCredit Suisse analyst Brad Zelnick, who has an Outperform rating on Microsoft shares, likewise expects a strong quarter, driven by Azure, Windows, and gaming. \u201cLeverage to strong secular trends places Microsoft in a select group of companies that can deliver strong top-line and EPS growth as massive scale amidst an uncertain backdrop,\u201d he writes. He keeps his $225 target price.\n\nSource: Barron's",

        "selftext": "I'm seeing far too many people here buying absolute garbage like Gamestop or QQQ (whatever tf that is). Even buying companies like TSLA or AAPL is stupid at this point. Every normie and their mother knows about these companies. They aren't really coming out with anything crazy that's going to revolutionize peoples lives. They have peaked, I am sorry. Yes they will continue to go up slowly and steadily, but if you think AAPL or MSFT is going to go up 1000% in the next few years, you're deluded. The big discovery boom for these companies is over. There are only a few companies at the moment that are working on things capable of generating worldwide hype, and Virgin Galactic is one of them. Do you R tards not understand the implications of their potential success? Even if it doesn't happen until the end of 2021, they are either going totally bust, or they are going to be sending celebrities, well known people with enormous platforms and spheres of influence into space. Either the stock is going to 0, or it's going up 1000%. I'd take that over maybe 50% on AAPL over the next year. Fuck supersonic travel, their satellite business, deals with NASA. Those are awesome side deals, but we all know stocks move big on hype, widespread media coverage, and the right people plugging it. Normies can't comprehend supersonic travel. It's just a string to them, a confusing science word. They aren't going to get excited like that. The big price pump is going to happen when the company does something that is sexy and easily digestible by the masses, such as sending Justin Bieber to fucking Space.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 15, 2020**\n\nStocks fell once again today for the third straight day of losses, as market participants consider a disappointing unemployment report, new virus-related restrictions in Europe, and dimming prospects for additional stimulus before the november election\n\nThe Nasdaq finished 0.67% down. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell a modest 0.11% and the Dow finished the day 0.04% down. Stocks were able to mostly recover from the deeply red open. \n\nThe Labor Department released their weekly unemployment, which showed that an additional 898,000 new claims were submitted last week, way above the consensus estimate of 830,000.  This is the highest number since Aug. 22 and another clear sign that the labor market continues to struggle to recover in this pandemic-riddled economy as cases rise and worries increase over a renewed wave in the fall and winter. The number represented a gain of 53,000 from the previous week\u2019s. The economy has recaptured some 11.4 million positions, or about half those who were sidelined. The unemployment rate has come down to 7.9% but is still more than double its pre-pandemic level.\n\nAfter Europe seemed to somewhat tame the virus that ravaged the countryside early in the year, the number of newly confirmed infections are skyrocketing, prompting fears of a second-wave and host of new restrictions. Socialising indoors will be banned in London, and a curfew will be imposed in nine French cities. Poland designated red zones where schools and gyms will close, including in the capital Warsaw, and the Czech Republic said it was building its first field hospital for coronavirus patients. Schools in Italy's southern Campania region, including the city of Naples, are to close for two weeks, as the country recorded its highest daily rise of cases since mass testing began. Coronavirus is the fifth-leading cause of death in Europe, where a threshold of 1,000 deaths daily has been passed, the WHO's European director, Dr Hans Kluge, told a news conference today. In the United States, new cases per day are on the rise in 44 states, with the biggest surges in the Midwest and Great Plains, where resistance to wearing masks and observing other social distancing practices has been running high. Deaths per day are climbing in 30 states, according to data collected from John Hopkins University.\n\nMarket participants continue to be fixated on whether more stimulus, which lawmakers and economists say is necessary, will be passed before the November election. Messaging from top officials regarding stimulus has been inconsistent, with Pres. Trump first said he was directing his representatives to halt negotiations before doing a 180[\u00b0](https://www.degreesymbol.net/#:~:text=Degree%20Symbol%20on%20Microsoft%20Windows,0176%20numbers%20of%20degree%20symbol.) turn. Yesterday, Mnuchin conceded that \u201cgetting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult, just given where we are in the level of details\u201d. Today, in response to being asked if he supported stimulus, Pres. Trump told Fox Business, \u201cI would. Absolutely I would. I would say more. I would go higher. Go big or go home, I said it yesterday.\u201d Needless to say the inconsistent messaging heightened volatility in the market as investors have a heightened sense of risk. Additional relief is viewed by many (including Jerome Powell) as a necessary propellant to maintain and speed up economic recovery. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* US regulators (FDA) approved yesterday afternoon the first treatment for Ebola Virus from Regeneron (REGN). This is the same company that made the treatment that President Trump received while being treated for COVID-19 about two weeks ago.\n* US jobless claims reached 898,000 which was higher than the estimates of 830,000.\n* Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PCG) has cut power to around 33,000 customers to mitigate risk of starting a wildfire citing dry and windy conditions renew threat of fires.\n* Boyd Gaming (BYD) had a price increase by Deutsche Bank from $27 to $38 at BUY. Big increase in analyst sentiment, the stock trended upward today.\n* Datadog (DDOG) had a price target raise from Mizuho from $116 to $125 at BUY. It opened low, but recovered throughout the day. Stock has been a monster lately. \n* Dell (DELL) had a price target raised by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) from $70 to $80 at OVERWEIGHT.\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) had price targets raised by Citigroup (C), and Barclays from $285 to $300 at BUY, and $253 to $270 at EQUAL WEIGHT, respectively. Stock faded towards the end of the day, nevertheless bullish analyst actions.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) had a price target raised by Mizuho from $240 to $255 at BUY. (looking at this one for a possible bounce tomorrow)\n* Netflix (NFLX) had a price target raise by KeyCorp from $590 to $634 at OVERWEIGHT\n* Service Now (NOW) had a price target raised by Mizuho from $500 to $560 at BUY. This is the third price boost this week, this stock is a monster!\n* Peloton (PTON) had a price target raised by BofA Securities (BAC) from $116 to $150 at BUY. stock is at All Time Highs today... insane, an absolute monster!\n* Replimune Group (REPL) had price target increase by BMO Capital, SVB Leerink, and Barclays from $40 to $51 at OUTPERFORM, $27 to $44 at OUTPERFORM, and $29 to $50 OVERWEIGHT, respectively. This thing is squeezing, up 60% in the last two days!\n* Take-Two (TTWO) had a price Target raise by Morgan Stanley from $176 to $185 at OVERWEIGHT\n* United Health (UNH) had a price target raise from Piper Sandler, Raymond James, SVB Leerink, Oppenheimer and Royal Bank of Canada. On average its a $380 price target at OUTPERFORM, this has been a monster stock!\n* Zoom Video Communications (ZM) had myriad of price target increases, including from Wells Fargo (WFC), Royal Bank of Canada, Piper Sandler, $375 to $465 EQUAL WEIGHT, $450 to $600 OUTPERFORM, and $411 to $501 NEUTRAL. Very bullish analyst action.\n* Morgan Stanley (MS) reported better-than-expected results in Q3 earnings. Stock was 1.26% up at the time of writing\n   * EPS of $1.59 vs $1.28 estimate \n   * Revenue of $11.6 billion vs $10.61 estimate\n* Charles Schwab (SCHW) reported slightly better-than-expected earnings. Stock outperformed the market, up 3.96% at the time of writing.\n   * EPS of $0.51 vs $0.47 estimate\n   * Revenue of $2.45 billion v $2.43 billion estimate\n* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) reported much better-than-expected earnings, especially in EPS. Stock was 0.9% down at the time of writing.\n   * EPS of $5.30 vs $0.92 estimate (wow!!!)\n   * Revenue of $356.43 billion vs $315.20 billion\n\n\u201cLife is not about finding yourself.

        "selftext": "This week, two things happened. Fastly down 30%+ after a revenue warning. And Zoom rose to a record after its Zoomtopia analyst event. The year of 2020 has once again amazed me. I guess I \u2018m getting old.\n\nFastly reports preliminary Q3 revenue 70-71 mil, which is 5.6% lower than estimated 74.7 mil (Bloomberg number). This 5.6% drop in revenue triggered a 31% selloff, but I was not surprised about that. I knew this would happen one day. As I quote a [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/fastly-plunge-is-reminder-of-valuation-excesses-in-software) \u201cFastly\u2019s slowdown highlights the precariousness of lofty software valuations. **Massive share plunges are the price paid when these businesses fall short of perfection**.\u201d Exactly, **a perfect dream is destined to end in our imperfect world**.\n\n**Even though the FSLY lesson has come out, investors are not learning anything at all.**\n\n# Zoomtopia\n\nZM\u2019s meteoric rise surprised me. Ahead of the Zoomtopia event, on Monday, ZM\u2019s price was 491.54. Today it traded at a high of 563, a 14%+ rise. So what happened on the Zoomtopia event that has caused such a ZM euphoria?\n\nZM announced a couple of new features. One is the \u201cOnZoom\u201d , which allow users to sell tickets for their Zoom calls, so they can teach classes, hold concerts etc. for a profit. Basically, ZM is moving into the paid live streaming business. The other new thing is \u201cZapps\u201d, apps that run inside Zoom. For example Slack, now you no longer need to open Slack in parallel to Zoom, you can simply use Slack inside Zoom (with reduced functionality). **So basically, this saves you a couple mouse clicks** when conferencing. These announcements are certainly positive. The company would do better with them than without. But just how much better? Just a reminder, no matter how fancy the new features are, if they don\u2019t help make money, they would not matter at all. So let\u2019s think about how much money will these new features help Zoom make.\n\n# Long $ZM has become a new pandemic\n\nOn Wednesday, I was watching the analyst\u2019s call, via the Zoom link they provided. There were quite several ass-kissing questions, like what is Zoom\u2019s culture, philosophy, futures of our world blah blah. One practical question finally appears, when an analyst asked about **how Zoom plans to monetize on the new OnZoom and Zapps feature**. And the CFO\u2019s answer was, \u201c**This is new. We are not sure. We are looking at it. We will probably find out in next several quarters**.\u201d FYI, **Zoom is not taking a cut from the ticket sales. (**[**https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360050178332#h\\_01EMH8B5ND84F6XSSTPVKY75E7**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360050178332#h_01EMH8B5ND84F6XSSTPVKY75E7)**)** There is no evidence Zoom will take a cut in the future. **There is no evidence Zoom will charge third-parties to develop Zapps either**.\n\nHmm, Ms. CFO, you are not telling us much, How much money on earth are your new features worth?\n\n**When the profitability is an uncertainty to the company\u2019s own insider CFO, it has not been an uncertainty to the financial analysts**. A slew of analysts upgraded their target prices. RBC upgraded from 450 to 600. D.A Davidson upgraded from 457 to 600. And **Berstein, they upgraded from 228 to 612, a stunning 383$ per share increase, or a 75 billion dollar increase in valuation** (ZM has about 200mil shares outstanding). Ok folks WOW. In a professional analyst's opinion, **An online ticketing feature, plus an app feature that pretty much only saves you a couple of mouse clicks, are worth 75 billion USD**. Hey, remember how much money Oracle offered to buy TikTok? 20 billion. This values TikTok at about $50b ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bytedance-tiktok-exclusive-idUSKCN24U1M9](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bytedance-tiktok-exclusive-idUSKCN24U1M9))  **One Zoomtopia event, just pumped ZM\u2019s valuation by 1.5x TikTok.**\n\nIf Ms. CFO does not tell us how much more money ZM expect to make. Let\u2019s make some comparisons with existing, well-established companies doing similar business. Paid online courses website Udemy, one of the biggest, is valued at 2 billion. ([https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/online-learning-marketplace-udemy-raises-50m-at-a-2b-valuation-from-japanese-publisher-benesse/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/online-learning-marketplace-udemy-raises-50m-at-a-2b-valuation-from-japanese-publisher-benesse/)) Popular streaming services like Twitch, is worth 15 billion. ([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/amazon-media-assets-worth-500-billion-almost-as-much-as-aws-needham.html#:\\~:text=To%20get%20to%20%24500%20billion,says%2C%20is%20worth%20%24127%20billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/amazon-media-assets-worth-500-billion-almost-as-much-as-aws-needham.html#:~:text=To%20get%20to%20%24500%20billion,says%2C%20is%20worth%20%24127%20billion)). How can a feature in its infancy, increase ZM's valuation by more than the total worth of huge established companies? **Zoom\u2019s uncertainty has become better than other company\u2019s reality.**\n\nIf you say these companies are not comparable to Zoom's new ticketing feature, I've got another example. Facebook added [ticketed live streaming feature](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/626637251511853?id=1123223941353904) on Aug 14 ([https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2020/08/facebook-adds-ticketed-live-streams-waives-all-fees.html](https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2020/08/facebook-adds-ticketed-live-streams-waives-all-fees.html)), **pretty much exactly what ZM is offering**, And last time I checked, FB has more users than ZM? FB stock dropped on Aug 14 and 15. So why should ZM rise 14%?\n\nThere are also more rational and skeptical analysts apart from the Bernstein dude. Credit Suisse\u2019s new target stands at 315$ and Morgan Stanley at 350$. (tbh, I have not even heard of Bernstein or DA Davidson before. Morgan and Credit Suisse of course everybody knows). **But nobody is mentioning these. That is what people want to believe. Zoom has become their religion.** From twitter to stocktwits. the story of \u201cZoom to the moon\u201d is getting infectious. **Long Zoom has become a new pandemic.**\n\n# Tesla is saving the earth. Is Zoom too?\n\nMy story is not over. The massive increase in ZM's valuation is not the only absurd thing here, its valuation before Zoomtopia, was already insanity. **Zoom\u2019s FORWARD P/E ratio is at 211.9** (Bloomberg EEO next 4 qtrs est), and trailing P/E ratio is 518.47. In case you do not know what forward P/E ratio means, it is the P/E ratio for the next 4 quarters based on earnings projections, so it has accounted for the benefit ZM received from the pandemic. **Wait a sec. Tesla\u2019s FORWARD P/E is only 160.58.** ZM\u2019s forward P/E is higher than Tesla? Our world is warming, is on fire, and EV is saving the earth by reducing fossile fuel consumption. **Is Zoom, a video conferencing company, going to save our planet too?** Plus, **Tesla\u2019s P/E is high because its growth is yet to be realized. EV sales are expected to explode over next few years. How is ZM's growth going to explode after the pandemic is over?**\n\nOr do you really believe in a permanent WFH world? Do you really believe in a world where everybody is at home, downtown area is empty, offices are all vacant? There are success stories in battling Covid, like China or Singapore, where most people are back in office already. Also today **Pfizer just announced today its vaccine may be put in use as early as late November (**[https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-could-apply-for-emergency-use-of-covid-19-vaccine-by-late-november-11602842906](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-could-apply-for-emergency-use-of-covid-19-vaccine-by-late-november-11602842906)) But apparently, **market thinks this has no impact on Zoom at all**. It\u2019s true that some big tech firms can afford to have employees work permanently from home. But many of them do not use Zoom. Microsoft and Google both use inhouse tools (Team and Duo) and ban Zoom. Even if they WFH forever, does it benefit ZM? Moreover, **customers with fewer than 10 employees represent 36% of ZM\u2019s Q2 revenue** (Goldman Sachs research). Even if tech WFH forever, do you think teams smaller than 10 will too? **How does ZM retain this 36% of earnings?**\n\n# ZM, the next FSLY?\n\nOne last note on the numbers. **Before FSLY\u2019s 30% tumble, its price to sales ratio was 35. Nasdaq index\u2019s  average P/S ratio is 5.1. ZM today is at 54.59** (Bloomberg BEST\\_PX\\_SALES\\_RATIO). ZM is going to report Q3 earnings on Dec 6. It\u2019s estimated EPS is 0.753, a 736.32% YOY growth. If similar to FSLY, its revenue misses by 5.6%, do we expect a 31% drop too?\n\nHere\u2019s my question to my dear r/stocks friends. **When people finally realize the future is not that rosy for ZM. How much is it going to tumble?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Position Disclosure: I'm short $ZM today at 560$)",

(Also Biotech, pharma companies working on vaccines and therapeutics) \n2. Even companies like PEIX(medicinal alcohol manufacturers) and similar ones. \n\nTech companies - names abound here\n\n1.

MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, QRVO, QCOM, APPS, the list goes on...\n\nGold - as a safe haven - given the vagaries of the market and its manic moods. \n\n1. Barrick gold(GOLD) and other miners\n\nHousing - there is a boom in housing (owing to low interest rates, probably?)\n\n1. BLD, BLDR, LGIH...\n\nAlternative energy\n\n1.

I am planning on buying 4 $190c 1/20/23 for MSFT and buying another $20k worth of MSFT on margin and planning to hold those for 5-6 years and use the profits from those 4 contracts to then purchase super long dated calls for another 2-3 years way in the money for lower risk. Do you guys think this is a good plan or what flaw should I be addressing in this plan? I am also planning on adding shares to diversify in ARK or AAPL or etc... with more money I get as time flies by but I am a huge believer in the multi-income stream MSFT and its company has in general so that is why I am feeling a good tendency to all in MSFT for now and any money I have will go towards diversification.",

        "selftext": "So this is what happened.  Some of you know my story about my diamond hands on GME **h0dl**ing over 46 thousand shares buying at the 10s and 11s level and was stuck in a rut. \n\nOctober 9, I was down about -**90k** because GME was trading in the low 9s before the MSFT announcement.  After the announcement, when GME traded at high $14s, I was up from $430s to $600k in my whole account at around 11 AM 10/9/2020 because I was sitting diamond hands with 46k shares... LUCKILY, I rolled down my calls from 15 to 12.5s and 13s to capture intrinsic value and hope to end the week flat.   I went to work.  \n\n**WTF...GME was like a shit show dropping from $14s to low $13s...** calls were wasted and I was partially hedged, which was somewhat good.  At least it was above my strikes expecting to get called away over the weekend. So, I didn't do anything.\n\nAbout 2:15-2:45 PM, mid-call with an old customer, literally watched my GME drop from the 13s all the way down to the low $12s (**dumping was really fast if you looked at the chart**), costing me about **-40k** plus of my potential gains.  (not allowed to trade while talking to clients\\*\\*\\*)\n\nThis old yeller was literally bitching for almost 30 minutes about how company procedure sucks, and how we were giving him a massive burden because we couldn't authenticate his outdated/missing credentials.  He kept repeating himself yada yada yada.  And I was stuck watching my trade screen forking tens of thousands in less than an hour.   **I WAS VENTING ON THE INSIDES and was in a rush TO TAKE ACTION BUT he kept me on the phone.  Can't abruptly hang up the call on him either.**  \n\n**THIS GUY COST ME A WHOLE SALARY in less than HOUR.** \n\nIt was 2:50PM or so when I was done with this guy.  Closed more than 80% of my positions (I had very complex trades, so they take time to set up) closing short calls/short puts/long stock...my account dropped from 600s to 560s in less than 1 hour because I couldn't take proper action.  By instinct, I quickly reduced the risk to end the weekend...**I am still not flat with 7k shares at risk due to covered calls (they don't reduce risk when stocks are plummeting fast...)**   Hopefully, Monday wouldn't be another shitshow.\n\nMy trade would have been up about $130k from Oct 9 to Oct 10, but failure to take proper action only allowed me to realize about **$90k in realized profits in one day's time.**\n\nFor your knowledge, it's not only painful to lose your principal, it's just as painful lose your gains, and it's even more painful to NOT be able to do anything when know you needed to take action.  This is a costly learning experience.\n\nHave a nice weekend.",

        "selftext": "It was several years ago I first encountered wall steeet bets. At the time I was a high school student, and interested in stocks. I was too young to remember the crash of 08, and in my life, STONKS only went up. After saving up a few hundred dollars, I opened a Robinhood account and bought my first stock: Amazon at $274.76. Every morning I would check the ticker and be satisfied with my modest gains. After lurking around WSB for several more months, I became desensitized to the consistent yet small green increases in my portfolio. I decided to sell my stock, and after taking the advice of a user by the name of Jarek, I bought my first option: MSFT $200. Several days later I lost everything. I vowed to never trade again. \n\nYears later, I graduated high school and entered a top tier university. I joined a fraternity, where all my friends traded stocks. I realized that the only way to be cool like them was to trade. My parents have me $1000 allowance a month, and I decided to be smart and invest the money. I began with SPY, AAPL, and NIKE calls, and started earning enough to pay my tuition. I was fortunate enough to intern in the TMT group at Goldman Sachs. But the money I was making there paled in comparison to the money I had made on SPY calls. \n\nIn January, I made the toughest decision of my life, and decided to turn down my return offer from Goldman, as well as offers from McKinsey and DE Shaw. I was going to start my investing career on my own. With my money, I opened a small hedge fund, and received investments from many of my friends and their families. In February of 2020, I entered my first position l: SPY 400 for the end of March. My models were perfect, nothing could go wrong. \n\nThen the pandemic hit, and wiped my clean. I was forced out of my own home, and several people claimed that if they ever saw me again, they\u2019d end my life. I moved to an inconspicuous town in Peru, where I want $15 a day. It\u2019s not much but it\u2019s enough. I vow to never return to Robinhood again.",

        "selftext": "So all you retards think the stock market is overvalued? It must be because a share of AMZN costs $3.500 and almost 30x as much as as AAPL\u2018s $125?\nLet\u2019s be honest. Covid is hard to digest as an Investor. But is the stock market overvalued? No way. And I\u2019ll tell you why. The best reason for that is actually that Main Street is suffering.\nLet\u2019s take a look\n- your local grocery store shut down due to COVID or has less traffic? Guess what, it\u2019s good for the stock market.\n- You haven\u2019t spent a single penny at a mall or fashion store since February? It\u2019s good for the stock market.\n- You cannot comfortably go to this tasty and local burger restaurant? Again, good for the stock market.\n\nI\u2018m making an argument for Cramer\u2018s thesis. As much as he is talking bs, he\u2018s right there. Main Street is suffering, Wall Street is flourishing.\n- Everybody buys their groceries at WMT or TGT or even gets them delivered by AMZN\n- Everybody orders stuff online, may it be necessities, may it be clothes, may it be furnitures etc\n- Everybody stops by a MCD or Wendy\u2018s via drive through and enjoys their junk food.\n\nThe small corporations and one man shows aren\u2019t traded publicly. Their stock price would suffer if they were. But they aren\u2019t. Instead Wall Street mega corps are taking away market share from them. So right now SPY is barely 10% higher than pre-COVID? I think that\u2019s not enough, it should be up further considering this effect.\nNASDAQ is undervalued even more, considering that not only they eat up small corporation market share but also the COVID environment shifter behavior across the entire board, may it be \n- cloud infrastructure (SNOW, MSFT, AMZN, CRM, remote work requires more cloud)\n- may it be online shopping (ETSY, AMZN, SHOP for obvious reasons), \n- may it be real estate (Z, EXPI, yes even real estate becomes digital, just look at Zillow and exp world holdings),\n- may it be digital advertising (FB, GOOG, physical advertising returns less for the advertiser due to less traffic in the cities etc).\n\nThe only companies that won\u2019t be affected particularly positive by Covid are industrials, materials and energy, because there are less or no small corps on Main Street that can stripped of market share.\n\nTl;dr: Yes Covid is fuk, but it\u2019s a blessing in disguise for Wall Street and a double blessing for tech behemoths like the FAGMANs of this world.",

        "selftext": "Obviously value stocks haven\u2019t performed this year, that\u2019s why they\u2019re value stocks, no? I think people look at 2020\u2019s best growth stocks and see the excellent performance in a short period of time and automatically assume that value investing is dead. What they seem to forget is that a lot of the popular stocks now would have been fairly considered \u201cvalue stocks\u201d not even a couple years ago. For example AAPL had a PE of 12 in December 2018. In the early and mid 2010\u2019s people were already dismissing Apple and looking elsewhere for opportunities. But the funny thing is is that AAPL was a \u201cvalue stock\u201d not even a couple years ago, so how can people reasonably say that value investing died? Isn\u2019t AAPL a classic example of how value investing can win in the end? \n\nI know PE isn\u2019t everything but it\u2019s a solid tool to use. Here\u2019s some more, MSFT was 100% a value stock until Nadella came in a few years ago and the stock skyrocketed. It had PEs around 10 in 2013 and 2016. People looked at MSFT the same way people look at CSCO or INTC today. \n\nI think my point is that people say value investing is dead, but the biggest winners of the last few years were \u201cvalue stocks\u201d that ended up breaking out of their undervalued state and dominating the market. I know AAPL and MSFT are obvious example now but 5,10 years ago they weren\u2019t. \n\nThoughts? I could be dead wrong for all I know, and I know that Apple and Microsoft weren\u2019t unpopular stocks at all in that time period, but they weren\u2019t the hottest. XOM and GE and IBM were all the hottest stocks at one time too.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: GME calls -short/med term cause retards.  \nGME puts- long term, cause blockbuster. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was getting ready to blow my load on some GME calls this morning at market open, because you turds had me sold.\n\n\\-Short Squeeze  \n\\-Epic Microsoft Deal  \n\\-Turn Around King CEO\n\nBut, I thought to my self... did BlockBuster, ever turn it around? They laughed in the face of change, what makes you Daivey1, think that GME is different? You know, people don't change, why would companies? \n\nSo, I decided to pull up the 10-Q and take a look at the Q2 report (August 3rd, if anyone even read it.) LOL, if anyone looked at their 10-Q, I love how their management team tried to hide the fact that their **sales were DOWN 26.7% from same quarter last year.** \n\nAt the top of their 10-Q, they parade the fact that their eCommerce was up 800% and, costs were down biggly, BUT, of course, the important news -SALES- that part does not get nice Big Burly Bold Font... Nope, that gets the usual size 12, Arial font, to help it blend in with the rest of the shit 10-Q.\n\nAs I am perusing this fine specimen of a 10-Q, I take a look at the sales mix. \n\n**Last year in august, for 26 week ended GME sold $1.2 billion in consoles and $1.3 billion in software.**\n\n**This year in august, for 25 week ended GME sold $955 million in consoles and $803 million in software.**\n\nOh, shit, their sob story goes on about how \"well 2020, is the end of the console cycle, blah blah blah\".\n\nHow, the fuck, during COVID, do your software sales go DOWN. I will give them a BREAK on console sales (*EVEN though, back in March-April-May-June-July, YOU Couldn't find a used X-box, Nintendo, PS to save your life, and GameStop had new consoles in stock!).*\n\nLike legit, every software sales company in the world has GONE UP during covid \"stay home stocks\".\n\n***But, but, but, but, THE MICROSOFT DEAL is a FREE LUNCH!***\n\nThat's a good joke. I thought about it for a while. Someone in another thread posted about how Microsoft will pay them $1.50 commission on GamePass sold per month, and it equates to something like $180 million in easy profit over the next few years...\n\nUmm, do you yall realize that in order to earn a commission, you need to sell something first, right? How does GME plan to do that, when they can't even sell one of the hottest commodities during COVID? \n\nAnd even if the Microsoft deal is as lucrative as thought and they keep chugging at their CURRENT sales volume, the Microsoft deal doesn't even cover the difference between the lost sales between 2020 and 2019..... \n\nBut Ok, the 2nd Q is during the summer... Not notorious for video gaming. It's X-Mas that counts, Right? \n\nThink about this, if summer sales were 26% higher LAST YEAR, wtf is Christmas going to look like this year? Specially if that Stimulus doesn't pass and with unemployment edging higher? \n\nThe incentive to buy from GME, when Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart offer the same product and likely more trusted from an adult perspective.... \n\nbut hey... this is WSB.

        "selftext": "Sup bitches,\n\nGot some interesting info for yall asses.  I have a friend who works in cyber security and is into gaming, and he hit me up today with some interesting dd.  I dont know shit about this stuff but this is basically his word so take this info for what its worth.\n\nBasically AMD just announced its going to be coming out with new gpu that, in his words, is either matching or beating  NVIDEA with less power and for cheaper.  This is huge news because up until now NVIDEA has apparently dominated this space.  He states \"NVIDIAs top GPU the RTX 3090 sells for $1,499.99 and draws 350W and its one of the largest GPUs ever in terms of physical size. AMD took some shots. They released the RX 6900XT for $999.99 only draws 300W and it's the same size as your average GPU.  The only thing the 3090 has is more memory 24Gb vs 16GB but honestly that shouldn't matter.\"  He further states \"They should be getting a lot of sales on both cpu and GPUs because they also made this technology that when you pair one of their cpu with one of their GPUs you automatically unlock this feature NVIDIA and intel cannot provide.  Same feature that's going to allow the new consoles to load games so quickly and just boost the performance.\"  He finishes \"Streams of revenue PS5, XboxseriesX, CPUs (consumer laptops/desktops, high end gaming/workstations, servers google + Microsoft deals) and now GPUs.\"\n\nSo what does all this mean?  Honestly I donno and most of you are too retarded to understand this info let alone read but maybe theres atleast one of you out there autistic enough to find this info suitable, or at the very least school me on this stuff.\n\nTLDR:   buy long dated AMD calls I guess.....",

        "selftext": "Swaggy is back with some unusual options activity that was spotted last week. We\u2019ll be looking into some of the plays that happened and what the player is expecting.\n\nI get a lot of DMs asking about the activity, so if you want to read a bit about option flow, I made [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) describing how it works.\n\nIn addition, if you would like to check out the option flow tool and scan for yourself, here is the [option flow tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow).\n\n**DDOG**\n\nDDOG was fairly active last week after the stock jumped 15% on the news of a deal with MSFT. One would assume the MSFT deal will be huge in terms of size and might attract more clients for DDOG. Most of the flow was pretty short-term (2-3 weeks) expecting the stock to continue it\u2019s upward momentum. October 16 and November 20 were the common expiration dates with most plays being out-the-money.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sv5xkvo0x2r51.png?width=1818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f06eefe8c8acb35a922692ce4edac2a282f6e090\n\n**PINS**\n\nPINS saw some BIG buyers on Thursday as players expect the stock to perform well in the short-term. Players were buying strikes all across the board with each position being in the range of 3,000-7,000 contracts a piece. The largest positions were $4-5 million. Pretty heavy bullish flow, will definitely add this ticker in my stocks to watch this week. PINS will be reporting earnings toward the end of the month of October.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ajnsej1x2r51.png?width=1816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51f7b43da477b2ac35ab63fcb34e417e3a289113\n\n**SFIX**\n\nSFIX the e-commerce fashion brand with a subscription model for receiving fitted clothes. A stock with generally low volume in option flow saw some huge buys coming in. Biggest positions were for the December 2020 expiration, long calls and put-selling makes it for some heavily bullish sentiment. SFIX is set to report earnings 1 week before these options expire, so IV will be relatively high for that expiration date. If you go 2 weeks earlier you will be able to find \u201ccheaper\u201d options that don\u2019t include the earnings report.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6lrhu22x2r51.png?width=1818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87ffcb60be074a1f7d65db6aeaa1e069c121a987\n\n**ZNGA**\n\nZNGA saw a few big plays roll thru on Friday an hour before close. Option flow sentiment this week has been higher than normal and quite bullish. Some of the bigger plays were for over 10k contracts a piece, call-buying AND put-selling. ZNGA reports at the end of October.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sex9xd34x2r51.png?width=1818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdca52e7e0ac9f3b0517e681d84fa86b25dd1311\n\n**MAC**\n\nMacerich Company (MAC) was another name with some bullish option flow. The stock has been on a steady downtrend over the last 3 months dropping to a low in the $6.75 range. Thursday around the time the stock started to show some strength a big purchase of 3,200 calls came through for March 2021 expiration. I like these longer-term plays when I see them because it gives the player a bit more time for everything to turn out how they expect. MAC continued to rally up 6% on Friday, so the player has already earned a decent amount so far.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yec0dnp4x2r51.png?width=1822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5294a7cdba244fd04770e6926185cd63c2a2ba14\n\n**VNQ**\n\nVanguard Real Estate (VNQ) had some players buying the dip over the last week when the stock dropped to $76 range. Looks like most action was put-selling expecting the the stock to get back above $80-81 in the next month or two. Since the action already happened the stock is up 10% and already trading at $81. Have we missed the boat on this one? Maybe, but interesting to see how these \u201cbig\u201d plays end up working out more often than not.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dm0vii55x2r51.png?width=1824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea339c8da7cdfacd333bdaa1ea949acc10bd5034\n\n**CNP**\n\nI saved the most unusual for last, CenterPoint Energy (CNP). A player opened a SHORT STRANGLE where they SOLD both a call and put position. They sold the $20.5 strike calls, as well as sold the $19 strike puts to collect a total premium of $700k. This strategy is a THETA play where they expect little movement in the stock price until expiration in 4 weeks time. In theory if the player realizes max profit he will have made $35k per day that the market was open (from the time position was opened to option expiration).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x48vixs5x2r51.png?width=1820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa3e677afec8f5d92349326b769f5e073fce218b",

        "selftext": "Okay so its Friday and your account is red because you're a retard that keeps buying calls on overpriced megacap tech. Listen up cuckboy tech is good, megacap is bad. We're going into another wave, and tech is going to continue to moon. As institutional investors pull money from these megacaps to further diversify into small cap tech, you'll keep getting fucked by red dildos. Now the good thing is that even though we're retards, we're not boomers. There's still hope for you to get your wife back. First DD so excuse shit grammar and formatting, I'm a retard.\n\n1. LOGI - On recent quarterly report 10/20/20 showed sales rocketed 75% boost. Siting keyboards and combo products climbed 44% and 26% sales growth respectively. Which caused the stock to roar 16% representing about a 1.3b market cap increase. \n\n2. Analysts - Goldman Sachs has it as a buy with a target of 32. And all these other shit boomer banks have it at $24 with a buy rating. They all see the same shit you would see if you just stopped being such an autist. The future is stay at home work, E sports, gaming and streaming. WHICH IS WHAT CRSR FOCUSES ON AND DOMINATES. Which brings me to my next point.\n\n3. Gaming, Esports and Streaming - This year is the console wars, with people saying that this technological leap will be the first of its time. Where Consoles are going to dick pcs for the first time. You already see Microsoft dumping cold hard cash on trying to finally have an exclusive library again besides HaLo and buying out Bethesda for an extreme premium. Wake up people, as newcomers enter the gaming world and OG's look to upgrade their accessories, CRSR will be in the position to ride the wave. \n\n4. Market Float &amp; IPOs - The reason why some fucktards got burned on these recent IPOs is because they don't realize how float can shit on the price of a stock. Usually when these IPOs come out, its a bait for retail investors to gobble up the market shares. While the institutions dump those same stocks on your head. Their float is sitting at 6% while other IPOs like RKT that loves to be pumped here, have a float of 23%.\n\n5. Market Cap - Logitech sitting at 22.31b and CRSR is sitting at 2.3b, what does this mean? In a recent interview the CEO mentioned how they've noticed a strong trend of why and when new customers enter their market/gaming world. When a good game comes out, when new hardware gets released, and when they stay home/work from home. Guess what retards - all 3 are relevant. Huge growth numbers are coming, the same way they crushed their first quarter, they'll crush it again this one. And because the market cap is 2.3b, there's not a ton of float, and institutional investors are interested it means that little Itty bitty 25/share will explode with so much room to run. \n\n6. Esports, AMD &amp; NVIDIA and PC building-  This year we have new releases in the graphics card that are so ridiculously superior from the last model, people are buying them at 10x 15x price on 3rd party sell websites like eBay. The demand for these are through the roof and its safe to assume that people will upgrade and future proof their system with ram cards, coolers and other essential parts that CRSR sells. They'll also pick up new peripherals and add streaming gear as the new streaming trend continues to show good signs. \n\n7. Strong Price Support &amp; How to play - Lets look at the TeChNiCaLs and no Stonks only go up bullshit. Have you looked at the nasdaq, I thought I was fucking colorblind and only saw red until I took my eyes off of that hot garbage. This one tends to run up premarket and aftermarket a good sign of big boys playing. But it also means the buying opportunity for us little guppies is mid day when there's a dip or small pullback. What I love about this movement is, you'll get a 5-10% rally in the premarket but only cool down 2-3%. And then it'll trade sideways as every drop gets caught. On every nasdaq red day, crsr has been as green as the cash in my account. The strength of this stock reminds me of your wife's boyfriend. I posted about it yday but I'll say it again, on red days, look for the green retard strength stocks.\n\nI'm pretty sure at this point your little brains are about to have an aneurysm so I'll save you the trouble. Don't be a beta bitch and finally make some money. CRSR is in a great position, at a great entry point, and has a lot more room to grow. \n\nPositions: CRSR $30 11/30",

        "selftext": " \n\n**Introduction:**\n\nBlink Charging owns, operates, and provides electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and networked EV charging services primarily in the United States.   It also provides the \"Blink Network\", a cloud that  tracks charging stations and the associated charging data. This data provides property owners, managers, and parking companies remote monitoring and management of EV charging stations and payment processing. Additionally it provides drivers with station information, info such as location, availability, and applicable fees.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Current setup:**\n\nAs of December 2019 it has approx. 14,700+ EV charging stations across the US East Coast, West Coast, and locations in the Mid-West. Additionally they are expanding into Europe and the Middle East. (Can't attach the map because rules)\n\nThe following types of locations currently have stations (It is pretty much where you'd expect):  airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medicals, hotels, municipal locations, residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Predictions:** \n\nEV charging industry is projected to be a $112 billion industry by 2027.  The growing demand and sentiment for electric vehicles is a major factor responsible for aggressive growth. Additionally expansion of this industry will increase rapidly as more world governments move towards becoming carbon-neutral status the next few decades. \n\n*  In 2018 US EV sales were up 81% from 2017\n*  In 2018 global EV sales totaled 2.1 million, up 64% from 2017\n* There are currently more than 1.2 million electric vehicles in the U.S.\n* The global EV market is expected to grow at a 25.6% CAGR from 2019-2026 and is forecasted to reach over $567B by 2026\n*  By 2025 EV sales are projected to account for 30% of all global vehicle sales \n*  By 2030, the US is estimated to need 13 million charging stations \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Recent Developments for Blink:**\n\n* Agreement with Cushman &amp; Wakefield for Deployment of EV Charging Stations \n* Agreement with InterEnergy for the purchase of $1.2 million of Blink EV charging equipment to be deployed in the Dominican Republic\n* Co-recipient of a $900,000 grant from the BIRD energy program for the development of a DC fast-charging solution\n* Reached more than 23,000 deployments of EV charging stations at multiple living complexes and offices\n* Migrated the Blink Network to Microsoft Azure to optimize performance, operability and driver experience and prepare for future expansion\n* Expansion into Greece with Eunice Energy joint venture, deploying 40+ ports \n*  Blink enhanced its software to work seamlessly with Google Maps \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA more recent agreement with SG Blocks (NASDAQ: SGBX) aims to deploy a rapid and cost-effective innovative EV charging containers designed to provide off-grid charging solutions through a combined solar and battery components in multiple capacities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Competitors:**\n\nChargepoint (their main competitor, they are not publically traded) - focused on manufacturing and selling hardware (SemaConnect is another competitor we could lump here)\n\nEVgo, Electrify America - DCFC (Direct-current fast charger) charging solutions that are mainly beneficial for long road trips\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Blink Charging claims to stand out from their competitors claiming: \"We are the only company in the U.S. that can provide a full package of EV charging solutions under one roof, from start to finish!\"** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Prices &amp; Market Cap:**\n\n52 Week Range $1.25\u2014$14.58 \n\nMarket Cap $310M \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Takeaway &amp; Final Thoughts:**\n\nInterest and sentiment towards Electric Vehicles has been booming and the EV charging industry is poised to grow along side them. Like many of the companies that produce electric cars, EV charging is not the most profitable right now, however, having the infrastructure in place sets Blink and Chargepoint in excellent positions to capitalize in this upcoming market. Additionally there is the possibility of future government subsidies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you to all that have read this. This is not all inclusive so please please do your own research to supplement, especially since I did not talk in depth about the company financials, and since there are many competitors in this emerging market. Additionally thank you to everyone that provided constructive comments to the AMC vs Cinemark post. I hope everyone has a good day.",

The likes of GameStop, EB Games and Game not only face the competence of online distribution but also from online shops that do not have to pay for the rent of a fancy store in a mall or at street level.\n\nOn the opposite side, platform owners are profiting more than ever from a model that reduce publishing costs and increase their revenue share. It's in their hands to flip the coin, and Microsoft just showed the way.\n\nMicrosoft and GameStop closed a historic deal that let the retailer participate in the digital market from every Xbox console sold at GameStop stores. This is part of a [multi year deal agreement by both companies](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft) signed a few days ago, but it wasn't until Wednesday when people realised the implications.\n\n[Domo Capital Management](https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1316173476777136128), a small stockowner of GameStop, put some light about it in a tweet:\n\n*Today $GME confirmed with* u/DOMOCAPITAL *that the agreement with $MSFT includes revenue sharing on all downstream revenue (i.e. digital downloads and digital content) from any device that GameStop brings into the* u/Xbox *ecosystem.

All now offer ways for people to play visually complex console and\u00a0PC games\u00a0over the internet, using technology similar to how Netflix streams movies. While most companies are focused on the top-tier games like Take-Two's action game\u00a0Grand Theft Auto V\u00a0or Ubisoft's upcoming\u00a0Assassin's Creed Valhalla\u00a0historical fiction title, Facebook says it's going to focus on mobile games instead.\nFacebook's new service, which is part of its Facebook\u00a0Gaming\u00a0project, will offer people access to smartphone games like Gameloft's\u00a0Asphalt 9: Legends\u00a0racing title\u00a0without the need to download or install an app. Instead, Facebook said people can play these games on a computer through its Facebook Gaming website or through its Facebook app on devices powered by Google's Android \n\n\nhttps://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/facebooks-new-mobile-gaming-service-says-no-to-iphone/",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow degenerates,\n\nPicked the perfect time to start trading options as you can see. Had no idea what I was doing and bought FD calls on MSFT right before the crash. Didn't lose that much, but it resulted in a slew of reckless bets and losing just about everything.\n\n[\\~2\\/20-now](https://preview.redd.it/6wah37j45yq51.png?width=696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed6d8701d5530b89f9b7df9259815e1ffee4ef86)\n\nI've got about 1k left in the ol robinhood portfolio, and yesterday I was setting some limit orders to see if I could pick up ITM calls on companies announcing earnings later in october. \n\nI have done this for the past few days and didn't get anything, so I decided to push my luck and raise my normal bid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3gfc4j8m6yq51.png?width=281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20818455dae426e62a655434ef7beed9bef2aab5\n\nNot much to my surprise, pharma took a nice dump right before close and I got burdened with these two. With my wallstreetbets experience I will probably lose everything, but hey it's not the first loss and it sure won't be the last.",
