Wood\u2019s main exchange-traded fund, which trades under ticker ARKK, is down more than 12% this week, on pace of its worst week since February. Ark Innovation is down 6% on Friday. The painful losses have left all but 2 of Wood\u2019s constituents more than 20% off their recent high, meaning they are in a bear market. Just Trimble and Tesla are less than 20% from their high, but the pair are both more than 10% from their 52-week records. Berkeley Lights, Proto Labs and Skillz are all more than 80% below their 52-week highs.\n\nWood spoke to CNBC this week and kept her conviction in Ark\u2019s strategies, which focus on \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d in five digital plaforms: DNA sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Wood said her strategies are set to quadruple over the next five years, after their underperformance this year. The portfolio manager expects the next few years to bring the \u201cmost spectacular period for innovation that we have ever seen,\u201d said Wood.",

        "selftext": "Does anyone else think Western Unions sell off is an over reaction? WU seems extremely undervalued. I believe it should be trading 30%+ higher than current price. \n\nWestern union dividend yield is over 5% and trades at a historically low PE and PFCF. \n\nWhile there\u2019s 0 revenue growth they are a cash flow machine and buy back an insane amount of shares. They have $500M left in buy back before YE if they choose to use. This is approx. 8% of the company. Many are scared they are a dying company but I do not think so. They just agreed to sell off a small part of their business for $900M cash. That\u2019s a lot of cash for western to give back to share holders. Also, I think concerns from fin tech is overrated. WU has been able to hold revenue steady for 10 years. If they continue buying back large portions of the company and holding revenue flat they will be fine. \n\nI\u2019m long WU until they recover back to mid $20s~. I don\u2019t want to hold them long term as they aren\u2019t a high enough growth company but they are undervalued at current prices.",
