How does this happen? Shares can be borrowed, sold, then borrowed from the buyer (making two people technically borrowing the same 1 share). This is insane and has never happened before without causing a short squeeze. (look up volkswagen short squeeze chart to see what it looks like when short interest exceeds 100%). \n\n[https:\\/\\/finance.yahoo.com\\/quote\\/GME\\/key-statistics?p=GME](https://preview.redd.it/n8sr8ifnww161.png?width=840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3f3ef131a7d5bdee19acd4c6bd8196fad9c66aa)\n\nSo if gamestop stock goes up, the shorts will have to cover, which is literally impossible since theyve shorted over 100% of shares, so the price will be driven to an absolute retard height. But, whats gonna make gamestop go up? how are the shorts wrong?\n\n**Consoles**\n\nWell, the obvious is console sales, but thats not really it. Yes, the consoles will help, however more importantly there are key indicators that gamestop is not going bankrupt. Recently, they just paid off a metric fuckton of debt *voluntarily* which means they have the cash to do that, aka not bankrupt. People are literally camping out at gamestop for consoles. They will not struggle.\n\n**Cohen**\n\nAlso, they are getting the help from ryan cohen, who successfully competed with amazon by launching an online pet store called Chewy, which made him a billionaire. This is good news for gamestop because he will help pivot them from brick and mortar towards a more digital world, which means gamestop now has realistic growth prospects. Also, there is rumors that cohen will announce a tender offer, which would immediately trigger a short squeeze, end of story. Cohen has openly critiqued the BoD about their '20th century mindset' so it is likely he is going to take over soon. \n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Also, massive completely random spikes in volume off seemingly no news indicate that cohen is buying up shares. ](https://preview.redd.it/e19xcu0qxw161.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81f7c9aeb4df33cc2d416f7fda3b2e8ee257cc43)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positioning**\n\nThey have also positioned themselves to benefit from non traditional 'brick and mortar' revenue streams. Another thing that gamestop has is online revenue sharing with sony, which means they will be benefiting from digital game sales. They also just announced that they would be selling TVs on their website, showing that they are positioning themselves to compete as an online retailer. \n\n[https:\\/\\/www.theverge.com\\/2020\\/10\\/15\\/21517970\\/gamestop-revenue-sharing-microsoft-xbox-digital-downloads-games](https://preview.redd.it/cijd0o25xw161.png?width=1518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=310955852b0224bfff2fc36825d50a741475f46c)\n\n[https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/](https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/)\n\n\\^Link about TVs. \n\n**The move:**\n\nBuy as many shares as you can and hold. Set a limit sell on all your shares for at least $500, to make sure that you dont miss the squeeze. That alone would be a 3,233% gain.  \n\nImportant note: This quarters earnings will likely not be a catalyst for a short squeeze. It is likely that there will be a run up and then small dump after. Remember, the shorts are working hard to fuck over longs. Dont be a retard and fall for it. Buy up the dips. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: BUY GAMESTOP SHARES, HOLD WITH A LIMIT SELL OF AT LEAST $500/share**",

        "selftext": "Fellow Betters, if you understand options, move on.\n\nFirst, proud of this community and all the giving it did yesterday.  Truly phenomenal.\n\nI've noticed a lot of people on this sub legitimately don't know what options are or what they do.  This is incredibly concerning, how are we going to get to the moon if we don't know how to build a rocket.  As such, I've decided to write a quick reference options guide to help some of the newer, younger, or less experienced traders as a Christmas present to the sub. If you know what options are, move on.  I'm going to try and make this as short and sweet as possible.  A reference guide.\n\nAs much as we all like loss porn, I like seeing gain porn way more and hate the thought of people losing life savings/tuition money/inheritance because they come to the sub and don't know anything about options but see a ticker with rocket ships and buy a 0 DTE 30% out of the money call with everything they have.  Gotta know how to play blackjack to sit at the table.\n\nDepending on feedback, I may write a few more.  If I get told to fuck off I completely understand, but if some people learn some stuff then I'll continue.  I will be using $MSFT as my example.\n\n* What are options?\n   * The Basics/Buying vs. Selling Options\n   * The Money\n   * Calls Explained\n      * Buying Naked Calls\n      * Selling Naked Calls\n   * Puts Explained\n      * Buying Naked Puts\n      * Selling Naked Puts\n* Options Pricing\n   * Intrinsic Value\n   * Extrinsic Value\n* The Details\n* The Greeks\n* Helpful Links\n\n**Options Explained**\n\n***The Basics***\n\nBuying an option **gives you the right** to buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of a stock at a specific price (strike price) on or before the expiration date (European options are specifically on the expiration date).  Buying calls is bullish, buying puts is bearish.  To buy an option you are going to pay a premium as the other party will be accepting risk with the trade (premium explained more later).\n\n* If you believe a stock is going to go up past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy calls.  \n* If you believe a stock will go down past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy puts.\n\nSelling an option **obligates** you to buy (put) or sell (call) 100 shares of a stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date, really whenever the buyer wants to exercise the option.\n\n* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or drop in price, you sell calls.\n* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or raise in price, you sell puts.\n\n***The Money***\n\nFor Calls:\n\n* At the Money - A call with a strike price equal to the current stock price\n* In the Money - A call with a strike price BELOW the current stock price, can immediately be exercised\n* Out of the Money - A call with a strike price ABOVE the current stock price.  The stock MUST rise to or above the strike price to be exercised.\n\nFor Puts:\n\n* At the Money - A put with a strike price equal to the current stock price\n* In the Money - A put with a strike price ABOVE the current strike price, can immediately be exercised\n* Out of the Money -  A put with a strike price BELOW the current strike price, must fall to or below the strike price to be exercised\n\n***Calls Explained***\n\nBuying calls is a bullish strategy and the most popular on this sub, and thus will be covered first.  I will be using $MSFT as my example stock.  $MSFT is currently trading at $215.17 and I believe that the sale of the new XBox around Christmas time will increase the stock price to $230.0 by Christmas.  I would buy a call.  I decide to look at the Dec. 31 options which you can see below.\n\n[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/v1li3ko65u161.png?width=1155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f4953ae3048e58bca84001d3caa2be444b0189)\n\nThis is Robinhood on a computer.  At the top you can see what each thing is which is explained below.\n\n* Strike Price - The price the stock has to rise above to be exercised\n* Break Even - The price the stock has to rise above to not lose money\n* To Break Even - Percent change in the stock required to break even\n* % Change - Daily change in option price in percent\n* Change - Daily change in option price in dollars\n* Price - Price of the option\n\nIn the above example:\n\n* $215 Strike Price - In the Money, could be immediately exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss\n* $217.5 Strike Price - Out of the Money, could NOT be immediately exercised.\n\nThe Break Even point is always higher than the strike price for calls as you are paying someone to accept risk.  This can be calculated by taking the strike price and adding the premium paid for the option.  For the 12/31 $230, $230.0 + $1.67 = $231.67.  The option CAN BE EXERCISED BELOW THE BREAK EVEN FOR A LOSS.\n\n***Buying Naked Calls***\n\nOk, so the 12/31 $230.0 strike is what we are going to buy, that is $1.67 dollars PER share, for 100 shares, so the buyer would pay a total of $167.00 for the trade (depending on the bid - ask, explained in ***The Details*** below.)  We go ahead an buy that option for a debit of $167.00.\n\nAs the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:\n\n* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time\n* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time\n* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing (explained in Greeks)\n\nOn 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:\n\n* $MSFT is above the breakeven, we'll say $240.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, the contract would be worth around $10.00 ($240.0 - $230.0 = $10.00).  This is per share! So your profit would be: ($10.00 x 100) - ($167.0) = $833.  The $167.0 is the debit paid for the contract.\n* $MSFT is above the strike but below the breakeven, we'll say $231.00.  The contract will be very close to break even, and throughout the day will likely fluctuate to above and below.  If you are still bullish on $MSFT, this is the ONLY time I would recommend exercising the option to buy the share (AND ONLY IF YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL TO DO SO).  If you are bearish or do not have the capital, your best bet would be to sell the option for a slight loss.  In this case it would be around $100.  **NOTE: ROBINHOOD RISK MANAGEMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SELL OPTIONS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE CAPITAL TO EXERCISE THEM AND IT IS CLOSE TO THE STRIKE ON THE DAY OF EXPIRATION.**\n* $MSFT is below the strike, hold or sell to avoid max loss.  Your max loss in the trade is $167 dollars, and the stock may run up towards the end of the day.  If $MSFT finishes the day below the strike, the option will expire worthless.\n\n***Selling Naked Calls***\n\nIf you are neutral to bearish on $MSFT because you think the PS5 will outsell the XBox, you could sell the 12/31 $230.0C.  See below.\n\n[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/d8z02ztweu161.png?width=1145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38aef118e5984f02c90185de2e5cc9855c73a4e3)\n\nNotice \"To Break Even\" turns into \"Chance of Profit.\"  This is a calculation using the Greeks of your odds of coming out on top in this trade.  You sell this call.  This would mean you would be CREDITED with $167 dollars initially.  As the month goes on, if $MSFT goes up in value, you will begin to lose money on the trade, and if you desired to close the trade you would have to Buy to Close, meaning you payed more for the option then you sold it for.  If $MSFT trades sideways or decreases in value, the options contract will decrease and you can Buy to Close the call at a lower price than what you paid for it or just let it expire worthless on 12/31.\n\n**SELLING NAKED CALLS CAN BE VERY RISKY.**  If you sell the call, and $MSFT shoots up the next day to $240.0, the buyer of your contract can immediately exercise the call.  This means that you as the seller are OBLIGATED to sell them 100 shares of $MSFT at $230.  What happens if you don't have them? You have to buy them at the current market price.  So $240.0 x 100 = $24,000.  You would then sell them for $230.0: $23,000. Your max loss on the trade will be $24,000 - $23,000 -$167.0 = $833.  And that is only if the price goes to $240.0.  If the price at expiration is $250, your max loss would be $1,833.  For every $10 increase in underlying, the max loss increases $1,000.  To avoid this and collect premium you can sell covered calls, to be discussed later.\n\n***Puts Explained***\n\nBuying puts is a bearish strategy and the second most popular on this sub.  $MSFT is still $215.17, and I believe the new XBox sucks.  I think the stock will fall to $205.0 on or before 12/31.  Below are 12/31 puts.\n\n[Figure 3](https://preview.redd.it/svbfbulzcu161.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41e389a6b8a77e1b71c189615a6fb9acbee41553)\n\nNone of the metrics change, except for what is in and out of the money.\n\n* $217.5 - In the Money, can immediately be exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss\n* $215 - Out of the Money, cannot immediately be exercised\n\n***Buying Naked Puts***\n\nThe 12/31 $210.0 strike is what we are going to buy, so that is $3.58 for 100 shares, so if purchased and filled this would cost us $358.0 dollars.  Note this is much more expensive than the $230.0 call, this is a result of the strike price being much closer to the current stock price.\n\nAs the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:\n\n* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time\n* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time\n* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing\n\nOn 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:\n\n* $MSFT is below the breakeven, we'll say $200.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, worth around ($10.00). ($210.0 - $200.0 = $10.00)  Again, per share, minus the debit, would again get us around $642.  Notice how this trades profit was lower with the same difference in strike price to underlying price on expiration. That is because the premium we paid for this trade was higher.\n* $MSFT is below the strike price but above the breakeven, we'll say $207.0.  The contract will very throughout the day, and unless you have the capital to exercise Robinhood risk management will likely sell the thing whether you like it or not.\n* $MSFT is above the strike price, you can sell to minimize profit OR hold until it expires worthless.\n\n***Selling Naked Puts***\n\nIf you are neutral to bullish on $MSFT because you think the XBox will be meh, you could sell the 12/31 $210.0P.  This means you would be credited with $3.58.  If $MSFT decreases in value, the option price will increase in value, and you will lose money on the trade.  You can hold to expiration or Buy to Close at any time for a loss.  If $MSFT trades sideways or increases in value, the option will decrease in value, and you can Buy to Close for a profit at any time.\n\n**THE SAME RISK APPLIES TO SELLING NAKED PUTS AS NAKED CALLS, BUT IS \"CAPPED\" AS A STOCK CANNOT GO BELOW ZERO.**\n\n***Options Pricing***\n\nThe price of an option has two different parts, intrinsic and extrinsic value.\n\n* Intrinsic Value = |Current Price - Strike Price|\n   * An Out of the Money option has no Intrinsic Value\n   * An In the Money Option has an Intrinsic Value equal to the difference in stock price and strike price. \n   * Example:  $MSFT price: $215.17.  For the 12/31 $212.5C, this option has an Intrinsic Value of $2.67 for each share, or $267.  BUT you can see in Figure 1 it is $7.30, or $730 dollars to buy.  That is where extrinsic value comes into play\n* Extrinsic Value\n   * Effected by theta and implied volatility\n   * Can be calculated by Extrinsic Value = Option Price - Intrinsic Value\n   * Theta\n      * The more time an option has to expiration, the higher it is priced.  This is because the underlying stock ($MSFT) has more time to move.\n      * The theta curve accelerates around the 45 day mark, see the figure below.  You can see that as an option gets closer to its expiration it will lose value, regardless of if it is in or out of the money IT WILL DEPRECIATE\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knprhfu1iu161.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80a6189eafe6f7fb8662cf5cd467d2c9b588af9d\n\n* Implied Volatility - a lot of math goes into this one, but its essentially how much a stock is likely to move during a give amount of time\n   * Steady stocks, like $KO, tend to have lower IV. \n   * High growth stock or stocks that move a lot have higher IV.\n   * The IV OF EACH OPTION will be different depending on expiration date, how far In or Out of the Money the stock is, and the movement of the underlying.\n   * IV Crush - this occurs often after earnings and results from volatility decreasing.  Even with no movement in the price of the underlying an options price can be cut in half if the volatility drastically decreases, decreasing the extrinsic value.  BE CAREFUL IF YOU HOLD OPTIONS OVER A STOCKS EARNINGS.\n\n***The Details***\n\nGoing back to our out of the money 12/31 $230.0C on $MSFT, if you select the option, you will open up the details surrounding that option.  This can be seen below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9jybsf99ju161.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28414c66b7307b4d47e6841693976f068c0af774\n\nThis explains more about the option and can explain why it is priced the way it is. From left to right.\n\n* Bid - Highest price a person is willing to pay for the option and the amount of options asking to be bought at that price\n* Ask - Lowest price a person is willing to sell the option and the amount of options offered to be sold at that price\n* Mark - Often in between the Bid and Ask, what you see on the main options tree\n* Previous Close - The price of the most recent option sold\n* High - Highest price paid during the trading day for the option\n* Low - Lowest price paid during the trading day for the option\n* Volume - number of contracts traded during the trading day\n* Open Interest - number of total contracts not settled\n\nBid-Ask Spread is the different between the Bid and Ask, in this case $.19.  The closer the bid ask spread, the more likely you are to get an order filled.  Slippage occurs as the spread moves up or down depending on if the movement of the stock.  If the stock is rising rapidly and you are trying to buy a call, by the time you enter the order the Bid-Ask Spread might have moved up dramatically, and your order might not get filled.\n\nOpen Interest is important as well.  If very low open interest, Selling or Buying to close may be very difficult depending on how popular the options contract is.\n\nThe lower the open interest and the wider the Bid-Ask Spread is, the more likely you are to get fucked by market makers.  They will not be willing to meet at the mark or change their bid/ask and will expect you to do it.  If they are moving millions of options a day, $.10 is a lot to them and they will profit off of it.\n\n***The Greeks***\n\nYou can see the Greeks listed above for this call.\n\n* Delta - how much an options price is expected to change for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Calls have positive delta, puts have negative delta.  If $MSFT goes from $215.0 to $216.0, the price of the option will increase $.1691.  Puts have negative delta because the options price will decrease as the stock price increases.  Delta will approach 1 as the stock underlying approaches the strike and moves through the strike, causing a natural increase in intrinsic value.\n* Gamma - the change in Delta for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Gamma increases as the stock approaches the strike price and can be very powerful if the underlying is near the strike.\n* Theta - change in the option price for every 1 day closer to expiration.  Theta increases as the option approaches the expiration date.  If you hold onto the 12/31 $230C for a day it would decrease in value .06 per contract, so a total of $6.  You can see how this is an options buyers Enemy.\n* Vega - How the implied volatility affects the price of the option.  A drop in vega will typically cause both calls and puts to lose value.  Compare vega to normal levels by looking at other options of other similar underlying.  Again, BE CAUTIOUS OF IV CRUSH AROUND EARNINGS.\n* Rho - sensitivity to interest rates, has to do with the U.S. treasury, you have the least control over this and this arguably effects options the least.\n\n***Helpful Links***\n\nHere are some awesome links that will help everyone get better at trading options.\n\n [Options Strategies | Learn To Trade Options - The Options Playbook](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/) \n\n [Investing with Options (robinhood.com)](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/trading/investing-with-options/) \n\n [Options Trading Strategy &amp; Education (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/options-trading-strategy-and-education-4689661) \n\nI hope you find this helpful.

Like 2 days ago I said if Palantir made it to $30 by the end of the year, I\u2019d give out a PS5 to someone in this subreddit.\n\nWhile a 50% gain over 6 weeks sounded aggressive, turns out things are moving a tad faster around here.\n\nLooks like we are over $30 in Europe. Fuck it. Let\u2019s do this draw now. It\u2019s American Thanksgiving after all.\n\n\\--\n\nBut before I live up to my promise and get into the details of how you enter this draw, I think I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t use this opportunity to get my thoughts in about Palantir.\n\n**First and foremost, will everyone who is calling PLTR a quote \u201cmeme stock\u201d shut the hell up?**\n\nJust because a bunch of gorilla IQ memers happen to be buying something, does not mean that the thing they are buying is stupid. All those dingleberries also own Androids and iPhones, does that doesn\u2019t mean Google and Apple are \u201cmeme companies\u201d? No.\n\nUnlike actual meme stocks such as: unprofitable weed companies, camera companies gone pharma, car rental companies gone bankrupt, and little airlines living off corporate welfare - Palantir is actually a ROCK SOLID COMPANY with an extremely promising future.\n\nThis rally was predictable and **it will keep on going in the long run.**\n\nMyself and many others in WSB, r/investing and r/stocks got in on day one - not out of chance - but because we did our due diligence and we could see the writing on the wall: Palantir has the potential to possibly become one of the most important tech companies in the world, and it is being led by people with a track record to back it up.\n\nThis stock isn\u2019t mooning because we have posted 10,000 memes and shit posts. I'm sorry kiddos and Cramer, but our TikTok videos with a few thousand views aren't powerful enough to create $25B of stock market value.\n\nThere is something much larger at play here, and we in WSB are lucky enough to be along for the ride.\n\nPLTR is heading to Mars because the financial institutions didn\u2019t have the opportunity to get in before the IPO and now they are racing to catch up. Moreover, now that **Palantir\u2019s first quarterly report has proven they are the real deal,** and everyone has started googling this pandora\u2019s box of a company - the market is going \u201choly shit\u201d.\n\nThe only question mark that was in Palantir\u2019s path was the impact Joe Biden\u2019s administration might have on the company's relationship with the US government.\n\nWith a former Palantir consultant Avril Haines at the helm of the entire US intelligence community as of this week, the risk of the new administration working against Palantir has been all but removed.\n\nThat\u2019s why we are up bigly this week.\n\nBut more importantly, **you need to consider the global technological context of this company, to truly understand its future potential.**\n\n1. In the 90\u2019s PC\u2019s took over. \n2. In the 2000\u2019s it was all about the .coms.\n3. The 2010\u2019s was the era of wireless and mobile platforms.\n4. 2020 WILL be the decade of smart automation through a global wifi network.\n\nAnd because of that, there is now an information and technology cold war brewing. China and USA are racing to get control of the global internet infrastructure, and they are doing everything they can to invent true AI. \n\nOnce the entire world and everything in your home goes \u201csmart\u201d and becomes connected to Starlink\u2019s grid, someone or some*thing* is going to need to sift through the quintillions of zeroes and ones, to make sense of it all in real time. Guess who is **the only company in the world that has the know-how and business/political connections to fill that void?**\n\nAt the risk of getting too deep in the weeds here, I need to mention one last detail: You all need to read up on Project Maven.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Project Maven is an AI drone project that Google was originally supposed to fulfill for the US Airforce. Google walked from the contract citing \"ethical\" concerns, and then Palantir picked up the pieces. Imagine how pissed the US Airforce was when Google called them unethical and embarrassed them?\n\nThis has a **very** important underlying implication. If you accept the premise that the American government is going ham in this technological revolution, there still remains the question as to who will be the primary benefactor. \n\nCommon sense would suggest that companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft will be working with the US government to create AI. However, Project Maven changed all that. \n\nGoogle's refusal to fulfill their top secret contract taught the government that they cannot trust the trillion dollar megacaps to be unequivocally and unapologetically pro-USA. Those companies are so big, that they don't need to choose a side in geopolitics, and they will almost certainly continue to offer their products to everyone around the world. \n\nWhen it comes to matters of national cybersecurity, the odds are that **the US government is going to put all it's eggs in a company that is unquestionably loyal and patriotic.** When the pentagon is creating a trillion dollar AI behemoth, they know they need to work with someone they can trust when push comes to shove. Palantir is the only AI company that is bold enough to do so, and **their founders have created a special the corporate share structure to ensure they will never lose control**.\n\nSo again, this is not a fucking \"meme stock\".\n\nPLTR is mooning like your pubescent boner on viagra because everyone is starting to realize that this **magnificent titan the CIA created** (*see In-Q-Tel*) has gone public and will probably be at the forefront of the next global technological revolution.\n\nSo: \n\n* Stop worrying about a dip next week. (*Yes it might happen. So what?*)\n* Stop worrying about a price crash post lock up. (*This will happen. But from what price to what price? Who cares?*)\n* Stop trying to time the market to squeeze out an extra $1000. (*We aren\u2019t smart enough or fast enough to win that game.*)\n* Stop viewing Palantir like it\u2019s a penny stock. It\u2019s not.\n\n**Start** looking at the year 2030 and imagine what you will do with your money then, if you grow the man balls (or lady balls) required to hold that long.\n\nHow you handle your positions over the next 6-12 months may be the most important decision of your life: do... not... sell\u2026\n\nThere are only a handful of times in your life when a person should truly go all in. 1) When you meet the person you know you want to marry. When you decide to change your career. And when a company like Palantir goes public.\n\nIn 10 years, you can thank me. Today, I would like to thank you for your time and consideration.\n\nGod speed.\n\n\\--\n\nNow for the fun stuff.\n\n# RULES:\n\n* You must be 18 or older to enter.\n* You must be in a country where you are able to receive shipments from Walmart, Amazon, Bestbuy and/or Gamestop.\n* Your reddit account must be at least 1 week old to claim the prize.\n* There are no financial or trading requirements for this draw.

The transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of Apex, as well as the Board of Directors of AvePoint and it is expected to finalise in Q1 2021\n\n**// About AvePoint**\n\nAvePoint is the largest data management solutions provider for the Microsoft cloud, with over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices. Key takeaway:\n\n* AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way\n\n[Company's Footprint](https://preview.redd.it/hc09mm676r161.png?width=2336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bcd7d11a2681c0cc6d44c7a0f79996caf32b8a1)\n\n* Huge diversified blue-chip client base, \\~7 million members (as of Sep 30, 2020) with 16k accounts and 25% of Fortune 500 using the company\u2019s services. 7M users represent 3% or 250M Microsoft 365 client base with an estimated addressable market of $33 billion by 2022 (according to IDC).

Expected 2020 revenues @ USD 148M, a + 26% YoY increase (78% recurring revenues). There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a 14% EBIT margin and 30% ARR growth.

Explosive data growth, increasing data regulations, shifts to the cloud, hyper growth of Microsoft Teams were all trends that fuelled the growth prior to the pandemic. The impacts of COVID-19 have greatly accelerated these trends\n\n[Current and Future Potential](https://preview.redd.it/jwg00s6d6r161.png?width=2704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03e3dcfdd8f3fea45a494e49e9bb81d55857287a)\n\n* The company raised $200 million in January this year led by Sixth Street Partners (formerly TPG Sixth Street Partners), with additional participation from prior investor Goldman Sachs.

        "selftext": "  \n\n\\- In April 2019 GME brings in former president of Best buy Services named \u201cGeorge Sherman\u201d who has tremendous amount of experience in Brick &amp; Mortar retails. George made huge changes to the company (e.g., hired a former president of Nintendo America in order to solve supply issues for Nintendo Switch during the beginning of Pandemic).\n\n\\- As a result, E-commerce revenue grew 500% YTY in Q1 2020 and 800% YTY in Q2 2020.\n\n\\- Ryan Cohen, a self-made Billionaire, who co-found Chewy .com shows interest in Gamestop and purchases 9.98% of GME shares. \n\n\\- Ryan Cohen recognizes the booming gaming industry and realizes the goldmine that Gamestop is sitting on with strong brand and 55million + PowerUp members. \n\n\\- Despite George Sherman\u2019s proven success in E-comm sales, Ryan Cohen believes a more aggressive change needs to happen in order to make GameStop Great Again.\n\n\\- Ryan Cohen believes that in order to make GME Great Again, it is absolutely necessary for GameStop do the following:\n\n1) Forgo the upcoming 2-year lease renewal on all underperforming stores\n\n2) Non-core operations in Europe and Australia to be streamlined or sold.\n\n3) By cutting cost with the above two methods and with the revenue generated from the biggest ever console cycle, GameStop should invest heavily on boosting E-comm sales.\n\n(Hire proficient E-comm gurus, invest more in GME website and App, secure delivery channels that are better or at least on par with Amazon.\n\n[http://wsj.com/public/resources/documents/RC%20Ventures%20Letter%20to%20GameStop.pdf](http://wsj.com/public/resources/documents/RC%20Ventures%20Letter%20to%20GameStop.pdf)\n\n\\- Ryan Cohen demands the company to layout the roadmap as soon as possible (\\*hint\\* December 8 Earnings call)\n\n**2 possible scenarios:**\n\n1. GameStop addresses Cohen\u2019s letters and agrees to implement Cohen\u2019s ideas.\n\n2. GameStop completely disagrees with Cohen as they believe they are on the right track or doesn\u2019t address Cohen\u2019s letter at all.\n\n\\- Scenario 2 is where it could get interesting as many speculate a potential hostile takeover by Ryan Cohen. \n\nMy take on this:\n\n\\- Ryan Cohen is not a WSB autist. He sees the potential short squeeze opportunity. Ryan Cohen could be holding massive amount of ITM calls which he can exercise and reduce the supply of shares significantly. This way, he could easily takeover the company with the shares his holding and possibly even ride the short squeeze with us. This would force the shorts the cover. Similar to what happened in 2008 with Volkswagen.\n\n[https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/)\n\n\\- Or, Cohen could actually plan a hostile takeover and call up a proxy vote. This could lead to recalling shares by the company, forcing the shorts to cover and triggering the short squeeze.\n\nIcing on the cake:\n\n\\- On 12/11/20, GameStop voluntarily pays off debt as their cash on hand deems healthy.\n\n[http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-voluntary-early-redemption-senior-notes](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-voluntary-early-redemption-senior-notes)\n\n\\- Microsoft multi-year revenue sharing partnership meaning, they will receive constant revenue flow from sales of Xbox All Access. \n\n[http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft)\n\n\\- Short Squeeze will happen with enough short interest even with the most retarded stocks:\n\n[https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/](https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/)\n\n\\- Michael Burry from \u201cThe Big Short\u201d sees an undervalued stock that is massively shorted.

        "selftext": "Back in September 2019, Michael Burry predicted an index fund bubble. Since I invest index funds and write about them with relish, I was intrigued. But I quickly moved on.\n\nThen another headline caught my eye. It was an episode of Odd Lots podcast titled,  [**\u201cWhy Passive Investing Might Be Distorting the Market.\u201d**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2020-02-07/why-passive-investing-might-be-distorting-the-market-podcast)   I immediately listened to the episode, featuring investor and fund manager Mike Green. And then I listened again. Considering a lot of my net worth is currently tied up in index funds, I want to understand why some people think index funds are fools\u2019 gold.\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to play devil\u2019s advocate and talk about both sides of the conversation. Is there an index fund bubble? A market crash around the corner? Or is passive investing still the winning strategy it\u2019s always been?\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find compelling arguments from investors Mike Green and Michael Burry, who both say there is a bubble. Then I\u2019ll follow up with comments from financial analyst Ben Carlson and portfolio manager Ben Felix, both of whom see no bubble . It\u2019s #TeamMike vs. #TeamBen. I\u2019ll also pull some soundbites from Raoul Pal, a former hedge fund manager who now produces financial videos with a silky British accent. And then I\u2019ll add in my own thoughts at the end.\n\n# Quick reminder: what\u2019s an index fund?\n\nAn index fund owns a wide assortment of assets (e.g. stocks), and owns those assets in proportion to their market share. Uh\u2026that\u2019s a lot of FinSpeak. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nFor an example, let\u2019s look at an S&amp;P 500 index fund. An S&amp;P 500 index fund would own all of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500. Since Apple and Microsoft each make up about 5% of the S&amp;P 500, this index fund would be comprised of about 5% Apple and 5% Microsoft. But Chipotle would only compose about 0.08% of the index, because it\u2019s 0.08% of the S&amp;P. In this way, the index fund is benchmarked to the S&amp;P, like a shadow that follows all of the body\u2019s movements.\n\nSimilarly, a \u201ctotal stock market fund\u201d would own every stock in the market. There are tons of options in the index fund world.\n\nLet\u2019s get into the arguments that claim indexing is now in a bubble.\n\n# Part I \u2013 Bubble! \u2013 \u201cThe tail is now wagging the dog\u201d\n\nOne of Mike Green\u2019s first points on Odd Lots is this: the original idea behind indexing is that active traders and actively managed funds will dictate how the market behaves, and that a small number of passive investors (e.g. index funds) can simply go along for the ride. The large majority active traders are the dog; the minority passive investors are the tail. The dog does what it wants. The tail only follows.\n\nIf dogs don\u2019t do it for you, I like the boat analogy. Think of actively managed funds and active traders as large cruise liners and passive investors as a small canoe. The cruise liner picks its course. The canoe ropes onto the cruise liner and gets a free ride. The cruise liner doesn\u2019t notice the small canoe\u2019s drag whatsoever; its course is unaffected. This big-small relationship is the original assumption behind passive investing. Market behavior is dictated by the active majority, and the passive minority gets a free ride.\n\nHowever, asserts Green, we now live in a paradigm where active and passive investing are too close in size. Therefore, the fundamental assumption no longer rings true.\n\nMillions of Average Janes and Joes\u2013individual investors\u2013are using index funds to invest huge portions of their income and savings. After all, that\u2019s how many 401(k)s and their non-American equivalents are set up. Green points out how recent U.S. legislation changes are pushing 401(k)s and passive investing even further into the mainstream.\n\nPassive investing is no longer the \u201csmall tail.\u201d It\u2019s no longer the canoe. It\u2019s now a fairly large boat, and the active management cruise liner is impacted by towing such a large passive boat.\n\nThe past 30 years have seen index funds grow and grow. Index fund inflows are the \u201csingle largest transactors in the market by far\u201d Therefore, by definition, they are not passive. Index funds have to be influencing the market. What might this influence look like?\n\n# Passive investing influences the market\n\nLet\u2019s go back to our S&amp;P 500 index fund from before. The S&amp;P 500 went up \\~30% in 2019. Where does this gain come from?\n\nSome of it probably comes from fundamental growth in the S&amp;P companies. They\u2019re doing better! Active investors respond by saying, \u201cIf the company is better, then these stocks are now worth more!\u201d\n\nAlternatively, what happens when millions of individual investors put their retirement savings into S&amp;P 500 index funds? It\u2019s simple supply and demand. Joe and Jane are increasing the demand for S&amp;P stocks, therefore the price will increase.\n\nWhen Joe and Jane were the \u201csmall canoe,\u201d their demand didn\u2019t affect the market. But these passive investors are no longer \u201cjust along for the ride.\u201d They are actively impacting the ride. Last year\u2019s 30% price increase is not based only on fundamental growth. Instead, the Average Janes and Joes are artificially increasing the price of the S&amp;P 500 via their demand for index funds.\n\n# The effects of \u201cindex inclusion\u201d\n\nWhat about \u201cCompany 501;\u201d that is, the first company not in the S&amp;P 500? Well, it does not receive the benefits of being a part of the S&amp;P 500 index funds. It does not receive the demand that occurs from inclusion in that index fund, and this exclusion affects Company 501\u2019s price.\n\nMike Green says that historical data clearly shows this growing impact on asset values\u2013it\u2019s called \u201cindex inclusion.\u201d This is true for all sorts of index funds. They include some stocks, exclude others, and there\u2019s a recognizable delineation between those included and excluded.\n\nGreen says there\u2019s a \u201cdistinct and permanent shift in the valuation and price levels associated with these securities\u201d when they are included or ejected from an index. Companies inside of indices are receiving more attention than they fundamentally deserve. Companies outside of indices, therefore, are getting the cold shoulder. This lack of true valuation is one of the formative factors of a bubble.\n\n# \u201cFire!\u201d in a theater\n\nIn the past 40 years, passive investing has done nothing but grow. But eventually, that growth will end. Individual investors will retire. Withdrawals will take place. What happens when you take the money out?\n\nAt that point, Green states that the artificial inflation of index funds will cease, and quickly turn south. As more retail investors sell, prices will drop. When investors see prices dropping, they\u2019ll get scared and sell more. The vicious cycle will continue\u2013sell, drop, sell more, drop more\u2013into a index fund crash. It\u2019ll be an old-fashioned bank run.\n\nOr, as Nicholas Nassim Taleb has written, \u201cthe market is like a large movie theater with a small door.\u201d If everyone is looking to get out, the only way to do so is to offer the doorman a better price than the other people. Prices will plummet. Pop goes the index fund bubble.\n\n# Is it the British accent?\n\nRaoul Pal looks the part, sounds the part, and produces his videos while sitting in front of monitors chock full of financial data. My bulls\\*\\*\\* detector is whirring to life, but something about that accent is just so factual.\n\nPal\u2019s argument is that baby boomers\u2013through no fault of their own\u2013have been dumping too much money into passive funds (pensions, 401(k)\u2019s, etc). When they start selling en masse\u2013which will happen soon!\u2013then pop goes the index fund bubble.\n\nThere are 76 million baby boomers in the U.S., and their average age is now 65 years old. The wave of retirees is about to crest. And when they start to pull money out for retirement, we will see the large theater/small door issue. Prices will plummet.\n\nBut, says Pal, index funds aren\u2019t the only issue. Boomers will also face issues trying to sell their houses. They\u2019ll have issues trying to sell their material goods. Baby Boomers were such prolific consumers that the economy will be overwrought will all their stuff, and prices everywhere will fall. Growth will cease as markets are flooded with goods. A vicious cycle will ensue.\n\nAnd then \u201cthe doom loop of corporate debt will get ignited.\u201d Oh no, not a doom loop! In short, says Pal, corporations have recently gotten into the habit of:\n\n1. Borrowing money (this is the corporate debt)\n\n2. Buying shares of their own stock\u2014a.k.a \u201cstock buy backs\u201d\n\n3. \u2026which drives the price of their stock higher (P.S. this is an artificial price increase)\n\n4. \u2026which makes the company appear more valuable, and usually lets the biggest stockholders (e.g. the executives) get extra rich\n\nAnd Pal\u2019s right. Corporations have been gluttons for their own stocks in recent years. Just read about Apple\u2019s buyback tactics.\n\nEventually, these corporations will have to pay back their debts. And their artificial valuations will come back to Earth. Stock prices will plummet. Indexes and pension funds will plummet. And Baby Boomers\u2019 selling will cause further pricing drops.\n\nAnd thus, claims Pal, the third Baby Boomer crash will occur. And every good story has the symmetry of threes.\n\n# Problems with Pal\n\nMy core issue with Pal is that he\u2019s as much a story teller as he is fact teller. And therefore, it\u2019s hard to tell if he\u2019s selling olive oil or snake oil.\n\nFor example, this sounds impressive: \u201cThe baby boomers accumulated the greatest concentration of wealth the world has ever seen. And they\u2019ll destroy it too.\u201d Whoa! Rise and fall. The double-edged sword. The boomer giveth, and the boomer taketh away.\n\nPal provides facts to back up his claims. But most of his facts are arguable at best.\n\nThe 2000 Dot Com bubble? It happened because Boomers flooded the stock market with their investments, says Pal. And then \u201ceverything got dashed on the rocks, as those markets collapsed.\u201d\n\nThe Baby Boomers\u2013then age 45 on average\u2013turned to real estate, says Pal. Can you guess what happened next? The 2008 Subprime Mortgage and Financial Crisis! Baby Boomers are so many in number, says Pal, that their sum-total behavior can\u2019t help but create bubbles.\n\nAfter 2000 and 2008, the Boomers were worried about their retirement savings, goes Pal\u2019s argument. So now they\u2019ve got to take risk, and they were forced to do so in the stock market. Well, what\u2019s the easiest way to invest in stocks? Through passive investing! And as we\u2019ve now learned twice\u2013according the Pal\u2013where the Boomer money goes, a bubble will soon follow.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice story. It has symmetry. It has foreshadowing. It\u2019s narrated with a silky British accent.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it has an iota of truth. Euphoric day-trading of \u201c.com\u201d companies led to the 2000 Dot Com bubble. Passive investing is the exact opposite of that kind of behavior! Perhaps the money is coming from some of the same people, but that\u2019s not evidence for the existence of an index fund bubble. Pal is grasping at straws.\n\n# Michael Burry: Big Short to Big Bubble\n\nMichael Burry is an investor and hedge fund manager who correctly foresaw the 2008 financial crisis, and managed to make a boat-load of money for himself and his customers through his correct prediction. If you\u2019ve seen the movie The Big Short, Michael Burry is played by Christian Bale.\n\nBurry\u2019s argument for an index fund bubble is a less scary than Green\u2019s, and certainly less apocalyptic than Pal\u2019s.\n\nBurry\u2019s claim is that indexing has caused an artificial bubble that\u2019s inflating stocks inside the index, and thus leaving stocks outside the index ripe for the picking. It\u2019s the \u201cindex inclusion\u201d argument again.\n\nBut where Green sees a dangerous bubble, Burry sees more of an opportunity. Ready for another metaphor?\n\nImagine a pair of identical twin basketball all-stars. Everything about them is the same, including their skills. Except that one twin plays college ball for Duke\u2013he\u2019s always on TV\u2013while the other plays for Harvard\u2013a good academic school, but not a basketball Mecca.\n\nThe average basketball fan would be biased towards the Duke player. He\u2019s on a better team, he gets more media coverage, and has more post-season success. The average fan would certainly believe that the Duke twin has better long-term prospects, and therefore would deserve a bigger professional contract.\n\nBut since I built this strawman hypothetical, you and I know the truth! The two twins have the same exact skill set. Therefore, signing the Harvard twin at his lower price would actually be quite the financially efficient move.\n\nMichael Burry\u2019s claim is that this is what\u2019s happening with passive investing. Near-identical companies are being over- or under-valued due to their index inclusion or exclusion.\n\nStocks that are inside of index funds are like the Duke twin\u2013they are being over-valued simply because of where they are. While stocks not in the index are like Harvard twin\u2013they are under-valued, and therefore should be targeted by smart people looking to make more money.\n\nIn my opinion, this is less of a \u201cindex fund bubble\u201d and more of an \u201canti-index opportunity.\u201d\n\nBurry is simply saying, \u201cThere\u2019s an inefficiency here, I\u2019ve discovered it, and I plan on making money off it. P.S.\u2013come invest with me so we can both make money together.\u201d\n\nGood work, Mike! Go exploit that inefficiency!\n\n# Price Discovery is becoming fragile\n\nBurry\u2019s second claim is that price discovery is becoming fragile. \u201cPrice discovery\u201d is a fancy term for \u201cbuyers and sellers determining a price where they\u2019re willing to make a deal.\u201d\n\nThink about Craigslist. Someone wants $200 for a used snowblower. Snow?! Yes, in Rochester it helps to have a snowblower. So, you take a look at the snowblower and counteroffer $150. The owner haggles back to $175\u2026and you have a deal! That\u2019s price discovery.\n\nTypically, stock market price discovery involves many buyers and sellers conducting detailed analyses of a company\u2019s holdings and profits and cash flows\u2013all of the fundamental business metrics.\n\nBut passive investing doesn\u2019t care about those fundamental metrics. Instead, passive investing simply follows the leader. It assumes that others in the market have already done the fundamental research, and that the current price of a stock is \u201cright.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a little bit like saying, \u201cThe last Craigslist used snowblower went for $200, so I\u2019ll buy the next one for $200 sight unseen.\u201d Are you sure you want to trust the last buyer and seller? What if they were dopes? Don\u2019t you want to look at the snowblower and make a decision for yourself?\n\nSince passive investing doesn\u2019t rely on price discovery, Burry argues that prices are now dangerously skewed from what traditional price discovery would suggest. This cannot go on forever, and eventually the prices will snap back to where they fundamentally belong.\n\nOr, you could say, the index fund bubble will pop. This, Burry says, is very similar to how housing and CDO pricing behavior malfunctioned before the 2008 crisis. It will be a painful, painful snap.\n\n# Part II \u2013 The other side: Index funds are fine\n\nWhile I appreciate the logic behind Misters Green and Burry and Pal, there\u2019s plenty of good money still betting on index funds\u2019 future success. Let\u2019s start with [**Ben Carlson**](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2019/09/debunking-the-silly-passive-is-a-bubble-myth/). . Ben is financial analyst, author and blogger (nice!), and podcast host. I\u2019m a big fan of A Wealth of Common Sense (the blog) and Animal Spirits (the podcast). Thanks for sharing all the good work, Ben.\n\nAnyway, what does Ben have to say about the index fund bubble and passive investing?\n\n# The tail is not wagging the dog.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get back to dogs and tails and boats. Carlson writes, \u201cIndex funds hold less than 15% of shares in public companies.\u201d While this is a growing number\u2013it was 3.3% in 2002 and 6.8% in 2009\u2013passive investing is neither a majority nor plurality.\n\nIf we combine all exchange traded funds and all mutual funds, that percentage rises to about 35% ownership of all shares. That means that active investors\u2013the dog\u2013own at least 65% of the equity market, and therefore are still wagging the tail. All is well in the dog/boat metaphor universe, says Carlson.\n\n# Bias! Bias! Read all about it!\n\nAnother of Carlson\u2019s arguments is that active investing, by nature, is biased against passive investing. Passive is stealing active\u2019s business share, and now active is biting back.\n\nPassive investing shadows what the active investors are doing. But rather than spending money on research and trades, passive investing keeps expenses\u2013and fees\u2013to a minimum. Passive has all the profits of active investing, but none of the costs: ipso facto, passive investing is better. And the active investors don\u2019t like it! The \u201cindex fund bubble\u201d is their propaganda technique.\n\nBesides, let\u2019s consider any and all claims that passive investing is doing something \u201cwrong.\u201d Logically speaking, anything that passive investing is \u201cdoing wrong\u201d first has to be done by active investors.\n\nYou can\u2019t blame your shadow for flipping you the middle finger\u2013the shadow only copies the source. Similarly, passive investing only copies what active investors are doing. It\u2019s a simple argument in logic.\n\n# The price discovery argument\n\nPrice discovery is a cop-out, says Carlson. There is way more trading occurring today than most times in the stock market\u2019s history. In the book Index Revolution, author Charley Ellis writes that about 95% of all trades today are done by active managers\u2013there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for price discovery. It\u2019s all about trading volume.\n\nThis means that the prices aren\u2019t skewed. The prices aren\u2019t a stretched rubber band, ready to snap back. There\u2019s no index fund bubble, waiting to pop. Instead, the active investors are setting the prices and price discovery is healthy.\n\n# So what\u2019s Michael Burry worried about?\n\nBesides, Carlson says, when else in life do we expect individuals to actively partake in price discovery? Do you haggle with the grocery cashier about the cost of oranges? No! All over our economy, prices are set and individual consumers simply choose to buy, or not. They don\u2019t barter or bargain.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I agree with Ben\u2019s point here. It\u2019s true: we don\u2019t haggle at grocery stores. Instead we\u2019re presented with Hobson\u2019s choice\u2013we either take it, or leave it. If you don\u2019t want to pay $12 for a bag of oranges, you don\u2019t have to.\n\nBut are people thinking about Hobson\u2019s choice when they passively invest in index funds? I don\u2019t think so. I think a lot of people are \u201cblindly\u201d putting their bi-weekly 401(k) contributions into index funds, regardless of the price. There\u2019s not much \u201ctake it, or leave it\u201d going on. It\u2019s just \u201ctake it.\u201d\n\nMy conclusion: index investors might be blindly buying in, but they\u2019re still buying at a price that was intelligently discovered through the fundamental analyses of active investors.\n\n# Ben Felix from YouTube\n\n [**Ben Felix**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv0pJh8mFk0) is a portfolio manager at PWL Capital, and popular creator of YouTube financial/investment videos.\n\nI really like one of Felix\u2019s foundational arguments against the idea of the bubble. That idea is: assets under management do not set prices; instead, trading sets prices.\n\nSo Green and Burry should not be asking, \u201cHow much money is in indexes?\u201d Instead, the question should be, \u201cHow much trading is done by indexing?\u201d This means that the size of the boats doesn\u2019t matter. In fact, it means the boat metaphor doesn\u2019t really make sense.\n\nSo let\u2019s relate it back to the quote from Charley Ellis: 95% of all trades today are done by active managers. That means that price discovery is dominated by active trading. And it means that there shouldn\u2019t be any bubble driven by price discovery.\n\nBlackrock, another investment management firm, estimates that for every $1 of passive trades, there are $22 of active trades. Again, this points to the same conclusion: there is no issue with price discovery.\n\n# Some ideas from the academics\n\n Felix quotes a couple serious economics papers\u2013one by [**Fama/French**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=502605), another from [**Palia/Sokolinksi.**](https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/Paper_P%26S_Darius.pdf) \n\nFama &amp; French came to the conclusion that it doesn\u2019t take much active investing to create an efficient (i.e. non-bubble) market. Passive investing, they say, is pushing bad active managers out of the market. And those who remain? Only the skilled active managers. It\u2019s survival of the fittest. Culling the weak should only make the market more efficient. More efficient = better price discovery = no bubble.\n\nPalia and Sokolinski have a really interesting theory. In brief, they claim that index funds drive down the cost of short selling, which makes short selling more efficient, and that leads to better price discovery.\n\nThey start with the simple truth that index funds hold onto lots of stocks. And since the supply of stocks is high, index funds can easily lend out those stocks to short sellers (people betting that a stock will go down). The short seller pays the index fund a small fee, which gets passed onto the passive investor in the form of low costs.\n\nHowever, since there are so many index funds out there, the short sellers have many different options of where they borrow stocks from. With high supply comes low prices. They can find their short sources very cheaply. This makes the cost of shorting go down.\n\nAnd thus, conclude Palia and Sokolinski, passive investing is creating a more efficient market for short sellers, and a more efficient market leads to better price discovery.\n\n# Part III \u2013 Home-grown arguments and takeaways\n\nNow that you\u2019ve heard the smart people talk, let me bless you with my pro-index ideas.\n\nFirst, index investing is self-corrective.\n\nTo wit, let\u2019s take another look at Michael Burry\u2019s argument: \u201cpassive investing has an inefficiency in undervaluing non-indexed companies, and I plan on taking advantage of that.\u201d\n\nIf Burry is correct, then more active managers will follow his lead and make their money. And right behind them will be their shadow a.k.a. passive investing. The market is a self-correcting system, where money flows towards the best values. Passive investing simply follows that flow of money.\n\nIf passive gets too influential, then the smart active managers will exploit the problem. Inefficiencies will balance themselves out in the long-term. And passive investing is a long-term technique.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s easy to avoid the pitfalls of index inclusion.\n\nIndex funds don\u2019t have to exclude stocks. Many investment managers (like Fidelity and Vanguard) offer total market index funds. They include high and mighty S&amp;P companies and all of the \u201ccompany 501\u2019s\u201d out there that might be excluded from other index funds.\n\nTherefore\u2013if there is an index inclusion bubble\u2013the total market index funds own both sides of that bubble.\n\nA total market fund would only be exposed to a bubble that includes entire asset classes. For example, one could claim that stocks in their entirety are overvalued, but that commodities are undervalued. Therefore, a total U.S. stock market index fund would still expose you the bad outcomes of bursting bubble!\n\nIf this concerns you, then diversify your index investing via a lazy portfolio. There are indexes that track bond markets, international markets, different sized companies, commodities, REITs, etc. You can spread out your investments across multiple asset classes to reduce your risk.\n\n# Takeaways\n\nGreen and Burry both make good points. Pal tells a nice story. I\u2019m really glad I took some time to understand those ideas. Carlson and Felix support the ideas I\u2019ve always heard: the wisdom of people like Jack Bogle and Burton Malkiel. What actions am I taking after all this conversation?\n\nReading. Lots more reading. I want to learn more about Mike Green, Michael Burry, and their anti-passive compatriots. After all\u2013they did compel me to type up 4000 words of arguments that go against my investing strategy. But I also want to remind myself of the reasons why I started indexing in the first place: Malkiel, Bogle, and people like Ben Carlson and Ben Felix.\n\nBut I will be staying my course, at least for now. I have not been convinced to move away from indexing, or that there\u2019s an index fund bubble. Indexes still float my boat, and I think the bubble argument has more bark than bite. I\u2019m in it for the long run. I do not think hand-picking individual stocks is the way to go.",

They probably have an actual short position too (don't have to file that in an 13F) they're also underwater on. No one else has a put position this big in the 13F's.\n\nWhat are the chances they're responsible for half the short interest? It'd make sense on why we're not seeing significant covering on GME yet. They're a bunch of stubborn boomers that have collateral in the billions. It wouldn't be crazy if they made a $200 million bet on Gamestop becoming the next Blockbuster when it was under $6. They've made similar bets in the past like their $400 million short on Nintendo back in 2018.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u7ttqxuym8261.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b39a443a7d7cdc8d62ede4680a5b540af920f1d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course that $200 million bet would have turned to a $500 million (and growing) that they owe. They might not get a margin call, but surely there's a point where their risk management and exit strategy tells them they have to cut losses instead of paying $100K daily in interests (\\~7% APR fee) on a losing position that's getting bigger and bigger.\n\n**Note:** the short squeeze is just a bonus so don't be a paperhand retard. There's more to the GME play than just hoping the short sellers pay for your lambo. GME is unusually undervalued compared to its peers (0.13x revenues if you're basing it on TTM revenues), it can go up without a short squeeze. These boomers still think that digital consoles are going to kill Gamestop even though Microsoft threw them a safety net and that disc consoles are still the vast majority of sales. Surprise surprise, no one wants digital consoles in America when downloading a game uses up their entire bandwidth cap for the month.",

        "selftext": "\nAPXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.\n\nAPXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.\n\n'AvePoint\u2019s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft\u2019s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'\n\nAddressable market: $33 billion by 2022.\n\nThe company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022.\n\n**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**\n\nManagement: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC.\n\nBig name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs,\n\nBig advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.\n\nThis seems similar to the other data related plays weve had this year \\*cough\\* PLTR \\*cough\\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.\n\nThe SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger)\n\n[https://www.avepoint.com/](https://www.avepoint.com/)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23)\n\n[https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html)\n\n[https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac](https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac)\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nDisclaimer: I have APXT shares and this does not constitute financial advice.",

        "selftext": "**Walmart Due Dilligence**\n\n**PARTNERSHIPS** \n\n\\- Partnership with Instacart \n\nRecently Walmart and Instacart have founded a partnership that will allow Walmart to use Instacart their same-day shipping service. \\[Walmart and Instacart together make up for nearly 50% of the online grocery sales.\\]( [https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)) Walmart\u2019s vast inventory and Instacart their network and experience will only strengthen their position as the dominant grocery delivery providers, and thus putting more pressure on Amazon. \n\n\\- Partnership with Shopify\n\nIn addition to Instacart Walmart has also partnered with Shopify. This new partnership will allow third-party sellers to directly sell their items on the Walmart marketplace. This new partnership will greatly expand Walmart\u2019s inventory while giving small businesses the opportunity to reach a bigger demographic. Walmart is expecting to add 1200 Shopify sellers in 2020. Listing an item on Walmart\u2019s marketplace allows Walmart to pick up some fees and generate greater traffic to the website. Another interesting possibility to consider is the fact that Walmart could be used as a Shopify returns hub, with a Walmart being within 10 miles of 90% of the US population it is the ideal candidate for further strengthening their relation with Shopify and saving both parties a lot of money.\n\n\\- Partnership with ThredUp\n\nWalmart has also partnered with Thredup. ThredUp is basically an online thrift shop for clothes and wearables. This brilliant partnership means Walmart can now offer both normal and high-end clothing on their marketplace for an affordable price and expose customers to nearly 750,000 pre-owned items. Who would\u2019ve ever thought you could tell someone that you bought your Michael Kors or Calvin Klein at Walmart.\n\n\\- Google\n\nWalmart has been partners with Google for over 3 years now. This partnership allowed Walmart to enter the domain of voice ordering groceries. Simply ask one of your Google devices to buy milk and it will add milk to your Shopping cart. This Partnership might just be the beginning of a strong bond between Google and Walmart as both companies are interested in competing with Amazon.\n\n\\- Microsoft (+ Possible TikTok acquisition) \n\nWalmart has been partnered with Microsoft for about 2 years with 3 more years to go. \n\nSince the partnership Walmart has been using the full range of Microsoft cloud solutions in a bid to accelerate their digital transformation, innovation and efficiency. \n\n**Acquisitions**\n\n\\- Bonobos, ModCloth, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Parcel\n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning, with these acquisitions Walmart stated entering the e-commerce market in 2016-2017. Sadly, as is known none of these are particularly success stories with the companies being sold again, discontinued or CEO\u2019s leaving. However, Walmart learned a lot from these companies and has used this knowledge to further try to expand in the e-commerce market.\n\n\\- Jet.com\n\nThe first big step in the fight against Amazon. When amazon acquired Jet.com it was a clear signal of what its intentions were. Jet.com was one of the fastest growing U.S. e-commerce companies and Walmart acquired them in September 2016. Since then a lot has happened, Jet.com has been discontinued but the knowledge, progress and technology gained due to Jet.com is irreplaceable and has given Walmart a brilliant boost into the e-commerce with their e-commerce sales increasing 29%. Furthermore (ex)CEO of jet.com Marc Lore is now the CEO of Walmart\u2019s e-commerce.\n\n\\- Flipkart\n\nEver heard of the small startup company called Flipkart? Maybe you have not, you should though. Flipkart owns 35% of the Indian e-commerce market, a true giant. Walmart acquired Flipkart in 2018 and ever since then it has been expanding its influence in India and fighting against Amazon for market dominance. This year Flipkart took over Walmart\u2019s 28 Indian stores in order to expand its wholesale growth. Another interesting thing is that Walmart might make Flipkart public within the next 3 years.\n\n\\- TikTok acquisition \n\nSome very recent news of their Partnership with Microsoft is to potentially acquire TikTok. TikTok\u2019s enormous userbase and the current pressure in the US and India have made for an interesting situation causing the partnership to push forward in the bid to acquiring TikTok. In my opinion Walmart has a very decent chance of getting TikTok and making it work. One factor that plays a big role in this is Walmart\u2019s presence in India due to Flipkart. Flipkart is India\u2019s biggest online store for; phones, electronics, books, home appliances, etc. With Walmart having a presence in both countries where TikTok is (going to be) banned might mean some positive things for the future, but for now that is speculation. The acquisition of TikTok would allow Walmart to use its genius algorithm and massive userbase to further promote and integrate its Walmart marketplace.\n\n**Walmart PLUS**\n\nSince September Walmart has its Amazon competitor called Walmart plus. It will give numerous benefits to the user such as; Unlimited free delivery (with 2700 stores having same day delivery), fuel discounts and scan&amp;go a tool to make shopping faster, all for the price of $98 per year\n\n**2 Hour Delivery**\n\nWalmart recently launches its new delivery service, called Express Delivery. This new service will allow customers to place their order online and receive their groceries (for a 10$ fee) within 2 hours. Walmart express delivery is currently available in 800 stores with plans to expand to 2000 stores. In addition to 2-hour delivery Walmart also offers same-day delivery in almost the entire United States.\n\n**Drone Delivery**\n\nWalmart has recently partnered with **THREE** drone delivery companies; Flytrex, DroneUp &amp; Zipline. With these partnerships Walmart will increase it\u2019s focus on cheaper and faster home delivery. The key takeaway from these companies is to remember that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart. These drones will be able to cover almost the entire American population. Currently it\u2019s still in the pilot phase but Walmart is showing great ambitions and a clear trajectory for the future.\n\n\\- Flytrex\n\nFlytrex has drones that can carry up to 6.6 pounds worth of goods for a distance of 3.5miles and back. The test for Flytrex will be in Fayetteville, North Carolina.\n\n\\- Zipline\n\nZipline provides medical supplies in Rwanda and Ghana and has recently gotten permission to deliver medical supplies to medical facilities in North Carolina. The drones have a range of 50 miles and fly at a speed of 63mph, it can carry up to 3.5 pounds of cargo.\n\n\\- DroneUp\n\nDroneUp their drones are initially used to assist commercial industries and public sector entities with aerial data collection solutions. However, they will be delivering Coviv-19 test kits for single family residences within a 1-mile radius of designated Walmart Supercenters.\n\n\\- Cruise, Udlev, Ford, Waymo\n\nOkay so its not really drone delivery but autonomous delivery. Walmart has partnered with all these companies in order to experiment and expand into autonomous delivery. Another amazing step in it\u2019s last mile delivery!\n\n**5000+ US stores.**\n\nThis is Walmart\u2019s biggest weapon. The thing Amazon lacks the most is physical stores. Walmart has over 5000 stores while Amazon has just over 600 (worldwide!). If Walmart can find a way to combine e-commerce with its enormous physical presence then it could give Amazon an absolute run for its money. Remember that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart.\n\n**Some other interesting facts to consider.** \n\n\\- 90% of US population live within 10miles of a Walmart.\n\n\\- Walmart\u2019s e-commerce sales were up 97%\n\n\\- Walmart\u2019s expansion in Africa. \n\n**Conclusion/TLDR**\n\nLet me first state with you that this has been my first Due Dilligence and that English is not my first language.\n\nWalmart is currently the underdog, and not many people are expecting them to properly fight Amazon. However, its recent spree of partnerships and acquisitions have been a brilliant and very clear move in the direction of e-commerce. If Walmart fully utilized its massive physical network together when their growing fresh e-commerce, I see no other outcome then for Walmart to grow, grow, grow. COVID-19 has given Walmart customers the push they needed to fully explore Walmart their marketplace, the marketplace that is now starting to fill up with thousands of sellers and endless products. The latest partnering with drone companies also shows that Walmart knows what the future hold and that they are ready to innovate and expand.\n\nWalmart VS Amazon, here we go, my money is on Walmart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources posted on my profile!",

        "selftext": "**Honeywell and the Quantum Computing Revolution**\n\nHoneywell is a huge industrial conglomerate that has been a legacy manufacturing company for several decades now. Many of you know what the company is, but you probably also know them vaguely compared to some of their other industrial competitors such as General Electric. Honeywell is a huge defense contractor and a manufacturer of productivity and building solutions such as thermostats, security systems, and air purifiers. Honeywell\u2019s aerospace division manufactures engines and provides integrated avionics solutions along with them. Honeywell also manufactures automobile parts such as turbochargers and electricity solutions. On top of that, they provide the software necessary for a lot of their own tools and technologies to function. You could say that Honeywell is a large legacy company that has a solid line of products, it functions in an industry where there\u2019s not much new competition grabbing at your throat, and that in and of itself makes it a buy. However, while Honeywell may have fit into the average portfolio that needs manufacturing just fine, it\u2019s not exactly an amazing value. It has several large competitors domestically and internationally and they don\u2019t do seemingly anything outside of the ordinary that GE (which is a better value) does, or that Siemens (an international competitor) does. As far as the average investor can tell, there\u2019s no growth prospect for him and as far as the experienced one can tell, there\u2019s no opportunity within the company either. However, as I was going through the news (as an investor should) I discovered that [Honeywell is developing their own quantum computer](https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/newsroom/news/2020/06/the-worlds-highest-performing-quantum-computer-is-here), which should position it very nicely for an investor looking for safe and sustainable growth as Honeywell has some very solid financials and the potential in the quantum computing segment is huge. Due to COVID-19, their past quarterly results were significantly down as their aerospace revenues depend significantly on global air traffic, but their share prices haven\u2019t suffered much and that I believe has primarily to do with the 2 things I\u2019ll discuss in here; an exceptionally strong balance sheet and a high-growth potential industry. \n\nLet\u2019s start off looking at Honeywell\u2019s finances:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zuypj8ra7iz51.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e10faea11f73330047e1f50ac8b7ffc127d6263a\n\nFor the past few years, cash has grown at a far higher rate when in proportion to total debt\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m5nfspqk7iz51.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f9d96122a35a9924347dec2e8f7ee20a5d44c21\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bfuplukl7iz51.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8089771fef7fcf2999afa96c0e7446813990e66e\n\nHere\u2019s a peak into Honeywell\u2019s Income statement, whose growth has been pretty constant until (seemingly) last year. But the reason revenue and Net Income shrank was due to two spin-offs that provided over $10B for them. When factoring for revenue lost due to the sold assets/liabilities, Honeywell\u2019s revenue actually grew by 4% from 2018-2019\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26e8ppsm7iz51.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07d943e978251e21325c6159b15a73b4dfab42a0\n\n  \nDue to the sales of unprofitable assets, Honeywell\u2019s gross profit margins have increased significantly in the past 2 years\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eektjqhn7iz51.png?width=394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d51b0eeaac3cead22bae66dca982a51398ad2ba5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7te6lzr7iz51.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=501971c6bccb7c57ef174800aba66e23837e73fb\n\nThis explains the EBITDA growth over the past few years as well\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jr6kcmzs7iz51.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a32e33fa4eca4333101edf9dbf4487c39cc692e\n\nHere\u2019s how Honeywell\u2019s divisions split up currently, with aerospace making up most of their sales, and that division has increased sales by 9% from 2018-2019 when adjusting for spin-offs .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2zgq49vt7iz51.png?width=383&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7490c69dd659d32e04e414faaa5aab82f58626a\n\nHere\u2019s Honeywell\u2019s  cash per share, which has grown very quickly since 2015\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vwcxuoiu7iz51.png?width=377&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b3ec82ffa1c17600a0c9aaa3422a22c841badf0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere\u2019s their free cash flow, which has also been accumulating several years\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8n14lay08iz51.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=550cf128a1a7360df6c8a4da4dbe8703f7de1de6\n\nThis is Honeywell\u2019s EBITDA growth over the last 20+ years\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3l5vmzo18iz51.png?width=385&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bb50c6302bf1e0b7ebf7b3287d44c329db019a0\n\nAnd here\u2019s their SGA Expenses per $ of gross profit\n\nTheir profit consistency compared to General Electric or Boeing, two similar industrials companies is remarkable: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z4jqsbl28iz51.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cc6b16cd0110c258c8f8e9027998b1f33c05219\n\nHoneywell clearly knows how to manage their financials despite being a complicated conglomerate, which is why their stock price has recovered so well compared to BA and GE. This shows that regardless of how overvalued it may be, that\u2019ll be justified by the means of their consistently growing profits. Investors seek conservative companies such as Honeywell, especially during times of financial volatility, which is why the stock price has fared so much better during these past couple of months compared to their competitors.\n\n**The Future:**\n\nThis year despite all of the troubles with COVID-19, Honeywell was able to deliver on their promise of making the world\u2019s highest-performing quantum computer this year. You\u2019ve probably heard the term, but haven\u2019t really bothered to try and understand it. Here, I\u2019ll draw out a very basic dichotomy between a normal computer and a quantum computer.\n\nTraditional computers perform their problem solving through processing information in \u201cbits\u201d which are binary (0s and 1s). These bits are processed through transistors as electrons, but as transistors get smaller and smaller, they reach a point at which the laws of quantum mechanics prevent any further shrinkage. Quantum computers would process information as qubits, and these blocks of information can contain any proportion of 0s and 1s inside of them (superposition), and this greatly increases their information storage capabilities we\u2019d have for problem solving. Another important property of qubits is their ability to become entangled; to have two particles change in accordance with each other, unlocking powerful parallel processing opportunities.\n\nQuantum computing will be an essential technology for Artificial Intelligence, because AI is very simulation and probability based, the nature of quantum computers processing power would be ideal in order to accelerate the parallel processing needed to train and use ML models. In order to solve for the amount of simulations you need for AI-based solutions, the qubit would be the perfect means to solve them. AI solutions can range from cryptography, financial modeling, weather forecasting, and even particle physics.\n\n\u201c[For example](https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/newsroom/news/2019/11/the-future-of-quantum-computing), pharmaceutical companies could accelerate the discovery of new drugs, materials companies could discover new molecular structures, finance companies could develop new trading strategies, transportation companies could optimize logistics, and companies relying on the output of machine and deep learning could perform analyses that are impossible with classical computing of today\u201d\n\nHoneywell is partnering with Microsoft Azure Quantum to enable their computer and they already have a client using it in JP Morgan. Honeywell Ventures has also invested in two large quantum computing companies, Zapata and Cambridge Quantum. Add to that Honeywell\u2019s quantum supremacy: \u201cWith a quantum volume of 64, the Honeywell quantum computer is twice as powerful as the next alternative in the industry\u201d\n\nDue to the particularly industrial nature of quantum computers themselves, Honeywell is actually not a surprising entrant into this space. They already have an extensive software segment, and aren\u2019t a slouch there by any means either. Honeywell\u2019s system has [double](https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/news/252491505/Honeywells-quantum-computer-makes-a-quantum-volume-leap) the quantum volume of IBM\u2019s quantum computer. Honeywell also \u201c[unveiled](https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/news/252491505/Honeywells-quantum-computer-makes-a-quantum-volume-leap) a two-tier subscription plan designed to make it easier and less expensive for users to upgrade quantum systems\u201d. If Honeywell can successfully create a subscription model for easier quantum accessibility, it would be the next biggest enterprise solution software, magnitudes greater than something simple like CRM. It\u2019s obviously a very complicated and foggy outlook still as to the mysteries of quantum computing, but we know the potential would be tremendous and it could create another leap in the types of problems we can solve as a civilization. \n\nNot only is a Honeywell a decent value stock by itself, it also has tons of potential with this new segment which investors are clearly pricing in. There are pretty much no events or anything that can cause some awesome volatility for us to bank off, but I think in the next 2-5 year span we'll see a good amount of growth if this works out, so hold stock, but be on the lookout for any announcements that you could possibly play (again no short term play here, sorry)\n\nPositions: stonk",

        "selftext": "supp guys, hope you are ready for another busy week of loss porn and short selling reports that gonna destroy your accounts. \n\nFor all those of you who missed the pltr and gme train or are too scared to get in (if you are than gtfo of this subreddit), I'm going to show you a company that is so undervalued it hurts and its to take off soon\ud83d\ude80\n\n**So what is Alteryx?**\n\nglad you asked, Alteryx is a data analytics data science company that provides a platform for companies to perform analysis of the data, share it, and deploy lots of analytic models. The platform can be used by business analysts, programmers, and trained data scientists. The company wants to solve the problem of wasting time in the organization for doing simple Data analytics. As for 2020 60 BILLION DOLLARS per year wasted on analysts doing repetitive manual work in spreadsheets. The uniqueness of this company is that the interface of the platform is very intuitive and user friendly, using drag and drop interface and mainly reduces the need to write complex software code. Their platform is designed to interact with almost any data source, starting from IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP to AWS, Google Analytics, Workday, and more.\n\n**Who are the customers?**\n\nSo the company has, as of 2020, approx. 7000 customers in more than 90 countries and big names like Netflix, Salesforce, Toyota, Chevron, Uber, Twitter, Xerox, Nasdaq, and many more. The company already has a name in the big boys' playground and we can expect it to continue to expand. \n\n**Tell me more, please.**\n\nNo problem amigo. The company continues its growth strategy by a series of acquisitions mainly for developing tools and talented people. in 2019 they acquired ClearStory Data mainly because the developers are very good and can leverage them to help to develop and improve their tools. They acquired Feature Labs to augment their machine learning capabilities and to penetrate to the East coast of the US. Also the company announced strategic alliances with Adobe, UiPath and ABBYY to accelerate adoption of APA (analytic process automation) which altreyx is a leader at. \n\nAlteryx is a subscription-based software which makes it a SaaS company the same as TTD, Shopify and so on, but it focuses on analytics. Their main competitors are the big software companies (IBM, Microsoft, SAP) and some small ones which most of them are private.                  So in order to compare them to check if they are under/overvalued, I will use companies in the same field as Datadog, Splunk, and more.\n\n**Let's dig in for some numbers**\n\nAnnual revenue has increased from 86M to 418M in just 4 years (2016-2019) that is a 48% CAGR which is amazing. This year the company expects to grow revenues at around 15% mainly because of covid, which made companies cut expenses.\n\nQ3 revenues growth is 38% YOY, customer growth is 24% YOY.                                                        Gross Margin is 93% (Amazing) Operating Margin is 24%. This company is super efficient and with great margins.\n\nThe company is profitable as of the 3Q with a positive EPS of 0.07. It uses more than 50% of its gross profit for R&amp;D which is exactly what we want to see in a growing tech company.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nCash is down to 95M from 409M mainly because of acquisitions, but short term investments are almost double YOY with 627M. **Current Ration** is 1:4 approx. and **asset to liabilities ratio** is 1:1.5 so the company is indeed solvent and can survive even black swans like covid.                 Liabilities wise the company has 650M in convertible bonds which as we see can be covered by the short-term investments, It is something we should consider when the company starts to underperform, not now though. \n\nCash from Operating Activities for the 3Q is 16.3 M an improvement of 20%                              FCF is negative for the quarter mainly because of the investments they made (240M) \n\nSo the company is performing really well so far this year and is able to grow despite covid and companies reducing expenses. Of course, they need to increase their FCF but as long as they are growing and acquiring companies it's all good.\n\n**Let's use some gay TA to see what's going on**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AYX 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/eu91ywiifd261.jpg?width=1374&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96335b788ca104400101c7f29fdc13435ce4aac7)\n\nWell as you see AYX is in a range for quite a while (since May) with 104 and 80 acting as support and 150 and 178 as resistance. It hits 104 twice and couldn't break it and in the last 2 weeks, it tried again, and again was denied. \n\nSo the stock can now go to 150 easily or contest again the 104 level. with the tech trend going up I can see it going to retest that 150 level hoping to break it.\n\n**Now we compare this company with other companies**\n\n \n\n* SNOW: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~100x\n* DDOG: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 40x\n* MongoDB: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 25x\n* **Alteryx: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 15x**\n* JFROG: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 30x \n* PLTR \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 50x\n\n(thanks  [u/xwpv8j62](https://new.reddit.com/user/xwpv8j62/) for the info)\n\nAs you see AYX is the most UNDERVALUED company here which means a lot of room to grow.\n\nGross Margin:\n\n**AYX- 92%**\n\nDDOG- 78%\n\nSNOW - 55%\n\nMongoDB- 69%\n\nP/S Ratio:\n\n**AYX-  16.95**\n\nDDOG- 51.71\n\nSNOW - 150.15\n\nMONGODB-  30.88\n\nPLTR - 47.76\n\nAYX has the best margin, best ratios, and still is way undervalued than its peers. This is wrong and YOU have a chance to take advantage of it.\n\n**TL:DR,**  Shares and January Calls at 120/130 strike will do the work.\n\nHave fun guys happy trading and tendies for y'all.",

        "selftext": "My post [last Sunday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmbuff/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_this/) where I talk about my positions. [On Wednesday I did a follow up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jo3up7/4k_in_realized_gains_from_sunday_positions_next/) and discussed why I held some, closed others, and also why I opened up cash-secured-puts on QCOM right before earnings for a $450 pay-day.\n\nKeep in mind I only sell puts and buy shares. I made $4k on putting roughly $80k of collateral down for buying shares if I end up getting assigned. My true profit was about 5% last week with relatively low-risk positions where if they went against me I would bag-hold until profitable. When you are willing to bag-hold for months you literally cannot lose on any position (not financial advice). If you're ready to take your trading to the next level and do some technical ANAL(ysis) with me, then follow along. For those of you that hate money close this thread immediately.\n\nLastly, before I start. This is my game-plan for tomorrow's open. A lot depends on the price action in the morning. If market is down big or flat in the morning it will help me sell puts or buy shares, if we open hulk green then I just may need to wait. I haven't entered any of these positions yet. Normally I don't do this many positions, but it's earnings so its time to YOLO on some theta decay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore we start, when you look at my charts:\n\n**PINK = CHANNEL LINES** where the stock bounces between that range. When a stock exits a channel it either:\n\n1. Comes right back down into the channel or\n\n2. Begins to form a new channel.\n\nYou will never know which option happened until after-the-fact.\n\n**BLUE = SUPPORT OR RESISTANCE LINES**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll positions listed should be expected to expire this Friday the 13th of November. You can always go out further to collect more premium. It all depends on your strategy and what you are comfortable with.\n\n**DDOG - Earnings on Tuesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9quq9wx0i3y51.png?width=1964&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91186ec0288bd562ee7a4fc31f96f4de3591efc7\n\nDDOG provides cloud-based services. They shit the bed last earnings and the stock tanked 20% the next day. Am I worried about that happening again? Of course. Do I think it will? No. They are currently trading 10% higher than they were from market-close of their last earnings call. For any of you that have been following the stock, they landed a huge deal with Microsoft and we are about to find out just how much value that contract will bring. For that reason I think it will put a hard floor on where the stock might drop to.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$95p strike for $4.25 premium expiring this week will net you a return of about 4.5%. \n\nBreak-even only reached if stock drops to $90.75.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RKT - Earnings on Tuesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1r6vebe2i3y51.png?width=1968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a41d32126ce49e2e91ec8b05af193af5bfd916a\n\nRKT is somewhat of a recent IPO so the stock price is all over the place. What I do see on the chart is some strong support at the $18 and $20 level. The trend is currently down, but it looks like the stock might be reversing and breaking into a new channel through earnings this week. Good earnings will rocket this stock back to $25+, poor earnings we can re-test the $20 level. I like the upside on this one relative to what the downside might be. I'll be selling puts here.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$20p strike for $0.75 premium will have a return of 3.75%\n\nBreak-even is reached if the stock drops below $19.25\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RVLV - Earnings on Wednesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dx4hk495i3y51.png?width=1954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e262fb8fd220ac069fb0b822e6b2030c88392ec9\n\nRevolve crushed earnings on their last report and the stock went up 25%. You can see the stock has been trading in channel (pink lines) and is sitting comfortably somewhere near the high portion of the channel. Each time the stock price exited the channel to the upside it was rejected and pulled right back down. Generally it takes a break-through of the supply zones (resistance) or a big event to exit a channel and form a new trend. If we see some downside from earnings we might get a bounce off the $18 level. I'll be selling some puts there.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$18p for $0.85 premium will have return of $4.7%\n\nBreak-even reached if the stock drops below $17.15\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PTON - Earnings last week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tqfvpvl6i3y51.png?width=1956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f4a5802a15a0769523eee117083da0b6805d19f\n\nPeloton reported earnings last week. Management summarized to us that demand was still very high and they had trouble keeping up with it. Pretty fucking solid. This stock is literally a meme, but I do think it will be bought up on any dips. IV is also pretty high so I'll be selling weekly puts at the $115 or $120 level when I get a chance.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$120p at $2.25 premium for a return of 1.9%, break-even at $117.75\n\n$115p at $1.00 premium for a return of 0.85%, break-even at $114\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**V - Not earnings play**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppd3x268i3y51.png?width=1836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58093caef63d46861d8751d5ea4826d9c69135f0\n\nVisa is one of the more predictable stocks. The dip to $180 two weeks ago was an early Christmas gift. I didn't draw any channel zones with my magical crayons here because this thing just bounces back and forth between resistance and support zones. V is currently trading at the pinnacle of the resistance line. If it gets rejected expect another dip back to $195 or even $190. If it breaks through we might see a continuation in momentum all the way up to $215. Why? We might see some follow through on last week's move. All the other times it was rejected by $200 from July through August it was on small moves and lower volume.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nIV is low on Visa, personally I would just outright buy the shares here. You can sell the weekly $210 covered call for some extra pocket money. I doubt this will break-through by end of next week and if it does you've already won on your shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pro Tip:** Cash-secured-puts are a much \"safer\" way to make money. There is a misconception about selling higher volume of credit spreads instead of 1 or 2 cash-secured-puts because when you lose on a credit spread you are realizing and accepting the loss. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nListen here folks, we will NEVER accept defeat. We might lose the battle and get assigned some shares of these ultra high-quality stocks, but we will ALWAYS win the war and come out profitable. See how I am aiming here for 1-3% on each of these plays. We are winners baby so lets make that bread.",

        "selftext": "So, I\u2019m quite new to investing, but I think that I have a pretty solid-ish level of knowledge in this already. I\u2019m probably going to delete this, since this is pretty dumb, but let\u2019s get in to it...\n\nAlright. My latest post discussed about what are people\u2019s reasons why they are invested in the big-shot stocks like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google etc. OR should I say those people who are in it for the long run, why do you think they\u2019ll grow even more? \n\nI know, that many people didn\u2019t comment on it, but I was still somewhat surprised that people weren\u2019t THAT Apple friendly. Sure, people weren\u2019t disliking Apple, but they weren\u2019t that optimistic about it, which made me a bit uncertain about it. Don\u2019t get me wrong I think Microsoft &amp; the others (Amazon and Google) might have a bit more potential/room to grow than Apple, but they (Apple) aren\u2019t gonna dissappear, are they? \n\nBut I get it, the biggest companies change all the time etc, etc. But Apple is still like a good investment right? Have I just overreacted or some sort? My original plans where that $MSFT and $AAPL would hold a decent amount in my portfolio. That\u2019s still a good strategy, IF I diversify in other areas and I\u2019m not going to change these plans based on other people\u2019s opinions, BUT I shouldn\u2019t get too sentimental about it, which I mean by you should NEVER get attached to any stocks. If Apple starts to go south as a company then of course I\u2019ll get rid.\n\nMy point is: Apple is a good investment, which you can trust in, isn\u2019t it?\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "selftext": "Jfrog (FROG\ud83d\udc38) is set to leap into WSB\u2019s EoY meme stock conversation and turn you retards\u2019 portfolios greener than Kermit. It was slightly overshadowed by SNOW\u2019s IPO that happened the same day, but FROG is a rapidly growing powerhouse. Since hitting a post IPO share price high of $95.20, FROG slipped all the way to $57.14, until late this week when it rallied 15% with large bullish option positions being taken. While other hot tech stocks with similar IPO dates like SNOW and PLTR have rallied over 100%, FROG has stalled, only leaving us retards one option\u2026 meme it to triple digits.\n\n**WSB Thesis**\n\nRecent IPO? \u2611\ufe0f\n\nGrowthy tech company? \u2611\ufe0f\n\nCool ticker? \u2611\ufe0f\n\nMemeable name? \u2611\ufe0f\n\nThat should be good enough DD, but if you\u2019re not convinced, read on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFROG is a newly public software company with a good moat, rapidly growing revenue base, fat margins, and drastically undervalued share price compared to its peers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Business Overview**\n\n\\- Software company that streamlines the development process by providing necessary tools and visibility\n\n\\- Enables ability to software to update continuously without the user knowing\n\n\\- Functional alongside Azure, AWS, Google cloud\n\n\\- 5800+ customers w/ 75% of Fortune 500 companies as customers including Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Netflix (yes, even big tech is using Jfrog\u2019s product)\n\n\\- Exclusive partnerships (Atlssian, Pure Software, Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud) with many best in class cloud providers limit potential competition\n\n\\- $22bn TAM with a $18bn opportunity for FROG by 2024 (company estimates)\n\n\\- FROG\u2019s flagship product is Artifactory, which functions as package/binary storage. They do face legitimate competition here from Github and Gitlab, but FROG is **far and away the leader in this space.** This is because FROG supports significantly more types of package formats (25+ vs. 6 and 3 respectively). Having the **best binary/package manager** is ultimately what drives FROG\u2019s value proposition and what separates them from their competitors. Since they are best-in-class here, FROG can cross and upsell their customers with other products. Simply, FROG attracts customers with their best-in-class product Artifactory and then can upsell other products. Their products become integral in a company\u2019s software stack to the extent that there is very little customer turnover (see extremely high net dollar retention rate below).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Incentivized Leadership**\n\n\\- FROG was founded 10 years ago and still led by same 3 founders who own 20% of shares outstanding\n\n\\- Board and other managers own another 33% of shares outstanding\n\n\\- Leadership clearly incentivized to make this thing rocket\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Financials**\n\n\\- $206.3M revenue expected FY2021\n\n\\- Q3 2020 revenue was $38.9M, increasing 40% yoy\n\n\\- 81% Q3 gross margin, ranked 4th among top SAAS companies\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjyok6und8261.png?width=1950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49abd795025cb67c6196aa4f3b93975867d90780\n\n\\- Net dollar retention rate of 136% indicates customers are \u201cextremely sticky\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u73ue4uod8261.png?width=1950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d64f8bf5887b198688faf75f7230e690b7d1f04e\n\n\\- LTM CAC Payback of 16 months is best-in-class. This is an industry specific term and represents the amount of time it takes until the revenue generated from acquiring a customer exceeds the cost of doing so. FROG\u2019s value is extremely impressive here, as its growing revenues at a whopping 40% YoY without much of a sales and marketing spend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8nht1n2qd8261.png?width=1950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a63cd1f83b8249fe3626c9b769b2806e1c25cd2\n\n\\- Compared to peers, FROG is \u201cBest-in-class\u201d or \u201cGreat\u201d with respect to each key SAAS statistic\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pluwa6ird8261.png?width=1950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1424c9fb650a2ee5024f1cbac22348b012bbdb40\n\n**Relative Valuation**\n\nI'm not a huge fan of DCF's when it comes to valuing these growth names because some of the assumptions you're forced to make about business conditions 5-10yrs down the road determine the bulk of the company's value. A simple change in the longterm growth rate might change the company's enterprise value by 25%. I think the proper way to value FROG is by looking at their peers' valuation multiple (which reflects current market conditions favoring late duration cash flows) and determining FROG's value from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- FROG trading at \\~ 30x expected 2021 revenue\n\n\\- DDOG trading at \\~40x expected 2021 revenue\n\n\\- SNOW trading at \\~100x expected 2021 revenue\n\n\\- PLTR trading at \\~50x expected 2021 revenue\n\n\\- ZM trading at \\~50x expected 2021 revenue\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile SNOW\u2019s valuation seems a bit crazy, it\u2019s a valuable exercise to walk through what FROG would look like if it was valued like its peers. If FROG were to trade at:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n40x expected 2021 revenue -&gt; $92.49/share or 33% upside\n\n45x expected 2021 revenue -&gt; $104.05/share or 50% upside\n\n50x expected 2021 revenue -&gt; $115.62/share or 67% upside\n\n(for kicks) 100x expected 2021 revenue -&gt; $231.23 or 233% upside\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously FROG isn\u2019t growing revenue quite at SNOW\u2019s rate, so a 100x multiple might be a bit extreme, but given current valuation levels, FROG\u2019s 40% YoY growth rate should drive a valuation multiple in the 40x-50x range, yielding FROG significant upside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Recent Big Money Call Buying**\n\n\\- Recent large amounts of call buying indicate smart money is positioning bullishly for an end of year run-up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cphmrknsd8261.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41b66163d0bbb7980f113a08ea017f52f5683788\n\n**Recent Performance**\n\nAfter hitting a post-IPO high of $95 per share, FROG fell all the way to $57.14 before catching a bid late this past week with outsized volume. In doing so, FROG just broke through a recent downtrend and looks primed to breakout and test ATHs before the year\u2019s end, especially with fresh volume, bullish option positioning, and a likely rotation back to tech amid a resurgence in COVID-19.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w7it1fqtd8261.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec270a9acc019633a1559b2c725b9c978176b0b1\n\n**TLDR**\n\nFROG is a well-positioned, rapidly growing software company and is drastically undervalued compared to other hot tech companies. As smart money piles in and attention shifts back to growth after a brief vaccine rotation to value, expect FROG to hit ATH\u2019s in late 2020/early 2021\n\n**Positions**\n\nFROG 80c 12/18/20\n\nFROG 90c 12/18/20\n\nFROG 80c 1/15/21\n\nFROG 90c 1/15/21\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Happy gambling retards!***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If interested, here's an neat description of FROG's platform from their S-1**, \"We built the world\u2019s first universal package repository, JFrog Artifactory, to fundamentally transform the way that the software release cycle is managed.

        "selftext": "r/Stocks, I've been tracking my performance the last several weeks by selling theta and occasionally entering share positions. I normally post in the Options sub-reddit but just like my portfolio that is diversified in 4 stocks, I'm diversifying where I post my plays. This week I have a few positions where I will be buying shares. I thought maybe you guys would like to see my plays.\n\n**Here are the last 3 weeks of returns**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Week**|Buying Power|Profit/Loss|Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|$75,000|$4,000|5%|\n|2|$79,000|$1,600|2%|\n|3|$81,000|$1,500|1.9%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What am I doing?**\n\nI do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 3 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.\n\nI watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**\n\n**1.** I don't do spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see spreads as a \"Theta Gang\" play and is still very high risk.\n\n**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss. \n\n**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.\n\n**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling!\n\nHonestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.\n\n# Open Positions From Last Week\n\n**LULU:** 1x LULU 18 Dec 2020 PUT @ $310 strike. Currently up 45% on the play.\n\nThis is holding a lot of my buying power. I'm already up 45% on the play on the run-up it's had so far last week. Waiting for the last 40-50% profit might be laborious since the option will begin to lose theta &amp; delta as the stock price increases. Up 45% in a few days why wait another 2 weeks for the remaining 40%? I will be looking to sell this option once it hits 60% profit or so.\n\n# Chart Rules\n\n**Pink Lines** = Trading range &amp; channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.\n\n**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.\n\n# Master Plays This Week\n\n**FB - Facebook**\n\nFacebook has been on a slow and steady uptrend staying within the pink channel. It's tested support a couple times on weakness and bounced cleanly off them each time. Stock price at $269 (nice) is currently at the lower range of the uptrend channel. I think we'll see some continued momentum upward. If we get another re-test of some lows I think we will find some support at $260 and again at $250. IV is pretty low for facebook, so buying shares and selling weekly covered calls at 0.15 delta for a little extra premium might be better return than put-selling.\n\n**Positions on the watch:**\n\nDec 18 $260 PUT sold to open. Premium collected: $610, return: 1.5% in 4 weeks. \n\nBreak-even price would be if the stock closes below $253.90 by December 18 (currently $270).\n\nOR\n\n100x shares \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**KR - Kroger**\n\nKroger has always been a boring stock. I've labeled in purple where Buffet announced his stake. The stock shot up after the news and has been range-bound staying between $31-$34 with a slight uptrend. I think KR will react somewhat similar to WMT's stock price with a slow and steady upward grind. If so, we are at the bottom of the channel looking for continued momentum upward. Kroger reports earnings in 2 weeks and might provide a little extra premium on some plays.\n\n**Plays on the watch:**\n\nDec 11 $31.50 PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $65, return: 2% in 3 weeks.\n\nOR\n\nIV is low again, so owning some shares and selling CC against might also be a good move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MSFT - Microsoft**\n\nClassic Microsoft, not really doing much until it does. This chart only displays the last 6 months, but zooming further out you will see MSFT only goes up, albeit rather slowly. Last 3 months it's been in a slight uptrend bouncing between the $200 and $215/220 levels. Currently at the bottom of the trend channel, and might see some continued momentum going up. Big time support at $200 if we do see a little dip.\n\n**Positions on the watch:**\n\nDec 18 $200 strike PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $240, return: 1.2% in 3 weeks.\n\nOR\n\nBuying shares and selling covered calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NVDA - Nvidia**\n\nI am very bullish on NVDA in long-term. This is another ticker that will benefit as the world shifts even more-so on the tech side of things. They have been server revenue massively and they are no longer just a gaming chip company. Very bullish uptrend even if another round of covid quarantines and lockdowns hit. I think we can see this ticker re-test the $560 level and have another break-out. Otherwise we might see downtrend back to $500 or $510. \n\n**Positions on the watch:**\n\nOptions are pretty expensive here. Best play in my opinion is to be purchasing shares outright.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SHOP - Shopify**\n\nShopify has been within the same range since June. A few times it almost broke out of the $100 level, but was pulled right back in. The stock price is sitting at the lower end of the uptrend channel and close to the $1,000 support/resistance. If it breaks through this time look for some confirmation up above and into the $1,100 zone. I do like e-commerce long-term and think SHOP is at the very top of this list when you think e-commerce.\n\n**Positions on the watch:**\n\nOptions here are also very expensive, I think I might purchase some shares and look for a quick 3-4% pop this or next week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll be posting an update tomorrow morning with more potential theta plays and what I've entered.\n\nTime to dial in your trading, let's get this bread.",

So I just didn't check for weeks but I found in real life I was a lot more uptight, getting more angry at people for no reason, irrational moods of despair or sadness.  Constantly worrying if I was losing money.  I couldn't advance in my career or even grow in my personal life because I felt like I was trapped in a prison and stuck to my portfolio.  5 months later I said screw it, and just sold everything.

        "selftext": "I just wanna start off by saying, it's no coincidence that this news came yesterday - on RELEASE DAY which **also** happens to be the day when short interest data was to be released. That's what you call execution *chef kiss*.\n\nYes, this is only the beginning. The console cycle begins has just begun and GameStop is the largest retailer of games and consoles in the world, with over **5,000** stores worldwide in 10 countries. This cycle will lasts (at least 5) years, as all have previously. GME's pivot to e-commerce combined with an entry into the gaming equipment market will be the defining edge for GameStop.\n\nGameStop. The only place you *know* will have whatever gaming-related item you want - with same day delivery in many locations. This is where GameStop is headed. \n\nMost of you will already have heard the news from GameStop regarding \"Voluntary Early Redemption of Senior Notes\". For anyone that's unsure, this means that they are repaying debts equivalent to $125mn *voluntarily*; as in they are not *required* to pay them back right now. \n\nWe already knew that GameStop reported $700mn+ in cash so this reaffirms that GameStop are able to use the cash for deleveraging as opposed to them being *in a tight spot for cash*, so to speak, during the pandemic. This is great news for a brick-and-mortar store (since half of Reddit wants to keep calling it that) considering the sheer number of funds that are about to flow through GameStop (as they have been on pre-orders and will continue for YEARS). I'm no longer concerned about the next earnings as the cost-cutting by Management has been ridiculous. GameStop WILL beat ER expectations.\n\nThe news of a vaccine does not negatively impact GameStop or GME stock, in my opinion. People aren't going to game any less than they were before lockdowns, simply because lockdowns are (allegedly) going to go away soon. Before covid was a thing, the gaming industry was continuing to explode as it as has been year on year. It's not gonna slow down any time soon. Not now. Not when Sony and Microsoft just blessed us the next generation of gaming consoles.\n\nAlso, short interest is down this time around but only by around 2 million shares. We still have about 68 million shares short. Any more big news and we'll be off \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1a.\n\nTo recap: \n\n-Burry/Cohen still **in**\n- u/DeepFuckingValue still *IN* (big respects for \ud83d\udc8e hands)\n-institutions increasing their stakes in GME\n-short interest still over 100% (insane, in itself)\n-new console cycle JUST started and it's going to last YEARS (GameStop bout to make bank and keep making bank)\n-debts have been reduced by $125mn\n-costs being reassessed and cut down regularly\n-MSFT deal\n-yada yada yada\n\n**TL;DR** If you thing GameStop is going bust, idk for you fam. Quit while (you think) you're ahead. It may squeeze, it may not. But if you don't think it's gonna moon, think again.\n\nI wonder I many times I said GameStop in this post.\n\nPositions: GME shares",

Full article below: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is now more than 20 years since the Nasdaq, an index of technology shares, crashed after a spectacular rise during the late 1990s. The peak in March 2000 marked the end of the internet bubble. The bust that followed was a vindication of the stringent valuation methods pioneered in the 1930s by Benjamin Graham, the father of \u201cvalue\u201d investing, and popularised by Warren Buffett. For this school, value means a low price relative to recent profits or the accounting (\u201cbook\u201d) value of assets. Sober method and rigour were not features of the dotcom era. Analysts used vaguer measures, such as \u201ceyeballs\u201d or \u201cengagement\u201d. If that was too much effort, they simply talked up \u201cthe opportunity\u201d.\n\nPlenty of people sense a replay of the dotcom madness today. For much of the past decade a boom in America\u2019s stockmarket has been powered by an elite of technology (or technology-enabled) shares, including Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. The value stocks favoured by disciples of Graham have generally languished. But change may be afoot. In the past week or so, fortunes have reversed. Technology stocks have sold off. Value stocks have rallied, as prospects for a coronavirus vaccine raise hopes of a quick return to a normal economy. This might be the start of a long-heralded rotation from overpriced tech to far cheaper cyclicals\u2014stocks that do well in a strong economy. Perhaps value is back.\n\nThis would be comforting. It would validate a particular approach to valuing companies that has been relied upon for the best part of a century by some of the most successful investors. But the uncomfortable truth is that some features of value investing are ill-suited to today\u2019s economy. As the industrial age gives way to the digital age, the intrinsic worth of businesses is not well captured by old-style valuation methods, according to a recent essay by Michael Mauboussin and Dan Callahan of Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n\nThe job of stockpicking remains to take advantage of the gap between expectations and fundamentals, between a stock\u2019s price and its true worth. But the job has been complicated by a shift from tangible to intangible capital\u2014from an economy where factories, office buildings and machinery were key to one where software, ideas, brands and general know-how matter most. The way intangible capital is accounted for (or rather, not accounted for) distorts measures of earnings and book value, which makes them less reliable metrics on which to base a company\u2019s worth. A different approach is required\u2014not the flaky practice of the dotcom era but a serious method, grounded in logic and financial theory. However, the vaunted heritage of old-school value investing has made it hard for a fresher approach to gain traction.\n\n## Graham\u2019s cracker\n\nTo understand how this investment philosophy became so dominant, go back a century or so to when equity markets were still immature. Prices were noisy. Ideas about value were nascent. The decision to buy shares in a particular company might by based on a tip, on inside information, on a prejudice, or gut feel. A new class of equity investors was emerging. It included far-sighted managers of the endowment funds of universities. They saw that equities had advantages over bonds\u2014notably those backed by mortgages, railroads or public utilities\u2014which had been the preferred asset of long-term investors, such as insurance firms.\n\nThis new church soon had two doctrinal texts. In 1934 Graham published \u201cSecurity Analysis\u201d (with co-author David Dodd), a dense exposition of number-crunching techniques for stockpickers. Another of Graham\u2019s books is easier to read and perhaps more influential. \u201cThe Intelligent Investor\u201d, first published in 1949, ran in revised editions right up until (and indeed beyond) Graham\u2019s death in 1976. The first edition is packed with sage analysis, which is as relevant today as it was 70 years ago.\n\nUnderpinning it all is an important distinction\u2014between the price and value of a stock. Price is a creature of fickle sentiment, of greed and fear. Intrinsic value, by contrast, depends on a firm\u2019s earnings power. This in turn derives from the capital assets on its books: its factories, machines, office buildings and so on.\n\nThe approach leans heavily on company accounts. The valuation of a stock should be based on a conservative multiple of future profits, which are themselves based on a sober projection of recent trends. The book value of the firm\u2019s assets provides a cross-check. The past might be a crude guide to the future. But as Graham argued, it is a \u201cmore reliable basis of valuation than some other future plucked out of the air of either optimism or pessimism\u201d. As an extra precaution, investors should seek a margin of safety between the price paid for a stock and its intrinsic value, to allow for any errors in the reckoning. The tenets of value investing were thus established. Be conservative. Seek shares with a low price-earnings or price-to-book ratio.\n\nThe enduring status of his approach owes more to Graham as tutor than the reputation he enjoyed as an investor. Graham taught a class on stockpicking at Columbia University. His most famous student was Mr Buffett, who took Graham\u2019s investment creed, added his own twists and became one of the world\u2019s richest men. Yet the stories surrounding Mr Buffett\u2019s success are as important as the numbers, argued Aswath Damodaran of New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business in a recent series of YouTube lectures on value investing. The bold purchase of shares in troubled American Express in 1964; the decision to dissolve his partnership in 1969, because stocks were too dear; the way he stoically sat out the dotcom mania decades later. These stories are part of the Buffett legend. The philosophy of value investing has been burnished by association.\n\nIt helped also that academic finance gave a back-handed blessing to value investing. An empirical study in 1992 by Eugene Fama, a Nobel-prize-winning finance theorist, and Kenneth French found that volatility, a measure of risk, did not explain stock returns between 1963 and 1990, as academic theory suggested it should. Instead they found that low price-to-book shares earned much higher returns over the long run than high price-to-book shares. One school of finance, which includes these authors, concluded that price-to-book might be a proxy for risk. For another school, including value investors, the Fama-French result was evidence of market inefficiency\u2014and a validation of the value approach.\n\nAll this has had a lasting impact. Most investors \u201calmost reflexively describe themselves as value investors, because it sounds like the right thing to say\u201d, says Mr Damodaran. Why would they not? Every investor is a value investor, even if they are not attached to book value or trailing earnings as the way to select stocks. No sane person wants to overpay for stocks. The problem is that \u201cvalue\u201d has become a label for a narrow kind of analysis that often confuses means with ends. The approach has not worked well for a while. For much of the past decade, value stocks have lagged behind the general market and a long way behind \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks, their antithesis (see chart 1). Old-style value investing looks increasingly at odds with how the economy operates.\n\nIn Graham\u2019s day the backbone of the economy was tangible capital. But things have changed. What makes companies distinctive, and therefore valuable, is not primarily their ownership of physical assets. The spread of manufacturing technology beyond the rich world has taken care of that. Any new design for a gadget, or garment, can be assembled to order by contract manufacturers from components made by any number of third-party factories. The value in a smartphone or a pair of fancy athletic shoes is mostly in the design, not the production.\n\nIn service-led economies the value of a business is increasingly in intangibles\u2014assets you cannot touch, see or count easily. It might be software; think of Google\u2019s search algorithm or Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system. It might be a consumer brand like Coca-Cola. It might be a drug patent or a publishing copyright. A lot of intangible wealth is even more nebulous than that. Complex supply chains or a set of distribution channels, neither of which is easily replicable, are intangible assets. So are the skills of a company\u2019s workforce. In some cases the most valuable asset of all is a company\u2019s culture: a set of routines, priorities and commitments that have been internalised by the workforce. It can\u2019t always be written down. You cannot easily enter a number for it into a spreadsheet. But it can be of huge value all the same.\n\n## A beancounter\u2019s nightmare\n\nThere are three important aspects to consider with respect to intangibles, says Mr Mauboussin: their measurement, their characteristics, and their implications for the way companies are valued. Start with measurement. Accounting for intangibles is notoriously tricky. The national accounts in America and elsewhere have made a certain amount of progress in grappling with the challenge. Some kinds of expenditure that used to be treated as a cost of production, such as r&amp;d and software development, are now treated as capital spending in gdp figures. The effect on measured investment rates is quite marked (see chart 2). But intangibles\u2019 treatment in company accounts is a bit of a mess. By their nature, they have unclear boundaries. They make accountants queasy. The more leeway a company has to turn day-to-day costs into capital assets, the more scope there is to fiddle with reported earnings. And not every dollar of r&amp;d or advertising spending can be ascribed to a patent or a brand. This is why, with a few exceptions, such spending is treated in company accounts as a running cost, like rent or electricity.\n\nThe treatment of intangibles in mergers makes a mockery of this. If, say, one firm pays $2bn for another that has $1bn of tangible assets, the residual $1bn is counted as an intangible asset\u2014either as brand value, if that can be appraised, or as \u201cgoodwill\u201d. That distorts comparisons. A firm that has acquired brands by merger will have those reflected in its book value. A firm that has developed its own brands will not.\n\nThe second important aspect of intangibles is their unique characteristics. A business whose assets are mostly intangible will behave differently from one whose assets are mostly tangible. Intangible assets are \u201cnon-rival\u201d goods: they can be used by lots of people simultaneously. Think of the recipe for a generic drug or the design of a semiconductor. That makes them unlike physical assets, whose use by one person or for one kind of manufacture precludes their use by or for another.\n\nIn their book \u201cCapitalism Without Capital\u201d Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake provided a useful taxonomy, which they call the four Ss: scalability, sunkenness, spillovers and synergies. Of these, scalability is the most salient. Intangibles can be used again and again without decay or constraint. Scalability becomes turbo-charged with network effects. The more people use a firm\u2019s services, the more useful they are to other customers. They enjoy increasing returns to scale; the bigger they get, the cheaper it is to serve another customer. The big business successes of the past decade\u2014Google, Amazon and Facebook in America; and Alibaba and Tencent in China\u2014have grown to a size that was not widely predicted. But there are plenty of older asset-light businesses that were built on such network effects\u2014think of Visa and Mastercard. The result is that industries become dominated by one or a few big players. The same goes for capital spending. A small number of leading firms now account for a large share of overall investment (see chart 3).\n\nPhysical assets usually have some second-hand value. Intangibles are different. Some are tradable: you can sell a well-known brand or license a patent. But many are not. You cannot (or cannot easily) sell a set of relationships with suppliers. That means the costs incurred in creating the asset are not recoverable\u2014hence sunkenness. Business and product ideas can easily be copied by others, unless there is some legal means, such as a patent or copyright, to prevent it. This characteristic gives rise to spillovers from one company to another. And ideas often multiply in value when they are combined with other ideas. So intangibles tend to generate bigger synergies than tangible assets.\n\nThe third aspect of intangibles to consider is their implications for investors. A big one is that earnings and accounting book value have become less useful in gauging the value of a company. Profits are revenues minus costs. If a chunk of those costs are not running expenses but are instead spending on intangible assets that will generate future cashflows, then earnings are understated. And so, of course, is book value. The more a firm spends on advertising, r&amp;d, workforce training, software development and so on, the more distorted the picture is.\n\nThe distinction between a running expense and investment is crucial for securities analysis. An important part of the stock analyst\u2019s job is to understand both the magnitude of investment and the returns on it. This is not a particularly novel argument, as Messrs Mauboussin and Callahan point out. It was made nearly 60 years ago in a seminal paper by Merton Miller and Francesco Modigliani, two Nobel-prize-winning economists. They divided the value of a company into two parts. The first\u2014call it the \u201csteady state\u201d\u2014assumes that that the company can sustain its current profits into the future. The second is the present value of future growth opportunities\u2014essentially what the firm might become. The second part depends on the firm\u2019s investment: how much it does, the returns on that investment and how long the opportunity lasts. To begin to estimate this you have to work out the true rate of investment and the true returns on that investment.\n\nThe nature of intangible assets makes this a tricky calculation. But worthwhile analysis is usually difficult. \u201cYou can\u2019t abdicate your responsibility to understand the magnitude of investment and the returns to it,\u201d says Mr Mauboussin. Old-style value investors emphasise the steady state but largely ignore the growth-opportunities part. But for a youngish company able to grow at an exponential rate by exploiting increasing returns to scale, the future opportunity will account for the bulk of valuation. For such a firm with a high return on investment, it makes sense to plough profits back into the firm\u2014and indeed to borrow to finance further investment.\n\nPicking winners in an intangible economy\u2014and paying a price for stocks commensurate with their chances of success\u2014is not for the faint-hearted. Some investments will be a washout; sunkenness means some costs cannot be recovered. Network effects give rise to winner-takes-all or winner-takes-most markets, in which the second-best firm is worth a fraction of the best. Value investing seems safer. But the trouble with screening for stocks with a low price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratio is that it is likelier to select businesses whose best times are behind them than it is to identify future success.\n\n## Up, up and away\n\nProperly understood, the idea of fundamental value has not changed. Graham\u2019s key insight was that price will sometimes fall below intrinsic value (in which case, buy) and sometimes will rise above it (in which case, sell). In an economy mostly made up of tangible assets you could perhaps rely on a growth stock that had got ahead of itself to be pulled back to earth, and a value stock that got left behind to eventually catch up. Reversion to the mean was the order of the day. But in a world of increasing returns to scale, a firm that rises quickly will often keep on rising.\n\nThe economy has changed. The way investors think about valuation has to change, too. This is a case that\u2019s harder to make when the valuation differential between tech and value stocks is so stark. A correction at some stage would not be a great surprise. The appeal of old-style value investing is that it is tethered to something concrete. In contrast, forward-looking valuations are by their nature more speculative. Bubbles are perhaps unavoidable; some people will extrapolate too far. Nevertheless, were Ben Graham alive today he would probably be revising his thinking. No one, least of all the father of value investing, said stockpicking was easy.",

        "selftext": "Pfizer on Monday morning [announced that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-114500360.html), developed in partnership with BioNTech, was more than 90% effective in studies and that it could distribute 50 million doses before the end of this year, and 1.3 billion doses in 2021.\n\nThe good news immediately sent [U.S. markets broadly higher](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/election-2020-stock-market-news-updates-november-9-2020-231320807.html)\u2014especially airline stocks, energy names, bank stocks, in-person entertainment like theme parks, and real estate\u2014except for a slew of key names that have seen huge gains during the pandemic, boosted by prolonged work-from-home trends.\n\nThose \u201cstay-at-home stocks\u201d were hit hard.\n\nPeloton ([PTON](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PTON/)) fell by as much as 25%; Logitech ([LOGI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LOGI/)) fell 19%; Zoom Video ([ZM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZM/)) dropped 17%; CrowdStrike ([CRWD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWD/)) fell 11%; Chewy ([CHWY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CHWY/)) fell 10%; Roku ([ROKU](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ROKU/)) sunk 7%; Netflix ([NFLX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/)) fell 6%; Slack ([WORK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WORK/)) was down 4%.\n\nThe market thinking appears to be: a widely available vaccine will prompt a return to normalcy, which will mean the end of the hockey-stick run for products and services you use in your home.\n\nBut that reductive logic doesn\u2019t apply equally well to every stay-at-home name. Rather, the post-pandemic prospects for each business have to be examined on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## Remote work won\u2019t abruptly end with a vaccine\n\nSince early on in the pandemic, analysts and experts have predicted that some form of [remote work](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-a-remote-work-boom-will-affect-salaries-jobs-and-where-people-live-190344317.html) is here to stay\u2014after all, it was a trend already growing before the pandemic. If that\u2019s the case, then many companies are going to continue to use enterprise tools like Zoom and Slack, even once offices reopen. Whether workers are in their office or at home, teams that use Slack aren\u2019t going to just stop using it.\n\nIn Zoom\u2019s case, the stock has also become extremely expensive. It trades at more than 800 times earnings, so it was arguably due for a big correction. The vaccine news provided an excuse for firms to take some profit and move into other names, like the battered stocks set to take off now that a vaccine is imminent. (As for Slack, increased competitive threat from Microsoft Teams is also contributing to its slide.)\n\nThe same \u201chere to stay\u201d thinking with the enterprise names can apply broadly to streaming services like Netflix and Roku: just because people might return to their offices doesn\u2019t mean they will stop streaming at home.\n\nIn Roku\u2019s case, the dip makes a little more sense, since Roku relies on ad revenue from ads on its home screen, and advertisers might indeed shuffle their budgets away from Roku if they think time spent on streaming will drop significantly. For Netflix, which makes its revenue from subscriptions (it doesn\u2019t sell ad space or sell user data), the stock dive would only make sense if you think a significant number of subscribers will cancel Netflix after the pandemic.\n\nPeloton is its own case: the exercise-bike company took off early in the pandemic amid staggering demand for its bikes, creating wait times of 5-10 weeks on orders. As the stock surged, some analysts warned of a \u201cpull-forward in demand,\u201d the idea that Peloton cannot sustain this level of sales and would be punished later on because shareholder expectations would get too high. But in its [fourth-quarter earnings report in September](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peloton-new-highs-q4-earnings-and-revenue-202044922.html), Peloton had its first profit and showed massive continued demand for its bikes, making the bear case look wrong. (Meanwhile, Netflix, in contrast, actually did see in Q3, and explicitly identified, a [pull-forward in demand from the first half of 2020 that hurt its subscription adds](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflixs-q-3-demonstrates-the-dreaded-pandemic-pullforward-in-demand-193405344.html).) Once gyms fully reopen across the country, will Peloton bike sales really dry up?\n\nOn the other hand, Peloton stock, like Zoom, got extremely expensive (trading at a 15x P/E ratio), so it was due for a correction as soon as there was any indication that the end of the pandemic is in sight.\n\n## Buy online, pick up in store\n\nOne good example of a trend accelerated by the pandemic that is generally expected not to reverse is e-commerce and the rise of BOPIS (buy online, pick up in store) for brick-and-mortar retail.\n\n[Walmart, Target, Best Buy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-and-target-huge-ecommerce-gains-are-a-blaring-siren-to-brickandmortar-retail-192709224.html), Urban Outfitters, [Restoration Hardware](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-restoration-hardware-stock-is-up-240-during-the-pandemic-180244236.html), and [Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dicks-sporting-goods-is-wildly-outperforming-amid-the-pandemic-195504143.html) are just some of the physical retail names seeing enormous e-commerce gains, so much so that the share of U.S. retail spending attributed to e-commerce has surged to 16.1%, up from 10.8% one year ago.\n\nThose chains have also seen [huge customer adoption of curbside pickup](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/curbside-pickup-is-exceptionally-sticky-and-will-continue-postpandemic-mc-kinsey-retail-expert-183712446.html). Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods president Lauren Hobart said in August that Dick\u2019s \u201canticipated originally that we would see a large drop-off \\[in curbside\\] when the stores reopened, but that is not the case.\u201d Many retail analysts predict that even after the pandemic, consumers will stick with their new behavior and shop online, for home delivery or curbside pickup.\n\nWhole Foods CEO [John Mackey disagrees](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whole-foods-ceo-does-not-think-online-grocery-will-remain-the-norm-postpandemic-food-is-different-175009302.html)\u2014he thinks some people will stick to online ordering, but that it won\u2019t remain the norm for most. Even if he\u2019s right, what that creates is a hybrid landscape for physical retail and physical grocery.\n\nThe same applies to remote work: even if a large number of workers return to the office, many more workers than before the pandemic are going to keep working from home, which should be good for enterprise names like Zoom, Slack, and CrowdStrike.\n\nWharton professor Mauro Guillen writes in his new book, \u201c2030: How Today\u2019s Biggest Trends Will Collide and Reshape the Future of Everything,\u201d that beyond the pandemic we should expect a \u201chybrid model\u201d of working that allows for remote-work a few days a week, and continued automation of service warehouses.\n\n\u201cMost of what I hear from companies right now is that we're going to go to a hybrid model,\u201d [Guillen told Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/whartons-mauro-guillen-trends-shape-203000781.html) in August. \u201cSo, a majority of American employees who are working from home now, they're saying, \u2018Yes, I would like to have a remote component in my work week, but I would like to also go to the office.\u2019\u201d\n\nLogitech CEO Bracken Darrell sounds a similar tune. He insists that the recent sales boom for Logitech\u2019s computer accessories [can\u2019t be totally chalked up the pandemic, but to four \u201csecular\u201d shifts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/logitech-ceo-4-trends-are-driving-our-sales-boost-not-just-the-pandemic-141208902.html): \u201cOne is video going everywhere, whether it\u2019s offices or webcams. The second one is the rise of gaming as a professional sport, and as a bigger and bigger spectator sport; it\u2019ll be the biggest collection of sports in the world one day. The third one is working from anywhere. The fourth is everybody creating their own content and streaming it, which lends itself well to our microphones. All four of those are long-term secular trends.\u201d\n\nBut of course, Darrell has to hope so for his business. The other companies labeled \u201cstay at home names\u201d during the pandemic are all hoping their momentum continues, even once we get a vaccine.\n\n[Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pandemic-stay-at-home-stocks-like-peloton-zoom-roku-tank-on-pfizer-vaccine-newsis-it-an-overreaction-183519186.html)",

        "selftext": "I started investing around July this year. I put about half of my money in at the start and gradually bought on the dips. Yet even with the general bull run and the ridiculous broad market rally these last few days, I feel like every single stock I touch ends up disappointing. Here's my portfolio:\n\nSPGI - Bought it since it was a solid company with a strong history of market-beating growth. Down 2.9%.\n\nNDAQ - Bought for similar reasons to SPGI. Down 2.3%.\n\nBABA - I saw it as a cheaper Amazon that had more room to grow too. It was one of my best individual picks until last week. Down 9.4%.\n\nWORK - Thought this would be a nice growth stock that would benefit from the pandemic. It had some good moments but currently sitting at a depressed state. Luckily I didn't chase too much and only bought on its many many dips. Down 1.8%.\n\nEA - Video game companies ought to do well during the pandemic right? Well unfortunately not this one. Down 9.3%.\n\nLMT - My recovery play. Thought it would be a better investment than Boeing since it had a better balance sheet and wasn't bleeding cash. Vaccine announcement barely made it budge. Should've bought Boeing instead. Down 3.1%.\n\nGOLD - Bought it when I heard that Buffett bought this company and used it as a way to have exposure to gold prices. Kept averaging down on the dips, but man is it painful. Down 7.6%\n\nKR - My value play. The recent shift from growth to value stocks has barely affected this one. Down 5.5%.\n\nPFE - Vaccine play. News of its CEO selling shares was not good to hear. Down 1.3%.\n\nMSFT - Big tech stock of choice. Unfortunately I bought a bit high. Barely breaking even but only because I had extra cash to buy on the dips. Down 0.3%\n\nAAL - The only stock I have that is in the green at 8% up, but it was also a tiny speculative position that barely affected portfolio performance.\n\nCurrently I'm debating whether I should sell most of these at a loss and move entirely to index funds. Or would it be better to wait it out in the hopes that they would mean revert back to outperforming the market?",

AvePoint is increasing its recurring revenue, providing predictable forecasting for its financial estimates.\n\n**Why should you buy?** \n\n* Microsoft Office 365 has a worldwide market share of 41.59%, and Microsoft Powerpoint with 5.06%, for a combined **46.65%**. (Google leading with 50.59%)\n* AvePoint is in presence with companies like **Atlassian Corporation**, **RingCentral**, **ServiceNow,** **ZoomInfo Technologies**, and **Zoom Video Communications.** (The 5 companies mentioned combined have an average price of: $**297**).\n* Stock Price is $10.87 currently. (Minimal Risk, if merger fails, you get $10 per share back.)\n\n**Position:** 50 Shares at 10.50.\n\n***Why only 50 shares?*** I'm 18 and broke, so instead of using this money for something like a PlayStation or Macbook, I would rather invest it and hopefully double/triple/quadruple my money. \n\n***HOPEFULLY APXT HITS $20 AND UP BEFORE BOXING DAY.***\n\n***DISCLAIMER: I'M A RETARDED 18 YEAR OLD, DON'T TAKE THIS POST TOO SERIOUSLY, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH ETC.

        "selftext": "I've been invested in $amzn since 2016 and have done round about a 5X on my investment. With Amazon running up to over $3k I've decided to reassess my investment once again, this time focusing on more than just the fundamentals because it's such a unique bunch of businesses under one umbrella.\n\nI took this info and really analyzed it also making a detailed video, and I've personally come to the answer that $amzn is nowhere near done growing.\n\nThis is not an extensive list, but here are some of the top areas keeping me attracted to $amzn:\n\n1. Interviewing philosophy. Especially how they have over 3400 \"Bar Raisers\" at the company focused on removing positive/negative bias from interviewing and ensuring they \"Raise the Bar\" with each hire. \n\n2. How Amazon has stuck to the same principles laid out by Jeff Bezos in 1994. This clearly shows a very deep running corporate culture which is difficult to compete with. \n\n3. Continued growth mindset, focusing on Customers rather than Stock holders. Even as a stock holder myself this pleases me. There are always stockholder interests and Amazon has always put it on the back burner, reinvesting profits and having a longterm strategy. This makes it one of the best growth stocks to own, as it is clearly still undervalued because of profits seeming to not exists, when its just being reinvested. \n\n4. Amazon Web Services. This is the largers Cloud Computing provider in the world and tops market share (31%) even over Microsoft Azure (20%) and Google Cloud(6%). Last year AWS was 13% of Operating Revenue but 71% of operating income. It's a key business in a market that's spiking. And 3rd party analysts like Gartner puts AWS down as the market leader for the past 10years.\n\nAnyways those are just some high-level elements I covered during my analysis...but...I'm curious to hear others thoughts?\n\nAre you invested in $amzn and if so, what are your top reasons or Amazon businesses for continuing to hold or buy even more? Or alternatively, if you're not investing in $amzn why not? \n\nWill be interesting to get some varied perspectives, as Amazon is such a beast and a nevereneding topic.",

        "selftext": "APXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.\n\nAPXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.\n\n'AvePoint\u2019s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft\u2019s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'\n\nAddressable market: $33 billion by 2022.\n\nThe company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022.\n\n**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**\n\nManagement: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC.\n\nBig name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs,\n\nBig advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.\n\nThis seems similar to the other data related plays weve had this year \\*cough\\* PLTR \\*cough\\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.\n\nThe SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger)\n\n[https://www.avepoint.com/](https://www.avepoint.com/)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23)\n\n[https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html)\n\n[https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac](https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac)\n\nDisclaimer: I have APXT shares and this does not constitute financial advice.",

        "selftext": "Listen up you degenerates.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been pouting all month because you missed out on election week rally, post-Pfizer Dow rally (because you were a pussy who held cash), NIO \ud83d\ude80, or you were simply \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b, then I have the play the next stock to fawn over.\n\n**What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**\n\nEven though this company started trading publicly only a month~ or so, this is a legit company that already pulls in billion dollars in revenue. Company\u2019s products are beloved by all the losers in your life (i.e. your loser childhood friend who works at McDonald\u2019s and spends all their paycheck towards RH YOLO trades, weed, and video games).\n\nThis is the number one seller of high-performance computer memory, cases, power supplies, coolers and gaming keyboards as well as #2 in performance controllers and streaming gear. Per Andy Paul (CEO) in their most recent earnings call, he reported that most of their product lines maintain a top 3 US market share positions, with several number one positions according to data from NPD group.\n\n\n**So what? Why should I care?**\n\nListen you retard. When there\u2019s unexpected nudity during that HBO show that you watch on Sunday night, you say thank you. You don\u2019t stop and ask, \u201cMan, I thought this show was rated PG. Why is there nudity?\u201d Similarly, when someone tells you about a promising stock that is going to double, triple, and quadruple from the current price point, you fucking listen and continue to read the wisdom documented in this long ass fucking post.\n\nCorsair generates their revenue from two segments.\n\nSegment 1: Gamer/Creator Peripherals.\n\nFor you retards who can\u2019t understand big words like peripherals, this segment includes gaming keyboards, mice, controllers, headsets and other streaming equipment such as capture cards and microphones. And I am not talking about $10 mice or $20 keyboards that your broke ass buy at Staples. These are high margin, high end, top of the line gaming/computer peripherals used by those talent-less hacks streaming live on Twitch, YouTube, OnlyFans, etc for \u201cdonations\u201d. Today, 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming video content on streaming platforms for an average of almost 6 hours per week. There are over 6 million committed streamers in the world today who viewed over 12 billion streaming hours in 2019 alone.\n\nThe revenue in this segment spiked 129% YOY in the most recent quarter to $161.1 million. It made up for 35% of CRSR\u2019s total revenue. This is high fucking margin business, which means Corsair is a winner that rips off those losers mentioned above. Their gross margin was 37.1% in the most recent quarter.\n\nSegment 2: Gaming Components and Systems.\n\nThis segment includes sales of equipment such as computer cases, RAM, cooling solutions, power supply units and pre-built gaming PCs. You know those losers with a big ass gaming desktop PCs with \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b LED lights around the case? Those \ud83e\udd21 s spend shit load of money on these gaming systems because it makes them feel important when they play video games with other losers. The gross margin for this segment is 28%. Not too shabby.\n\nIn the most recent filing, their total revenue increased 60.7% YOY to $457.1 million and the gross margin jumped significantly. Adjusted operating income increased 194% to $61.4 mil.\n\n**Ok. So they rocked this quarter. But what about their future? What is their outlook?**\n\nWell you ungrateful greedy f*ck, CRSR is well positioned to benefit from long term growth trends in the gaming hardware market, making it an ideal play for retards like you who can only ask questions like, \u201cPS5 or the new XBOX? SNE or MSFT?\u201d. No you retard. Those stocks are not gaming pure plays, and they are not fucking cheap. Your broke ass can\u2019t afford them. \n\nCRSR can rely on the gamer and creator peripherals business to drive sustained growth in the future. Why? Because of the fast growing e-sports market. According to some smart ass industry experts, they estimate that the global e-sports market could clock a compound annual growth rate of over 24% thru 2027. That means, the demand for video game streaming equipment and other peripherals is expected to increase in the coming years, adding $2.8 billion worth of incremental revenue over the next four years in this market alone.\n\nCRSR reportedly has 18.3% of the peripherals market today and controls 41.9% of the PC components market. The entire PC gaming hardware market is expected to add $3.6 billion in incremental revenue this year, thanks to all the losers playing games at home due to COVID. The total market size for PC gaming hardware market today is $40 billion, of which 83% was spending from competitive and committed gamers. These are true retards who will spend between $1,000 to over $1,800 on gaming hardware and accessories. \n\n**But the stock ran up quite a bit. Should I wait will it drops?**\n\nThe stock is still cheap. Their POS (Price to Sales) ratio is 1.91. In comparison, Logitech\u2019s POS is at 4.3. Additionally, CRSR is currently priced at 80x trailing earnings and has a forward P/E ratio of 26. Both are favorable compared to their peers.\n\nBecause of COVID, upcoming holidays and other factors/trends that are favorable to Corsair (i.e. anticipated next generation gaming hardware/GPU to be launched by NVDA and AMD), CRSR is expected to generate full year revenue of $1.6 billion this year (which is 45% increase YOY)\n\n- Second Wave COVID: Will force consumers to stay at home and people will need other activities apart from binging Netflix.\n\n- Holiday Retail Sales Outlook is still positive. Gaming products will be boosted by Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas shopping.\n\n- People are upgrading their home PCs. As more people stay at home or work from home, more attention is being paid to the home PC and people are spending $ on upgrades.\n\nThey focus heavily on the higher end of the market, with product focus on performance and innovation. With gaming growing rapidly and big money flowing into this market, demand for performance is increasing. CRSR\u2019s products meet the expectation of what the gamers want (i.e. speed, precision, reliability, great processing power, etc)\n\nAlthough the competitive and committed gamers accounted for 83% of the $40 billion spend in the global market for PC and streaming gears in 2019, that only accounts for 18% of the worldwide total of 524 million PC gamers in 2019 with the remaining being casual gamers, who do not often rely on specialized high end gears yet. (Translation,there is untapped market of 82% among the 524 million PC gamers who have yet discovered the beauty of high end gaming stuff)\n\nIf the average spend of this group of gamers were to significantly move up going forward, then the market will also grow by multiples (for high end gaming stuff). \n\nThis stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers like Logitech and Razor. Not only that, the current P/E ratio of CRSR is roughly 3% below the overall P/E of NASDAQ. Additionally, looking at POS (Price to Sales) and MCS (Market Cap to Sales), CRSR is cheap by discount of 57% and 45% respectively to the NASDAQ. Sales are expected to grow next year by more than 30%.\n\n**Risks**\n\nF*ck risks. F*ck that mindset. This company is already profitable and prints money. If you retards can blindly throw money at losers like GME and NKLA, you can throw money at a company with actual sales, actual products and actual profits.\n\n**Price Target**\n\n$40+ per share by May 2021. You can play the call option or you can just buy the stock.\nEither way, it will get to $40 range and above once this stock\u2019s valuation catches up with the rest of the market. By end of 2021, I expect this stock to be $70-80. Oh, and for you retards who are risk averse, this stock is considered \u201cStay at Home\u201d stocks. It will moon during the pandemic, and it will moon after the pandemic.",

        "selftext": "So many SPACs announcing targets and merging in this economy makes sense. Just ask Chamath. \n\nMany consider it to be too late for the heavyweight SPACs currently due to the price being far from NAV (in case merger failure) and the historical trend of SPACs seeing a sharp downturn post merger. Solid companies will sustain and grow (think SPCE hitting $7 post merger then rising to $34 in the next 4 months). \n\nSo which SPACs should I look out for TODAY? \nI\u2019ll touch on my favorite one by industry below. \n\nEV: \nYou know which ones I\u2019m talking about from NKLA to HYLN to SBE to FSR. All of these have a niche where they clearly lead or are in competition with others. So which one is in a unique market that has high growth? \nHCAC is your answer. They\u2019re targeting Canoo. See my boys post here- \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/jzlwwh/mega_dd_bangbus_ev_going_public_everything_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n\nTECH:\nWith Covid-19 the workforce has shifted to remote relying on the Cloud for really everything. There are tech plays with large upside but are looking at revenue years away. Many other tech companies are filling through traditional IPOs. So which tech SPAC is one with obvious upsides? Ones with revenue, serving cloud, and deep client base. \nAPXT is your ticker for tech. They\u2019re targeting AvePoint. Insane revenue and growth. Microsoft partner with big name clients. See my boys post here-\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/jzgg44/avepoint_the_largest_microsoft_365_data/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nHEALTHCARE:\nThis is a SPAC industry that has been very underwhelming (see MPLM). There are few health SPACs to even consider making the choice that much more obvious.\nLGVW is your ticker for healthcare. They\u2019re targeting Butterfly. Backed by Bill Gates. ARK Fund just picked up shares yesterday. See my boys post here- \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/jxy6gh/lgvw_butterfly_was_on_cnbcs_top_50_disruptor_list/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nPositions:\n400 shares HCAC, $15C 2/21 \n500 shares APXT\n250 shares LGVW\n\nTLDR:\nBuy HCAC, APXT, LGVW",

Volume is already heating up.\n\nAPXT will be merging via SPAC with Microsoft partnered company AvePoint in Q1 2021. Merger valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.\n\n**AvePoint:**\n\n* AvePoint offers data management solutions for Microsoft Cloud users.\n* Is 5 time Microsoft partner of the year.\n* Currently estimated 7 million users only make up roughly 3% of total Microsoft Office 365 users, meaning there is a lot of room to grow. AvePoint believes they may even be able to hit the 10% share. Potentially 50 million future AvePoint customers.\n* Microsoft Office makes up 41% of the global market share for office applications. Big growth opportunity for AvePoint.\n* Estimated addressable market of $33 billion by 2022.\n* 2020 projected growth of 25% from previous year.\n* 25% of Fortune 500 companies use AvePoint for data management/solutions.\n\n**APXT:**\n\n* Unlike many SPACs, APXT checks out financially. They already have revenue.\n* Estimated revenue of $150 million by end of 2020. Much of this is recurring income.\n* Management made up of many key figures with access to resources and great track records.\n* Jeff Epstein is CEO, former CFO of Oracle Corporation.\n* Brad Koenig is former Head of Technology Investment at Goldman Sachs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* After hours on 11/25 was up 20% since market close.

        "selftext": "Tech stocks have soared this year as the pandemic rapidly shifted people to remote work and school. Still, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs, the five largest U.S. tech companies actually aren\u2019t overvalued.\n\nFirst off, these stocks\u2014Facebook \ufffc (ticker: FB), Apple \ufffc (AAPL), Amazon \ufffc (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft \ufffc (MSFT)\u2014are up about 49% year-to-date on average. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 is up just under 12% for the year. Before Sept. 2, these five stocks had an average multiple on the next two years of earnings of roughly 35 times, against 12 times for the other 495 stocks on the S&amp;P 500, according to Goldman Sachs data. That was the widest valuation gap between the group and the broader market since 2000\u2014before the tech bubble burst.\n\nLately, investors have taken note of the drastic surge in the five stocks\u2019 valuations. Since September 2, the group is down about 3% on average. Meanwhile, large-cap value stocks, judging by the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (VOOV), have climbed 5.2%. Now, the so-called FAAMG group is trading at roughly 31 times earnings, compared with 20 times for the other 495 stocks.\n\nMany on Wall Street are wary of big tech as these multiples would seem bound to continue falling after their meteoric rise this year, and as interest rates rise when the economy starts to see a more solid recovery. Tech stocks, after all, would see less of a benefit from a firming economy. Mostly, growth stocks such as these five tend to have idiosyncratic revenue drivers that aren\u2019t affected by changes in the economy\u2014while the revenues of value stocks like consumer discretionary are very much tied to consumer spending trends and economic growth.\n\nEvercore strategists recently said they only see S&amp;P 500 gains of roughly 5% in the next year or so because they don\u2019t expect big tech to outperform the way it has in recent history.\n\nBut David Kostin, Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief US equity strategist, argues in a note that \u201cfundamentals support higher valuation for FAAMG.\u201d\n\nKostin noted that the near-term earnings outlook for FAAMG stocks supports the current valuations. Goldman is looking for S&amp;P 500 companies to post a median annual earnings per share growth of 8% for the next few years. The tech group is expected to see EPS growth of about 17%.\n\nComparing these companies\u2019 earnings multiples to their near-term earnings growth rates\u2014which many analysts do to determine how fair a valuation is\u2014further justifies Kostin\u2019s point. Facebook\u2019s PEG ratio\u2014calculated by taking the stock\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio and dividing by its projected earnings growth rate\u2014is 1.2 times, roughly in line with in its five-year average of 1.1, according to data from FactSet. Amazon\u2019s PEG ratio is 1.6 times, notably lower than its five-year average of 2.4. Alphabet\u2019s PEG is at 1.9 against an average of 1.5, although its five-year high is above 2. Microsoft\u2019s PEG is 2, in line with its average. Apple is the most overvalued by the metric, with a PEG of 2.6 against an average of 1.5.\n\nWith the exception of Apple, these companies are expected to see EPS compound an annual rate between the midteens in percentage terms to above 30%. If investors are willing to pay top dollar for these stocks, earnings growth could continue to take them higher.\n\nAll five have dominant platforms that create seemingly endless synergies. Amazon\u2019s new online drug business, for example, offers perks to their roughly 70 million Prime members. This can drive adoption of the new offering, but can also drive new prime customers.\n\nThe point is tech stocks are pricey for good reason\u2014don\u2019t count them out.\n\nSource: Barron's",

        "selftext": " So Friday we saw the stock market down again as the dow fell almost 0,6% percent while the s&amp;p fell over 1% and the nasdaq was crushed being down almost 2and a half percent as This last week we saw the dow fell 6,5% the s&amp;p 5,6% and the nasdaq 5,5% as all 3 ended the month of october down more than 2,3%\n\nOne good thing for the US economy is that the retail stores sales has recovered and consumers are still spending excess cash especially with the holidays and black Friday up next. I believe that as much as Tuesday is important for the economy, the events that will come later in the week as the FED holds two important meatings and the latest jobs report comes in at the end of the week far outweight that\n\nAs you can see the New York Federal bank economic index is still rising, that sugests a V-Shaped recovery is continuing in the US. This index takes into consideration lots of important data from the economy.\n\nThe unemployment in the US has been decling but that rate has sharply slowed down in the last months as it\u2019s still more than double the 3,5% at the start of the year as the latest number from September was almost 8% rate of unemployment.\n\nAs you can see the most affected people are still the middle and low wage under 60k/year. As the high wage jobs unemployment rate is barely down 0,5% since January.\n\nSo the fear in the stock market saw a huge pop in the last week as the VIX (the volatility index) rose from 27,55 more than 10 points to close at over 38 this last week. This next week is probably the last with such high volatility as the upcoming big events will pass and more certainty will be in front of us . The volatility was so high as we retested the June highs and have seen a pullback 3 times after hiting those levels.\n\nDespite strong earnings last week from all big tech companies (Alphabet,Amazon,Apple, facebook and Microsoft) the companies stocks dropped amid the broader stock market sell-off with the exception of Google which posted terrific numbers to crush analysts expectation.\n\nApple is down almost 19% since the highs of September and has lost 450 billion dollars in market cap since then.\n\nThis dropped in the company has been caused by a broader stock market sell off as well as missed iphone revenues. I do believe that iphone revenues will see a huge spike in the next coming quarters as apple customers as myself will finally upgrade from older iphone to this next generation iphone which is the first to have 5G technology as well as other great improvements in capability as well as camera.\n\nA couple analysts have recently changed they\u2019re target to between 132-140 which is over 20$ from where it sit\u2019s today. That is quite good upside for the company.\n\nAs you can see they are barely down 2,7% year over year in product revenue despite not having the new iphone launch included in this financials, and overall the company still saw a 1% increase in revenue due to the huge spike in services revenue that I believe will continue especially with the Apple One bundle just being launched at the end of last week. The Total Gross margin also increase slightly but I expect this to be just a small drawback in the short-term.\n\nAlso I believe that Amazon was dragged down because of the next quarter predictions of huge costs while they only forecasted a operating income of 1 to 4 point 5 billion dollars which is below what was anticipated despite amazon web services continuing to be the largest player in cloud spending. With a 32% share of total market and a revenue of 11,6 billion dollars which Is up 29% year over year, while Azure from Microsoft comes in second and google cloud in third. There is still a lot of room to grow for all of this companies as there is still over 37% of the market provided by other companies. Also this is a great company to own for the long term as digitazation and online commerce will continue to grow, some are estimating that by 2030 amazon could have annual revenues of 1 trillion dollars $ while using conservative projections of compound annual growth for e-commerce of 10%, for the cloud services of 15% and for ad revenue of 20%, amazon could hit that mark by then. But I believe this is possible even faster than that.\n\nFacebook is the one company that I will have to analyze more in this group. They will be hit with privacy issues do to the regulatory risk and Apple\u2019s announced privacy changes. But I still do believe this to be a great company as they also own Instagram, and I really like how that part of the company is innovating and growing.\n\nWhile google seems to be back on track as the company was the laggard in the group. They have become less reliant on the search ad revenue as growth in Youtube ads and Google cloud will push the company to renewed growth in the future.\n\nAlibaba will see two big events this week as they will kick off the singles day event next week, extending the event with 3 more days rather than the usual 24-hour event, in which they will also double the products on offer. Also another big event will be the IPO of ant Group in which Alibaba will still have a big stake. I believe they are a great company the forward revenue growth estimates of 31% are higher than other tech companies like amazon, google and Microsoft while the P/E for the company is the most attractive of the group also.\n\nFord just announced that late next year they will introduce a lower priced competitor for Tesla AutoPilot and GM\u2019s super cruise, this is great news for the company as they seem to be improving the company continuasly.\n\nSome important earnings coming this week are :\n\nPaypal on Monday, which I believe is the greatest fin-tech company, on\n\nWednesday Qualcomm will announce that will be a great insight to see what Apple\u2019s iphone 12 is doing as Qualcomm is the biggest supplier for apple and on Thursday Alibaba (with ant group ipo) coming also on the same day this stock could see a surge in value.",

        "selftext": " \n\nThe news that the COVID-19 vaccine from drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) and its partner  BioNTech  (BNTX) is 90% effective, according to  Bernstein Research  strategist  Inigo Fraser Jenkins , has sent stocks scurrying like \"tracks left in a cloud chamber from particles scattering in an accelerator.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs strategists, led by  David Kostin , say the vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. \"The divisive  U.S.  presidential campaign was actually a backdrop to the main event: a public health crisis that has tragically claimed 240,000 lives in the  U.S.  since it began. However, within less than a year, a vaccine has been discovered,\" they say.\n\nThe Goldman team boosted its year-end price target on the S&amp;P 500 to 3700 from 3600, which isn't so far away from Tuesday's closing level of 3545.53. Goldman is also targeting 4300 by the end of 2021 and 4600 by the end of 2022.\n\nThe strategists expect the Pfizer vaccine, and possibly others, will receive emergency use authorization by the end of January, and sufficient doses will be available for the  U.S.  population during the first half of 2021. They increased earnings estimates, mostly reflecting the better-than-expected results for the third quarter. They also are expecting better growth in the  U.S.  next year than the market does, at 5.3% versus the consensus forecast of 3.8%. A weakening  U.S.  dollar and slack in the labor market should support S&amp;P 500 sales and margins, they add.\n\nThey are not too worried about the weight of the technology giants -- Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and  Google  owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The S&amp;P 500 would rise 9% if the FAAMG stocks trade sideways and the remaining 495 stocks rise by the historical median 12-month rise of 12%. And the S&amp;P 500 would rise 16% if the FAAMG stocks rise 5% and the remaining 495 climb 20%, which would represent an 80th percentile move based on historical distribution since 1990.\n\nAs for the debate about value or growth, the Goldman team likes both. For value stocks, the team noted that Monday was the largest single-day increase in the factor's history since 1980, while they say growth stocks should continue to benefit from weak trend economic growth and low interest rates.\n\n\"When thinking about the potential resolution of today's record valuation dispersion, investors often recall the unwind of the tech bubble, which was characterized by a two-year bear market and large negative absolute returns of the previous market leaders. More often than not, however, value rallies tend to occur in rising markets during which high valuation stocks also rise but are outpaced by the lowest valuation firms. This 'catch up' dynamic is what we expect will take place in coming months as a vaccine is approved and distributed,\" the strategists say.",

        "selftext": "What are your opinions In Dropbox? Since this summer I see more and more people on YouTube, Reddit and on other platforms that talk about Dropbox as If it is the next great tech darling. I like DBX and I think it will do well, but I doubt it will quadrouple in the next 5 years as some suggest.\n\nAlso, what is odd is the fact that 1) the pandemic did not propell this stock and 2) even though all these social media gurus talk about it and pump it, the stock fell which I believe is just short term impacience from traders and hype.\n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\nTalking valuations is has a sub 20 forward PE and recently started getting profitable. The market cap is just around 8b. Share price 19$.\n\nFinancials. It's short term assets cover is short and long term liabilities. No debt. And a future buyback program. Positive FCF.\n\nProduct. I use dropbox at work and at home with my family and I really like the fact that it's UI is easy to understand and use, when comparing it to OneDrive and GoogleDrive. So, user growth+ a nice product which is expanding into smart workspace, not just cloud storage. Also, they bought hellosign, which could be second to DocuSign in the digital signature space. \n\nWhen glancing who owns DBX shares, we can see really large funds like vanguard, black rock and the rennaisance group. Also insiders hold 30 percent of the company and they did not sell any shares recently. One co-founder is still actively with the company and is the CEO for 13 yrs. I love it when founders stay and fight for the company, it gives the company credibility.\n\nPossible tailwinds: included into NASDAQ 100 and S&amp;P500. Smart workspace makes a big difference and people accelerate to it's products. Hellosign gets a DocuSign type valuation. A big fund actively promotes the company.\n\nThe risks: google or microsoft focus more on smart workspace and kill dbx product by underpricing. Extending into smart workspace fails and it kills their financials.\nPretty large shareholder dillution in the past. So that growth/dillution is not that great.\nCEO and co-founder leaves the company\nMeh expected revenue growth of 8.5% in the future.\n\n\nBased on the fcf to equity discounting that many people use for the company, and a discount ratio of 8%, a growth ratio of 2.2%(5yr us bond), the share price should be around 23$ now. Price target 2025 40$.\n\n\n*Full disclosure, I Have a long position in DBX\n** No intention of pumping and dumping, I just wanna see if I am misreading something and unnecessarily risking my capital.",

        "selftext": "This is rather going to be summary of what happened to GME.\n\n1.The smartest autist in the world Dr. Michael Burry is still in the game and in June this year, he voted to back the board.\n\n&gt;\"Scion believes CEO George Sherman, appointed by the Board in 2019, is progressing quickly in reshaping GameStop to thrive into and beyond the coming console upgrade cycle. Scion believes that under Sherman, GameStop is approaching its own reboot in a sensible and innovative manner. Scion noted that Sherman, along with CFO Jim Bell, have revamped working capital management for improved efficiency. Most crucially, it appears to Scion that GameStop is now succeeding in transforming vendor partnerships to unlock high-margin revenue streams. Scion believes that this is a direct result of current management's expertise and focus and is a complete gamechanger for GameStop beyond the coming console upgrade. \"\n\nBasically he says new board is adaptable to change and he believes current board can \"reboot\" Gamestop.\n\n2. Ryan Cohen- the guy who beat amazon by selling dog and cat supplies, sent angry letter to Gamestop board to adapt to new era of digital gaming this week. He acknowledges that with the console cycle, Gamestop will have better revenue streams. However, he calls the board members to close the non-profitable stores and adapt to new era of gaming.\n\nHe ended the letter with urging board members to quickly announce roadmap for future.\n\n&gt;\" In this spirit, we urge you to quickly provide stockholders with a credible and publicly-available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets, and building the e-commerce ecosystem gamers deserve. \"\n\nAnd Ryan Cohen is a bad motherfucker who turns stone into gold.\n\n&gt;\"I look at almost everything that comes to me, but I say no to 99.9% of it. That was true at Chewy too in terms of just programming all of our executives that generally the best answer is no. As Warren Buffet says, the difference between successful and really successful people is really successful people say no all the time.\"\n\nThis dude saw Gamestop and he saw potential. And we have this guy on our side. His fund owns 9.98% share of Gamestop.\n\nIf coherent roadmap is announced soon, it will open big bull case for Gamestop's future. Most likely, they will have official communication on their earnings day when announcing their guidance.\n\n3. Mobile gaming. Ryan Cohen mentions huge mobile gaming market in his letter to Gamestop board.\n\n&gt;\"The explosion of mobile. \"\n\nGamestop is aware of this and they are trying to create community of mobile gamers. Recently, they've partnered with Niantic to attract Pokemon Go players.\n\n4. Partnership with Microsoft . It's a developing story, we do not know full details of the deal. However, it's been rumored that Gamestop will help Microsoft to sell more Microsoft products through their stores (Gamestop has around 5000 stores). And Microsoft will give portion of their digital sales to Gamestop on Xboxes purchased from Gamestop. I think this is honorable attempt to rob some PS5's market share.\n\n[Source: Gamestop partnership with Microsoft](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft)\n\n5. Undervalued on paper.\n\n&gt;\"GameStop has over $5 a share in net cash and over $12 a share in cash, making it an extremely undervalued security given expected positive future cash flows from the next generation console cycle. \"\n\nSource: Seeking Alpha (reddit won't let me link seekingalpha)\n\n6. Short Squeeze.\n\nWell fuck this. Y'all know all the itty bitty about this, and read how it could shoot GME to the Mars like SpaceX.\n\nPersonally, I think any good news, any growth opportunity will shoot the stock up, and there are too many potential catalyst.\n\nTLDR: any GME call dating after January",

        "selftext": "Have a day bulls. \ud83c\udf7b \n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8974295/amp/U-S-FDA-grants-emergency-use-authorization-Regeneron-COVID-19-antibody-given-Trump.html#click=https://t.co/ss1gdaqnVL\n\n\u201cThe FDA on Saturday issued emergency use authorization for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's COVID-19 antibody therapy, an experimental treatment given to President Donald Trump that he said helped cure him of the disease.\n\nThe FDA said the monoclonal antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab, should be administered together for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19.\n\nThis includes those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions.\n\nThe FDA on Saturday issued emergency use authorization for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's COVID-19 antibody therapy, an experimental treatment given to President Donald Trump that he said helped cure him of the disease\nThe treatment is part of a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies, which are manufactured copies of antibodies created by the human body to fight infections.\n\nRegeneron's REGEN-COV2 'antibody cocktail' - containing an antibody made by the company and a second isolated from humans who recovered from COVID-19 - is designed so that the two antibodies seek out and bind to the coronavirus' spike protein to prevent it from entering healthy human cells.\n\nRegeneron said on Saturday the clinical evidence from outpatient trial suggests that monoclonal antibodies such as REGEN-COV2 have the greatest benefit when given early after diagnosis and in patients who have not yet mounted their own immune response or who have high viral load.\n\nWHAT IS REGENERON'S ANTIBODY COCKTAIL?\n\nRegeneron's drug 'cocktail,' REGN-COV2, contains an antibody made by the company from mice and another isolated from a recovered COVID-19 patient, each of which may help to neutralize coronavirus. \n\nThe firm's latest data from the ongoing trials, show the drug drove down the viral loads of patients who were not hospitalized and cut their recovery times by nearly half. \n\nBut it's very much an experimental treatment, and the data announced earlier this week are the first published from the trial. \n\nTwo patients treated with the antibody cocktail had 'adverse events' - undesirable side effects. One of those was a 'serious' adverse event, but Regeneron did not reveal details of what happened to the patient, who received a low dose of the drug. \n\nREGN-COV2 is comprised of a duo of therapeutics in a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies (hence REGN-COV2's distinction as a 'polyclonal antibody'), which are clones of antibody that attacks a specific antigen.\n\nThe company said it expects to have does of REGEN-COV2 treatment ready for about 80,000 patients by the end of this month, about 200,000 patients by the first week of January and approximately 300,000 patients in total by the end of January.\n\nThe FDA said the antibodies are not authorized for patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19.\n\nTrump spent three days at Walter Reed after his infection in early October, where he received a variety of experimental treatments, including an antibody therapy from Regeneron.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies treatments are also being developed by Eli Lilly and other companies.\n\nThe drugs mimic antibodies that the immune system naturally produces to fight off viruses and other pathogens.\n\nTrump later credited the experimental drug therapy with aiding his recovery.\n\nTrump returned to the White House on Monday October 5 after spending three days hospitalized at Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Maryland for coronavirus.\n\nThe monoclonal antibody cocktail is considered experimental because clinical trials are ongoing and it hasn\u2019t been approved for the market by the FDA.\n\nTrump was able to receive it through the FDA\u2019s 'compassionate use' provision, where unapproved drugs are administered to seriously ill patients who have no other treatment options.\n\nWhile Regeneron has shared promising results of the treatment, which cut the viral load of COVID-19 patients who were not hospitalized, there is no evidence the drug cut the risk of death or 'cured' patients.\n\nThere also is no way for the president or his doctors to know that the drug had any effect.\n\nLast month, Bill Gates said Trump was wrong to call monoclonal antibodies treatment a 'cure' for COVID-19, but says it\u2019s the most promising therapeutic in research for now.\n\n'The word \"cure\" is inappropriate because it won't work for everyone. But of all the therapeutics, this is the most promising,' the Microsoft founder said on the October 11 broadcast of NBC\u2019s Meet The Press.\u201d",

        "selftext": "# Introduction:\n\nGood evening everyone. This post will be an in-depth look at IBM, and is likely going to end up being a bit lengthy. The stock is in a bit of a weird position, there is no doubt there will be people on both sides of the fence when looking at this stock. First we will take a look at the business for those unfamiliar, then the financials, and lastly their potential road ahead. \n\nThere will be a few questions we are looking to answer:\n\n1. Is there revenue growth?\n2. Is there earnings growth?\n3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt)\n4. Is there strong cash flow?\n\n# IBM - International Business Machines:\n\nInternational Business Machines' mdel is to be a part of everything IT's enterprise needs. The company primarily sells:\n\n* Infrastructure services (37% of revenue),\n* Software (29% of revenue), \n* IT services (23% of revenue),\n* Hardware (8% of revenues).\n\nIBM operates in 175 countries and has over 80,000 business partners to service 5,200 clients \u2013 which includes 95% of all Fortune 500. IBM\u2019s outward impact is substantial. For example, IBM manages 90% of all credit card transactions globally and is responsible for 50% of all wireless connections in the world.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n&gt;\\- The company has been able to use its large free cash flow to invest heavily in the future (R&amp;D and acquisitions) as well as buy back significant amounts of its own stock. Additionally the cash flow is allow the company to transition its larger customer base from old lower margin businesses to new higher margin, higher growth products and services.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- The company consistently tops the annual list of U.S. patent beneficiaries.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- The acquisition of Red Hat is transforming the company toward new Cloud technology.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n&gt;\\- IBM\u2019s old mainframe business is in a long term decline. As we will see in the next section, over the last 10 years the company\u2019s Revenue growth is negative, Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) is barely positive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- While the stock share buybacks were listed as a positive, they are also a negative.  IBM's Earnings Per Share (EPS) is only positive because they bought back so many shares.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- And most importantly, data and analytics businesses face fierce competition from corporations such as Amazon,  Microsoft, and others. \n\n# Financial History:\n\nThere is going to be a lot to unpack here, let's look at the general trend here. \n\n|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2011|106,916|26,361|27,163|1.0|\n|2013|98,368|27,478|29,680|1.4|\n|2015|81,741|20,372|38,702|1.9|\n|2016|79,919|18,551|40,902|2.2|\n|2017|79,139|16,223|45,086|2.8|\n|2018|79,591|16,711|42,656|2.6|\n|2019|77,147|16,844|66,883|4.0|\n\nThe revenue has decreased approx 4% each year over the last decade, earnings has also decreased down to $16 Billion while their debt has ballooned to over $66.8 Billion setting the current debt/earnings ratio to 4x...big ouch.\n\nLooking back at the first chart there are two things that need to be pointed out. Firstly, the decline in revenue and EBITDA has been leveling out, from 2017-2019 we can see there hasn't been as much of a decline. Secondly, the ballooning in debt in 2019 is attributed to IMB acquiring Red Hat. \n\nSo let's answer some of the questions.\n\n1. Is there revenue growth?  - No\n2. Is there earnings growth? - No\n3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt) - Lots of Debt\n4. Is there strong cash flow? Hmmm. \n\nThis is where things are going to get interesting. and less gloomy. (But it is still gloomy)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2011|19,846|4,108|16,787|\n|2015|17,225|3,579|13,594|\n|2019|14,770|2,286|31,365|\n\nWhat is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating \\~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting \\~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings. \n\nAt the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been \\~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential. \n\nLet's quickly look into where the money is coming from.\n\n**Revenue:**\n\n|Revenue Sector|2018|2019|Year-Year Change|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Cloud &amp; Cognitive Software|22,209|23,200|\\+6%|\n|Global Business Services|16,595|16,634|\\+2.4%|\n|Global Tech Services|29,146|27,361|\\-3.7%|\n\nLooking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud &amp; Business services growing at \\~8.4% combined, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models. \n\nThis also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition. \n\n# So what's the big if?\n\nThe big \"IF\" is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return. \n\n# Some other numbers:\n\nNOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.\n\n|Current Annual Payout / Share|$6.52|\n|:-|:-|\n|Yield|5.84%|\n|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.6|\n|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.3|\n|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3.5|\n|Current EPS Payout Ratio|72.77%|\n|Years on Consecutive Div Increase|25 Years|\n\nAs it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years. \n\n# Final Thoughts:\n\nIBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership. \n\nPicking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on. (They are also involved in crypto - Stellar Lumens for those interested in that, won't be talking about it in detail here)\n\nUltimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company? \n\nI hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. What is everyone's opinion about the company? \n\n As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!",

Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news** [BANNER](https://ibb.co/Y2M1dQ8)\n\nHey everyone and Welcome, let\u2019s start with a recap of the stock markets yesterday \n\nAs we saw a continuing of the same market trading as Monday as the Dow gained almost 1% [CHART](https://ibb.co/1z2DXMT), while the Nasdaq was punished again down more than 1,3% [CHART](https://ibb.co/k8hJGQf) while the broader stock market in the SP finished flat for the day. [CHART](https://ibb.co/bR3yw5L)\n\nWe saw 2 thirds of the market advancing with 77 new highs and 15 new lows while the volume continued to be above average for the second straight day [CHART](https://ibb.co/jfMb5G8) as investors are shifting portfolios more to the value plays. As we saw energy lead the way with 61% of energy companies advancing more than 2% as well as more than 50% of companies from consumer staples and industrials also advancing more than 2% for the day while the laggards were consumer discretionary and technology with more than 20% of the companies being down more than 2% for the day [CHART](https://ibb.co/LhjWFR0)  with many internet retails companies selling off again like fiver jd.com , Etsy eBay, Shopify and others including Amazon. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/fxzG9m5)\n\nThe market was led again by small caps as well as value and high dividend plays while growth and momentum companies were down again. [CHART](https://ibb.co/9HcqktG)\n\nHere is the heat map for the S&amp;P500  [MAP](https://ibb.co/DG8f1JW) where you can see most of the big tech companies as well of most of the credit services were down. While the broader market map shows the transition to energy plays as well as industrials [MAP](https://ibb.co/vz48M8g). Whereas tech companies like Netflix, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft extended losses from Monday this dragged the Nasdaq Index down.\n\nThe volatility index maintained steady at the 25 level slightly lower than yesterday but keeping that support line that will be maintained for a period in my opinion [VIX](https://ibb.co/3MmwnjF) with the VIX withstanding the huge market volume from Monday, as early data from Reuters shows that there were nearly 2 trillion $ being exchanged [NEWS](https://ibb.co/xMNCPNz) as value stocks had the best one-day performance against growth stocks ever in the US as brokers worldwide had problems handling this huge volume of trading with companies like TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, Charles Schwab experiencing issues. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Xx1dwpG)\n\nSo, democrats have clinched House control but they really disappointed expectations as they were expecting to gain even more seats as much as 15 but this has moved to a loss of seats that stand at 6 and counting at the moment. This has completed 2 thirds of the best results the stock market was expecting with only the Senate being up for grabs at the beginning of January. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qCkzY3x)\n\nToday there are not many events in the economic calendar as only Mortgage Applications number are expected, as the bond markets are also closed for Veterans day, stocks will see most of the trading today.\n\nYesterday Apple launched the first MacBook laptops with the in-house built processor, this will move closer the Mac and iPhone as they will both have the Apple processors from now, cutting they tie the company had with Intel that bad provided them for almost 15 years. The new Macs seem to have huge improvements in performance and battery life. This will likely be a boost to the addressable market of the Macs as they will address the people who need big performance in they\u2019re computers as well as people who are looking for good cheap computer as the new Mac Mini desktop is 100$ cheaper than the previous version. This will be a more than 15 billion addressable market for Apple as they continue to improve products and services all the time. [APPLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/RHsDQx6)\n\nBoeing announced that they have lost another 12 orders for the 737 MAX and delivered just 13 aircrafts, the delivery number is down from 20 aircrafts in the same month from a year ago. So they have only delivered 111 aircrafts this year a huge decrease from 321 just a year ago in the same period. [BOEING NEWS](https://ibb.co/HTZSB94)\n\nThe stock has seen a surge of more than 30% as people are rushing back to own the stocks after positive news on the ending of the 737 max grounding as well as the vaccine news.\n\nThis was also helped by the fact that the just secured worth almost 10 billion $ with the Air Force. [BOEING CONTRACT](https://ibb.co/6vRFGjF)\n\nAlibaba just announced that orders made on its e-commerce platform during the Singles Day event have exceeded 56 billion $ by today as consumers are still splashing out money on buying products online. Singles day is the world\u2019s biggest sales event eclipsing both Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the US combined as it stretches over 4 main days this year. They have received more than 16 times the orders that Amazon received last month in its two-day Prime event. This are finally some good news for the company as it has lost almost 76 billion $ of it\u2019s market value after the suspension of Ant Group IPO which they own about a third of. I believe this will be a great opportunity to buy the stocks as it is way down from its highs. Ant Group will eventually file and have they\u2019re IPO in the next year which will boost the stock up once again even if it will be at a much lower valuation for the company. [ALIBABA NEWS](https://ibb.co/JFBvPV7)\n\nSome other news interesting news is that Airbnb has delayed the documents release for the IPO, as they decided to delay these more from the US elections. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/0JKW0wD)\n\nAlso, Uber is expected to close a deal worth more than 2,5 billion $ after the DOJ has cleared the way [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Tkbx1FN) \n\nWhile Ford is moving more and more to address the EV market as they are expected to release a lot of EV models starting next year.  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qxNmdyT)\n\nWhile the jobs openings from September has seen a revision that moves it closer to the 6,5 million that where expected as the job openings rate was more than double the quits rate. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zFrrpsZ)\n\nThis as the small business optimism was flat last month a lower value than was expected but the same as September [NEWS](https://ibb.co/RjgKNLw) pretty much in line with TD\u2019s Investor movement that was flat also in the last month. [INVESTOR SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/X2fv359)\n\nSo, I believe great times are ahead as do many of the investors as a post-election poll shows that over 60% expect a positive return next year. But be aware any derailments or delays of the vaccines may bring more volatility to the stock market. [POLL](https://ibb.co/SxqtQSL)\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "I'm back r/stocks with my plays this week. Last week I closed out half my positions and left a few on the table waiting for them to hit my targets. Since I still have some of my positions open from last week I made my watchlist longer for this week to keep an eye out on plays that become within my level. I've also had a lot of DMs asking for plays that can be used on a smaller account so I've included some tickers that require less capital to sell cash-secured-puts. These are simply positions I might be entering based on my own due diligence and analysis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What am I doing?**\n\nI do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 4 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.\n\nI watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.\n\n# Here's a few things regarding my strategy\n\n**1.** I don't over-leverage with spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a \"Theta Gang\" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.\n\n**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.\n\n**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.\n\n**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling and shares!\n\nHonestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.\n\n# Open Positions From Last Week\n\n**FB:** 1x 18 Dec, 2020 $260 put sold to open. Up 50% on this option I sold, looking to sell early this week if we get a good pop and close it out at 60-70%.\n\n**MSFT:** Holding 100 shares. Up 1.75% on the position. Stock sitting at $215, my short-term price target is around $218-220 before I look into selling the position.\n\n**NVDA:** 30 shares. Up 0.24% on the position. Looking for $550 here.\n\n**PTON:** 1x 11 Dec 2020 $101 put sold to open. Up 25% here will look to close at around 50-70% profit range.\n\n# Chart Rules\n\n**Pink Lines** = Trading range &amp; channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.\n\n**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.\n\n# Master Plays This Week (Stock price in parenthesis)\n\n**CRM Salesforce ($248) - Earnings theta yolo**\n\n[CRM CHART](https://imgur.com/uTjMgNF)\n\nCRM has been the powerhouse is customer relations management throughout covid. High quality product that is converting more and more businesses into clients. Earnings are coming up this week so premiums will be juicy. The stock has been consolidating in a volatile range for about 2 months now. Uptrend still intact and close to the $240 support level where we will find some buyers. I'll be looking to enter a position here.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 11 2020, $240 strike put, sold to open for $7.60 or $760 premium. Return: 3% in 2 weeks. \\*I'm selling the 0.33 delta put here. You can go to a lower strike and lower delta, maybe even $235 here and still get decent return.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT to $280.\n\n**TDOC Teladoc ($196)**\n\n[TDOC CHART](https://imgur.com/NC6WSKs)\n\nI entered TDOC a couple weeks ago and made a quick 2-3% return on my play in just 2 or 3 days after the stock price shot up. It's trading a little higher than when I entered my position last time, but still near the bottom of the trend channel (pink lines). I think anything close to $190 is a good entry point. I'll be keeping an on it and look to sell a 0.30 delta put option 4 weeks out if the timing is right.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $185 strike put, sold to open for $7.00 or $700 premium. Return: 3.7% in 4 weeks.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT to $210-$215\n\n**PTON Peloton ($109)**\n\n[PTON CHART](https://imgur.com/Rl0L7pJ)\n\nI already have a position in PTON open. I sold a put when it was down 6% in a single day last week. I think anywhere sub-$100 level there will be buying pressure to keep it up. When it broke out to $140 it quickly reversed back to the mean stock price and into the channel. Weird how that works ;) Looking at the chart would you buy the stock when it the stock price was going vertically up from $100 to $140? I try to avoid buying on vertical lines unless it's a vertical line down on a stock ticker I like. The trend is still up here even though it has wild swings. Eventually this ticker will lose it's juicy premiums when volatility goes down. I'll try to capture some theta in the mean time.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $101 strike put, sold to open for $4.45 or $445 premium. Return: 4.4% in 4 weeks.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT back to $120.\n\n**FSLY Fastly ($85)**\n\n[FSLY CHART](https://imgur.com/x0QFpVj)\n\nFSLY also trading in a range approaching that $85 resistance level. It might take off, but if it doesn't I will look to sell a put option around the $78 strike where I think we can find some buyers for the stock. This is another ticker that has volatile swings, but also has been trading steady in a range. Looking at charts like this helps me see where the stock is going and what it is doing. If you look at the daily or intraday you lose sight of these things because it has such wide swings. This will lead you to easily being spooked out of your positions or selling too soon.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $78 strike put, sold to open for $3.75 or $375 premium. Return: 4.8% in 4 weeks.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT up to $95.\n\n**PRPL Purple Mattress ($30)**\n\n[PRPL CHART](https://imgur.com/ccdQhGV)\n\nPRPL is outside the trend lines and outperforming and also right at the resistance line. Sounds cliche, but the stock will either continue up and outside the range, where I will not touch it, or come back down to the $26-28 range where I will look to sell some puts. IV is still high on this ticker and makes premiums good to sell on. Will need to see where the stock goes this week before any decisions are made.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\nWaiting for a dip and for the stock price to come back into the channel. Waiting.\n\n**GME Gamestop ($16)**\n\n[GME CHART](https://imgur.com/LjpQ9Ie)\n\nThe possibilities where this stock can go are infinite. Premiums sky high. Strong support at $11 and we have some at the $14 range. If we get another up day of 10% tomorrow I won't touch this stock, otherwise I might sell some puts 4-6 weeks out and try to capitalize on the crazy IV this ticker has. This is a higher risk, higher reward play that I am willing to take. Why? Short interest is sky high. When the stock price increases, shorts will cover their losses which will squeeze the stock higher. If the stock price goes down, we will see some dip buyers and also potentially some shorts closing positions for break-even.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** I will look to sell puts at an appropriate strike when the time comes. If the stock is up 10% Monday I won't chase it.\n\n# Long-term holds I am watching\n\nPLTR (Palantir) and AAPL (Apple Inc). Unfortunately AAPL has terrible premiums so I can't collect any theta on it, but I do like the pricing point going into the holidays. Some of the main tech stocks have been under-performing for some time. I think there is a good opportunity to get some before they begin to take-off again.\n\nI did some research on Palantir stock this weekend and I gotta say I like it. The stock has almost tripled in just a few weeks, but I will be looking to enter some long-term positions in shares if or when the stock dips.",

More demand in the stock (no matter how deep it is, but it often works better if it's lightly floated). This also has nothing to do with how PLTR, a relatively recent IPO, probably doesn't have that many option writers which results in a possible spike in demand for calls which not enough supply, forcing market makers to both write more calls and buy more underlying. \n\nCase in point: MSFT during Jan/Feb 2020, QQQ during July/August, TSLA at random months throughout 2019 and 2020, and random Chinese EVs in October/Nov. \n\nIV for PLTR 1mo 15% OTM is around 70%. That's not that high... MSFT and QQQ 1mo 15% OTM during their respective \"high demand periods\" had IVs near 25-35%. TSLA 1mo 15% OTM (which has always been high) was around 100% during the pre-split run, which ran up to around 180% at the end of the run. \n\nTLDR: Buy PLTR calls. It only works if everyone believes. Also because PLTR knows everything, it probably pre-cog'd you already by buying calls for itself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wwaecc3wq061.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1571fa94a0c224b647f63003a7cd300a5fe30fb",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve heard about this idea a while ago however it\u2019s still never made sense to me. Here\u2019s the issues I have in my head\n\n**Problem 1)** One thing that was mentioned to me was that when a company pays a dividend, it decreases its value and thus the same as selling shares (or something close to that). This doesn\u2019t make sense to me, for this to be true, then a stock price/market cap must be directly correlated to the total value of that company....which never happens. Last time I checked KO, HD, MSFT and AAPL\u2019s stock price didn\u2019t fall after they paid their dividend. \n\n**Problem 2)** I\u2019ve been told selling shares and dividends are \u201cfundamentally the same\u201d and I take issue with this as well. In order to receive a dividend, one doesn\u2019t have to give up their ownership of a company; where as if you sell shares you are. It mathematically isn\u2019t the same thing. \n\nDividend paying stock: 100 shares x $1 = $100; and you\u2019re left with 100 shares. \n\nCreating your own dividend: 100 shares - (sell) 5 shares = $100; but you\u2019re now left with 95 shares. \n\nIf selling shares and receiving a dividend were fundamentally the same then you wouldn\u2019t see any difference between the two scenarios. \n\n**Problem 3)** People who hate dividends love to say Warren Buffett doesn\u2019t care for dividends because he says there the same thing as selling shares and thus this is a reason why he doesn\u2019t pay a dividend. Well....his actions speak differently, frequently he negotiates for higher yields and bigger dividends. Example, he negotiated with some of his bank stocks to get preferred shares that yield 10%. If he really was against dividends he would negotiate special shares that don\u2019t pay a dividend. Right?\n\nNow I\u2019m not one of the people that only invest into dividend payers. I also understand dividends should only be paid if the company doesn\u2019t really have anything to reinvest the cash into. \n\nBut my question is...am I missing something?",

        "selftext": "**What happened last week in the stock market? What are the next interesting earnings reports? Let\u2019s talk about the stock market!**\n\nHey everyone and Welcome so let\u2019s start with the recap of what has happened in the stock market since Monday.\n\nMonday the [DOW](https://ibb.co/ryHzJ3C) rose by more than 1,12% with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/PG8CcgX) also gaining more than half a percent while the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/Qfwj6QX) was the laggard barely up 0,2% to finish the day while The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SdCNtBZ) had another big drop closing at 22.2. About 70% of the companies were gaining while 80% were trading over 50 and 200-day moving averages. The stock market was lead by the energy sector, which saw a major spike of almost 5% with Financials and Industrials also up more than 1% for the day. The rally was pushed mostly by small and mid-cap value stocks while large-cap growth companies were lagging as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Kbvv08B) with the biggest company in the world, Apple, dragging down the sector, down almost 3% for the day. [CHART](https://ibb.co/LSxy7Mj) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ZHYXxRW) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/pynTjjH)\n\nReports also came in on Monday that the PS5 and the new xBox have been sold out the moment they are available in stock, as the two gaming consoles are enjoying great demand, this bolds well for the parent companies Sony and Microsoft especially if they can keep up with the demand for this holiday season including Black Friday, holiday [RETAIL SALES](https://ibb.co/J2vDV3F) are forecasted to rise between 3,6 and 5,2%. [XBOX &amp; PS5 NEWS](https://ibb.co/qFMvRz5)\n\nAll this while Europe will start to re-open again after a contraction of the economy due to the latest lockdowns. As they saw the Eurozone PMI falling by almost 4% in October. [EUROZONE NEWS](https://ibb.co/8DFqbd7)\n\nSome good news came from [STORE CAPITAL](https://ibb.co/rHy6pGj) as the rent collections for November remained at 90% with no new tenants requiring deferrals, this suggests that companies are managing to survive even with the current restrictions in place.\n\nWe also saw reports that Janet Yellen will be the next Treasury pick as she would become the first person to be at the top of the FED the White House Council of Economic Advisers and the Treasury and she will become the first woman to lead the Treasury. [TREASURY NEWS](https://ibb.co/bRyZk8G)\n\nMoving on, Tuesday we saw the [DOW](https://ibb.co/K0SW54V) spike more than 1,5%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/8j7WcXs) rising 1,6% and the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/S7D4MJ3) up more than 1,3% in what was a very good day for the stock market with more than 70% of companies advancing and 167 new highs on above average volume. The leaders were once again Energy and Financials, as this 2 sectors, will be two of the fastest benefiting from the end of the pandemic. The rally was continued with value companies leading the way for the 2nd straight day. You can struggle to find red spots in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/FgNk2rg)  from Tuesday but there were a few in healthcare and real estate. This was the first time that the [DOW](https://ibb.co/C7dYJVD) closed over 30k. [CHART](https://ibb.co/FHmJRYw) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/C2WXYW6) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/S5DbTNV)\n\n[NIKOLA](https://ibb.co/M15WTJ4) stock tumbled after the recent rally as the GM deal seems less likely every day, as the deadline for the deal is December 3rd.\n\nWhile October [HOME SEARCHES](https://ibb.co/8PVX9KT) surged over 200% as a Redfin report shows, this leads me to believe that the strong housing demand will keep remaining at this levels for a good period of time. \n\nOn Wednesday we saw the stock market take a breather, as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/0f0Xt8g) lost 0,6%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/LYdGYSz) lost 0,16% while the pandemic plays regained some momentum with the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/37Y7qGX) being up almost half a percent before the stock market closed for Thanksgiving.\n\nAbout 54% of companies were losing ground with below average volume for the day, as Technology and consumer discretionary and staples were the gainers for the day. Value plays did see some normal corrections after the huge gains in the last days as investors were cashing out some money probably before the day off. [CHART](https://ibb.co/pW4g7g4) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ZJxg1MW) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/zhGhJMB)\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/PDyDqBb) from Wednesday as only a couple of companies Like Amazon, Apple, Nvidia and Shopify were gaining, while the energy sector was the biggest laggard.\n\nAlso the AAII investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/CM9RsDQ) from Wednesday showed that people are getting more bearish or bullish as the neutral feeling fell way below the historical average as bullishness remains very high. This is usually a contrarian indicator, as more bullishness gives me reason to take profits and bearishness to invest in the stock market, though I don\u2019t have the same confidence in this as in the past, as I expect this market rally to last until the end of next year.\n\nNews came in from Delta Airlines as pilots approved pay cuts and lower guaranteed hours that could avoid more than 1700 pilots getting cut off. This are great news both for the company and the pilots, as air travel will pick up again in the next years. [DELTA NEWS](https://ibb.co/PmHQMDf)\n\nAlso, Deere reported blowout [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/z4C2L6S) and a beat of more than 1$ per share and a revenue only 0,6% below last year while also issuing strong 2021 forecasts as they see the equipment sales climbing more than 10% compared to 2020 with a strong net income guidance of 3,6 to 4 billion $ compared to the May guidance of 1,6 to 2 billion $. [4Q 2020](https://ibb.co/FKNjHKs) / [2021](https://ibb.co/PT8GhBW)\n\nWe closed the week on a short day on Friday as the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/8PXVwTT) led the way up 0,93%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/6Pgyrd9) up 0,24% and the [DOW](https://ibb.co/82j8ft0) barely up 0,13%. As we saw about 55% of the companies advancing on way below average volume due to the short day of trading with 85% of companies trading below average volumes. Friday was a pretty divided day as Health Care and Tech lead the way while Utilities and Energy saw a slight pullback after the big gains this week. [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/s3n9Sdb) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/Ldx38vW) / \n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TggK0j5) from Friday as we see that the market was dragged higher by the big tech companies and communication services while the rest of the market was pretty much lagging.\n\nSo for the week, the Nasdaq lead the way up 3% and closed at the 45th record of 2020, the SP followed up 2,3% and closed a 26th record of the year with the DOW also rising 2% in this shortened week. While the [VIX](https://ibb.co/n6M1Z9k) closed the week just below 21, at the lowest level since February.\n\nSo great signs for the recovery of the economy still popped up almost every day, as the stock market is more forward looking than it is a reflection of the current economic conditions. As November will likely be the 7th straight month of job gains, though they will be the fewest in number since the recovery of jobs has begun. [NOVEMBER JOBS](https://ibb.co/ZVMDxtr)\n\nAlso, Bitcoin has seen its price drop from almost all-time highs at 19,5k down more than 3k before bouncing back to around 17k. The cryptocurrency was due for a correction as it had seen a huge rally in since Labor Day and this correction came as news popped of the Treasury attempting to rush out regulation on crypto-wallets. This would be a big negative factor for people who own Bitcoin not for just it\u2019s value but for using it also. But we will have to wait and see as the Treasury boss will be replaced when the Presidency changes. [BITCOIN NEWS](https://ibb.co/FhpVSjC) / [BITCOIN CHART](https://ibb.co/myVqJzN)\n\nSome company news from Friday were that [PALANTIR](https://ibb.co/hDMN8vz) saw it\u2019s stock plunge from all time high of 33,5$ to 27,6$ after Citron tweeted that they are shorting the stock with a 20$ price target. This are common tactics that short sellers use in my opinion to get the fast results they expected. Citron also got into a short position on NIO recently and that news also made the stock take a plunged but that has since recovered and even made new all time highs since.\n\nGreat news came for sports betting companies like DraftKings and Penn national as Canada seems to be going the same way as the US as legalizing sports betting advances more and more. [CANADA NEWS](https://ibb.co/6F20V4W)\n\nAlso, Tesla has seen a huge spike in the last weeks since the SP500 news, and the stock might see another spike as Musk [TWEETED](https://ibb.co/qyLQXRp) that the full self-driving feature will be released wider in the next weeks as the company finally approaches the end of software development as they collect more and more data. Tesla has surpassed Berkshire and is now the 6th largest company in the US as the stock is up more than 600% year to date making Elon Musk the second richest person in the world behind only Bezos. The company will go into the SP500 index at about 80% of its total market value cap as the index only counts the free-floating shares. I believe we won\u2019t see such a big spike in price when the company will be added to the SP in December, just like it happened with the stock split its more of a buy the news sell the event type of thing. As I expected the stock jumped over the previous all time highs and it might see a little correction when the event actually happens, but in the long run this a company that I will continue to own in my portfolio. [TESLA CHART](https://ibb.co/S3w4YVD) / [MUSK WEALTH](https://ibb.co/b6xRMZL) / \n\nNext week we will have some interesting earnings reports that I expect to beat the estimates from companies like [NEXT WEEK EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/6yNcM9m)\n\n[AUTOHOME](https://ibb.co/nQ08V04) which is a company that has great potential as it trades at a low P/E, they offer leads and services for auto consumers in China and they have a very wide consumer base to spread to.\n\nWith [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/br3pPJC) also expecting to report on Monday after the close, I recently just sold out of my position in Zoom. I think there is too much positive expectations for the company as it trade at almost 200 times earnings per shares.\n\nAlso, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/D5dwYYW) are expected to announce earnings on Tuesday, as the company saw it\u2019s stock tumble after the news of a possible acquiring of Slack. In the long run that will be a very good play for the company as they have continued to buy more and more companies that allows them to keep growing.\n\nOther companies that are reporting and are very interesting to watch are [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/X3YBpqN) and [OKTA](https://ibb.co/rGLJtPW) also on Tuesday with [DocuSign](https://ibb.co/vvmSw3p) , [Dollar General](https://ibb.co/23YQzcg), [Marvell](https://ibb.co/nfbYcgG) and Snowflake reporting on Wednesday.\n\nGood news came this Saturday for online retailers as sales jumped more than 20% on Black Friday and are expected to grow between 15 and 35% tomorrow as Cyber Monday may set a new record for online sales.  [RETAIL EXPECTATIONS](https://ibb.co/QFbmcPD)\n\nHere are the most important economic data that we are looking for in the next week as it will be a week full of numbers that may impact how the stock market reacts in the near future. Hopefully we will see an improvement in PMI and a decrease in jobless claims and many more improvments. [NEXT WEEK ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/DYp3LyP)\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "The question isn't \\*when\\* you should get out, its **why** you should get out.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't 1 10x gain (though that's pretty amazing, right?!). The number of companies that see a 10x gain are &lt; 1%. However, if you get out at say a 80% gain, you're looking at a significantly larger chance of that happening. If you're looking at a 20% gain then, many companies can give you that return.\n\n**Understand what your end goal is and break it down on how you can get there. Run toward that dream instead of running away from whatever it is that you think money will help you escape from.**\n\nSo what's all this mean? Figure out where you're trying to get to. Want to turn 10,000 into 1,000,000?\n\nYou could hope for 1 stock that you're fully invested in generating a 100x (1000% return). Chances of that happening... minimal. Chances of that 10,000 turning into 15,000 (50%) return much better. Look, making 1,000,000 out of 10,000 is NOT easy. It's luck, timing, and to an extent skill and discipline.\n\nIf you want to make a million bucks out of a single win on a 10,000 investment, you need to find something that's going to generate a 10,000% return. Good freaking luck. But... do you think you could find opportunities that can generate a 20% return? Probably so. Yes, you'll need to do this 500 times, but if you don't think you have the time and discipline to to find 500 opportunities in 700 days (2 trading years)... I mean... take a step back and breathe... Of course 10,000% is possible - you'll see that in WSB all the time. But what you won't see are the other two types of people:\n\n1. People who made that 10,000% return over several years. Guarantee you this group is larger than that # of people who generated a single 10,000% return on 1 investment.\n2. People who lost it all chasing that 10,000% return who have no interest in sharing their pain for BS karma points.  Guarantee you that this group is significantly larger than group 1.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**To put this all in perspective: Do you think you'd have an easier time of generating:**\n\n\\- **1 10,000% return or**\n\n\\- **500 20% returns.**\n\nPut another way, do you think you could generate 1 20% return each day for the next couple years? It's not easy at all. But then again, if that's not very easy, then exactly how easy is generating 1, 10,000% return. And what happens if you lose your 10,000 on 1 investment that went south (cough...SPX weekly puts / calls)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBEGINNING INVESTMENT: $10,000\n\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: $1,000,000\n\n|\\# of positive investment outcomes|% return required|Chances of this happening|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|10,000%|Really freaking low|\n|10|1,000%|Really, really low|\n|20|500%|still really low|\n|50|200%|you've had a few of these I bet|\n|100|100%|MSFT hands these out in the long run|\n|200|50%|doable|\n|500|20%|Really, really doable|",
