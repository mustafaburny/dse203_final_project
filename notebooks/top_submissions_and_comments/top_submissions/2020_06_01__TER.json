This would be my goal high risk high reward portfolio. \n\nI\u2019ve always been anti ETF, seems like they never move and even if their biggest holdings do well they can go down.\n\nWell I cashed out my holdings in my trading app and am transferring to my big boy portfolio. Here are my holdings. \n\nFirst off screw spy and voo. Boring\n\nI went sectors I was interested in for example I love DraftKings and NET but who knows if the competition comes out of nowhere and eats them up. So let\u2019s go with BETZ and WCLD\n\nSo here\u2019s my ETFs I\u2019ll be buying into and some of their top holdings.\n\nBUYZ- AMZN, SHOP, SE, BABA, Mercado\nOnline shopping if the future\n\nWCLD- Fastly, ZM, DDOG, DOCU, Wix\nEverything will be on the cloud \n\nBETZ- GAN, DKNG, Flutter, PENN\nIt\u2019s like investing in alcohol during the prohibition \n\nXNTK- Telsa, SHOP, AMZN, AMD, Activison, NVDA\nWho doesn\u2019t love those companies futures \n\nARKW- TSLA, SQ, PINS, ROKU\nYou had me at Telsa and square leading an ETF\n\nARKQ- TSLA, 2U, Autodesk, Teradyne\nIf telsa doesn\u2019t moon one of these next gen stocks will\n\nQCLN- TSLA and bunch of clean energy stocks\nShut up I like telsa and oil will go dry eventually right?\n\nIETC - Microsoft, Apple , FB, google\nThis was my favorite MSFT heavy etf\n\nPPA- RTX, Lockheed, Honeywell, BA\nDefense stock of choice\n\nFDIS- AMZN, HD, Nike, telsa, McDonald\u2019s \n30% Amazon\n\nPEJ- chipotle, DIS, PENN, LUV\nFavorite Disney etf (IYC gets a shoutout here)\n\nSHE- PayPal, V, MA, Gilead, HD\nMy banking etf with the most interesting holdings \n\nGERM- covid ETF\nI always wanted to invest in the cure(it\u2019s in here) \n\nPW- my REIT, holds greenhouses for solar energy and marijuana. And railroads. None of which will be affected much when people can\u2019t pay mortgage or start working from home.\n\nI went out of the box, some of these ETFs aren\u2019t priced super high and make it easier for me to keep adding to positions. I think the total holdings were very unique that help with the potential.",

        "selftext": "Looking at SE, FSLY, DDOG, TER, CRWD, AYX, amongst others. Some of these like DDOG have gone steadily up. I remember looking at this one when it was $40 and now it has more than doubled. This is my evaluation if this sector of tech/cloud/data/mobile is worth it to get into now.\n\nThe good: \n\nThey are not impacted by COVID, no risk of second wave drops, no risk of bankruptcy. You can sleep better too.\n\nWe can expect them to continue to grow, to some degree, as tech grows in value over time, same as it has in the last decade. I'm expecting no reversal of this trend.\n\nThe risk:\n\nSince they are safer might be overbought and in a bubble to some degree. This might impact medium term returns.\n\nOnce life goes back to normal, the stocks that have seen heavy drops could be expected to significantly outperform over the small/medium term. Imagine REITs, retail, shipping, cruise lines etc going back to 80% of their pre-COVID values.",
