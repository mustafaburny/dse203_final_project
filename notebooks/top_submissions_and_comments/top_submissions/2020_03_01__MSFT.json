Do not fall into the incoming bull trap. \n\n&gt;This virus is nothing, just like those other times China closed down all of their ports, all of their major cities, trucked in dirt to cover the roads to prevent people from escaping, and stopped all of their factories for weeks\n\n&gt;China had to ban shorting for a period because they were afraid that it would drop 40% like last time they took a big market hit\n\n&gt;Most western major markets (including the DOW and S&amp;P 500) fell by 10-12% in a few days, manipulated it similarly to China in order to avoid a total crash and sell-off\n\n&gt;\"People are fine, going to events and stuff as normal, don't be paranoid\"\n\n&gt;Meanwhile in the real world, once-a-year events are cancelled because major companies are pulling out, like GDC (Game Developers Conference) where Microsoft, Faceberg, Sony and others all pulled out over virus fears\n\n&gt;People in specific regions said to be affected by the virus are panic-buying canned goods, water, masks and other supplies\n\n&gt;The Chinese factory activity index hits its lowest recorded point, ever, indicating a severe decline that we haven't been fully hit by yet\n\n&gt;Most major products that source parts or materials from China will be unable to function (i.e. any modern electronics, drug companies and other major businesses), and will be behind by months once China does start working\n\n&gt;The second wave of the disease hasn't hit yet (it likely will when China bleeds too much, forces start-ups of factories/mixes people again, and it explodes out from Hubei)",

        "selftext": "Jack Welch was a railroad conductor\u2019s son who rose to chairman and CEO of General Electric.\n\nDuring the 20 years he led the conglomerate, its market value grew from $12 billion to $410 billion.\n\nFortune magazine once called him \u201cmanager of the century,\u201d but he also was known as \u201cNeutron Jack\u201d for slashing tens of thousands of jobs.\n\nJack Welch, a railroad conductor\u2019s son who became chairman and CEO of General Electric and led it for two decades, growing its market value from $12 billion to $410 billion, has died. He was 84.\n\nHis death was announced Monday by his wife, Suzy.\n\nWith a determination to win by busting up bureaucratic complacency, Welch earned two titles \u2014 \u201cmanager of the century,\u201d and \u201cNeutron Jack\u201d for slashing tens of thousands of jobs. Under his leadership, GE became the world\u2019s most valuable company, after Microsoft. Its fortunes later turned south.\n\nWhile at the helm, Welch bought and sold scores of businesses, expanding the industrial giant into financial services and consulting. GE Capital Bank was founded seven years into his tenure. His acquisitions included RCA \u2014 then-owner of NBC \u2014 and Kidder Peabody, the brokerage that became entangled in an insider trading scandal.\n\nHe also streamlined the conglomerate\u2019s bloated bureaucracy by giving managers free rein to make changes they deemed beneficial to the bottom line.\n\nHe invented the \u201cvitality curve,\u201d in which managers were ranked into three groups. The top 20% \u201cA\u201d group was \u201cfilled with passion, committed to making things happen.\u201d The \u201cvital\u201d 70% \u201cB\u201d group was essential to the company and encouraged to join the A\u2019s. Then there was the bottom 10% \u201cC\u201d group. \u201cThe underperformers generally had to go,\u201d Welch said in his 2001 book, \u201cJack: Straight From the Gut.\u201d\n\nAccording to the book, \u201cthe workforce went from 411,000 to 299,000 during his first five years as chief. With such cuts, he acquired the derisive moniker named after the neutron bomb, which was designed to kill multitudes without destroying cities.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/02/jack-welch-obit-ge.html",

        "selftext": "TLDR: Nvidia, Netflix, Dropbox, Facebook look like decent plays for a rebound. For the truly truly autistic - there is Micron.\n\nHere's my reasoning - the market has sold off a whole bunch in the past week, but some look much weaker than others right now. I wouldn't touch Apple with a 10 foot pole because it has gone up so far, and was the favorite for so long. But if there is a rebound, which stocks might be the strongest? Not the ones everyone has been FOMOing into for the past 2 months because those people have just got burned (I'm looking at you MSFT $200 call holders). \n\nAnd definitely not $SPCE - probably one of the worst ideas ever to come across this sub. \n\nIf I look at which ones have held up very strong the past week and close on Friday, Nvidia definitely gets my attention. It's been a slower climber but recently broke out and last week just retested its upward trend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$NVDA still on an linear uptrend, up 7&amp;#37; on Friday 2\\/28](https://preview.redd.it/a9vdb1w6l5k41.png?width=909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0f7eb6f3ac9f0cf270f390dac9608d48d6ebbfe)\n\nMedia companies with no physical presence (hence coronavirus safe) also seem like decent bets. I'm talking about Netflix and Facebook here. $FB and $NFLX are the only FAANG stocks not breaking out to new highs recently and there could be a rotation of money into them as they are minimally affected by coronavirus. Also Facebook has announced a $10 billion stock buyback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$NFLX mostly flat last week, still in solid uptrend](https://preview.redd.it/fhafupxfl5k41.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72057d5a941678e3deda16910e4418f4e988180f)\n\nDon't have a position because last week was insane, but watching.",
