        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021**\n\nStocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain in the Nasdaq (QQQ). After the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered.\n\nNew economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April, compared to March, even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US. The Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. \n\nYesterday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and that the Fed was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be \u201coverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.\u201d \n\nRichard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said \u201cthere will come a time in upcoming meetings\u201d when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that \u201cit is going to depend on the flow of data\u201d. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.\n\nThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn\u2019t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Great vaccination numbers coming out in the US. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States has administered 289,212,304 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 359,849,035 doses. 165,074,907 people had received at least one dose, while 131,850,089 people are fully vaccinated as of Wednesday morning. For context, the entire US population is roughly 328.2 million.\n* Amazon (AMZN) announced that former CEO of Amazon Web Services Andy Jassy will formally take over as CEO of the e-commerce giant on July 5. A few months ago, Jeff Bezos, current CEO and founder, announced he was stepping down and transitioning to a role as the Executive Chairman.\n* Shares of Ford (F) jumped more than 8% after the company said it was raising it\u2019s investment on electric vehicles from $22 to $30 billion. The company recently announced the all-electric F-150.\n* Amazon announced it was purchasing Hollywood movie studio MGM Holdings for $8.45 billion, bolstering Amazon\u2019s streaming service. Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios said, \u201cThe real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM\u2019s talented team. It\u2019s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling \"\n* Mortgage applications slid by the most since early April last week, with a decline in refinances dragging down overall loan volumes even as purchases ticked up for another week. The Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) weekly market composite index for mortgage applications fell 4.2% during the week ended May 21. This followed a 1.2% rise during the prior week.\n* Volkswagen sold more than 206,000 electric vehicles over the past 12 months in Western Europe, more than double the 102,500 made by Tesla over the same time period, according to Schmidt Automotive Research. \n* **\\*\\* Please note that the current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price.\\*\\***\n* Agilent Technologies (A) with a host of target raises.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 18, 2021**\n\nStocks held steady today, with the three major indexes trading within a 0.5% range of the even line. It\u2019s encouraging to see the market holding steady after the volatility experienced in the last few weeks. As I have said before, I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, where technology stocks sank and the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 4%, was overblown for a few reasons that will be explained below. \n\nLast week, the market tumbled in the largest loss since February after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April Consumer and Producer Price indexes, which showed a larger increase than expected.  The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. \n\nThe PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year.\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint exact causes, there seem to be several factors contributing to the rise in inflation, none of which I think pose a significant threat to the sustainability of the current bull market.  First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. \n\nSecond are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. As basic economics shows us, when demand begins to outstrip production capabilities (aka supply), prices inevitably go up. One prominent example of this you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. \n\nThird are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt\u2014incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs\u2014recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, \u201cGiven the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying \u201cEven with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve\u2019s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.\n\nNow that we understand why inflation may be rising, these are the reasons I think fears are overblown. With the US economy reopening, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures \u201ctransitory\u201d. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, \u201cAmid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\u201d \n\nMoreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be \u201ctransitory\u201d as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, \u201cWe want to see a string of months like that \\[like in March\\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there\u2019s a very large group of people who are not.\u201d Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell\u2019s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fourth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. \n* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan \"proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States\u201d and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories \"to build advanced vehicles and parts.\"\n* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie \u201cThe Big Short\u201d, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry\u2019s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available. \n* Square (SQ), one of the leading fintech companies, launched services in Ireland, it\u2019s first foray into the Eurozone as the company looks to expand beyond the US.\n* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday volatility\\*\\***\n* Amazon (AMZN) target raised by Citigroup from $3750 to $4175 at Buy.

The Condor looks to profit if CRM stays within its expected move following earnings. It is a max gain between 212.50 and 232.50. If the stock moves beyond what options are pricing, the Condor is a max loss (with defined risk):\n\n*Processing gif 9m8yu14wxw071...*\n\nLet me know in the comments anything I missed that's of interest.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021**\n\nStocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain in the Nasdaq (QQQ). After the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered.\n\nNew economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April, compared to March, even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US. The Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. \n\nYesterday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and that the Fed was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be \u201coverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.\u201d \n\nRichard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said \u201cthere will come a time in upcoming meetings\u201d when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that \u201cit is going to depend on the flow of data\u201d. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.\n\nThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn\u2019t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Great  vaccination numbers coming out in the US. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States has administered 289,212,304 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 359,849,035 doses. 165,074,907 people had received at least one dose, while 131,850,089 people are fully vaccinated as of Wednesday morning. For context, the entire US population is roughly 328.2 million.\n* Amazon (AMZN) announced that former CEO of Amazon Web Services Andy Jassy will formally take over as CEO of the e-commerce giant on July 5. A few months ago, Jeff Bezos, current CEO and founder, announced he was stepping down and transitioning to a role as the Executive Chairman.\n* Shares of Ford (F) jumped more than 8% after the company said it was raising it\u2019s investment on electric vehicles from $22 to $30 billion. The company recently announced the all-electric F-150.\n* Amazon announced it was purchasing Hollywood movie studio MGM Holdings for $8.45 billion, bolstering Amazon\u2019s streaming service. Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios said, \u201cThe real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM\u2019s talented team. It\u2019s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling \"\n* Mortgage applications slid by the most since early April last week, with a decline in refinances dragging down overall loan volumes even as purchases ticked up for another week. The Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) weekly market composite index for mortgage applications fell 4.2% during the week ended May 21. This followed a 1.2% rise during the prior week.\n* Volkswagen sold more than 206,000 electric vehicles over the past 12 months in Western Europe, more than double the 102,500 made by Tesla over the same time period, according to Schmidt Automotive Research. \n* **\\*\\* Please note that the current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price.\\*\\***\n* Agilent Technologies (A) with a host of target raises.
