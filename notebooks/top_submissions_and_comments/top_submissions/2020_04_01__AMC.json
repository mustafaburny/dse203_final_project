        "selftext": "Okay listen I might be retarded but I\u2019m not dumb. AMC bankruptcy is all but priced in and for good reason- they\u2019re leveraged to the tits, being fucked in the ass by streaming services, and even when they reopen a lot of big block buster movies might be delayed because they aren\u2019t filming right now so the movie business might be even slower than usual. But listen- even though AMC is technically fucked at this point in time and their theaters haven\u2019t been doing great business they are making way too much money for outside companies for the industry to let them die. AMC is the biggest movie theatre chain in the US by a good amount with 661 theaters in the US. Here\u2019s why they can\u2019t die- Avengers Endgame grossed over 2.7 BILLION dollars at the box offices, most of those sales taking place at AMC. Disney made a fuck ton of money from this. Like a fucking ton. In the entirety of Q4 last year Netflix\u2019s profit was a little under 600 million. Meaning that one movie produced by Disney made them more money than Netflix did in there entire quarter, and these studios are making 10 of them a year. So here\u2019s the real point- when you take your stepson to watch toy story 2 at AMC you\u2019re spending $20 on tickets which means that movie studios are making significantly more money then when you and all 50 dudes your wife is fucking sit down on the couch and circle jerk to Toy Story 2 on Netflix for your broke ass $8 subscription. \n\n\nTldr: AMC is far too profitable for all major movie studio companies and producers as well the the entire concept of Hollywood and Disney for it to go bankrupt. Either bail out or buy out those are the only two reasonable outcomes.\n\n\nConclusion: AMC UP 200% IN THE NEXT YEAR OR BAN ME\n\nEdit: Positions- 3c 9/18 x15 &amp; 1000 shares",

WFC posted an earnings .01cents per share, which is down from an earnings of .93 cents per share from their previous quarter. Their net income also dropped a staggering 89% to $653 million for this quarter. \n\nJPMorgan reported revenue of 28.3 Billion, which was lower than the estimated 29 Billion. They also posted an earnings per share of .78 cents, well below the 1.84 estimates. \n\nBoth banks reportedly added billions to their reserves in anticipation for a high level of credit defaults from their customers and businesses. \n\n$GE, $DIS, $XOM and $WBA have all made moves in regards to securing and rolling over their credit, as fear grows that they\u2019ll run out of credit to maintain their operations. XOM issued 9.5 Billion in debt, while DIS extended their credit line by 5billion dollars. \n\nCompanies such as $F, $M, $DAL, and $GPS, have seen their Corporate bonds ratings drop to Junk bond status. Although the Fed has announced that they will be making purchases within the junk bond market. \n\nSome estimates are predicting that the airline industry could take a 300billion dollar hit this year. \n\nVaccine manufacturers are under pressure to create vaccines faster than ever before, due to the belief that the economy can\u2019t truly return back to normal until we have a vaccine.

The Cheesecake factory, and AMC are other notable names who have also told landlords they will not paying rent. \n\nThis has all been seen as fantastic news to investors, and reason to be bullish. Markets have now regained about 50% of their losses from March after having their best week in decades last week, the NASDAQ is on its longest winning streak since December, and the S&amp;P500 is trading at 35x earnings. $TSLA is back above $700, and most tech stocks are racing towards their ATHs.\n\nEdit *WeWork pays 500 million not billion a year for Manhattan rent.",

This does not mean the opportunity is missed! There\u2019s generally no way to predict gap ups because they\u2019re caused by unexpected news being released, but that does not mean that they\u2019re missed opportunities. There are **TONS** of ways to trade gaps.\n\nIt\u2019s important to do your own DD to determine the strength or the weakness of the individual stock gapping up or down. For example, a strong stock with strong news is much more likely to gap up and continue running at the open, making a good buy opportunity, than a weak stock with a history of dilution. On the other side of the spectrum, you can actually look for weak stocks that are gapping up to short-sell them and profit from them coming back down.\n\nAnother of the many ways to trade gaps is to look for oversold gap downs that have a high probability of bouncing back up. Again, it\u2019s dependent on the individual stock, company, and news, but many gap downs offer great opportunities to buy cheap shares before they recover.\n\nAt the end of the day, I hope this just shows that I am **not** posting these to show what has been missed out on, but to hopefully give some good day trade opportunities!",

        "selftext": "I do a write ups on news through out the week that is either market related or could influence the market. I summarize from multiple sources so if you see an error blame CNBC or WSJ. \n\n  \nThis is what happened this week.   \n \n\n04/11 - JP Morgan and other lenders are beginning to increase their mortgage borrowing requirements as they foresee a downturn in the housing market. They fear rising unemployment, sudden pay cuts, decreasing home values, in combination with social distancing guidelines will have a very negative impact and are looking to decrease their risk exposure. For the 2nd half of March, requests to delay mortgage payments increased by 1,900%. An alarming figure that even JPow might not have an answer for.\n\n04/11 - It should be a surprise to no one that the numbers are not adding up with a swift economic rebound in China. Despite posting a much improved PMI number, China's pollution data last measured on April 5th, was determined to be at its lowest point since the outbreak began in Wuhan. Chinese coal use and property sale are still well below their pre-virus numbers indicating their factories are not ramping up to full production. Mayor Bill De Blasio stated that New York schools will remain closed until next fall, although Governor Andrew Cumo said he was the only one with the power to make such a declaration. Italy has extended its lock down to May 3rd. India is extending its lock down an additional 2 weeks to the end of April, and Trump has begun to take the stance that the US economy will not reopen until it is best for public health. He is assembling a \"Opening our country\" task force to determine when the US will be able to ease restrictions due to the virus. \n\nSpain and Austria plan on allowing small non-essential businesses to reopen while the lockdown in Wuhan, China has officially ended. Although outside arrivals to china has raised concerns in Beijing and Hong Kong about spreading a second wave as they logged an additional 34 new cases, all attributed to arrivals from overseas.\n\n04/11 - Mexico over the weekend decided to play hard ball and would only make an oil cut of 100,000 barrels per day. Saudi Arabia was not happy with this and said they would only reduce their supply to 8.2 million bpd if Mexico cut their fair share too. US panicked and got on the phone with Mexico and Trump agreed that the US would cut an additional 250,000 bpd to make up for what Mexico refused to cut. OPEC agreed to cuts of 10 million bpd during May and June, then an 8 mil bpd cut from July to the end of the year, followed by a 6mil bpd cut from January 2021-2022 As of right now, it is estimated that there is a current demand loss of 20-35 million bpd while quarantines stay in affect.\n\n\\*\\*\\*UPDATE - A deal was finalized on Sunday with sources reporting that G20 countries will be cutting an additional 3.3 million barrels, in addition to the 10 million vowed by OPEC. IEA also plans to announce oil purchases on 04/13 adding to their reserve which will reduce the amount of oil on the market \\*\\*\\*\n\n04/12 - SoftBank Vision fund seems to be going through some difficulties to put it mildly. They are forecasting that 15 companies within the fund are expected to go bankrupt, while other companies they are significantly invested in such as uber, have heightened exposure to the Covid 19 pandemic. \n\nIn recent weeks, Softbank withdrew its offer to buy 3 billion dollars worth of WeWork stock due to concerns over their ability to meet various closing conditions. WeWork has now filed a lawsuit against SoftBank for withdrawing their offer. SoftBank So far has invested 14.3 Billion dollars into WeWork, their biggest investment, which by all appearances seems to be largely failing throughout the US.\n\nUber has been another strain on WeWork, since the ride sharing service has seen a 40-60% decline in rides since the pandemic began. With multiple failed IPO, upcoming bankruptcies, and 40% of their fund being exposed to transportation and logistics, SoftBanks vision fund at the least may be screwed for a while. \n\nUPDATE. On 04/13 SoftBank announced a 16.7Billion dollar write down on the value of the vision fund. This write down reflects a loss of 9.9 Billion dollars of value in the quarter ending in March, wiping out their cumulative gains of 9.5 Billion through December\n\n04/12 - Democrats and Republicans are getting ready to provide more relief to Americans through the CARES act. The Cares act initially provided 2 trillion dollars worth of relief to individuals and businesses but now Democrat and Republican leaders are saying it's not enough. New additions to the current CARES act could add more than 1 trillion in additional relief. The funding would mostly be targeted to small businesses, unemployment aid, and possibly a 2nd round of stimulus check to each household. Banks which began taking applications for small business loans last week, were quickly stretched to their limit. BofA took in over 177,000 applications requesting a total of 36.2 Billion in financing. While Wells Fargo quickly reached their cap of 10 billion they planned on giving out in small business loans. Confusion remained among small business owners about what exactly the criteria was for receiving this money, and many found themselves ineligible to file with their bank due to current guidelines. As of Wednesday the Small Business Association said it has received over 381,000 applications for small business loans totaling over $100 Billion dollars. President Trump also made statements that no additional funding would be provided for the US post office and that he would not sign off on any bill that attempted to do so. The US post office has requested 75 billion to help them maintain operations. Some fear without some sort of stimulus for the post office, they will not be able to operate through the summer in current economic conditions. \n\n04/13 - Soon, money might not even matter when we\u2019re unable to actually eat. Globally, food processing plants have seen up to a third of their workers walk off the job, or not show up at all as they fear for their safety due to Covid 19. The closing of global economies has presented unique challenges for various parts of the food industry. While demand has dropped drastically from the restaurant sector, there's been a surge in orders from grocery stores for beef and pork. Add that to the lack of workers, processing plants are struggling to keep up with demand, while various plants all around the globe have shut down temporarily due to outbreaks or significantly reduce demand within their specific sector. Smith Field food, the world largest pork processor has shut down one of their pork processing plants which accounts for 4-5% of the US production. JBUS in Colorado announced they will be shutting down their beef plant temporarily which accounts for 5% of US supply. Additional closures in the industry are anticipated. \n\nDairy has also been hit hard, as they see their demand plummet. The issue has become so bad that dairy processing plants are dumping out the milk due to oversupply. Farmers claim the issue is that cows simply can\u2019t stop producing milk on demand. So dairy supply is likely to continue outpacing demand.\n\nGlobally crop workers have stopped showing up to work, or are not being allowed to travel to work, which is leading to rotting crops. The fruit that is salvageable has nowhere to go due to a lack of shipping containers, and competitive demand for air cargo space. The lack of workers also causes concerns that we\u2019re missing our short window to plant fruit and vegetables for future harvest. \n\nTo add insult to injury, sudden layoffs and furloughs have created an unprecedented influx of mouths to feed for food banks in the US and Europe. Some food banks have reported running out of food within just hours. A problem that many think will only get worse the longer world economies remain under lockdown. \n\n 04/13 GE has made a move to replace all their short term debt with long term debt that will push the due date to 2024. The move is said to be debt neutral and will not add onto the total amount of debt that GE owes. Currently GE has $35 billion in bonds due between now and 2024. \n\n04/13 A chapter 11 bankruptcy is looking more and more likely for AMC movie theaters. On Monday 04/13 they were downgraded from neutral to sell out of fears they are running out of liquidity options and won't be able to rebound or even open after the quarantine. AMC has started taking drastic measures to keep it's doors open though the shut downs. All 600 of AMC corporate employees have been furloughed, and they have told their landlords that they will not be paying rent for the month of April. Their rent is currently 250 million per quarter. \n\n04/13 Governors of democratic states are taking lockdown easement measures into their own hands. California and Oregon have joined New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts in saying they will rely on health &amp; economic officials to determine when to reopen their economy. This caused backlash from president Trump who tweeted out that it is ultimately the Federal government who holds the power to determine when states could begin to reopen. There has been no official date discussed on when the economy may reopen, but some governors believe that the lockdowns could extend beyond May 1st. Overall it seems to be the stance of the Democrats that everyone must be healthy before we worry about the health of the economy. Republicans have pushed for reopening the economy sooner than later while practicing social distancing fearing the longer we remain quarantined, the less likely a quick economic recovery becomes. \n\n04/14 - To kick off earnings season Wells Fargo reported revenue of 17.78billion, which was lower than the expected 19.35 Billion. WFC posted an earnings .01cents per share, which is down from an earnings of .93 cents per share from their previous quarter. Their net income also dropped a staggering 89% to $653 million for this quarter. \n\nJPMorgan reported revenue of 28.3 Billion, which was lower than the estimated 29 Billion. They also posted an earnings per share of .78 cents, well below the 1.84 estimates. \n\nBoth banks reportedly added billions to their reserves in anticipation for a high level of credit defaults from their customers and businesses. \n\n$GE, $DIS, $XOM and $WBA have all made moves in regards to securing and rolling over their credit, as fear grows that they\u2019ll run out of credit to maintain their operations. XOM issued 9.5 Billion in debt, while DIS extended their credit line by 5billion dollars. \n\nCompanies such as $F, $M, $DAL, and $GPS, have seen their Corporate bonds ratings drop to Junk bond status. Although the Fed has announced that they will be making purchases within the junk bond market. \n\nSome estimates are predicting that the airline industry could take a 300billion dollar hit this year. \n\nVaccine manufacturers are under pressure to create vaccines faster than ever before, due to the belief that the economy can\u2019t truly return back to normal until we have a vaccine. For every day the economy is shut down, it is estimated the US loses 25Billion dollars.\n\nWeWork will not be paying their Manhattan rent for this month, joining a growing list of companies who told their landlords they will not be paying rent**.** WeWork is currently the largest tenant in Manhattan paying $500 million dollars a year in rent**.** The Cheesecake factory, and AMC are other notable names who have also told landlords they will not paying rent. \n\nThis has all been seen as fantastic news to investors, and reason to be bullish. Markets have now regained about 50% of their losses from March after having their best week in decades last week, the NASDAQ is on its longest winning streak since December, and the S&amp;P500 is trading at 35x earnings. $TSLA is back above $700, and most tech stocks are racing towards their ATHs. \n\n04/16 - The IEA, which is seen as a more neutral player in the oil industry in comparison to OPEC that provides accurate information, found that Oil demand was down by 29M BPD for the month of April. They estimate overall, oil demand will fall by approximately 9.3M BPD for the year of 2020. Under the current OPEC deal, OPEC countries will cut approx 9M bpd starting May until June, then 8M BDP for the rest of the year after that. Globally oil reserves are starting to fill up due to excess demand, and the US is forecasting their oil reserves will be full by summer. Trump is considering paying US Shale companies to cut back on production to prevent this from happening. \n\nAs of 04/16 unemployment claims have increased to 23 million, as 5M more americans filed for unemployment benefits the previous week. Economists predicted that the US would have an unemployment rate of 12% by the end of the month, while some payroll indicators predict that we may already be at 16% unemployment midway through April. \n\nThe Small Business Association has run out of 350Billion in funds approved by congress to loan to small businesses affected by the Corona Virus. The reported figures vary, but somewhere between 1.6 - 1.9M applications have been approved for loans, while over 3M applications have been submitted. The SBA says they can approve no more additional applications until congress secures more funding for the PPP (payroll protection program). Congress is in talks to add an additional 250B in funding for the program. Democrats refuse to support the current bill, and are requesting billions more in funding be added for hospitals and local governments. \n\n**\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*** 23% of the SBA loans went to California, New York, and Texas receiving a total of 81billion in loans. Retail, food and accomodation accounted for less than 9% of the approved loans despite being the industries hit hardest by the Corona virus. Construction firms received 13% of all loans,. \n\nAfter markets closed on Thursday, Gilead $GILD announced positive results from their clinical drug trials being conducted at The University of Chicago Hospital. Their antiviral drug Remdesivir was identified as one of few that may be effective at combating Covid-19. Out of 125 patients enrolled, 113 were classified as severe covid cases. Out of the 125 only 2 died during the trial, and \u201ca majority of the patients enrolled in the trial have already been discharged from the hospital\u201d although the exact number of patients discharged was not given. It is noteworthy that there was no placebo group included with this study. Also this drug will only work for patients already infected with covid-19 and does not act as a vaccine. \n\nThe white house has released a list of guidelines for states to follow when reopening their counties. Withdrawing from his previous stance, Trump has now said he\u2019ll leave it up to the governors to decide when their state/counties have satisfied the requirements for reopening. The guidelines suggest that \u201cRegions see a decline in documented cases over a 14 day period, ensure hospitals can treat all patients without crisis care, have a robust testing program in place and antibody testing for at risk healthcare workers.\u201d The guidelines are to be followed in 3 different phases with each phase allowing more sectors of the economy to open up while still following social distancing measures. It is still believed by many physicians and economists that the social distancing measures will have to stay in place until an actual vaccine is developed. \n\nBoeing $BA also announced after the markets closed that they will be resuming production of their commercial airplanes. The announcement by $BA in combination with $GILD clinical trials and reopening guidelines sent futures higher heading into Friday. At the time of writing this the Dow Jones is up 860 points in the futures market.   \n\n04/17 - Apple $AAPL received a downgrade this morning from Goldman Sachs from *neutral* to *sell* over concerns that iPhones sales would slump due to Corvid 19. $AMZN, $NFLX are also down by greater than 2% which seems to be weighing down on the rally everyone had hoped for, although the day is still green overall. $MRNA is up over 15% over hopes of a vaccine and federal funding, $BA is up by 13% due to revamping production of their commercial planes, and $TSLA continues to inch higher towards $800. As of midday, $TSLA is trading at $756.\n\n04/17 - The race to create a vaccine for Covid 19 is still in full effect as Moderna $MRNA is set to receive $483 Million from the federal government to accelerate the development of a vaccine. Phase one for the vaccine is already underway with patients being vaccinated in March. The additional money from the government will go towards supporting Phase 2 &amp; 3 of development. \n\nIn the UK a million doses of a potential vaccine are already being developed, though the vaccine is still being tested in trials and has not been approved. It is estimated that production of the vaccine will be ready by September. The company developing the vaccine is putting itself at great financial risk by starting early production, because if the vaccine proves to be ineffective or is not approved then it can not be distributed to the public population. No official number was given, only that production costs tens of millions of dollars. There are currently over 70 vaccines under development with at least 5 of those already in the human trial phase.",

This does not mean the opportunity is missed! There\u2019s generally no way to predict gap ups because they\u2019re caused by unexpected news being released, but that does not mean that they\u2019re missed opportunities. There are **TONS** of ways to trade gaps.\n\nIt\u2019s important to do your own DD to determine the strength or the weakness of the individual stock gapping up or down. For example, a strong stock with strong news is much more likely to gap up and continue running at the open, making a good buy opportunity, than a weak stock with a history of dilution. On the other side of the spectrum, you can actually look for weak stocks that are gapping up to short-sell them and profit from them coming back down.\n\nAnother of the many ways to trade gaps is to look for oversold gap downs that have a high probability of bouncing back up. Again, it\u2019s dependent on the individual stock, company, and news, but many gap downs offer great opportunities to buy cheap shares before they recover.\n\nAt the end of the day, I hope this just shows that I am **not** posting these to show what has been missed out on, but to hopefully give some good day trade opportunities!",

        "selftext": "They were facing bankruptcy last week but it sounds like they can weather the storm after looking at their financials and reading the news. The biggest question is, will people still go to see movies? I think there will always be a niche for movie theaters (at least for the the next 20-30 years), especially as they become nicer and nicer (reclining chairs, beer, menu with actual food). I do think there will be consolidation but that would be good for anyone holding the stock of the theater being bought.

Holding 260 shares of MSFT until I meet WSB you autists. During that time the market was not performing well and I lost around 5k. (50k -&gt; 45k)\n\nYes I discovered WSB on March 13th, which made me immediately changed into \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. I was dumb AF and yolo'ed all in SPY puts 03/16 (!) exp. I honestly did not understand what options are at all. Those options were bought right before Trump's pump, so my portfolio stay at 10k for the whole weekend, which freaked myself out. But extreme luck brought in the circuit breaker and I got a fat gainz of 30k. First one is free I guess? (45k -&gt; 10k -&gt; 80k)\n\nAfter that I started familiarized with the market, but I still have a lot to learn. In the next month or so, I generally bought puts and day trade only. I cashed out my starting 50k and had fun with my gainz. I was still somehow able to maintain my total portfolio value around 80k - 50k = 30k. My all time high was 32k, which is really not a lot of gainz after the first one.\n\nThis week is the most important week, since it is the tech earnings. I got AMD, APRN, MSFT, FB, AAPL, AMZN, all calls. Among those calls, FB I had least amount (oops), which was supposed to be the biggest winner of all. Everything else was either lost or theta ganged. Tomorrow will be a disaster, and it will trigger my max loss, so I will be outta here. Only able to secure 10k gainz in the past months, but I would rather take that as half full than half empty.\n\nBefore I go, I will YOLO everything else into SPY puts with a June exp date.\n\nNotable gains/losses:\n\n* 03/13 - 03/16 SPY puts (+30k)\n* 03/20 - 04/06 SPY puts (-7k)\n* 04/06 - 04/07 SPY calls (+12k)\n* 04/10 - ongoing PLAY $5 puts (-4.5k) super fat finger\n* 04/10 - 04/29 AMC $5 calls (+4k) penny calls\n* 04/27 - 04/28 AMD &amp; APRN calls (-3k)\n* 04/29 - 04/30 SPY calls (-2k)\n* 04/30 - 05/01 AMZN &amp; AAPL calls (-?k) disastrous\n\nStill holding:\n\n* ZNGA $8c 05/15 &amp; $10c 06/19\n* CCJ $12c 06/19\n\nTomorrow:\n\n* SPY whatever puts\n\nHave to admit, I totally stressed myself out during the time trading. I have to wake up extra early since I live in the west coast. Not really worth it.\n\n**TL;DR**: Dumb af and yolo'ed SPY puts with 1 day exp on Trump pump day, fat gainz. Then lost half during tech earning week by bad luck. Cashed out, and yolo the rest into puts tomorrow.\n\n[See you again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKAFK5djSk) soon. Long live all bears.",

On the surface, that\u2019s one in five over the age of 75+ will die.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch. If you are a healthy person with no underlying conditions, then you\u2019re fine and your risks are really low. In the 75+ category, deaths with no underlying conditions was reported at 16. That\u2019s 16 deaths in a population of 8713 cases. Mortality rate of 0.18% Your active, healthy grandparents with no history of smoking are in good shape. That 0.18% is also the highest for all age groups presenting with no conditions. There is a significant portion of pending underlying cases but it\u2019s highly doubtful all those would get dumped in the no underlying category.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Calcs](https://preview.redd.it/k7pmui6jn3s41.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ed9c158d3c6f144e607c43bc1de07b93c4e30a8)\n\nUnderlying conditions include Diabetes, Lung Disease, Cancer, Immunodeficiency, Heart Disease, Hypertension, Asthma, Kidney Disease, and GI/Live Disease.\n\nThis is why to market continues to climb. The risk to the healthy population is really low and those folks probably contribute the most. Just saying a healthy worker probably has better productivity than a sick worker.\n\nAt some point it makes sense for folks with no underlying conditions to return to regular life. That will probably happen end of April, mid may at the latest. They will want to go out and do normal stuff. But no one is working the stores and restaurants, we have the highest unemployment ever! Demand for employees is about to skyrocket again and 10 million people are about to be rehired. \n\nThe economy was put on hold for a while with the fed are covering the gap. Despite banks and analysts telling you otherwise, this is going back up quickly.\n\nI\u2019m holding SIX 5-15 25C, MGM 9-18 16C, AMC 9-18 5C\n\nAMC is a bit of a risk because of bankruptcy scares but I believe the movies are about to become really popular again. All these kids stuck at home and school years cancelled? Where are the parents going to take them? Otherwise the theme parks and Vegas are going to be packed. 2nd and 3rd quarters are going to be huge!",

You know, what everyone on here peters on about like true fucking chodes; tendies, gains, blow, hookers. This is the way.\n\nEveryone on this sub complains how it has \"gone downhill,\" in true WSB boomer fashion, without fuckall to back up their nihilism. And yet you're right, this place has become a cookie cutter post factory of generic loss porn and low brow analysis. I loved this place in a true blue no pandemic bull market. Lots of sass and outright, naked emotions from true retards like that guy who legitimately thought he didn't owe capital gains to the IRS.\n\nNews flash WSB OGs, times they are a changing and threads across the board are getting bigger, thicker, more meaty. It's post pandemic time and everyone's jerking off figuratively and literally on the internet. In regards to the flood of mediocrity on WSB... there has been a flood of mediocrity on WSB.\n\nThis thread is like a social distanced visit to the nursing home but instead of a nursing home it's a bunch of crippled, broken bears who are all infected with anal poorness due to the Rona and they can't even find solace in their anal plugs because their plugs are what got them here in the first place.

Every major record label and heavy hitter agent will be trying to secure their client for the next Fortnite event. Fuck this was smooth, way smoother than Universal spearheading the demise of the theatre distribution industry via Trolls: World Tour. But the numbers don't lie.

        "selftext": "I know many of you here are big fans of the mouse. Here are some things to consider before putting some of that hard earned cash in this rat. \n\n1. Disney stock has been flat for over the past 5 years, despite the brutal bull market we have had. Future share price doesn\u2019t look to get better anytime in the next few years.\n\n2. AMC is going bankrupt, and 12% of Disney revenue comes from the Studio division.\n\n3. Bought FOX last year for a very fat premium. One of the reasons was to gain marker share in the movie industry and it looks like it will not pay off.\n\n4. Disney+ is fine, but their library is very limited and highly targeted at children. But, in order to keep little Timmy begging his dad not to cancel they will have to produce some good and consistent shows, and  content spending will have to increase. \n\n5. Obviously the parks will be hit by a long time, don\u2019t expect the USA allowing large crowds 20k+ at parks for a looong time, even when the curb is flatten and cases are dropping.\n\n6. The new CEO seems to be old school type, a guy who use to run the parks and doesn\u2019t seem to be the type to adapt Disney to this new \u201ctechnological\u201d era.\n\n7. They are trying really hard to be social justice warriors. Yes, we all liked as kids the \u201cfamily friendly\u201d content which resulted in a happy ending with the hero winning and some moral lessons learned in the way. Now they are trying to put gender neutral characters with non binary superpowers? The f*** is this. \n\n8. Hulu will not be very popular outside the US. I can tell you because i live in Europe and nobody gives a f about it. With Netflix, HBO and now Warner Bros, nobody cares about the \u201cfriends\u201d or big ban theory sitcoms that we have seen a thousand times in TV.",

        "selftext": "Good morning, here's the watch list\n\nGap Ups: AMC, BA, DIS, GILD, JACK, LABU, LYV, MRNA, MSFT, PLNT, SOXL, TSLA, WYNN, XLNX\n\nGap Downs: NONE\n\nDay 2 plays: CODX, RCUS (day 2 means it had a strong day yesterday and could be in play today as well)\n\nSPY gapping right into the 50 day moving average. Many times the 50 DMA will act as resistance, hard to say in this market as QQQ moved right though it with ease. Most stocks are gapping with the market as well. We are seeing buying happening before earnings, ROKU had a real strong day yesterday as well as most of big tech names, individual stocks performing well. I added only the stocks I liked best but there are plenty of stocks to choose from. Business as usual, before you enter trades have defined risk to reward in mind. Good luck trading",

        "selftext": "$1 man here. Basically, the only flawless buy I've made since starting was Etsy, which has gained me $1.45 (my biggest profit yet). The other 2 winners are Barrick Gold &amp; Dollar General (which I should have bought more of sooner).\n\nMy 1st successful day trade was Roku ($5 start) yesterday morning. I earned 37\u00a2 before selling off.\n\nI've jumped the boat too soon on Kansas City Southern which peaked this morning &amp; Zoom (ZM) which gained tons last week.\n\nI bought $1 of Sprouts last week &amp; should have bought more before it shot up yesterday.\n\nI bought too high on XOM, USO, Conoco, Discover, ERI, AAL, UAL, DAL, &amp; MGM. They're still in the negative &amp; I was too chicken to buy any more despite most of them going up today.\n\nThere are several more that I didn't think about buying &amp; feel is too late, such as AMC, Cinemark, Boeing, etc. They made serious gap-ups that I could have cashed out on, like KSU.\n\nMy overall portfolio is currently doing well despite the negatives, but am wondering which would be best to buy more of [today] or sell off [once I break even]? Am I too late to buy some of the companies like Boeing or Overstock (OSTK)?",

I understand being in the money and out of the money, I just don\u2019t understand this part well enough and need to in order to move ahead with my self-education. Basically looking for an ELI5.

Today its just 71 days later, or 2 months and 11 days and you think the economy and the markets are already over it? \n\nI am not saying that we are about to see a new depression but just let it sink in that we are not even half a year later. Things take time, no matter if they are good or bad. And actually we already see the first bigger bankruptcies like Hertz but its no big deal since it is just one company, and AMC, Neiman Marcus, and potentially JC Penney, Levi Strauss or Victorias Secret but none else, and to be honest they were already shit years ago.\n\nI am just happy that there won't be any cascading effects from this as they are totally isolated entities that have no real connection to anything else in the economy.. right?",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 2nd, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-2-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures were pointing to an over 300-point rebound for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Thursday\u2019s open ahead of what\u2019s expected to be another unprecedented number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits. The Dow closed nearly 4.5% lower on the first day of the second quarter after logging the worst first-quarter ever. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped to under 0.6% early Thursday as global coronavirus cases approach 1 million. Oil futures bounced about 10% from highly depressed levels after President Donald Trump said he expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to reach a deal soon to end their price war.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Economists expect that 4 million to 5 million, or even more, workers filed for jobless claims last week. The Labor Department releases its weekly tally at 8:30 a.m. ET. The consensus forecast is for 3.1 million first-time claims after the previous week\u2019s record high of nearly 3.3. million. On Friday, the government issues its monthly report on job creation. However, the March numbers are expected to show little impact from the outbreak because the survey period went only to about the middle of the month \u2014 before the effects of the stay-at-home orders were felt.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * The president is set to meet with the leaders of at least seven major energy companies on Friday as U.S. producers struggle to break even after crude prices recently hit 18-year lows and turned in the worst quarter ever. Trump, at Wednesday evening\u2019s outbreak briefing, said the administration is considering halting some domestic flights and rail lines between cities hard hit by the virus. Also Wednesday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the first human trial testing a potential vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is \u201con track\u201d with public distribution still projected in 12 to 18 months. He called it the \u201cultimate game changer\u201d in the fight to control the pandemic.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * With coronavirus testing becoming more widespread, U.S. confirmed cases surged to more than 216,700, according to Johns Hopkins University data. American fatalities rose to 5,137. The White House, predicting a \u201cvery, very painful two weeks,\u201d estimates a death toll of 100,000 to 240,000. Globally, known cases reached about 942,000 \u2014 nearing 1 million since the outbreak started in China in December. There have been 47,521 worldwide deaths and about 186,000 recoveries. Italy has the second most cases globally at more than 110,500, nearly half the U.S. total.

Last week, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said it will take \u201ca few years\u201d for the company to get its balance sheet back in shape, but he balked at the idea of the government taking an equity stake in the company in exchange for aid.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/vXBqw3H.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/s2Qa8aB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jgr5aAr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5rLsTWv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/X2ee1ao.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($RH $BB $VFF $CHWY $KMX $WBA $PAYS $TTNP $STZ $CALM $GNLN $CSU $CAG $MKC $RMBL $GPL $HEXO $PVH $DARE $CTEK $CYD $NVCN $LW $AYI $ICLK $ALPN $APOG $UNF $EAST $SMTS $CSSE $SCHN $LNDC $NG $RECN $EDAP $APTX $ASND $VRNT $MOTS $VERO)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/InmHVgs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($WBA $KMX $PVH $AYI $APOG $SCHN $NG $ASND)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/at6jLJJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XGezu1R.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/z3khYSg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rfBTcM2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QKlg6rG.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Q7lS1pO.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/JxVaDjZ.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/dDcgi2b.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hVi0Bhq.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/x2FemUx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* CCL\n* ZM\n* WBA\n* KMX\n* LOW\n* BMRA\n* NVTA\n* SNX\n* THC\n* SWK\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-carmax-walgreens-disney-zoom-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **CarMax (KMX)** \u2013 The auto retailer reported quarterly earnings of $1.30 per share, 17 cents a share above estimates.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Thursday. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 2nd, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-2-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures were pointing to an over 300-point rebound for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Thursday\u2019s open ahead of what\u2019s expected to be another unprecedented number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits. The Dow closed nearly 4.5% lower on the first day of the second quarter after logging the worst first-quarter ever. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped to under 0.6% early Thursday as global coronavirus cases approach 1 million. Oil futures bounced about 10% from highly depressed levels after President Donald Trump said he expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to reach a deal soon to end their price war.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Economists expect that 4 million to 5 million, or even more, workers filed for jobless claims last week. The Labor Department releases its weekly tally at 8:30 a.m. ET. The consensus forecast is for 3.1 million first-time claims after the previous week\u2019s record high of nearly 3.3. million. On Friday, the government issues its monthly report on job creation. However, the March numbers are expected to show little impact from the outbreak because the survey period went only to about the middle of the month \u2014 before the effects of the stay-at-home orders were felt.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * The president is set to meet with the leaders of at least seven major energy companies on Friday as U.S. producers struggle to break even after crude prices recently hit 18-year lows and turned in the worst quarter ever. Trump, at Wednesday evening\u2019s outbreak briefing, said the administration is considering halting some domestic flights and rail lines between cities hard hit by the virus. Also Wednesday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the first human trial testing a potential vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is \u201con track\u201d with public distribution still projected in 12 to 18 months. He called it the \u201cultimate game changer\u201d in the fight to control the pandemic.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * With coronavirus testing becoming more widespread, U.S. confirmed cases surged to more than 216,700, according to Johns Hopkins University data. American fatalities rose to 5,137. The White House, predicting a \u201cvery, very painful two weeks,\u201d estimates a death toll of 100,000 to 240,000. Globally, known cases reached about 942,000 \u2014 nearing 1 million since the outbreak started in China in December. There have been 47,521 worldwide deaths and about 186,000 recoveries. Italy has the second most cases globally at more than 110,500, nearly half the U.S. total. But it has the most deaths, 13,155.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Boeing \u2014 whose stock has been slammed by the coronavirus economic halt and last year\u2019s grounding of its 737 Max fleet \u2014 is reportedly set to start offering early retirement and buyout packages to workers. Several media outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, said that an internal announcement is expected as soon as Thursday. Last week, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said it will take \u201ca few years\u201d for the company to get its balance sheet back in shape, but he balked at the idea of the government taking an equity stake in the company in exchange for aid.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/vXBqw3H.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/s2Qa8aB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jgr5aAr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5rLsTWv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/X2ee1ao.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($RH $BB $VFF $CHWY $KMX $WBA $PAYS $TTNP $STZ $CALM $GNLN $CSU $CAG $MKC $RMBL $GPL $HEXO $PVH $DARE $CTEK $CYD $NVCN $LW $AYI $ICLK $ALPN $APOG $UNF $EAST $SMTS $CSSE $SCHN $LNDC $NG $RECN $EDAP $APTX $ASND $VRNT $MOTS $VERO)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/InmHVgs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($WBA $KMX $PVH $AYI $APOG $SCHN $NG $ASND)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/at6jLJJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XGezu1R.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/z3khYSg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rfBTcM2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QKlg6rG.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Q7lS1pO.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/JxVaDjZ.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/dDcgi2b.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hVi0Bhq.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/x2FemUx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* CCL\n* ZM\n* WBA\n* KMX\n* LOW\n* BMRA\n* NVTA\n* SNX\n* THC\n* SWK\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-carmax-walgreens-disney-zoom-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **CarMax (KMX)** \u2013 The auto retailer reported quarterly earnings of $1.30 per share, 17 cents a share above estimates.
