        "selftext": "This is actually my first DD I've ever posted so fuck you and forgive me if this doesn't work out for you.  \nI've been looking at $PSTG for a while now and if my buying power wasn't so fucked from my decision to buy 8/7 UBER puts, I would have been already all over this play. \n\nWhat got me looking into Pure Storage was some unusual options activity alert. I've looked into this company before but didn't entirely understand what they do. Now after looking at them again, I'm still not exactly sure wtf they do....BUT I've gotten a better understanding. Basically what I got from this research is that these guys fuck with \"all-FLASH data storage solutions (enabling cloud solutions and other low-latency applications where tape/disk storage does not meet the needs).\"......and ultimately what this all means to me is these motherfuckers make those stupid fast laser money printers with the rocket ships attached. That's something I'm interested in.\n\nNow, here is the D^(aily)D^(ick) you all degenerates have all been fiending for:  \n*Fundamentally*:  \n[Pure Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Storage) remains one of the few hardware companies in tech that is consistently growing double-digits, yet remains constantly cucked and neglected by investors (trading at 1.9x EV/Sales). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ek7ugjsewnf51.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9c7e72c95e450a105e44223937422d896eeeb21\n\nThe 36 Months beta value for PSTG stock is at 1.62.   \n74% Buy Rating on RH.   \nPSTG has a short float of 7.28% and public float of 243.36M with average trading volume of 3.16M shares. This was trading at around $18 on Wednesday 8/5 when I started writing this and as of right now, it's about $17.33. \n\nThe company has a market capitalization of \\~$4.6 billion. In the last quarter, PSTG reported a ballin'-ass profit of $256.82 million. Pure Storage also saw revenues increase to $367.12 million. As of 04-2020, they got cash money flowing at $11.32 million . The company\u2019s EBITDA came in at -$62.81 million which compares very fucking well among its dinosaur ass peers like HPE, Dell, IBM and NetApp. Pure Storage keeps taking market share from them old farts while growing the chad-like revenues of 33% in F2019, 21% in F2020, and 12% in F1Q21. \n\nChart of their financial growth since IPO in 2015:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwlmy82v4nf51.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6508cd5f641da4086b70d8b8007da034e982fd7\n\nAt the end of last quarter, Pure Storage had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.274B, compared with $1.299B as of Feb 2, 2020. The total Debt to Equity ratio for PSTG is recording at 0.64 and as of 8/6, Long term Debt to Equity ratio is at 0.64.   \nEarning highlights from last quarter:\n\n* Revenue $367.1 million, up 12% year-over-year\n* **Subscription Services revenue** $120.2 million, up 37% year-over-year\n* GAAP gross margin 70.0%; non-GAAP gross margin 71.9%\n* GAAP operating loss $(84.9) million; non-GAAP operating loss $(5.4) million\n* Operating cash flow was $35.1 million, up $28.5 million year-over-year\n* Free cash flow was $11.3 million, up $29.0 million year-over-year\n* Total cash and investments of $1.3 billion\n\nI bolded the Subscription Services Revenue bullet because to me that's a big deal. Pure Storage keeps them coming back with products such as Pure-as-a-service and Cloud Block Store and everybody knows that the recurring revenue model is best model. Big ass enterprises buy storage from vendors such as Pure Storage in the cloud to prevent vendor lock-in by the cloud providers. $$$\n\nWhat are Pure Storage's other revenue drivers? Well these motherfuckers also have the products to address the growth of Cloud storage as well as products to drive the growth of on-prem storage. For on-prem data center, Pure sells Flash Array to address block storage workloads (for databases and other mission-critical workloads) and FlashBlade for unstructured or file data workloads. On-prem storage revenue is mainly driven by legacy storage array replacement cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01su6chrwnf51.png?width=1129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16e6a705f9392291bc0c3932c815802d9101365e\n\nSo far, it seems like Pure Storage's smart ass [CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHE7X5Gt71o) has been spot on with his prediction of the flash storage sector's direction. Pure Storage's \"Pure-as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store\" unified subscription offerings is fo sho gaining momentum it. This shit is catching on with enterprises, both big and small. COVID-19 increased the acceleration of our digital transformation and our subsequent shift to the cloud. The increased demand in data-centers is going to drastically help Pure Storage's future top and bottom line and to top it off, **NAND prices are recovering** (inferred from MU earnings). I expect Pure Storage to get some relief on the pricing front because of this which obviously in turn should improve revenues. \n\nPSTG's numbers look pretty good to me so far but are they a good company overall? Even when scalping and trading, I don't like to fuck with overall shitty companies so I always check for basic things like customer satisfaction, analyst ratings/targets, broad-view industry trends, and hedge fund positioning.. that sort of thing.   \n**Pure Storage stands out in all of these fields for me.**   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4n0e5nve5of51.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=495416bb6f5a2dab77f3ac483ca4d9510b39037c\n\nCustomers like Dominos Pizza and many others all seem to be happy AF with no issues. I can hardly even find a negative review online. The products seems to be universally applauded. Gartner and other third party independent analysts also consider Pure Storage's product line-up some of the best in the industry. \n\nThe industry average for this sector is a piss poor 65.  \nPure Storage has a 2020 Net Promoter Score of [86](https://customer.guru/net-promoter-score/pure-storage)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3w51io8yvmf51.png?width=698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f7d06825d0ad9d126216e5069af2f9c3636f86a\n\nEnterprises are upgrading their existing storage infrastructure with newer and modern data arrays that are based on NAND flash because they're forced to keep up with the increasing speed of the future of business inter-connectivity. This isn't changing because of the pandemic and this isn't changing in the future.. The newer storage arrays are smaller, consume less power, are less noisy and do not generate excess heat in the data center and hence do not need to be cooled like the fat fucks at IBM need to be. Flash storage arrays in general are cheaper to operate and are extremely fast, speeding up applications. Pure Storage by all accounts makes the best storage arrays in the industry and continues to grow faster than the old school storage vendors like bitchass NetApp, Dell, HPE and IBM. \n\nPure Storage\u2019s market share was 12.7% in C1Q20 and was up from 10.1% in the prior year - LIKE A PROPER HIGH GROWTH COMPANY.   \nHPE, NetApp and IBM, like the losers they are, lost market share.   \nAccording to [blocksandfiles.com](https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/07/03/gartner-all-flash-array-revenues-q12020/), AFA vendor market share sizes and shifts are paraphrased below:\n\n* \u201cDell EMC \u2013 34.8% (calculated $766m) vs. 33.7% a year ago\n* NetApp \u2013 19.3% at $425m vs. 26.7% a year ago\n* Pure Storage \u2013 12.7% at calculated $279.7m vs. 10.1% a year ago\n* HPE \u2013 8.4% \u2013 $185m vs. 10% a year ago\"\n\nPure has been gaining share almost every year since it began selling storage arrays in 2011. Pure Storage is consistently rated the highest for the completeness of vision as the following chart shows:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5agj17gcgnf51.png?width=428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da9c6389baccab85261d6e0f71b3474e84b90d3c\n\n**Hedge Funds are on this like flies on shit.** \n\nAlliancebernstein L.P. grew its position in Pure Storage by 0.5% in the 4th quarter. Alliancebernstein L.P. now owns 104,390 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $1,786,000 after purchasing an additional 560 shares during the last quarter. \n\nLegal &amp; General Group Plc grew its position in Pure Storage by 0.3% in the 1st quarter. Legal &amp; General Group Plc now owns 258,791 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $3,213,000 after purchasing an additional 753 shares during the last quarter. \n\nSunbelt Securities Inc. acquired a new stake in Pure Storage in the 4th quarter worth $4,106,000. \n\nCENTRAL TRUST Co grew its position in Pure Storage by 79.8% in the 2nd quarter. CENTRAL TRUST Co now owns 3,226 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $56,000 after purchasing an additional 1,432 shares during the last quarter. \n\nNorthwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co. grew its position in Pure Storage by 203.0% in the 1st quarter. Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co. now owns 2,312 shares of the technology company\u2019s stock worth $28,000 after purchasing an additional 1,549 shares during the last quarter. \n\nAlso, everybody's favorite wall street TSLA bull, **Cathie Wood** has been busy steadily purchasing big lots of PSTG for her ARK ETF funds for a while now...Even going as far as selling TSLA in order to re-balance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zjxuakjosnf51.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f34abdd3b35791eb207d31d72ea0f6fb11beec30\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bkf1uzb2tmf51.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9870ec41cfb4ce468ba61d83f2f8a4151927a4e\n\n**Hedge funds and other institutional investors own 78.93% of the company\u2019s stock and it seems like more are piling in every day.** \n\nTons of active options, too -Pretty good volume lately with the spreads looking *decent*.\n\nOver 5,000 September $20 Calls added just on 8/3 alone \ud83e\udd14 \n\nOrder flow helps my thesis here, showing a recent influx of big dick money moving into PSTG.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/liychuhblnf51.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca6a60d54a9eb8bd9e32e0ef70992b8282c29e70\n\nGoogle Search Trends showing uptick in interest:  ^(SPY420 baby)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/joo0b9wxinf51.png?width=1710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24eb18f18be18b9b771ff1911c09c5479ba2f1a0\n\nRobinhood Trends showing the YOLO is trending up\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4gk5yjdxmnf51.png?width=1538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c4b114c133c493c84386d1705f85229f5f7d44\n\nIncreased job postings on LinkedIn all across the globe, further supporting the idea that Pure Cloud Adoption is looking strong. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5zenasprznf51.png?width=1092&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a492e227e2208fe89925c9b7fe365634f7ffde6a\n\n*Technically*:  \nThis broke out through down-trend line a couple of days ago and as of right now looks to be pretty oversold. Looks like its found support at the 50 DMA and zooming out , the chart just looks like to me that it's coiling up for a big breakout. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxtz8minmnf51.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7baabbd3e8f97dfc8bd0d5bfa512613c2eea4921\n\nThese fucking shorts are going to get squeezed out hard. Potential short squeeze coming?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lh8lp08funf51.png?width=1533&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=921b6684369e25e94f00ed96a404458028e540c8\n\n**So what's the play?**  \nI'd like to see RSI break out of the downtrend and the divergence between price &amp; momentum ends at some point. If/when RSI breaks out, I want to play this thing aggressively with bullish call calendar spreads....THAT IS IF I HAD SOME FUCKING BUYING POWER (FUCK YOU UBER)....  \nSoooo really what I'll be doing is asking my wife's boyfriend sometime this weekend for a loan. That way on Monday I can buy some **$PSTG 9/18 $17.5 &amp; $20 calls** at open and YOLO my saddness away for a week.  \nGod forbid, I might even buy of those things called \"shares\" I heard about from /r/investing if at all possible because in all honesty, I really do feel like this is a good company to hold in a long term growth portfolio.  \nPure Storage is NOT looking like your average KODK prostitute to flip or scalp and actually more like someone you'd bring home to your 2 dads.   \n**EARNING DATE: 8/25**\n\nPure Storage has a history of beating estimates and rocketing up. Over the last 20 quarters, the company beat revenue 17 quarters by an average of $4.9 million or about 3%. Out of the three times that the company missed on revenues, once was due to supply fuck-ups at one of its distributors and the other two times were due to Average Selling Prices declining faster than the company forecasted. Higher-than-expected ASP declines (due to NAND oversupply) is one of the risks of the storage business...but then again NAND prices look to be recovering now if MU's earning isn't fucking with us and telling us fibs. Big money is forecasting revenue to be around $396 million, essentially flat year-over-year, and EPS of a disrespectful ass penny....Fuck that conservative ass guidance! I think PSTG is going to blow that shit out the water.  \nThis chart shows Pure Storage\u2019s past performance\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4xflpezdhnf51.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1660a80a1a1821ef8098791a8cee632e25f1445\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2fuen3n65of51.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9737a8d2c2a04163f447cf6d0ee287b40235868e\n\nMy Prediction: After ER on **8/25**, Pure Storage will hit new 52 week highs.   \n$20.50  - $23.50 is my guess. Bold prediction, $27.50+ by the EOY and $50 by December 2021.  \n\n\ntldr: **PSTG 9/18 $17.5 &amp; $20 calls**",

        "selftext": "**TLDR at the bottom**\n\nAs the title states, it is my opinion that SOAC warrants (SOAC.WT) are a great target for investors trying to get into the ESG sector. This is not financial advice. Do your own DD and make your own decisions.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nSOAC is Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation. It is a $300 million blank check company with a dedicated ESG focus. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. As their [website](https://www.greenspac.com/) states, SOAC is \"focused on evaluating suitable targets that have existing environmental sustainability practices.\"\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nI believe that ESG has a strong impact on the market today. Just think bout some of the examples below and how it can affect the public's perception of a company and also how it can affect a company's stock.\n\n**E** for Environmental: climate change, carbon emissions, air and water pollution, energy efficiency\n\n**S** for Social: gender and diversity, community relations, human rights, labor standards\n\n**G** for Governance: company leadership, shareholder rights, company standards\n\nSOAC is one of the first (if not the first) blank check company to have an ESG focus ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/wp-content/uploads/news/first-of-its-kind-sustainable-spac-raises-$300m-environmental-finance.pdf))\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nWhether you want to believe it or not, ESG will continue to have an impact on investing for years and years to come. This could be due to a number of reasons including the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice, among others. Here are some links for further reading about ESG:\n\n[https://www.morningstar.com/features/esg-investing-history](https://www.morningstar.com/features/esg-investing-history)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/01/coronavirus-major-turning-point-for-responsible-esg-investing-says-jpmorgan.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/01/coronavirus-major-turning-point-for-responsible-esg-investing-says-jpmorgan.html)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachconway/2020/08/05/as-social-issues-own-the-national-conversation-investors-can-use-money-to-talk/#55c751656ca5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachconway/2020/08/05/as-social-issues-own-the-national-conversation-investors-can-use-money-to-talk/#55c751656ca5)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/millennials-look-to-make-a-social-impact-with-their-investing-dollar.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/millennials-look-to-make-a-social-impact-with-their-investing-dollar.html)\n\n**Objective:**\n\nWhat type of companies/targets would SOAC look for? It turns out from their website, it can mean a target in a variety of industries such as \"manufacturing (including auto, building materials), chemicals, services (including waste, environmental, construction), logistics (including transportation, distribution), technology (hardware, software, devices), agriculture (including biofuels) and energy (with focus on renewable generation, utility services, energy efficiency/management), among others.\" They also state they could target companies that historically have not been focused on environmental sustainability but are now looking to enhance their environmental sustainability profiles.\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nThink about some of the \"hot\" investments sectors right now. I'm talking about auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy.....these could be where SOAC's target comes from.\n\nMany people will say that for blank check companies, the management team or the amount in the trust fund is the most important thing to look at when evaluating them. To me, both are very important but my number one most important thing to consider is the sector the blank check company plans to target.\n\nBased on my past experiences, I judge a blank check company's chance of success based on the public's excitement of the sector - the more people that are excited about the target and its sector, the more they are likely to invest in them, the more likely they are to spread awareness to other areas of the internet (social media, etc), and the more likely it will snowball into success for the blank check company (what some call its \"hype\" or its \"meme/moon potential\"). I can see that happening with SOAC.\n\nSpeaking of the management team...\n\n**Objective:**\n\nCEO - Scott Leonard, previously CEO of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and CFO/CRO of GenOn (an energy company), SVP at Hewlett Packard\n\nCFO - David Quiram, MS + Ph.D in Chemical Engineering from MIT\n\nChairman - Scott Honour, Managing Partner of Northern Pacific Group, previously Senior Managing Director of The Gores Group (which has completed four blank check company mergers in the past), and former candidate for Governor of Minnesota\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nGood mix of personnel in the management team with a wide range of backgrounds. Nothing that jumps out at me but no red flags which is exactly what I want.\n\nBased on these short interviews of the CEO Scott Leonard, he seems like a competent, knowledgeable guy on the outside. Again, no red flags.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx8U1byaark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx8U1byaark)\n\n[https://twitter.com/nyse/status/1261374888406745088](https://twitter.com/nyse/status/1261374888406745088)\n\n[https://cheddar.com/media/sustainable-opportunities-acquisition-corp-makes-nyse-debut](https://cheddar.com/media/sustainable-opportunities-acquisition-corp-makes-nyse-debut)\n\n**Objective:**\n\nSOAC.WT closed at $0.83 today, 8/24/20\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nSOAC.WT is such good value right now. I believe SOAC.WT has the potential to do well when you compare its price to other current blank check company warrants that are &gt; $1.50 and don't even have a letter of intent yet. You are getting a sub- $1 warrant at basically its ground floor that has the ability to run to much higher numbers.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nSOAC is targeting a business combination in late 2020 or early 2021 ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/))\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nThe timeline target of late 2020 or early 2021 will be here before you know it. That being said, SOAC.WT is not a short term play for me. SOAC.WT is not something I plan to buy now and sell in a week. It is a medium to long term play as SOAC based on its business target combination of late 2020 or early 2021. SOAC.WT only began trading on 6/26/20 so we are honestly still only in the early stages.\n\nWhat that said, getting in SOAC.WT now at these prices can lead to even more rewards than if I waited until Q4 2020 or Q1 2021 before buying. My hopes is that by the time Q4 2020 is here, the price of SOAC.WT will be nowhere near where they are now.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nSOAC.WT is everything that I am looking for in a blank check company warrant. Warrants are obviously more risky than commons however I believe in this case, SOAC.WT provides the risk/reward profile that I am happy with.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI have been steadily accumulating SOAC warrants for the past two weeks. Further, my plan is to take some of my (hopeful) profits from SHLL/GRAF/FMCI/SPAQ to SOAC.WT after their respective runs.\n\n**TLDR:** SOAC.WT is a blank check company with an ESG (**E**nvironmental, **S**ocial, **G**overnance) focus. ESG will only have a bigger and bigger impact on the stock market (and stock success) as time goes on whether it is due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice (among others). Based on a number of factors including SOAC.WT's current price (sub-$1 warrants), timeline (business combination target in late 2020 or early 2021), and possible target sector (auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy), I believe SOAC.WT is great value for its risk/reward profile.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets look to the Fed again to build on S&amp;P 500 record as Congress continues to disappoint  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/markets-look-to-the-fed-again-to-build-on-sp-500-record-as-congress-continues-to-disappoint.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed\u2019s anticipated policy framework review.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed\u2019s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we know the Fed\u2019s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You\u2019re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed\u2019s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed\u2019s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.\n*****\n&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let\u2019s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they\u2019re not going to stop it,\u201d said Caron. \u201cThey\u2019re going to stay there for awhile. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to communicate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Where\u2019s the stimulus?\n&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the thing I\u2019m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the politics are shifting beneath that.\u201d He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.\n*****\n&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.\n*****\n&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,\u201d said Keon. \u201cAs the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don\u2019t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It\u2019s not panicking about it.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. \u201cAs the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. \u201cDemocrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,\u201d said Mills.\n*****\n&gt; # It\u2019s the economy\n&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.\n*****\n&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.\n*****\n&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/0FgKliy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yHvkn2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/L2S9kUV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/kgk42Nv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cMOmbjC.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kCvYfYX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jwR8nq6.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nSC6K2N.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/bwcCQMYv/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/yxfJ72fy/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/3Nr453Zw/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years\n\n&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September\u2019s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September\u2019s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs\n\n&gt; \u201cBetter late than never.\u201d\n\n&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThis will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThen again, we\u2019ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn\u2019t a shock to see new highs this quickly.\u201d\n\n&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there\u2019s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early \u201880s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early \u201890s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February \u201961, July \u201980, November \u201982, and March \u201991. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)\n\n&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.\n\n&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.\n\n&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion.

Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays\n\n&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.\n\n&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.\n\n&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**\n\n&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven\u2019t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they\u2019ve actually given us credit for coining the \u201ctriple play\u201d term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.\n\n&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 21st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGhxT3rxKxc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.23.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCwfvNh2iXU))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$DKS** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$SJM** \n&gt; * **$ICLK** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$BIG** \n&gt; * **$COTY** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$BOX** \n&gt; * **$SPLK**\n&gt; * **$BNS** \n&gt; * **$TOL** \n&gt; * **$VMW** \n&gt; * **$BMO** \n&gt; * **$TD** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$HPE** \n&gt; * **$DELL** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$FLWS** \n&gt; * **$VIOT** \n&gt; * **$RY** \n&gt; * **$HPQ** \n&gt; * **$SOL** \n&gt; * **$BITA** \n&gt; * **$ATHM** \n&gt; * **$NTAP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/FKXPQh9j/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST INCREASE IN EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/G3q2ZwT4/erincrease1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RwgQ9SD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mvBOGth.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY6k2e0.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rx2gJbQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zKSTcN5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/B3hFxJN.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wqQ6cS6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tln4z5V.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7xetbo6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Buy Co., Inc. $114.00\n&gt; **Best Buy Co., Inc.

The S&amp;P closed 1.01% higher and the NASDAQ 0.6%. The Dow also rose, ending the day 1.39% up. Investors reacted positively to developments over a Covid-19 treatment and signs that a vaccine may be authorized in the near-term. \n\nTravel, airlines, hotels, and other \u201creopening\u201d stocks rallied, pushing the Dow higher.

Industry peers also saw similar increases in stock price today.\n\nOn Sunday, the FDA said it issued an emergency use authorization for investigational convalescent plasma to treat Covid-19 in hospitalized patients. While the treatment has not yet undergone full clinical trials, the FDA said that it deemed that the data so far suggest \u201cproduct may be effective in treating Covid-19 and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks.\u201d President Donald Trump, speaking in a press conference, called the approval a \u201cvery historic breakthrough,\u201d and said the treatment reduced mortality by 35%, based on a study of patients by the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThe Trump administration is reportedly considering fast-tracking a coronavirus vaccine being developed in the UK, according to a Financial Times report. One of the options reportedly being considered is AstraZeneca's ($AZN) vaccine candidate. However, a spokesperson for the US Health and Human Services called the report \u2018absolutely false\u2019.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Apple ($AAPL) continued their rally, finishing the day 1.2% up. With this latest rally, Apple has consolidated its position as the most valuable company in history, with a Market Cap of 2.15 trillion.\n* Precious metals and Miners underperformed the market today. $GDX was down 0.34%, Gold was down 0.5% and Silver was down 0.52%.\n* TikTok sued the US government over Trump\u2019s ordered ban.

        "selftext": "**TLDR at the bottom**\n\nAs the title states, it is my opinion that SOAC warrants (SOAC.WT) are a great target for investors trying to get into the ESG sector. This is not financial advice. Do your own DD and make your own decisions.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nSOAC is Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation. It is a $300 million blank check company with a dedicated ESG focus. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. As their [website](https://www.greenspac.com/) states, SOAC is \"focused on evaluating suitable targets that have existing environmental sustainability practices.\" \n\nFYI - a blank check company acquires and merges with another company thus allowing the latter company to become publicly traded.\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nI believe that ESG has a strong impact on the market today. Just think bout some of the examples below and how it can affect the public's perception of a company and also how it can affect a company's stock.\n\n**E** for Environmental: climate change, carbon emissions, air and water pollution, energy efficiency\n\n**S** for Social: gender and diversity, community relations, human rights, labor standards\n\n**G** for Governance: company leadership, shareholder rights, company standards\n\nSOAC is one of the first (if not the first) blank check company to have an ESG focus ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/wp-content/uploads/news/first-of-its-kind-sustainable-spac-raises-$300m-environmental-finance.pdf))\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nWhether you want to believe it or not, ESG will continue to have an impact on investing for years and years to come. This could be due to a number of reasons including the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice, among others. Here are some links for further reading about ESG:\n\n[https://www.morningstar.com/features/esg-investing-history](https://www.morningstar.com/features/esg-investing-history)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/01/coronavirus-major-turning-point-for-responsible-esg-investing-says-jpmorgan.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/01/coronavirus-major-turning-point-for-responsible-esg-investing-says-jpmorgan.html)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachconway/2020/08/05/as-social-issues-own-the-national-conversation-investors-can-use-money-to-talk/#55c751656ca5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachconway/2020/08/05/as-social-issues-own-the-national-conversation-investors-can-use-money-to-talk/#55c751656ca5)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/millennials-look-to-make-a-social-impact-with-their-investing-dollar.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/millennials-look-to-make-a-social-impact-with-their-investing-dollar.html)\n\n**Objective:**\n\nWhat type of companies/targets would SOAC look for? It turns out from their website, it can mean a target in a variety of industries such as \"manufacturing (including auto, building materials), chemicals, services (including waste, environmental, construction), logistics (including transportation, distribution), technology (hardware, software, devices), agriculture (including biofuels) and energy (with focus on renewable generation, utility services, energy efficiency/management), among others.\" They also state they could target companies that historically have not been focused on environmental sustainability but are now looking to enhance their environmental sustainability profiles.\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nThink about some of the \"hot\" investments sectors right now. I'm talking about auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy.....these could be where SOAC's target comes from.\n\nMany people will say that for blank check companies, the management team or the amount in the trust fund is the most important thing to look at when evaluating them. To me, both are very important but my number one most important thing to consider is the sector the blank check company plans to target.\n\nBased on my past experiences, I judge a blank check company's chance of success based on the public's excitement of the sector - the more people that are excited about the target and its sector, the more they are likely to invest in them, the more likely they are to spread awareness to other areas of the internet (social media, etc), and the more likely it will snowball into success for the blank check company (what some call its \"hype\" or its \"meme potential\"). I can see that happening with SOAC.\n\nSpeaking of the management team...\n\n**Objective:**\n\nCEO - Scott Leonard, previously CEO of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and CFO/CRO of GenOn (an energy company), SVP at Hewlett Packard\n\nCFO - David Quiram, MS + Ph.D in Chemical Engineering from MIT\n\nChairman - Scott Honour, Managing Partner of Northern Pacific Group, previously Senior Managing Director of The Gores Group (which has completed four blank check company mergers in the past), and former candidate for Governor of Minnesota\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nGood mix of personnel in the management team with a wide range of backgrounds. Nothing that jumps out at me but no red flags which is exactly what I want.\n\nBased on these short interviews of the CEO Scott Leonard, he seems like a competent, knowledgeable guy on the outside. Again, no red flags.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx8U1byaark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx8U1byaark)\n\n[https://twitter.com/nyse/status/1261374888406745088](https://twitter.com/nyse/status/1261374888406745088)\n\n[https://cheddar.com/media/sustainable-opportunities-acquisition-corp-makes-nyse-debut](https://cheddar.com/media/sustainable-opportunities-acquisition-corp-makes-nyse-debut)\n\n**Objective:**\n\nSOAC.WT closed at $0.83 today, 8/24/20\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nSOAC.WT is such good value right now. I believe SOAC.WT has the potential to do well when you compare its price to other current blank check company warrants that are &gt; $1.50 and don't even have a letter of intent yet. You are getting a sub- $1 warrant at basically its ground floor that has the ability to run to much higher numbers.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nSOAC is targeting a business combination in late 2020 or early 2021 ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/))\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nThe timeline target of late 2020 or early 2021 will be here before you know it. That being said, SOAC.WT is not a short term play for me. SOAC.WT is not something I plan to buy now and sell in a week. It is a medium to long term play as SOAC based on its business target combination of late 2020 or early 2021. SOAC.WT only began trading on 6/26/20 so we are honestly still only in the early stages.\n\nWhat that said, getting in SOAC.WT now at these prices can lead to even more rewards than if I waited until Q4 2020 or Q1 2021 before buying. My hopes is that by the time Q4 2020 is here, the price of SOAC.WT will be nowhere near where they are now.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nSOAC.WT is everything that I am looking for in a blank check company warrant. Warrants are obviously more risky than commons however I believe in this case, SOAC.WT provides the risk/reward profile that I am happy with.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI have been steadily accumulating SOAC warrants for the past two weeks. Further, my plan is to take some of my (hopeful) profits from SHLL/GRAF/FMCI/SPAQ to SOAC.WT after their respective runs.\n\n**TLDR:** SOAC.WT is a blank check company with an ESG (**E**nvironmental, **S**ocial, **G**overnance) focus. ESG will only have a bigger and bigger impact on the stock market (and stock success) as time goes on whether it is due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice (among others). Based on a number of factors including SOAC.WT's current price (sub-$1 warrants), timeline (business combination target in late 2020 or early 2021), and possible target sector (auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy), I believe SOAC.WT is great value for its risk/reward profile.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets look to the Fed again to build on S&amp;P 500 record as Congress continues to disappoint  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/markets-look-to-the-fed-again-to-build-on-sp-500-record-as-congress-continues-to-disappoint.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed\u2019s anticipated policy framework review.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed\u2019s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we know the Fed\u2019s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You\u2019re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed\u2019s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed\u2019s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.\n*****\n&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let\u2019s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they\u2019re not going to stop it,\u201d said Caron. \u201cThey\u2019re going to stay there for awhile. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to communicate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Where\u2019s the stimulus?\n&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the thing I\u2019m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the politics are shifting beneath that.\u201d He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.\n*****\n&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.\n*****\n&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,\u201d said Keon. \u201cAs the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don\u2019t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It\u2019s not panicking about it.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. \u201cAs the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. \u201cDemocrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,\u201d said Mills.\n*****\n&gt; # It\u2019s the economy\n&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.\n*****\n&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.\n*****\n&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/0FgKliy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yHvkn2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/L2S9kUV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/kgk42Nv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cMOmbjC.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kCvYfYX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jwR8nq6.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nSC6K2N.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/bwcCQMYv/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/yxfJ72fy/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/3Nr453Zw/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years\n\n&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September\u2019s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September\u2019s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs\n\n&gt; \u201cBetter late than never.\u201d\n\n&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThis will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThen again, we\u2019ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn\u2019t a shock to see new highs this quickly.\u201d\n\n&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there\u2019s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early \u201880s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early \u201890s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February \u201961, July \u201980, November \u201982, and March \u201991. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)\n\n&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.\n\n&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.\n\n&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion.

Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays\n\n&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.\n\n&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.\n\n&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**\n\n&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven\u2019t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they\u2019ve actually given us credit for coining the \u201ctriple play\u201d term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.\n\n&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 21st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGhxT3rxKxc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.23.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCwfvNh2iXU))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$DKS** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$SJM** \n&gt; * **$ICLK** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$BIG** \n&gt; * **$COTY** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$BOX** \n&gt; * **$SPLK**\n&gt; * **$BNS** \n&gt; * **$TOL** \n&gt; * **$VMW** \n&gt; * **$BMO** \n&gt; * **$TD** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$HPE** \n&gt; * **$DELL** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$FLWS** \n&gt; * **$VIOT** \n&gt; * **$RY** \n&gt; * **$HPQ** \n&gt; * **$SOL** \n&gt; * **$BITA** \n&gt; * **$ATHM** \n&gt; * **$NTAP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/FKXPQh9j/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST INCREASE IN EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/G3q2ZwT4/erincrease1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RwgQ9SD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mvBOGth.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY6k2e0.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rx2gJbQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zKSTcN5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/B3hFxJN.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wqQ6cS6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tln4z5V.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7xetbo6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Buy Co., Inc. $114.00\n&gt; **Best Buy Co., Inc.
