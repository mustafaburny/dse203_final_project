        "selftext": " Joel Tillinghast, a once-legendary portfolio fund manager and colleague at Fidelity, sometimes describes retail apparel investing as \"momentum-based\". After all, when it works, you look like a genius: people throw $20 bills at you in exchange for flimsy cotton shifts that cost $3.50 to manufacture and $5 to market. Every appareler is convinced they have the Midas touch, and [when it stops working](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_21), the public reacts to the your brand as if they'd awakened in some haze: \"Why did we buy this stuff to begin with?\" consumers wonder. \"Why did we give this thing such a high multiple?\" investors wonder. Somehow, we never learn the lesson with apparel, and so the cycle continues.  \n\n\nThere's a subtle distinction I'd like to make, though. While \"momentum\" is a good first-order approximation, it doesn't really describe what's actually going on: a realization gradient. Consumers over time realize the social capital that's being conveyed through apparel, and buy it because they come to an understanding. The realization gradient works both ways: some consumers are less quick to realize the death of a brand, but they eventually catch on and stop buying as well. The belief that apparel is a random walk down human preferences isn't accurate: rather, the social-capital zeitgeist shifts over time, and brands that are well-positioned to trade on that social capital do well.  \n\n\nVictoria's Secret (owned by publicly traded Limited Brands) is entering the negative realization death spiral. The clothing is now perceived as uncomfortable, overpriced vs alternatives, and promoting unhealthy expectations. Les Wexner's [Epstein connection](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/10/20689134/jeffrey-epstein-les-wexner-l-brands-victoria-secret-limited) is certainly not helping. The optics are horrendous. What was once sexy is now complicit. Worse, there are far, far too many competent competitors. Let's review.  \n\n\nGap Body has been exceptionally successful at targeting lingerie \"basics\", Journelle and Nordstrom round out the midtier, and Agent Provocateur and La Perla round out the high end.\n\n[Link to lots of women in lingerie.  For science.](http://theyieldblog.com/l_brands)\n\nDon't even get me started on the infinity of online competitors -- Adore Me, Panache, Hanky Panky, Heidi Klum Intimates, Mapale, Yummie, Addiction Nouvelle, Parfait, Le Mystere, Montelle Intimates, Giapenta, and Cosabella turn up with a few seconds of searching. Victoria's Secret is deader-than-dead, and worse yet, has massive operating leases and a fleet of retail sales associates that will accelerate its demise. To be honest, I've never understood how lingerie at Victoria's Secret became such a dominant in-store purchasing phenomenon to begin with: the shopping experience for men is at best awkward, and for women the brand is currently perceived as regressive, uncomfortable, and sexist. I'd also argue that the competition is broader than we realize: various athleisure brands fulfill a similar body-positivity drive while mitigating any feelings of being [complicit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2018/11/25/thirdlove-tells-john-mehas-how-to-fix-victorias-secret-in-full-page-new-york-times-ad/#292449f72285). Limited Brands will of course cut non-performing VS stores, but the question is how fast?  \n\n\nThere's an inherent tension between bondholders and equity holders here: Les Wexner owns 17% of the outstanding equity, his wife owns another 5%, and will issue dividends until it becomes [fraudulent conveyance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fraudulentconveyance.asp) to continue to do so. The fact that any dividends are being issued while a). the company needs to cut leases b). the company holds &gt;$5bn in debt yielding 6%+ and c). sales are imploding demonstrates either incompetent corporate finance or denial on the part of Les Wexner. If US creditor protection were stronger, bondholders might be able to fire off warning letters now asking Limited Brands leadership to start cutting leases, paying down debt, and halting dividend issuance. As it stands now, the only thing bondholders can do is sit back and record grievances until Chapter 11 gets filed.  \n\n\nI see only one way Limited Brands can pull itself out of this mess: Grow Bath &amp; Body Works fast enough to offset Victoria's Secret losses, and cut VS costs rather than trying to save a dead brand on the wrong side of the realization gradient. On Bath &amp; Body Works:\n\n*\"Their target is what we call the mastige segment,\" she continues. \"It's not prestige and it's not mass\u2014it's really about figuring out this niche of very American-centric shoppers that wants a notch above drugstore brands, but are still quite conscious. They don't want the prestige segment, which is where the Est\u00e9e Lauders and the L'Oreals of the world play.\" A compelling factor here is the price point. The largest size room spray (5.3 ounces) is only $9.50; foam soaps are $5.50; fragrance mists are $14. You can buy one item from every major category and barely spend $100. Kang confirms that's a huge part of the appeal. She says the diehard fan \"is someone who just absolutely loves fragrances, and sees fragrance as an essential part of her lifestyle.\" She adds, \"A lot of our customers actually own multiple fragrances, and they engage in fragrance the way that they do other fashion items in their life. It's a way to accessorize their style. It's not this sort of serious, deep-commitment kind of purchase that you see with a more traditional model in a department store.\"*\n\n1. I once mistakenly stayed in the AirBnB of what I at the time could only describe as a \"crazy candle lady\" who burned a different scent every 6 hours. It's a little bit sad that corporate marketing accords more nuance and empathy to their customers than anyone else ever would.  \n\n\n2. Bath &amp; Bodyworks' product is defensible: most \"nice things\" are expensive for most Americans, whereas Bath and Body Works offers an affordable, guiltless, if synthetic form of self-care. The guiltlessness of the brand is the ultimate growth driver: its products are sweets-adjacent (notice how many of the candles below are food-oriented), and inexpensive. Most activities I personally enjoy are either expensive enough to induce some amount of guilt, or unhealthy enough to do the same. There are almost no \"free pleasures\" -- an inexpensive scent from Bath &amp; Body Works might be one of the few. I think this is ultimately what's giving Bath &amp; Body Works its incredible comps, and being scent-based, it's of course naturally resistant to online competition.\n\n[Limited Brands Financial Model](http://theyieldblog.com/l_brands)  (Link to financial model)\n\nHere's a model of my best guess of what will happen (click on the image so you don't have to squint). There are a couple noteworthy things here:\n\n1). VS has not yet signficiantly cut non-lease SG&amp;A -- in fact it appears to still be growing in the low-single digits. This is totally unacceptable and honestly shows that LB management is either delusional or incompetent: if your revenues are declining 8% a year and you somehow find a way to grow SG&amp;A, you are either flailing, an imbecile, or a flailing imbecile. My guess, after having worked at many companies, is that Limited Brands management never set up the kind of performance-attribution tracking necessary to intelligently allocate capital. Their internal planning is likely just budget-based departmental fights. What's worse, new CEO Mehas is likely ride-or-die on Victoria's Secret: so long as he continues to describe his job as \"listening to the consumer\", rather than \"tying a tourniquet\", I expect SG&amp;A to be flat at best. There's also the \"stubborn founder\" angle -- for Les Wexner to order Mehas to cut VS would be a repudiation of his life's work. Old billionaires tend to get very sticky, and given Wexner's affiliations with Epstein, doubly so.  \n\n\n2). Various gross margins have been adjusted -- many non-cash impairments are negatively impacting earnings in a way that is irrelevant to the business.  \n\n\n3). Store leases are typically around 10 years long and non-cancellable, but management is only cutting total VS store square footage by around 3% a year, which means it's only closing around 30% of available \"closeable\" stores. This is not remotely aggressive enough. Management should be aggressively negotiating subleases and taking lease break restructuring impairments on their worst-performing stores. They should also avoid opening new stores, especially not ones in [nearly-Brexit](https://tietheknot.scot/the-first-victorias-secret-store-in-scotland-opens-today/) Scotland. I mean really, what is Les Wexner thinking?  \n\n\n4). While I continue to model growth in Bath &amp; Body Works, I think we are close to hitting a wall on growth: most women I know consider the brand to be for tweens and low-income young mothers. There's also minimal international appeal -- this is a niche brand for middle American women that is nearing saturation. Even if we assume 50m American women buy $100 a year of the stuff, that still only gets us $5bn of annual revenues. I think we are very close to hitting a wall in overall appetite unless Bath and Body Works can find some new realization gradient with very different demographics.  \n\n\n5). VS sales and gross margin decline comes almost completely from promotions, aka price cuts. VS will likely struggle to keep gross margins above 30% in the future.  \n\n\n6). I really want to emphasize how much the core of this conflict is fundamentally about capital structure ownership: equity performance via leveraged SG&amp;A, versus debt de-leveraging via decreased SG&amp;A. Non-rent SG&amp;A is the single largest controllable driver of VS operating profits. Yes, the [fashion show was cancelled](https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/victorias-secret-fashion-show-canceled-why-1203413186/), but it's not enough: literally the entire company hinges on whether it can cut SG&amp;A or not -- by 2025 VS will be 0% operating margins from VS declines, even if they manage to reverse SG&amp;A growth and cut it by 3%. Dramatic restructuring will be necessary to save Limited Brands.  \n\n\nPersonally, I am going to own a small holding of LBrands bonds: it doesn't look like the company as a whole will become insolvent by 2027, whereas the stock will almost certainly be unable to avoid a complete implosion in a few years, so I am planning on shorting 1/3 of the amount of my bond holdings amount in equity. The goal here is to target a very narrow, carefully modeled valuation range of stub equity value mismanaged by thumb-sucking leadership that will pull themselves out of a crisis only when things get dire.",

Treasury bonds gained 20% during the 2008 crash:\u00a0[http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/\\~adamodar/New\\_Home\\_Page/datafile/histretSP.html](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html)\n\n[https://imgur.com/JBQjgIu](https://imgur.com/JBQjgIu)\n\n**Advantages of stocks:**\n\n\\-Voting rights. Stockholders get to vote on board of directors.\n\n\\-Ownership of all profits after bondholders are paid. Profits are returned through dividends. Sometimes for tax reasons companies also return money by buying back stock, which raises the stock price.\n\n\\-Historically have a higher rate of return (average of 9% annually since 1980). Future yields are expected by many people to be lower.\n\n[https://imgur.com/aFkI4FE](https://imgur.com/aFkI4FE)\n\n**It's safest to own both stocks and bonds!**\n\nSuppose you were of retirement age in 2007 with $2 million in savings. When the market dropped &gt; 50% (Dow went from about 14,400 to 6,700) you would be very tempted to sell at the bottom. If instead you owned half bonds and half stocks, your bonds would have gained in value by 20%, which means your overall portfolio would only have dropped by 15%. More importantly, you would be able to sell your bonds and buy stocks when the market was at its lowest. A good rule of thumb is to always own half stocks and half bonds, and to rebalance your portfolio back to 50/50 at a specific date each year. This will force you to sell stocks when they are high and buy them when they're low. If you're younger you may prefer a slightly riskier portfolio with more stocks and less bonds, and older people closer to retirement are often advised to hold a higher proportion of bonds.\n\n**Diversification:** Not putting all your eggs in one basket. Takes the stress out of investing, which means you make better decisions.\n\n**Mutual Funds vs ETFs**\n\n**Mutual Fund:** Professional money managers that invest for you, usually for a 2% annual fee. Never invest in a mutual fund if you can help it! That 2% fee will compound to 50% over a 20 year period. Mutual funds have been shown to consistently underperform the market.\n\n**ETF: Exchange traded fund.**\u00a0A basket of stocks or bonds. ETFs charge much lower fees than mutual funds.\u00a0\n\nExample etfs:\n\nSPY: An ETF that mirrors the average performance or the top 500 traded US stocks. Expense ratio is 0.1% annually.\n\nGOVT: Tracks US government bonds, with an expense ratio of 0.15% annually.\u00a0\n\n**Simple Investment plan**\n\nIf you want a stress-free investment plan that tracks the overall market, open up an account somewhere (I use Fidelity) and put half your money in SPY and half of it in GOVT. Be sure to set up a calendar event each year to remind yourself to rebalance between these two.\u00a0\n\n**Valuing Stocks**\n\nFor most people, trying to pick winning stocks is a poor use of time versus buying an ETF. Most stocks have been closely scrutinized by an army of professional stock analysts who usually have done more research than we are willing to do. On the other hand, picking stocks can be a lot of fun!\u00a0\n\nTake Ford as an example. I crossed out the chart and the stock price because I think it's more important to look at a company's financials. A company can still be relatively cheap even after it has gone up significantly, or expensive even though it has dropped.\n\n[https://imgur.com/8e2zrB6](https://imgur.com/8e2zrB6)\n\n**Stock Price**: Cost per share. Means absolutely nothing, since the number of shares issued is arbitrary.\n\n**Market Cap:** The cost of buying all the shares in the company.\u00a0\n\n**Dividend Yield:** Annual return on investment from dividend payments.\n\n**P/E Ratio:** Price to Earnings ratio. Specifically, it is market cap divided by last year's net income (i.e. profit). Intuitively, if you bought the whole company, it is the number of years of profit you would need to receive until your investment paid for itself.\u00a0\n\nP/E ratio is the most important metric to consider. Historically 15 was an average P/E ratio for a company, although today 20 is average. See\u00a0[https://www.macrotrends.net/2577/sp-500-pe-ratio-price-to-earnings-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2577/sp-500-pe-ratio-price-to-earnings-chart)\n\n**Growth Companies**\n\nA company is considered a \"growth company\" if it has a history of growing rapidly (say &gt; 20% a year). Investors are willing to pay more for growth companies because they expect income to continue growing. Typically, investors may be willing to buy a company at a P/E ratio of 30-40 if it has a solid prospects of future growth.\u00a0\n\nFor an example of a growth company, check out Twilio's financials on Yahoo finance:\n\n[https://imgur.com/QeFPFyd](https://imgur.com/QeFPFyd)\n\nTwilio is a giant money pit: It lost $263 million in the last 12 months! However, it's revenues have increased by 50% every year, so investors are willing to pay a fortune for it:\n\n[https://imgur.com/SloY6PI](https://imgur.com/SloY6PI)\n\n(Note there is no P/E ratio, since earnings are negative). The takeaway is that investors are willing to pay $14 billion for a company that loses $263 million a year on $1 billion in revenue. This is only because their revenue has increased 50% for the past several years (and Twilio is a tech stock, which tend to be overpriced). When evaluating a stock like this, consider what the company would have to do in the next five years to justify this valuation. For Twilio to have a P/E ratio of 30 (which would be normal for a tech stock), it will need to make $500 million a year within five years. Furthermore, if you buy a stock like this you don't expect it to simply justify its valuation but to double in value, which means investors are expecting it to make $1 billion a year in profits within the next five years. This would require Twilio to both turn its profit margin from -25% to something healthy like 20%, and then to increase its sales from $1 billion to $5 billion. High priced-in expectations like this make growth companies like Twilio very risky. Personally, I avoid growth companies.\n\n**Value Companies**\n\nCompanies that are selling at a discount, usually because they aren't growing rapidly. Although the business may be in trouble, the stock is being sold cheap enough that it may be safer to purchase than a growth company. Take a look at the department store Macy's, which has scared investors off since retail is in decline:\n\n[https://imgur.com/K8iRBAS](https://imgur.com/K8iRBAS)\n\nNotice that revenue has declined about 6% over the past 4 years, and net income has held steady. Also notice that profit margin is only about 4%, which means it would only take a small drop in fortune for net income to become negative. Were that to happen, would this company pose a bankruptcy risk? Let's check out the balance sheet:\u00a0\n\n[https://imgur.com/ezMrjQB](https://imgur.com/ezMrjQB)\n\nMacy's only has $4.6 Billion in debt, which isn't too high compared to $26 Billion in sales and $1 Billion annual profit.\u00a0\n\nIn summary, Macy's is facing slightly declining sales but has consistent profit, and has low debt. There appears to be little bankruptcy risk over the next several years, even though revenue is declining.\u00a0\n\n[https://imgur.com/qCR75lL](https://imgur.com/qCR75lL)\n\nThe company is selling at a P/E ratio of 5, compared to the market average of 20! This means if you bought the company at its current price (5.1 Billion) you would make back your investment in 5 years. The company is also paying out a 9% dividend. Even if you expect Macy's to continue to decline in revenue, you can make a strong case that this is a good investment based on the low P/E ratio. Even if retail continues to decline, Macy's should, (to some extent) be able to keep a positive profit margin by closing down unprofitable stores and leaving the profitable ones open.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how to value stocks, research the Discounted Cash Flow model.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n\\-Picking your own stocks is riskier, more time-consuming and stressful than buying a basket of stocks (an ETF). I only do it because I enjoy it.\n\n\\-Keep an even balance between stocks and bonds.\n\n\\-Prefer ETFs to mutual funds.\n\n\\-Stock price is an arbitrary number, since companies have different numbers of shares outstanding. A stock priced at $10 could have a higher market cap than another stock priced at $100.\n\n\\-When valuing a company, P/E ratio is a critical number. Growth companies demand P/E ratios, value companies have lower ratios. Currently the average P/E ratio for a stock is 20.\n\n\\-Ignore stock market news. These days the stock market goes up and down because of\u00a0algorithmic trading, not because of the reasons financial reporters talk about.",

        "selftext": "[Posting from a throwaway, in case you're curious about the absence of a post history.]\n\nI opened a taxable Fidelity Go robo-adviser account a few months ago for the purpose of saving up for a down-payment on our first home in around six years from now (2026). I chose the 70/30 stock/bond allocation. Looking at the actual funds that Fidelity selected for me shows ~24% in FUENX (Fidelity Flex Municipal Income Fund) and ~4% in FUEMX (Fidelity Flex Conservative Income Municipal Bond Fund). I assume the selection of stock funds is standard and doesn't need to be discussed further (39% S&amp;P500, 5% small cap, 4% mid cap, 20% international). Other context: We're already maxing out our 401K and Roth IRA contributions each year. We are in a moderately high tax bracket.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Does this stock/bond allocation make sense for my investment goal?\n* Do I need to think about the tax implications of the holdings or is this going to be marginal over the six year time period?\n* How do I evaluate the quality and fitness-for-purpose of the bond funds? I was slightly surprised to see that the bonds are munis and not short-term treasuries.\n* (Related question) How should I be thinking about the purpose of the muni bond funds in my portfolio? Are they there to mitigate potential losses from the stock funds? My rudimentary understanding of munis is that they are funded by state and local income and property taxes and potentially revenue from state/local infrastructure. Don't all of these revenue sources take a hit during a recession? If so, aren't these a poor choice of security for insuring against this kind of scenario? On the other hand, https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Municipal_bonds says the average default rate of rated munis from 1970-2011 was 0.13% and even B-rated munis only default at a 4% rate over 10 years according to https://www.moodys.com/sites/products/DefaultResearch/2001700000407258.pdf.\n* I **feel** like the possibility of a major stock market correction and/or recession is almost certain over the next six years. Of course this is purely feels and not based on anything concrete whatsoever. In any case, is there anything I can or should do with my investments for this specific purpose (buying a home in 2026) to account for this possibility?",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nToday, a Forex scammer attempted to target me via Instagram, which led me down a rabbit hole to here. I think I'm a good representation of an \"average\" US American - I work for myself (due to no connections, just my degrees, determination, and coldcalls), had almost the exact average of student debt until a fortunate and modest inheritance, and make a lower than average amount of money considering my degrees. My only unique quality would be my curiosity and my thirst for learning. In spite of having undergraduate and graduate degrees I've never taken even an Economics 101 course. After extensive research a few years ago I have an extremely modest Roth IRA with Fidelity composed of mixed mutual funds and a minuscule amount of money in Robinhood from when I was young. \n\nSo, to my theory - After falling into this rabbit hole of Forex scammers, I have decided these are the 3 types of humans who make money in investing:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The extremely wealthy, who can pay others to invest and manage their money for them\n2. Scammers\n3. Those who are have above average financial literacy in economics, specifically investing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo that end - What are some legitimate resources I can consult to learn more about first, the economy, and second, investing? I'm not interested in getting rich quick, or frankly, at all. Most of my life values don't lie in wealth accumulation and I currently make enough money to support myself. However, I am embarrassed about my lack of economic and investing knowledge as a soon to be 30 year old adult. Suggestions?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "selftext": "I'm following a simple 2-3 fund lazy portfolio in my separate 401k and pension plans; 401k I buy into Schwab funds while pension I'm buying into Vanguard funds. I have the option to buy all into either (and I could also even buy into fidelity and others). I know Vanguard is the gold standard but I also like diversification in case of technical errors where I'm not relying on just one gate keeper. Now, here's my question ... Does it make any difference that it appears Vanguard pays consistent quarterly dividends while Schwab appears to pay only 2x per year in some cases? Everything I've ever read says the big guys (Vanguard, Schwab, Fidelity, etc) are all pretty much the same when it comes to low cost index funds. I'd imagine quarterly dividends are superior to less frequent reinvestments ala Vanguard funds. I'm beginning to question if I should just focus solely on Vanguard but again I like the diversification if they're truly equal. These funds are all in tax advantaged accounts and I'm in my early 40's.\n\nVanguard (4x per year consistent)\nhttps://www.dividendinvestor.com/dividend-history-detail/VTSAX/\n\nSchwab (2-3x per year)\nhttps://www.dividendinvestor.com/dividend-history-detail/swtsx/",

Do firms besides Vanguard, Schwab, and Fidelity offer the ultra low-cost index funds?  I've found offerings from all three (with comparisons to each other), but I can't seem to find anymore.\n2. Are the index funds within each class created equal?  e.g., here are the S&amp;P 500 Indexes from the three companies:\n\n|Ticker|Name|Expense ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|VFIAX|500 Index Admiral Shares|0.04|\n|SWPPX|Schwab S&amp;P 500 Index Fund|0.02|\n|FXAIX|Fidelity 500 Index Fund|0.15|\n\nThe returns for the first two (I can't pull FXAIX up through TIAA) are nearly identical, as expected. \n\n3.  Assuming the answer to 2. is yes, should you always go for the one with the lower expense ratio (assuming there are no additional expenses). Specifically, why would I choose VFIAX over SWPPX?",

        "selftext": "This post might be a little lengthy, but I figured I would list the majority of my thoughts since this is my first post here. Any response would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI am a college student that recently finished up some upper level finance classes, and a few of our take-home assignments were based around researching stocks and options. My interest was sparked and I made the first step in becoming a \u201ctrader\u201d. \n\nI registered an account roughly 5 days ago, and just scrolled through and got adjusted to the Robinhood layout before making a move. I deposited $100 (college....broke) and did a bit of research before making the first initial step in purchasing a stock.\n\nWith my first trade being made 2 days ago, I am currently up $30 and it has been pretty exciting so far. \n\nMy current goal is to play around with some money that I received out of luck and test my luck on this platform. My long-term goal is to reach an account balance of closer to $500-$1000, in which I then plan on moving to a service such as Fidelity and put my money in a safer and more reliable place, such as $AMZ or $AAPL, even if it means only owning a couple of shares. The way I see it is that if I were to lose the $100, it would be over a gradual period since I\u2019m not one to impulsively dump all my money into one place, and that it would offset because of the fact that I will have acquired at least some new knowledge about trading. \n\nHere are my questions (feel free to address any or all):\n\nQuestion 1: am I making the right decision, or should I work to acquire some more money over time and skip this step of playing around with money on Robinhood?\n\nQuestion 2: if you have been lurking this sub for some time now, is the advice that you have found generally helpful/hurtful? People always say \u201cresearch research research\u201d but I feel as if spending hours on end looking into a single stock that might yield me $50 is not worth my time at the moment. Should I trust others that put in more time than me?\n\nIn addition, researching does not ALWAYS give you a clear view of what to really do with a stock because it is sometimes hard to interpret what the information really means, if it did then everyone would be making a profit.\n\nQuestions about Robinhood itself:\n- if I wanted to purchase a stock right when the market opens, can I file a request at 10pm the night before and it will automatically purchase for me when possible?\n- if I have already reached my maximum number of \u201cday trades\u201d for the week, if I purchase a stock the next day do I have to wait at least a full market day before I can sell, no matter the drop that the stock takes?\n- what amount of money would I need to focus more on dividend payout and actually make a decent return, as oppose to just buying/selling?\n\nAny and all help would mean a lot! Thanks\n\nTL/DR: looking to gain some money through robinhood to eventually put into a more reliable place, questions are listed and responses are appreciated!",

        "selftext": "As I'm working on updating my portfolio, I've been looking at the various index funds across firms (specifically, I'm trying to match BlackRock with Vanguard, Schwab, and Fidelity). Schwab to Vanguard can be found [here](https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/accounts_products/schwab_index_funds_etfs), and Fidelity to Vanguard [here](https://www.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/investing-ideas/index-funds). I attempted to match  BlackRock funds manually using MarketWatch. A fairly extensive list is below, in case it's useful for anyone. There may be some typos, but I've tried to be careful.\n\nOne oddity I noticed was in small-caps. Specifically, VSMAX (Vanguard small-cap index admiral shares) closely matches BSMIC (BlackRock iShares Russel Small/Mid-Cap index fund) while SWSSX (Schwab Small-Cap Index Fund), FSSNX (Fidelity Small Cap Index Fund), and MASKX (BlackRock iShares Russell 2000 Small-Cap Index Fund) are very similar, even though VSMAX, SWSSX, and FSSNX are supposed to be direct competitors. \n\n**Total stock market**\t\t\n\nVTSAX\ttotal stock market index admiral shares\t0.04\n\nSWTSX\tSchwab Total Stock Market Index Fund\t0.03\n\nFSKAX\tFidelity Total Market Index Fund\t0.015\n\nBITSX\tiShares Total U.S. Stock Market Index Fund\t0.08\t\n\n**S&amp;P 500 Index**\t\t\n\nTicker\tName\tExpense ratio\n\nVFIAX\t500 index admiral shares\t0.04\n\nSWPPX\tSchwab S&amp;P 500 Index Fund\t0.02\n\nFXAIX\tFidelity 500 Index Fund\t0.015\n\nBSPIX\tiShares S&amp;P 500 Index Fund (Institutional)\t0.1\t\n\n**Large-cap growth**\t\t\n\nVIGAX\tGrowth Index Admiral Shares\t0.05\n\nSWLGX\tSchwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth Index Fund\t0.035\n\nFSPGX\tFidelity Large Cap Growth Index Fund\t0.035\t\n\n**Large-cap blend**\t\t\n\nVLCAX\tLarge-cap index admiral shares\t0.05\n\nSNXFX\tSchwab 1000 Index Fund\t0.05\n\nBRGNX\tiShares Russell 1000 Large-Cap Index Fund\t0.13\t\n\n**Large-cap value**\t\t\n\nVVIAX\tvalue index admiral shares\t0.05\n\nSWLVX\tSchwab US Large-Cap Vlue Index Fund\t0.035\n\nFLCOX\tFidelity Large Cap Value Index Fund\t0.035\n\n**Mid-cap extended**\t\t\n\nVEXAX\textended market index admiral shares\t0.07\n\nFSMAX\tFidelity Extended Market Index Fund\t0.045\n\n**Mid-cap growth**\t\t\n\nVMGMX\tmid-cap growth index admiral shares\t0.07\n\nFMDGX\tFidelity Mid Cap Growth Index Fund\t0.05\n\n**Mid-cap blend**\t\t\n\nVIMAX\tmid-cap index admiral shares\t0.05\n\nSWMCX\tSchwab U.S. Mid-Cap Index Fund\t0.04\n\nFSMDX\tFidelity Mid Cap Index Fund\t0.025\n\nBRMIX\tiShares Russell Mid-Cap Index Fund \t0.12\n\n**Mid-cap value**\t\t\n\nVMVAX\tmid-cap value index admiral shares\t0.07\n\nFIMVX\tFidelity Mid Cap Value Index Fund\t0.05\n\n**Small-cap growth**\t\t\n\nVSGAX\tsmall-cap growth index admiral shares\t0.07\n\nFECGX\tFidelity Small Cap Growth Index Fund\t0.05\t\n\n**Small-cap blend**\t\t\n\nVSMAX\tsmall-cap index admiral shares\t0.05\n\nBSMIX\tiShares Russell Small/Mid-Cap Index Fund \t0.12\n\n\t\t\n\nSWSSX\tSchwab Small-Cap Index Fund\t0.04\n\nFSSNX\tFidelity Small Cap Index Fund\t0.025\n\nMASKX\tiShares Russell 2000 Small-Cap Index Fund\t0.12\n\n\t\t\n\n**Small-cap value**\t\t\n\nVSIAX\tsmall-cap value index admiral shares\t0.07\n\nFISVX\tFidelity Small Cap Value Index Fund\t0.05\t\n\n**Small-cap blend (tax-managed)**\t\t\n\nVTMSX\ttax-managed small-cap admiral shares\t0.09\t\n\n**Social index**\t\t\n\nVFTAX\tVanguard FTSE Social Index Fund Admiral\t0.14\n\nFITLX\tFidelity\u00ae U.S. Sustainability Index Fund\t0.11\n\n**International**\t\t\n\nVTIAX\ttotal international stock index admiral shares\t0.11\n\nFTIHX\tFidelity Total Intl Index Fund\t0.06\n\nBDOIX\tiShares MSCI Total International Index Fund\t0.16\n\n\t\t\n\nVFSAX\tFTSE all-world ex-US small-cap admiral index shares\t0.17\n\n\t\t\n\nVTMGX\tVanguard developed markets index fund\t0.07\n\nSWISX\tSchwab International Index Fund\t0.04\n\nFSPSX\tFidelity International Index Fund\t0.35\n\n\t\t\n\nVFWAX\tVanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Index Admiral\t0.11\n\nFSGGX \tFidelity Global ex US Index Fund\t0.055\n\nMAIIX\tiShares MSCI EAFE International Index Fund \t0.11\n\n\t\t\n\nVEMAX\tVanguard Emerging Markets Index Fund\t0.14\n\nFPADX\tFidelity Emerging Markets Index Fund\t0.075\t\n\n**Real Estate**\t\t\n\nVGSLX\tVanguard Real Estate Index Admiral\t0.12\n\nFSRNX\tFidelity Real Estate Index Fund\t0.07\n\nBIRDX\tiShares Developed Real Estate Index Fund\t0.2\n\n**Total US Bond Market**\t\t\n\nVBTLX\tVanguard Total Bond Market Index Admiral\t0.05\n\nSWAGX\tSchwab U.S. Aggregate Bond Index Fund\t0.04\n\nFXNAX\tFidelity\u00ae US Bond Index Fund\t0.025\n\nBMOIX\tiShares U.S. Aggregate Bond Index Fund\t0.1\t\n\n**US TIPS Bonds**\t\t\n\nVTAPX\tVanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund\t0.06\n\nSWRSX\tSchwab\u00ae Treasury Inflation Protected Securities Index Fund\t0.05\n\nBIIPX\tiShares Short-Term TIPS Bond Index Fund \t0.09",

        "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nSo let me start by saying...I'm not really trying to time the market, but at least for now I technically am.\n\nI've deposited $6000 after tax dollars into a Fidelity IRA for tax year 2019, just now in January 2020.  I have not yet invested into a particular fund, but understand that I have to by April 15th.  I would like to buy a dip between now and then.  My question is, if I buy that particular fund on a dip, is there a delay or does it immediately honor the price at time of purchase.    Also, after I do purchase, I am planning on immediately converting to a Roth.  \n\nIm looking for feedback on this strategy. I realize that in the long run it really won't matter but at least if there's going to be some volatility I'd like to take advantage of it. For instance if this virus thing breaks out and gets really crazy and the markets tank I'd hate for that to happen the day after I buy in.\n\nFor context: This is my first IRA account, I already am maxing my 401k, and I do not meet the income requirements to get the tax benefit for IRA accounts or deposit directly into a Roth.",

I've been doing some reading and I wanted to see if my plan makes sense.\n\n1. Open a Traditional IRA with Fidelity\n2. Fill out Fidelity's form to remove excess contributions for 2019. This should be $6000 + the investment gain from that. Does anyone know if Fidelity accounts for investment gain or not? The form is here:  [https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060\\_www\\_fidelity\\_com/documents/customer-service/IRA-return-excess-contribution-request.pdf](https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/customer-service/IRA-return-excess-contribution-request.pdf) \n3. Transfer the money to a Fidelity Traditional IRA.\n4. Claim the investment gain on my 1040 and pay taxes on that.\n5. Convert the Traditional IRA in to a Roth IRA (backdoor). I think Fidelity allows you to do that without any issue.\n\nI have a few other questions as well.\n\n* Is there anything else I should be aware of? I only have a 401k and a Fidelity Individual account that I contribute to.\n* Is there really any downside to contributing to a traditional IRA and then converting it to a Roth IRA compared to a normal brokerage account?\n* Is there any limit on traditional IRA or Roth IRA backdoor conversions? I searched for a while and couldn't find anything on it.\n* Is there any reason why I can't contribute $500 a month to the traditional IRA and then roll it over immediate to the Roth IRA? That would result in me doing a backdoor rollover 12 times a year.\n\nThanks for the help. I'm trying to get this all sorted out. I thought I had everything nice and settled but then this came up.",

If this subreddit is not the correct place for this type of post I apologize.\n\n\\* Recently got a new job that will pay a lot more and want to make sure I am investing smartly for the long term. I am a recent college grad (Spring 2019) with a medium to high risk tolerance (while I am young). I won\u2019t be worried with major fluctuations in my portfolio value. I\u2019ve learned a bunch while just reading over the past few months (slow job where I dont get much work) including this subreddit.\n\n\\* I did some calculations and realized that I definitely should start planning my investments now so that I don\u2019t have to make any big changes down the road and have a big effect on my portfolio. \n\n\\* I have a bunch of questions and I was hoping you all would be able to help me. I understand that a lot of these questions are super subjective and a lot are based on speculation but I am curious as to what you guys think. Long post incoming.\n\n\\* My current money breakdown:\n\n\t\\* No debt (super generous parents that helped pay for college)\n\n\t\\* Bank: \\~8K\n\n\t\\* 401K: \\~3K\n\n\t\\* I currently am staying at home so I basically move all of my money to Robinhood to invest since I don\u2019t really need an emergency fund.\n\n\t\\* Robinhood: \\~45K\n\n\t\t\\* Yes I am transferring all of this to a Fidelity account. \n\n\t\t\t1. Is there a way to waive the $75 transfer fee?\n\n\t\t\\* 25%: SPY/VOO\n\n\t\t\t2. Just started contributing to VOO instead of SPY due to the lower expense ratio. Is this a better move?\n\n\t\t\\* 20%: QQQ\n\n\t\t\\* 25%: AMZN\n\n\t\t\t\\* Yes I know that I shouldn\u2019t have this much an individual stock.\n\n\t\t\\* 30%: A variety of individual stocks. A good chunk of this is different tech stocks.\n\n\t\t3. I feel somewhat comfortable investing in tech stocks since I know the industry fairly well and have been reading/studying/learning about the industry for the last \\~10 years. I could just be getting lucky due to this crazy bull run going on (which is most likely the case). That said should I attempt to diversify more out of tech or is that ok while I'm young? I have a few individual stocks outside of tech namely COST, NIKE, and ADDY.\n\n\\* First I am planning to build up my emergency fund to have about 6 months of expenses.\n\n\\* I am planning to max out my 401K fully. At my current job I don\u2019t do this because I am a dumbass who had no idea what they were doing. I don\u2019t plan to retire early or anything (at least now but I don\u2019t think that will change). I am planning to move  funds here will be distributed between VOO/QQQ/VTI.\n\n\t4. What would be the best percentage distribution between those three index funds? I guess I am asking historically and based on pure future speculation what blend would be the best? I understand this is super speculative but I am curious of hearing some of the responses here.\n\n\\* I also plan to contribute the max amount $6K towards my Roth IRA. \n\n\t\\* Since the Roth IRA has no capital gains tax when I withdraw when I\u2019m much older I was planning on taking big risks here. While I am young put all of this towards tech/FAANG stocks.\n\n\t5. Is this a good idea if I am willing to have a medium to high risk? If not is putting it in VOO/VTI/QQQ an okay idea?\n\n\\* Even with tax, 401k, and Roth IRA contribution I will have a decent chunk of change left over. I am planning to put 80% of it in VOO/VTI/QQQ and then buy more individual stocks with the remaining 20% (this 20% will decrease as I get older). \n\n\t6. Once again I am just wondering if this an ok plan?\n\n\t7. Should I also look into blue chip, small cap, and mid cap stocks? What would the allocation look like there?\n\n8. Anything else I should do to optimize for the long term?",

This number is expected to rise as they review data and outcomes from the first participants.\n\nConsidering that full approval is estimated to be 2+ years away I would expect to see this number go into the thousands.\n\nBecause not just anyone will be able to open up a psychedelic clinic and offer treatment, Expanded Access is a huge first-mover advantage for establishing best practices for a budding clinic.\n\nI assume that all of the 10 sites will be those that have been part of Phase II and III trials to this point but it will be interesting to see if there are any partnerships, say between MAPS and Field Trip, Numinus of any of the other entrants hoping to stake out space in the clinical realm.\n\nCongratulations to the MAPS team and thank you for the work that you\u2019ve put in for the last 30+ years, we appreciate it.\n\n[Share The Trip Report](https://thetripreport.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share)\n\n## Ibogaine Goes to Davos?\n\nThe World Economic Forum, known simply as Davos, took place this week where very important people fly in private jets from around the world to \u201cseriously discuss\u201d climate change and tax avoidance.\n\nSorry, not tax avoidance, climate change, and adequately stocking their New Zealand based [doomsday bunkers](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzmzyx/hunting-silicon-valleys-doomsday-bunkers-in-new-zealand-documentary).\n\nSorry, not doomsday bunkers, climate change and how to get a hold of Jeffrey Epstein to find out where the new [Fuck Island](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/everything-we-know-about-jeffrey-epsteins-private-islands.html) is located.\n\nSorry, not Fuck Island.\n\nThe perils of climate change, existential risk how to raise the standard of living for the poor and marginalized.\n\nYes, that\u2019s it.\n\nLast year the WEC hosted a forum titled **The New Science of Psychedelics** in which Robin Carhart-Harris the head of psychedelic research at the center for neuroscience and pharmacology at London's Imperial College spoke about the bright psychedelic future.\n\nBut there is no mention of psychedelics in any of the presentations, panels, and forums in 2020.\n\nHowever, Bloomberg did publish [a piece](https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/hallucinogenic-root-takes-davos-stage-as-addiction-fighter) about Christian Angermeyer pitching Ibogaine, via the company, Demerx to Davos attendees, at least that\u2019s how it reads.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe World Economic Forum\u2019s billionaire audience in Davos took a break from the problem of climate change to listen to the story of a company developing a hallucinogenic drug\u2026Interest in such therapies is high as an opioid epidemic rages in the U.S., the German firm\u2019s founder Christian Angermayer said in the Swiss ski resort.\u201d\n\nThe implication, which I was not aware of, is that ATAI has a stake in [Demerx](https://demerx.com/), which has [a ](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/demerx-inc)[*GRIP*](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/demerx-inc)[ of Ibogaine related patents](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/demerx-inc) (the kids use \u201ca grip\u201d to mean \u201ca lot\", or \u201can abundant amount\u201d).\n\nVery interesting stuff.\n\nAddiction was a highlight of the meeting and an interesting event on the topic.\n\n#### [The real cost of addiction](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/the-real-cost-of-addiction/)\n\n&gt;\u201cWorldwide, addiction may be\u00a0*the*\u00a0most formidable health problem, affecting about one in every five people over the age of fourteen.

We've heard numerous allegations against numerous healers and read many testimonies of sexual abuse on online forums.  \nOne name that comes up repeatedly is Guillermo Ar\u00e9valo, a well-known healer who's been honoured by the Peruvian Congress for his work on sustainable development.\n\nThis is a particularly difficult problem in healing communities or therapeutic relationships which require trust and fidelity.\n\nIt is painfully sardonic to be sexually assaulted at the hands of the healer who you have sought out to help you resolve the residue of sexual assault.\n\n&gt;\u201cAnd also this weird co-dependent relationship for me where the medicine was helping me so I didn't want to speak up because I was afraid I would be ostracised from the community and then I would be kind of cut off from the medicine.\"\n\nMAPS uses a co-therapist strategy that reduces the likelihood of such a dynamic. But of course, the trade-off is that this presumably doubles the cost of treatment.\n\nOne of the future issues I see coming is captured in the Charles Bukowski line:\n\n&gt;*\u201cThe problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence.\u201d*\n\nWe\u2019re going to see an influx of people seeking to be shamans, guides, therapists and I am not sure how to convey the gravity of such a responsibility\u2014this to me is the true need for training.\n\nLuckily, Chacruna is here to offer guidance: [**Ayahuasca Community Guide for the Awareness of Sexual Abuse**](https://chacruna.net/community/ayahuasca-community-guide-for-the-awareness-of-sexual-abuse/)\n\n**\u2713**\n\n**More news from the land of psychedelia:**\n\n### [Why Magic Mushrooms Could Overshadow the Cannabis Boom](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-magic-mushrooms-could-overshadow-140900516.html?soc_src=social-sh&amp;soc_trk=tw)\n\n### [Congressman Backs Ballot Measure To Legalize Psychedelic Mushrooms For Therapeutic Use](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/congressman-backs-ballot-measure-to-legalize-psychedelic-mushrooms-for-therapeutic-use/)\n\n&gt;Rep.

        "selftext": "Recently got a new job that will pay a lot more and want to make sure I am investing smartly for the long term. I am a recent college grad (Spring 2019) with a medium to high risk tolerance (while I am young). I won\u2019t be worried with major fluctuations in my portfolio value. I\u2019ve learned a bunch while just reading over the past few months including some stuff from this subreddit.\n\nI did some calculations and realized that I definitely should start planning my investments now so that I don\u2019t have to make any big changes down the road and have a big effect. \n\nI have a bunch of questions and I was hoping you all would be able to help me. **I understand that a lot of these questions are super subjective and a lot are based on speculation but I am curious as to what you guys think**. Long post incoming.\n\nMy current money breakdown:\n\n* No debt (super generous parents that helped pay for college)\n* Bank: \\~8K\n* 401K: \\~3K\n* I currently am staying at home so I basically move all of my money to Robinhood to invest since I don\u2019t really need an emergency fund.\n* Robinhood: \\~45K\n   * Yes I am transferring all of this to a Fidelity account. \n   * 1) Is there a way to waive the $75 transfer fee?\n   *  25%: SPY/VOO\n      * 2) Just started contributing to VOO instead of SPY due to the lower expense ratio. Is this a better move?\n   * 20%: QQQ\n   * 25%: AMZN\n      * Yes I know that I shouldn\u2019t have this much an individual stock.\n   * 30%: A variety of individual stocks. A good chunk of this is different tech stocks.\n      * 3) I feel somewhat comfortable investing in tech stocks since I know the industry fairly well and have been reading/studying/learning about the industry for the last \\~10 years. I could just be getting lucky due to this crazy bull run going on (which is most likely the case). That said should I attempt to diversify more out of tech? \n\nWhen I start my new job I am planning to build up my emergency fund to have about 6 months of expenses.\n\nI am planning to max out my 401K fully. At my current job I don\u2019t do this because I am a dumbass who had no idea what they were doing. I don\u2019t plan to retire early or anything (at least now but I don\u2019t think that will change). I am planning to move  funds here will be distributed between VOO/QQQ/VTI.\n\n4) What would be the best percentage distribution between those three index funds? I guess I am asking historically and based on pure future speculation what blend would be the best? I understand this is super speculative but I am curious of hearing some of the responses here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also plan to contribute the max amount $6K towards my Roth IRA. I might be over the Roth IRA limit but possibly not. If I am over I plan to do a backdoor Roth IRA. \n\n* Since the Roth IRA has no capital gains tax when I withdraw when I\u2019m much older I was planning on taking big risks here. While I am young put all of this towards tech/FAANG stocks.\n* 5) Is this a good idea if I am willing to have a medium to high risk? If not is putting it in VOO/VTI/QQQ an okay idea?\n\nEven with tax, 401k, and Roth IRA contribution I will have a decent chunk of change left over. I am planning to put 80% of it in VOO/VTI/QQQ and then buy more individual stocks with the remaining 20% (this 20% will decrease as I get older). \n\n* 6) Once again I am just wondering if this an ok plan?\n* 7) Should I also look into blue chip, small cap, and mid cap stocks? What would the allocation look like there?\n\n8) Anything else I should do to optimize for the long term?\n\nThank you all in advance. I love learning about all this on the subreddit.",

I think I am on the right path since again with my current role, I need to almost set and forget my IRA's but any and all advice would be great.\n\nMy current savings is: 11k emergency fund, 18k checking acct(usually is near 20k but contributed to Roth to start the year).\n\n  \nCurrent value of other accounts:  \nFidelity Roth IRA total value ~39k...I'm rounding off values for ease, values presented as cost basis and mkt value as of this post.  \nHoldings: AAPL (cost basis 78.5, current val: 1900), APLE(16.24, 2800), BBALX (13.28, 2650), DAL(61.38, 890), DON(35.37, 2215), FSDAX(16.15, 5735), FSDIX(13.68, 1680), FSRFX(87.94, 2200), FTQGX(23.62, 3140), FXAIX(97.54, 3575), KBWD(21.08, 2380), PCEF(23.62,1740), RTN(182.80, 3520), STOR(31.72, 2600), T(28.57, 2000)  \n\n\nRollover IRA total value ~ 46.5k  \nHoldings: FAGIX(9.65, 5050), FBGRX(94.04, 5730), FCNTX(12.36, 2540), FFFHX(10.63, 5465), FHIFX(8.72, 1790), FLVEX(12.03, 5415), FSCPX(44.39, 5590), IGF(43.65, 4980), LQD(125.70, 4610), VCLT(100.19, 5290)\n\nMy current thought is to sell AAPL and harvest the gains, having bought 10 shares back in 2014 (first stock I ever bought), I sold 5 before my current job(7/2019) without knowing about the trading restriction. I also know that I am overweight with RTN and FSDAX combined to be a defense sector heavy. In selling AAPL and RTN, what would be a few suggestions on entering into? Also, in terms of the above, is having ~85k a solid footing at 32?\n\nThe only large expense I would see upcoming would be purchasing a home, have looked in the range of (200-275k) within the next 2 years.",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI am thinking of rolling over an old 401k  to an IRA to simplify things as well as get a better deal on trade prices (current 401k still charges $14.95 per trade!)\n\nI'd like the new account to allow me to trade funds and ETF, individual stocks, options (will be cash secured in IRA). I take it pretty much all big names have this available now (merrill edge, fidelity, vanguard, etc.) and have no more trade fees.\n\nWhat do you all think about a self directed IRA to allow greater diversification such as crowdfunding, syndication, real estate, private RE, etc.? Do the really high fees make sense only at some amount of money invested? Any hint or experience with these fees? Any number at which point the fees are actually alright? $100k, $200k, $300K, more?\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "Hello! This is my first post on reddit, so a mandatory WAZZZZAAAUPPPPP is neccesary here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to know how long a call stock option takes before the stock is in my account ready to be traded. This is just a theoretical question, I currently have no stock options, but lets say I wanted to buy APPL for instance, and I bought a call for apple at a SP of $100 and then the stock increases to MKT $120. I want to be able to exercise that call and buy the stock at $100 then turn around and sell it for $120 and cap that $10 profit before the mkt price falls again. How long does it take for the stock option to be exercised and the stock in my account ready to be traded? I am also using Fidelity, Etrade, really whatever platform how the lowest turn time (remeber, theoretical question).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso *PLEASE* do not lecture me on how \"nobody ever exercises option\" or \"Why would you exercise it, just sell it\". I understand what I am doing, and once again, this is just a theoretical quesiton. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you, love you.",

        "selftext": "I have a large amount of shares (approaching over 10,000) in a particular company that people for a long time said was going nowhere. It is opening facilities worldwide and about to start full-time production later this year when they're all open. The company is doing this to be able to provide worldwide volume once they start production and basically not hit any snags due to being overwhelmed.\n\nI feel extremely confident in the company and have done thorough research for months. I strongly feel that this company is going to blow up when everything opens. Customers are already waiting for products, partnerships have been signed, patents have been acquired, licenses have been put in for already and approved, etc. Very unique company with technology and methods that far surpass their competitors who really aren't competitors because they can't produce similar products. A couple of months from now, their efforts so far will be released and profits are estimated at over $10 million. Future estimates after that keep going up and will only increase because I'm familiar with the demand and partner companies.\n\nThis is a hobby investment that has turned more serious for me once I saw the potential. I am in the USA and use a Roth IRA (Fidelity) to do the trade. I do active trading, so it is more so the \"sell and wait 2-3 days to clear\" type of deal before buying again. I'm not in a hurry to trade like a stock market broker and I'm perfectly fine with this method. As I understand it, there also aren't any taxes on the gains in a Roth IRA, which is another reason why I like it. So I don't have to keep up with that stuff.\n\nIt is an OTC trade. I got that many shares at pretty low prices. I researched and watched the stocks of the company for months before initially investing, then I invested a certain amount. It wasn't all that much. When I saw the weekly trend of it averaging an up-and-down 6 to 8 cent variation per week, I basically started selling when it went up 6-8 cents and then letting the money in the Roth IRA clear and buying back days (or a week or whatever time) when it dropped down as much as I have seen it drop before. Then I would buy back in, gain about 500-600 shares in that single buy and wait for it to climb up another 6-8 cents again, then sell again. Repeating the \"sell when high, buy when low\" strategy. \n\nI literally started with hundreds of shares and have turned that into 10,000 shares with very little of my own money. The other money came from selling when high and buying back when low. Now, will this method always work? No. I can think of two scenarios. One, the price of course could drop (and for any company, for that matter - risk is always there in investing) and not go back up and I could lose my money. The company could tank for some reason, even when appearing to do well, and I could lose it that way.\n\nThe second way...the company could surge in price during one of the times when I've sold when it was high and the price could climb much higher and the company could take off. Yes, I'd lose some money, but could easily just go all-in again.\n\n**Now here's my question in all of this**:  Is there anything that I'm missing from this scenario? Clearly, my balance has increase positively from doing this and I have a lot of shares in the company. The company seems to be doing really well. I'm asking if there's anything that I *don't know of* in regards to the back-and-forth trading that I'm doing as active trading. Are there any unforeseen stipulations that I'm overlooking? Of course, as the amount of shares increases and the balance increases, every time that I do a sell-and-buy trade like that, the amount of shares continues to climb. When I first started out, I gained hundreds of shares per trade. Now I gain thousands more shares simply using that same method. A lot of people seem to call this method \"share recycling\" and I see some investors in the company (I monitor a major online forum for investors in the company) who are just buying in at x price and not even doing any of that. They're just buying more and more, even if the price keeps climbing, but not recycling any. I have a lot more shares than they do, of course.\n\nSo...are they just really overlooking this opportunity or am I missing something? I commented my number of shares on the forum and the low price that I bought in at and I got some comments that said, \"You're going to make some big bucks!\" from a lot of people who couldn't believe the number of shares and the super low price from where I sold when it was higher and then went all-in one day when it hit its lowest point of the year before rebounding. Just trying to cover my bases. What can you comment on this?",
