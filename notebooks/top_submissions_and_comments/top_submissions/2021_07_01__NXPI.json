        "selftext": "My goal with my current holdings is to pick stocks that I can reasonably expect to 4x or 5x over the next five years - there's no way they all will, but enough of them will. I view none as gambles unlike certain speculative stocks - I'm betting on the future. Portion 1 (Growth, 80%)\n\nAAPL 11.3%, MSFT 11%, SQ 11%, LRCX 10%, AMD 9%, MTCH 8.5%, TTD 7.6% \n\nDOCU 4.3%, TSLA 4%, NXPI 4%, ETSY 4%, ARKK 4%, ARKQ 3%, ARKG 2.4%, LABU 1.9% ARKF 1%, AVGO 1%, QQQJ 1%, DDD 0.6%, ARKX 0.3%, ICLN 0.1% \n\n\nA small portion of the portfolio is allocated to insurance/banks that I think can outperform their own sector - a bit based of fundamental valuations, and are present should the day that the inflation attack comes hit growth and boost banks. This stabilizes the portfolio through a period that I may want to retain my growth stocks amidst them being a little underwater or lagging i.e. this is the enabler. Portion 2 (11%): \n\nPRU 21%, ALLY 21%, BMO 21%, PNC 21%, AXP 16% \n\n\nA smaller portion of the portfolio is dedicated to low-volatility and drawdown components - save for a few days/events here and there. This allows me to invest as much cash as possible and withdraw it either from that or something else in the portfolio if I suddenly need the money - also if it dips the growth may have dipped more, enabling me to add money to growth stocks. The underperformance of this component is addressed by the growth portion. Portion 3 (9%): \n\nSPY 40%, VYM 17.5%, WMT 12.5%, QYLD 10%, XLRE 10%, NEE 8%\n\nI'm in my low to mid-20s, but I have it so bad with medical issues that there's no way my time horizon is until the age of 50, for I'm not sure how long I can or should live past then when my symptoms will worsen. I need to grow this now and then save my body for whatever life I have left. Goals aside, there's the portfolio for ratings and viewings.",

        "selftext": "Quick and easy 400% in a month or so, semi conductors have a mass shortage currnetly so the stock has been stagnant waiting for a huge boost once they figure out their supply problem. With the pandemic coming to a close demand will continue to soar and orders will be filled at faster rates. Simple and easy technical to follow with this.",

This is a major issue because instead of building the infrastructure to produce our own chips, we end up spending billions on foreign products. To combat this problem, the Senate has approved a $52B subsidy plan to help semiconductor manufacturers in the U.S to help boost fabrication. However, it will take time to build the infrastructure.

Amon has helped spearhead Qualcomm's 5G strategy and global markets. Before working at Qualcomm, Amon was the CTO of V\u00e9sper (wireless operator in Brazil). He also worked for NEC and Velocom. Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\tWe've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Disclaimer:*\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice\\*\\**\n\n*\\*\\*Do your own research\\*\\**",
