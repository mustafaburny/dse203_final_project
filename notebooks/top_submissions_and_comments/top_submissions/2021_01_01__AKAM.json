        "selftext": "Let's brainstorm this a little bit.  I'm sure most of you saw that snippet from 60 minutes (posted on WSB recently), saying, \"Amazon would have to sell every book being sold in the world today to justify its stock price.\" That was way back in the late 1990s when Amazon was just an on-line book store. \n\nSomeone else said, \"That's Tesla today.\" \n\nI'd like to know how. \n\nAmazon had a clear path to expand from selling books, to household gadgets, to literally everything and anything sold by anyone anywhere. Including things that didn't exist in the 1990s, like AWS cloud services (that \\*should\\* have gone to someone like Akamai or CSCO or MSFT, or Oracle or even freaking WalMart had a better information system infrastructure than Amazon had in the 1990s.)  Amazon dominating that segment was just a fluke. And currently the lion's share of its revenue too.\n\nAlso, I wanted an electric car but didn't want Tesla's goofy iPad-style interface system, among other things, so I took an old sports car and built my own EV. Guess what? EV's are not hard. Sure, mine is definitely not more efficient than a Tesla (or Bolt, or etc.) but I learned something important -- replacing the drivetrain and installing batteries was the easy part (granted, I have some electrical engineering experience -- but not much). Literally everything else about building a car was way, way, WAY harder. Companies like Ford, GM, Toyota, VW, etc. can \\*easily\\* outbuild Tesla, and highly efficient, high-torque electric motors and solid state batteries appear to be on their way to commodity status. \n\nSolar Panels, self-driving capability, yada, yada... I don't see how these can possibly match the scale of what Amazon did. Grid energy storage, merging with Space-X and using Starlink's Skynet as part of the self-driving hive-mind... maybe? \n\nWhat else could there be? Fully autonomous, self-managing houses? Is Tesla going to start selling phones that use Starlink, to fulfill the space Iridium tried to back in the 90's? \n\nHelp me understand how TSLA \\*might\\* live-up to its current stock price. I want to believe, but currently, I'm just not seeing it.",

Everything in this post is based on my personal opinion and open-source information. Please don't see this as any financial or investing advice. I have no positions in Okta at the moment.\n\n**OKTA - General Description**\n\nThe company can be seen as providing Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) and is one of the leading companies in the IDaaS market. Okta primarily focusses on 6 main industries: Healthcare, Public Sector, Education, Energy, Financial Services and Technology providing their services to more than 9400 small, medium and large enterprises worldwide.\n\nOkta's main product is the Okta Identity Cloud which is comprised of 6 platform services:\n\n    Directories: stores users and attributes\n    \n    Integrations: ensures that apps (currently 6500+) can connect to Okta\n    \n    Insights: aggregates, analyses and disseminates data from Okta and its partners\n    \n    Identity Engine: customizable access experiences like authorization, authentication and registration\n    \n    Workflows: automates identity-centric processes\n    \n    Devices: collects device identity and context\n\nThese platform services can be leveraged using Okta's products, API's and SDK's like:\n\n    Single Sign On\n    Universal Directory\n    Advanced Server Access\n    Adaptive Multi-actor Authentication\n    Lifecycle Management\n    Access Gateway\n    API Access Management\n    Developer\n    One App\n    Enterprise\n\n**Okta Integration Platform**\n\nThe biggest part that makes Okta a key player is the fact that they integrated 6500+ applications into their cloud and on-premises systems which ensure that on all aspects, an organization can secure their processes. They integrated:\n\n* Human Resources Information Systems like bambooHR and Workday\n* Network Security like Cisco, PaloAlto and Fortinet\n* Application Delivery Controllers like F5, Akamai and Citrix Netsclar\n* Security Analytics like Splunk, Rapid1, IBM QRadar\n* Cloud Access Security Brokers like Bitglass and McAfee\n* API Gateways like AWS, Google Cloud, Apigee\n* Identity Governance and Administration like SailPoint\n* ID Proofing like Acuant, Evident and Experian\n* Privileged Access Management like BeyondTrust and CyberArk\n* Endpoint Security and Management like IBM, MobileIron and VMware\n* Healthcare Technologies like Cerner and AthenaHealth\n* Protocol Based Custom Integrations like Radius, LDAP and SAML\n* Bot Detection like Arkose Labs, Shape and Perimeter\n* Customer Data Integrators like Segment\n* Email Security like ProofPoint\n* SaaS Management Platforms like BetterCloud and Intello\n\nI've made this list, to show how versatile and broad their product is. They ensure that their single product can be used for a multitude of cases within the Workforce Identity, Customer Identity and Access Management market segments.\n\n**How they make money**\n\nOkta's business model follows a SaaS-based delivery model in which business subscribe to Okta's services and pay a fee per user per month. Okta's subscription revenues in the 9 months ending 10/31/2020 jumped 50% YoY to $571.2M.\n\n**Financials &amp; Valuations (as of** [10/31/2020](https://investor.okta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/okta-announces-strong-third-quarter-results)**):**\n\n* Current Market Capitalization (as of 1/15/2021) - $32.75B\n* Total Revenue (3 months): $217,379,000\n* Total Revenue (9 months): $600,684,000\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 3 months: ($72,764,000) \u2013 Up from ($63,495,000)\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 9 months: ($190,526,00) \u2013 Up from ($158,441,000)\n* Cash on Hand: $2.945B\n\n**Growth &amp; Opportunities**\n\nOkta is one of the companies that greatly benefited from the lockdowns all over the world, and the subsequent rise in the need for identity and access management services triggered by the  work-from-home wave. The company's momentum will highly likely continue through fiscal 2021 and beyond, with more and more companies looking to ensure safe and secure work-from-home environments that protects companies, their employees and their customers. CFO Bill Losch said on the company's third-quarter [earnings call](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/earnings),  \"We remain confident that the factors that are driving our business today will continue to drive our business well into the future.\"\n\nJust recently, [Okta's products were made available in the AWS Marketplace](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201202005943/en/Okta-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Bring-the-Okta-Identity-Cloud-to-AWS-Marketplace). It is expected that this move will drive top-line growth.\n\nOkta estimates that it will end fiscal 2021 with revenue of about $822.5 million, an increase of 40% from the previous year, and that it will surpass $1 billion in sales in fiscal 2022. Although Okta isn't profitable yet, one of its pro's is that the free cash flow consistently stays on the plus side and makes up 19% of Okta's revenue. One of the most important contracts in this business are annual contracts. Okta gained 100 customers in Q3 with $100,000+ annual contracts, totaling over 1700 customers. The number of large enterprise contracts ($500,000+) grew 50% YoY to 320. These now represent 80% of Okta's annual contract values.\n\nAs president-elect Joe Biden will take office later this week, one of the most anticipated moves is an [increase in cyber security](https://buildbackbetter.gov/press-releases/statement-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-cybersecurity/) spending by the new administration. Putting Okta, among other big cyber security players, into an excellent playing field the coming years.\n\n**Price Target**\n\nMarch 3 is the expected Q4 earnings. Okta is in a good position to beat their ER once again.\n\n[18 Analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OKTA/analysis?p=OKTA) combined have an average price target of $262.44.17 (upside of \\~4%) with tops being at $313.\n\n**TL;DR Okta is in a great position within the Identity and Access Management market which makes the company one of the ideal high-growth stocks moving forward. Personally, I think it is worth taking a look at and most likely a stock that will pay off not only when Q4 Earnings are reported, but easily for the next 2 years at least.**",

        "selftext": "[https://youtu.be/\\_O-YtayUoiw](https://youtu.be/_O-YtayUoiw)\n\nTravis Kalanick Is an american businessman who built some of the most recognizable tech startups in the world. He built Scour, Red Swoosh and Uber and after leaving uber he started cloudkitchens. He was born in 1976 and grew up in Northridge, a suburb of Los Angeles. His parents had catholic and jewish background. He showed lots of interest towards computing when he was already vey young. He learned coding when he was just in middle school and, as a matter of fact, studied computer engineering at UCLA. While at UCLA, he helped develop Scour, a company that had a search engine but was mainly known for its peer to peer file sharing service. He dropped out in order to take part in this project. That was a tough time for him because while working at Scour he lived with the disoccupation subsidies. But they received a $250 billion copyright infringement lawsuit so they declared bankruptcy. He later started another venture called Red Swoosh which was another peer to peer file sharing company. Since he was seriously broke, he moved to India while developing Red Swoosh in order to cut his expenses. Red Swoosh finally was acquire by Akamai Technologies in 2007 for $19 million dollars. This made Travis a millionaire. In 2009 after a bad experience with a taxi cab Kalanick and his friend Garrett Carp, that I\u2019ll later cover, got the idea to create a cheaper way to find rides. Camp worked at the first prototype while Kalanick was a project supervisor. It was orginally called UberCab but later they changed the name into Uber. In 2010 Kalanick took the role of CEO at Uber. Kalanick started the service in San Francisco but later expanded in all of the United States and later to rest of the world. It was started for high end customers. It started with black cars only but when Lyft started its peer to peer ride app, Kalanick wanted a slice of the pie and raised hundreds of millions of dollars through venture and private equity funds like Google Ventures, now GV and Texas Pacific Group, also known as TPG. They used the money to create Uber X and take a chunk of the marketplace from Lyft. Uber tried to expand in different mobility sectors, started experimenting bike sharing, autonomous driving vehicles, boat rides and even helicopter rides. In 2014 they started Uber Eats, a food delivery service that is having a strong growth all around the globe. Uber started facing criticism because it became a very strong competitor to usual taxi cabs. It had privacy issues as well because the app continued to track people location even after the app was closed. It also faced criticism for not paying drivers enough. It was also accused by Google of stealing the self-driving technology. The company has also been charged for misleading drivers on possible earnings. Uber and Kalanick himself faced lots of criticism after an employee who left Uber accused the company of systemic sexual misconduct. Kalanick later, due to this, said he would step down as CEO at UBER and Dara Khosrowshahi was named as his successor. But Kalanick stayed on the board until the end of 2019, when he sold 90% of the shares he owned in the company. The company was listed on the NYSE in May, 2019. It struggled but it\u2019s still thriving thanks also thanks to the backing of SoftBank, the fund created by Masayoshi Son, which I\u2019ll soon cover so make sure to subscribe. But Kalanick already saw a big trend cominc, delivery food so he invested through his company City Storage Systems into UK company FoodStars, a dark kitchen company. A company that owns kitchens without restaurants. It only works with delivery. In the meantime Kalanick started a new company, CloudKitchens, also thanks to a $400 million investment received for Saudi Arabia Sovreign Fund and $300 million of his own money, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. He spends most of his time between Los Angeles and New York. He bought $36 million apartment in SoHo New York. He also started his own venture fund called 10-100 that is focused on investing in e-commerce companies in the US, China and India. He has not showed much interest in philanthropy yet but he has donated through the companies he managed.",

        "selftext": "#1) Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ)\n\nThe Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.\n\nThe top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds. Many of these companies are valued at high multiples due to their growth potential. This is not financial advice; invest at your own risk.",

        "selftext": "**Stocks have a mixed day as Biden has his first full day in office. Traditional energy stocks lose some ground as we continue to see a transition to Green Energy. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news!**\n\n**\\~Long post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw a mixed day, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/RbB5Xhz) leading the way, finishing .55% up and closing at a new all-time high just like the [SP500](https://ibb.co/X5v19R6) which barely finished the day in the green, while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Gtq5WF7) industrial lost 12 points. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Mpbp84k) continuing to lose ground, but at a lower rate, as it is testing the 21 levels yet again.\n\nAlmost 60% of the companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/6rnhSpQ) on below average volume, as the companies trading above the moving averages is still very high. Yesterday we also saw only 3 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/2ZbYCWp) finish in the green with Tech leading the way up over 1%, while the biggest laggard by far was the Energy sector, losing over 3% for the day, as Large-cap growth companies were the only ones to gain [yesterday](https://ibb.co/yQNzN5b), while value plays lagged behind.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y626Sdj) from yesterday. We can see Apple had a terrific day ahead of earnings, with most of the semis also joining in the rally, while the value heavy sectors like banks, materials and utilities joined Energy in underperforming for the day.\n\nYesterday we also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/QFsMCkj) which revealed a further decrease in bullish investors, which is music to my ears, as bearish investors saw another increase of 3%. I really hope we can get the bullish sentiment down under 38% so we can find better opportunities in the markets.\n\nWe also received other economic data yesterday, as the jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/tPmQGkd) came in 26k below last week and in-line with expectations, while continuing claims were also down over 100k to 5.05M, as we also saw the Philly [FED](https://ibb.co/YpQSMj4) coming in way better than expected while the December Housing [Starts](https://ibb.co/H7cPXfx) also came in ahead of expectations with a 5.8% increase m/m, as it doesn\u2019t seem the housing market will cool itself soon, it just wants to go higher &amp; higher right now.\n\nAnd one last number that we saw yesterday was from [Store](https://ibb.co/TTGMFCv) Capital which announced rent collections for January standing at 91%, a 1% increase since December. This is better than I expected, as I thought they would start to have more problems, with more restriction &amp; lockdowns happening in the cold season rather than improving the situation.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/BTQDPvt) we start the day off with the PMI reading and finish mostly with energy related economic data.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw most of the solar [stocks](https://ibb.co/WWKvsmz) and the other green energy stocks pop yesterday after Biden signed the executive order to rejoin the climate accord and also signed a number of other orders focused on moving to a greener energy. I think this will remain a very investable theme in the next couple of years, especially if the Dems keep the control of the Congress in the next elections.\n\nThis sector also contains [Tesla](https://ibb.co/0sQv2th) which according to the most recent data saw a 63% increase y/y in vehicle registration in California, which is another good sign for the company, as they are working towards building into this high valuation, while others like [Lucid](https://ibb.co/8s42vV5) Motors are still working into getting their first production car to the market.\n\nI think this highly flying stocks and IPOs should be taken with a lot of attention, yes, they are very interesting, but not all of them will make it to the other side (meaning the profit side), just like not all dot com companies made it. Invest wisely and diversify your portfolio to avoid significant risk.\n\nYesterday we also saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/vvXfTqz) beat expectations, with a beat of 40 cents on earnings and a beat of $2.5B on revenues, but did not impress with anything else, as the guidance still disappointed investors. This was the last quarter for the outgoing CEO which will be replaced in the next weeks, in a try to reimagine Intel\u2019s path forward. The company also increased their [dividend](https://ibb.co/0DfsfnX) by 5%, probably in an attempt to keep investors motivated to hold the stock. I think Intel might eventually catch-up to their competitors somewhat, but it will take a lot of spending and time. I think you are better off investing in others like Broadcom, AMD, Micron which seem to have a plan figured out already.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a turnaround in the markets or hopefully we only see a small healthy correction as the Asia-Pacific [markets](https://ibb.co/3NQmSck) fell overnight, with the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mNq0Cy7) also posting to a red open.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

We can see Apple had a terrific day ahead of earnings, with most of the semis also joining in the rally, while the value heavy sectors like banks, materials and utilities joined Energy in underperforming for the day.\n\nYesterday we also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/QFsMCkj) which revealed a further drop in bullish investors, which is music to my ears, as bearish investors saw another increase of 3%. I really hope we can get the bullish sentiment down under 38% so we can find better opportunities in the markets.\n\nWe also received other economic data yesterday, as the jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/tPmQGkd) came in 26k below last week and in-line with expectations, while continuing claims were also down over 100k to 5.05M, as we also saw the Philly [FED](https://ibb.co/YpQSMj4) coming in way better than expected while the December Housing [Starts](https://ibb.co/H7cPXfx) also came in ahead of expectations with a 5.8% increase m/m, as it doesn\u2019t seem the housing market will cool itself soon, it just wants to go higher &amp; higher right now.\n\nAnd one last number that we saw yesterday was from [Store](https://ibb.co/TTGMFCv) Capital which announced rent collections for January standing at 91%, a 1% increase since December. This is better than I expected, as I thought they would start to have more problems, with more restriction &amp; lockdowns happening in the cold season rather than improving the situation.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/BTQDPvt) we start the day off with the PMI reading and finish mostly with energy related economic data.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw most of the solar [stocks](https://ibb.co/WWKvsmz) and the other green energy stocks pop yesterday after Biden signed the executive order to rejoin the climate accord and also signed a number of other orders focused on moving to a greener energy. I think this will remain a very investable theme in the next couple of years, especially if the Dems keep the control of the Congress in the next elections.\n\nThis sector also contains [Tesla](https://ibb.co/0sQv2th) which according to the most recent data saw a 63% increase y/y in vehicle registration in California, which is another good sign for the company, as they are working towards building into this high valuation, while others like [Lucid](https://ibb.co/8s42vV5) Motors are still working into getting their first production car to the market.\n\nI think this highly flying stocks and IPOs should be taken with a lot of attention, yes, they are very interesting, but not all of them will make it to the other side (meaning the profit side), just like not all dot com companies made it. Invest wisely and diversify your portfolio to avoid significant risk.\n\nYesterday we also saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/vvXfTqz) beat expectations, with a beat of 40 cents on earnings and a beat of $2.5B on revenues, but did not impress with anything else, as the guidance still disappointed investors. This was the last quarter for the outgoing CEO which will be replaced in the next weeks, in a try to reimagine Intel\u2019s path forward. The company also increased their [dividend](https://ibb.co/0DfsfnX) by 5%, probably in an attempt to keep investors motivated to hold the stock. I think Intel might eventually catch-up to their competitors somewhat, but it will take a lot of spending and time. I think you are better off investing in others like Broadcom, AMD, Micron which seem to have a plan figured out already.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a turnaround in the markets or hopefully we only see a small healthy correction as the Asia-Pacific [markets](https://ibb.co/3NQmSck) fell overnight, with the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mNq0Cy7) also posting to a red open.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "#1) Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ)\n\nThe Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.\n\nThe top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds. Many of these companies are valued at high multiples due to their growth potential. This is not financial advice; invest at your own risk.",

Still, considering rivals like qcom, mu, avgo, and tsmc, Marvell's in it's infancy with a market cap one-third the size of the smallest of the others I listed. \n\nbroadcom, for example, seems to be focusing on 5G rollout as one of their bigger growth streams, and Marvell is doing the same. Assuming they both see comparable revenue from exposure to that industry, shouldn't that result in a larger % of growth overall for marvell?\n\nOr, is there a reason to think that the already established competitors will be able to keep marvell's growth locked down due to their already substantial market share in most existing markets?",

I really hope we can get the bullish sentiment down under 38% so we can find better opportunities in the markets.\n\nWe also received other economic data yesterday, as the jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/tPmQGkd) came in 26k below last week and in-line with expectations, while continuing claims were also down over 100k to 5.05M, as we also saw the Philly [FED](https://ibb.co/YpQSMj4) coming in way better than expected while the December Housing [Starts](https://ibb.co/H7cPXfx) also came in ahead of expectations with a 5.8% increase m/m, as it doesn\u2019t seem the housing market will cool itself soon, it just wants to go higher &amp; higher right now.\n\nAnd one last number that we saw yesterday was from [Store](https://ibb.co/TTGMFCv) Capital which announced rent collections for January standing at 91%, a 1% increase since December. This is better than I expected, as I thought they would start to have more problems, with more restriction &amp; lockdowns happening in the cold season rather than improving the situation.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/BTQDPvt) we start the day off with the PMI reading and finish mostly with energy related economic data.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw most of the solar [stocks](https://ibb.co/WWKvsmz) and the other green energy stocks pop yesterday after Biden signed the executive order to rejoin the climate accord and also signed a number of other orders focused on moving to a greener energy. I think this will remain a very investable theme in the next couple of years, especially if the Dems keep the control of the Congress in the next elections.\n\nThis sector also contains [Tesla](https://ibb.co/0sQv2th) which according to the most recent data saw a 63% increase y/y in vehicle registration in California, which is another good sign for the company, as they are working towards building into this high valuation, while others like [Lucid](https://ibb.co/8s42vV5) Motors are still working into getting their first production car to the market and \u201creportedly\u201d entering a SPAC deal with CCIV.\n\nI think this SPACS and IPOs should be taken with a lot of attention, yes, they are very interesting, but not all of them will make it to the other side (meaning the profit side), just like not all dot com companies made it. Invest wisely and diversify your portfolio to avoid significant risk.\n\nYesterday we also saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/vvXfTqz) beat expectations, with a beat of 40 cents on earnings and a beat of $2.5B on revenues, but did not impress with anything else, as the guidance still disappointed investors. This was the last quarter for the outgoing CEO which will be replaced in the next weeks, in a try to reimagine Intel\u2019s path forward. The company also increased their [dividend](https://ibb.co/0DfsfnX) by 5%, probably in an attempt to keep investors motivated to hold the stock. I think Intel might eventually catch-up to their competitors somewhat, but it will take a lot of spending and time. I think you are better off investing in others like Broadcom, AMD, Micron which seem to have a plan figured out already.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a turnaround in the markets or hopefully we only see a small healthy correction as the Asia-Pacific [markets](https://ibb.co/3NQmSck) fell overnight, with the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mNq0Cy7) also posting to a red open.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!
