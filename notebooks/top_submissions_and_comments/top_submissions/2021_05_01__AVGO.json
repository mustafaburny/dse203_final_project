Also the good old payment for order flow PFOF system RH loves.\n\nMaking money and also using it to wash the empty fake trust bonds (sometimes partially empty), that\u2019s where the money is for him!!\n\nThey're not just shorting GME, they short tons of other companies as well. Those shorts need to seem legitimate and have real money backing them up (trust bond money) so no margin call happens if the SEC comes looking. Real money backing it so it\u2019s \u201cALL LEGAL AND LEGITIMATE\u201d\n\nYou know the drill! **Boom Money Washed!**\n\n**METHOD #2: Betting in the company knowing the result (manipulate the performance and outcome).**\n\nBet on the companies performance (not only short betting, but also making calls and manipulating it up and down)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to bet if you can manipulate the outcome right?\n\nNice casino Kenny! **Boom Money Washed!**\n\n**METHOD #3: Move the money overseas by funding overseas companies**\n\nFund companies overseas (together with other bank friends) and receive assets or Treasury bonds strips (T-bonds) as collateral (countries overseas have T-bonds to use as collateral for money) with interest rates of about 12%+!! **Boom Money Washed!**\n\nHe\u2019s making money on both sides of the trade, when giving the money he is making huge $$ in conversion exchange rates and fees, as well as when receiving the Collateral $$ for fees and exchange rates when it applies. **Boom!** ***this money is legitimate now!***\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001752724-21-087103/](https://sec.report/Document/0001752724-21-087103/)\n\n**METHOD 4: Scoop all the real state from bankrupted companies**\n\n[Scoop up all the real estate and assets](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amydobson/2019/09/19/billionaire-ken-griffin-adds-99-million-purchase-to-massive-real-estate-portfolio/amp/) that are left behind when the companies are bankrupt, buying the retail dirt cheap. **That\u2019s why Kenny targets brick and mortar, imagine GME stores closing and Kenny buying those properties for pennies.**\n\n**With real state the scam is even bigger! I\u2019ll explain more after!**\n\n**Boom Money Washed!**\n\n**METHOD 5: Buy real estate and assets (art, gold and other tangibles)**\n\nWith the real money made by selling his trust bonds, buy expensive houses\n\n[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/ken-griffin-most-expensive-home-ever-sold-us-nyc-penthouse-2019-1%3famp](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/ken-griffin-most-expensive-home-ever-sold-us-nyc-penthouse-2019-1%3famp)\n\nExpensive art\n\n[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2016/02/18/ken-griffin-spent-500-million-on-two-paintings-sources.html](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2016/02/18/ken-griffin-spent-500-million-on-two-paintings-sources.html)\n\nAnd any other valuable asset you could imagine to try to wash his money and make it legitimate!\n\n**With real estate the scam is huge, check this link up!**\n\n[https://news.utexas.edu/2020/12/03/lending-fraud-could-wreck-economy-again/](https://news.utexas.edu/2020/12/03/lending-fraud-could-wreck-economy-again/)\n\nMeans he can get **loans and allocate his TRUST BONDS (derivates) as collateral instead of buying the real estate with money!** So the banks are getting SHIT TRUST BONDS in exchange of houses and real state!!\n\nOmfg!!!! ANOTHER HOUSING MARKET BUBBLE!!!! **Boom Money Washed!**\n\nI\u2019ll explain a bit more about those TRUST BONDS SOON!

They are shorting the treasury too! So counter leverage... **YIKES!**\n\n**Boom Money Washed!**\n\n**METHOD 8: Short the Treasury!!**\n\n[Using part of that money to short the government bonds](https://www.localsuccess.org/shorting-the-us-treasury-bond-2021/) (especially 10 Year Treasury bonds) knowing about a highly probably hyperinflation caused by the federal reserve printing too much money, the stimulus and other factors.\n\nThey counter the leverage by having T-bonds and T-notes of the ones they bought and also the collateral when lending money to other countries.\n\nRefer to \"The Everything Short\u201d by u/atobitt.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the\\_everything\\_short/?utm\\_source=share\\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm\\_medium=ios\\_app\\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nAdditionally, he's shorting treasury T-bonds and T-notes because he expects a lack of solvency on the part of the Federal Reserve.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-pricing-idUSKBN2342VN](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-pricing-idUSKBN2342VN)\n\n**Boom Money Washed!**\n\nRead this bit about bonds (taken from the linkl bellow):\n\n**However, government-backed bonds**, particularly those in emerging markets, can carry risks that include country risk, political risk, and central-bank risk, including whether the banking system is solvent. Investors saw a bleak reminder of how risky some government bonds can be during the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998. During this crisis, several Asian nations were forced to devalue their currency which sent reverberations around the globe. The crisis even caused Russia to default on its debt.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp)\n\nAbout all this... Michael Burry has been warning us about a possible hyperinflation, all this will be **explained LATER ON!!**\n\nI'm going to break down each one of Kenny strategies as we go in the post.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TRUST BONDS: The basket of bonds INFITINE MONEY GLITCH!!!**\n\nFirst of all let me stress how important this is!\n\n**THIS IS KENNY MAIN SOURCE OF CASH (LIQUIDITY)**, with this he's able to do all kinds of fuckery from shorting, to all the washing methods above (Ill explain more with sources as we move forward).\n\nThey love shorting because they love producing naked shares to fill up the juicy [**TRUST BONDS**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateraltrustbond.asp#:~:text=A%20collateral%20trust%20bond%20is,pay%20the%20bondholder%2C%20if%20necessary) and get more and more cash for liquidity and fukery!!\n\nSo what's inside those **TRUST BONDS?**\n\n\"A collateral trust bond is a bond that is secured by a financial asset such as stock or other bonds\"\n\nWAIT WHAT???\n\nSo you telling me that Kenny is not only able to put his NAKED SHARES inside this basket called **TRUST BONDS** and pack it to sell, but that he can **PUT TRUST BONDS INSIDE OTHER TRUST BONDS?**\n\nThis is the pyramid and biggest **PONZI SCHEME!!!!**\n\nHear me out:\n\nThey have been **shorting many businesses** and also **buying some long positions in many other** businesses (I read somewhere and I cant find the source that Citadel controls 26% (according to the senate in the hearing) of the market).

Well...\n\n**As a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT Group and GMAC (now Ally Financial) converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to the Federal Reserve's credit facilities.

Also the good old payment for order flow PFOF system RH loves.\n\nMaking money and also using it to wash the empty fake trust bonds (sometimes partially empty), that\u2019s where the money is for him!!\n\nThey're not just shorting GME, they short tons of other companies as well. Those shorts need to seem legitimate and have real money backing them up (trust bond money) so no margin call happens if the SEC comes looking. Real money backing it so it\u2019s \u201cALL LEGAL AND LEGITIMATE\u201d\n\nYou know the drill! **Boom Money Washed!**\n\n**METHOD #2: Betting in the company knowing the result (manipulate the performance and outcome).**\n\nBet on the companies performance (not only short betting, but also making calls and manipulating it up and down)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to bet if you can manipulate the outcome right?\n\nNice casino Kenny! **Boom Money Washed!**\n\n**METHOD #3: Move the money overseas by funding overseas companies**\n\nFund companies overseas (together with other bank friends) and receive assets or Treasury bonds strips (T-bonds) as collateral (countries overseas have T-bonds to use as collateral for money) with interest rates of about 12%+!! **Boom Money Washed!**\n\nHe\u2019s making money on both sides of the trade, when giving the money he is making huge $$ in conversion exchange rates and fees, as well as when receiving the Collateral $$ for fees and exchange rates when it applies. **Boom!** ***this money is legitimate now!***\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001752724-21-087103/](https://sec.report/Document/0001752724-21-087103/)\n\n**METHOD 4: Scoop all the real state from bankrupted companies**\n\n[Scoop up all the real estate and assets](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amydobson/2019/09/19/billionaire-ken-griffin-adds-99-million-purchase-to-massive-real-estate-portfolio/amp/) that are left behind when the companies are bankrupt, buying the retail dirt cheap. **That\u2019s why Kenny targets brick and mortar, imagine GME stores closing and Kenny buying those properties for pennies.**\n\n**With real state the scam is even bigger!

WHAT IS THAT?**\n\nFirst we need to learn [what is a holding company?](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/using-a-holding-company-operating-company-structure-to-help-mitigate-risk) [Restaurant Brands International (RBI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_Brands_International) is an example of a holding company for a group of popular Quick Service (Fast Food) restaurants. They own Burger King, Tim Horton's and Popeyes. In this case RBI holding is basically a basket of a few fast food restaurants put together, like a stock ETF. It is the basket of those businesses and the value is according to those companies performance.\n\nSo are banks holding companies? Well...\n\n**As a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT Group and GMAC (now Ally Financial) converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to the Federal Reserve's credit facilities. (**[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holding_company))\n\nThese holdings are filled up by pieces of many private institutions they lent money to: businesses, hedge funds, as well as people they lent money to (mortgages, auto loans, student loans, etc., plus money they lent to the government. Obviously as well as the money the people deposit and keep in their bank account (it will be their liquidity if they don't use your money, most of the time they move your money.)\n\n**Keep in mind: The federal reserve is privately owned (not part of the government and instead is sanctioned and backed by it) by the 12 reserve banks and the 0.01% (THE BIG BIG WHALES) (they are the top contributors to the reserve).** [Federal Reserve Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System) WHAAAAAT?\n\nBut lets keep going with the banks...\n\nThink about every company borrowing money from a bank and putting their assets as collateral (putting that stock collateral inside the bank's basket/pool, mainly ETFs).\n\nNow the bank owns part of the company in form of debt collateral. The bigger the company debt the bigger part of the pie the bank owns as collateral, right? Big leverage!\n\nAlso, some ETFs are pretty much a basket/pool full of many many company shares that are supposed to be the collateral for the debts. Some others are filled with as packages of people\u2019s debt (student loans, mortgages, etc). Others full of government debt to the banks.\n\nPut all those shares and pieces of the company (could be turned into liquidity if sold in case of company liquidation or too much risk) and their liquidity backing of cash (people\u2019s bank accounts deposited) together and that\u2019s what the bank is made of. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong on the comments please. The banks own leverage on those companies they lend money too.\n\nTake a break!! I know this is very intense, but with every word I can see your hands getting harder and harder after knowing WTF is going on!\n\n**Ohhh Kenny, how the fuck did a melon discover your fuckery?**\n\n**PLEASE DONT FORGET TO UPVOTE EVERY POST AND COMMENT!! THIS NEEDS TRACTION SO EVERY APE SEES IT!**\n\n**SHARE IT WITH OTHER APES IN OTHER POSTS AND COMMENTS!! ITS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BE LOUD!**\n\nI RUN OUT OF CHARACTERS!!!

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI have been a long time and poster on this subreddit through some other account names, but wanted to make a more official account in order to share my ideas. \n\nI wanted to share with you guys a very basic SPAC trading strategy that I have been working on over the past few months. After developing it a bit further, I will be coming out with another blog post to cover the improvements that I have made to my trading model. \n\n[https://gainsandgrowth.wordpress.com/2021/04/18/spacs-a-trading-strategy/](https://gainsandgrowth.wordpress.com/2021/04/18/spacs-a-trading-strategy/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasics of the strategy:\n\n **1. SPACS offer a unique investment opportunity due to the \u201cprice floor\u201d** \n\n **2. SPACs tend to stay at or around the floor price until news surrounding the potential acquisition of a target is disseminated to the public** \n\n **3. SPACs will inevitably correct to the terms of the merger once they are announced** \n\nSo there are three keys points in this trading strategy\n\n1. **Identifying when investors \u201cnotice\u201d this stock.** If you can get in when investors notice the stock, you can ride the wave with them while avoiding the period of stagnation prior to major price movements.\n2. **Taking your gains and running.** I cannot stress this component of the strategy enough. We are not investing for the long term on this strategy, we don\u2019t even know anything about the company yet! We take our gains when we have them, and we revaluate if there is another point that is suitable for entry later down the road.\n3. **Reducing loses on \u201cFalse Positives\u201d.** If we enter into a position, we want to have clear end points for when we leave that position. Sometimes there will be false positives where we enter in the position, and no price action occurs, or the price of the SPAC falls. We want to get out quickly in these scenarios, since we are focusing on being ready to enter when the stock shoots up.\n\n**VOLUME**\n\nAs mentioned previously, the indicator is abnormal volume. This frees up the investor from monitoring news media and announcements, and focusing solely on the resulting interest in the company. What I have identified as a strong indicator of immediate upward price movements is three days of sustained volume above 200% of the monthly average volume.\n\nThis eliminates random trading days where the trading volume is high for unknown reasons. Maybe a fund is entering the SPAC and has bought a significant number of shares, who knows! We don\u2019t like just one day increases in volume because that can be anomaly. Three days of sustained large volume has appeared by the right indicator, but can of course be refined further. This is what I call the \u201cBuy Counter\u201d.\n\n**TAKING GAINS**\n\nThe second key part of this strategy is taking your gains. I have set an upward limit on price movement for 10%. After 10%, my algorithm will take its gains and exit the position, and will continue to monitor the SPAC and look for indicators to re-enter. The idea behind this being that a 10% return is an amazing return for any investor, especially over a short time frame. If we can string together many of these 10% returns, then I would be more than happy with the performance of my portfolio. This number is obviously arbitrary, and would benefit from more statistical analysis, but for the purposes of my initial tests I deemed it a fine starting point.\n\n**LIMITING FALSE POSITIVES**\n\nThe third key part of this strategy is reducing the times that you enter into a stock when the stock does not behave as expected. I also realized that towards middle/end of a SPACs lifecycle, volume indicators may also be true for major price corrections (refer to the CCIV graph and look at the volume towards the end of February). Therefore I also included a condition that the price increases over that 3 day period to avoid buying in on a fire sale.\n\n**Results:**\n\nI tested this strategy against 73 different SPACs, with $1000 to trade on these names from August 1st 2020 to April 18th 2021, and achieved a 20.5% return across the entire universe in my self built testing environment.\n\nParticularly impressive results were:\n\n1. TPGY: 203%\n2. ACTC 103%\n3. CCIV: 93%\n4. NGA 53%\n5. GHVI: 50%",

        "selftext": "For most people CumRocket seems like a funny memecoin, however for those who see it\u2019s potential it could revolutionise the porn industry. Here are some complied reasons as to why CumRocket is a solid investment right now. Obligatory this is not financial advice.  \n\nThe token unlike most meme coins actually has an real world use and an expanding economy. Right now it\u2019s used to buy nudes (that the models themselves are selling) and tip cam girls on NFT sites. But they are going to actually expand and either take on or combine with the porn industry.  \n\nHere are a few examples of how that might work:  \n\nScenario 1: They combine with the Porn industry and become the standard blockchain of choice for premium porn sites and other NSFW sites like OnlyFans. By having an alternative anonymous way to purchase subscriptions and porn, this allows many more people to engage monetarily with the porn industry. Right now millions of horney men and women are unable to access the content they want due to shared bank accounts and snooping partners. CumRocket offers the solution through anonymous payments.  \n\nScenario 2: they take on the porn industry by creating their own sites. They have already blackboarded this and are willing to offer 5% more than any other platform to creators while also offering complete anonymity for both the creator and buyer. Models would be paid and tipped in $CUMMIES.  \n\nThere is also a NFT marketplace where creators can sell their content. Buyers would have said content stored in their wallet, removing the need to store the content manually on a pc or hard drive. In other words the only way someone could access their porn is if they had their wallet keys.  \n\nFor many people around the world who are either embarrassed for creating porn or persecuted for it, CumRocket is the answer. In Australia where it\u2019s legal to be a sex worker they still struggle with mortgages due to the nature of the job. CumRockets allows them to show profits as an investment instead of sex.  \n\nNo matter which way $CUMMIES goes it cannot lose, they have already a growing list of content creators signing up and it\u2019s only a matter of time until one of the scenarios comes into fruition.  \n\nAudits have been done and passed, exchanges are interested, the token is deflationary with a small starting supply. It might have started as a meme but it won\u2019t end in one.",

        "selftext": "I'm a long term CLOV investor and do not believe the recent price action reflects a squeeze of any kind. More likely that wall street investors woke up to CLOV potential because of [this](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement) CMS update that announces CLOV participation in 10 US states in PY 2021. (This is my first reddit post so here goes)\n\nBelow is why I (a regular, retail investor) have held on to CLOV shares and warrants in my portfolio and why I believe getting in on this stock under $15 is a no brainer (disclaimer: I\u2019m not a financial advisor and this is NOT investment advice, do your own DD before investing):\n\n1. **Business Model:** Clover Health is a Medicare Advantage insurance company. [Sources of revenue for MA insurers](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-is-medicare-advantage-funded) include premiums and payments via CMS, most of which goes to hospitals and doctors. In MA, specially under plans offered by CLOV, premiums are negligible so for our purpose payments made by CMS (government) are the lifeblood of MA plans such as Clover. You may be wondering so what? Well, let\u2019s put things in perspective. The US federal govt spent $1.2 Trillion on healthcare in 2019, $644 Billion of this went to Medicare of which $270B was spent on MA. All or most of this growing annual budget goes to fund MA plans such as Clover for services they provide members. The problem is, there are too many visits and hospitalizations (than are needed). What if there was an innovative startup that used innovation (pay doctors fixed fees per visit) and technology (Clover Assistant software with telehealth features) such that federal government paid out LESS per member to such a company vs. competition ([target outcome of Direct Contracting](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/direct-contracting)) for HIGHER quality of care. Great ability to capture market share from legacy insurers and help lower government spending (more on this later) \u2013 a WIN-WIN situation for insurer and the govt. This is why Clover\u2019s business model is so fool proof!  \n***TLDR:*** ***Clover operates in a space that is majority funded by government, and its unique business model helps it gain market share***\n2. **Competition:** Now let\u2019s talk competition. Competitors such as Humana, United Health, CVS/Aetna have for years delivered medical insurance but hardly innovated in a way that was positive for federal spending. They continued charging seniors on plan premiums, while trying to receive as much funding as possible from the fed to grow their profits. Why make the process more efficient when all we do to get paid is to broker insurance plans in a highly regulated industry. Clover with its innovation is miles ahead of the competition by getting a nice head start (started in 2014, while other [insurers are just getting started with the innovation)](https://medcitynews.com/2021/02/mercy-humana-partner-to-expand-access-to-virtual-value-based-care/) and the Clover Assistant software will constantly help it become more efficient i.e. achieve better results for its members, at a lower cost to CMS!! CLOV is also MORE HOLISTIC than TDOC in services, while targeting a LOWER TAM i.e. only Seniors right now. Only a matter of time that they expand beyond MA and offer plans for the general population.  \n***TLDR: Clover is disrupting competition through its use of technology.***\n3. **Software:** Now the bit about software. This IS Clover\u2019s secret ingredient. The development is led by an ex-Googler (Andrew Toy, President at Clover Health) to radically transform software used to treat seniors through massive digitization, and interactive UI. This in turn helps doctors improve outcomes for patients. And they are giving it away for free!!! Why would a physician not use software that helped him/her improve the standard of care for their patients while being easy to use and access and FREE. Imagine, Marc Benioff giving away Salesforce for free to sales reps all over. When this software becomes the standard of care because of the years of head start they have in this space, Clover Health could eventually license this to the other insurers and health care providers i.e. additional sources of revenue.  \n***TLDR: The Clover Assistant software is the secret ingredient that helps the company deliver efficient care and achieve better outcomes.***\n4. **Growth:** Ok so we briefly spoke about licensing as an additional mode of revenue, now let\u2019s focus on others. 2) Current projections indicate 14% annual organic growth of MA population, this growth is likely to go bonkers when Biden reduces the Medicare eligible age to 60, as [promised](https://joebiden.com/fact-sheet-how-joe-biden-would-help-you-get-health-insurance-coverage-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/) in his campaign. Evergreen and ever-growing TAM 3) Direct Contracting introduced by CMS is basically a risk sharing model that incentivizes insurers to make treatment of seniors more efficient and cost effective. Insurers that can achieve a lower cost of treatment and fewer hospital visits for the same condition, they are likely to be held in favor by CMS when allotting MA counties every year. Now, if you remember the bit about software, Clover is in the best position to do this\u2026as long as doctors continue to use the Clover Assistant software to treat seniors. This may sound like a risky bet, but it really isn\u2019t\u2026.60%+ of Clover members see a PCP that uses the Clover Assistant software. Clover\u2019s [long-term goal](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213) is to get to a 70%+ rate. 4) End 2020, Clover offered MA plans in 34 counties but this will grow based on participation in more states as per the [CMS Direct Contracting plan for 2021](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement).  \n***TLDR: Growth in MA membership, direct contracting, geographic expansion, potential to license its software are all lucrative growth avenues.***\n5. **Customers:** Let\u2019s now put some light on the target demographic\u2026seniors. Clover is promising them the lowest cost plans ($0 premiums, low/no co-pays) which are highly flexible (telehealth on Clover Assistant) to their needs. Why not? In addition, Clover is developing partnerships with Walmart and other retailers to market their plans which is likely to result in an ever-growing customer and incentivized partner base.\n6. **Media:** The media has lambasted this company quite vocally including on CNBC despite little of substance\u2026except that there was a short-seller report and questions asked about the CEO. To his credit, Cramer recently invited Clover Health to Mad Money\u2026now, when this interview happens it is likely to introduce the company to a pretty massive list of retail investors (the buy and hold kind) and when they realize how undervalued Clover is, they will likely pick up a good portion of the float, causing fewer and fewer shares to be available.\n7. **Management:** If one reads through the exec incentive structure in [SPAC prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312520316032/d69158d424b3.htm#toc69158_24), they would soon realize that the CEO has most of his interest in the company tied to the stock \u2013 he does not receive a salary. More importantly, both CEO and President performance-based incentive plans do not kick in until CLOV reaches and maintains a volume weighted average price of $30 for a 90-day period. Consider also, **Lee Shapiro who sits on the board of Clover Health is the former CFO of Livongo (now part of TDOC, ARK fav) while Chelsea Clinton adds serious weight and is actively involved as a board member.**\n8. **Valuation:** SPAC merger docs value the company at $3.7B. Currently, because of the short seller report and the massive short-interest in the company, it is valued at \\~$3B, which is \\~4x 2021E sales. With projected revenues for 2021 of $835M (mid-point), and applying a 8x sales multiple, Clover\u2019s valuation needs to be at least $6.7B+ market cap implying a $16+ PT. With expected 24%+ growth in 2021, and premium multiple for high growth companies (note that the float is only 25% of shares outstanding), I believe a $20-25 target is more in line with current valuations. When medicare eligible age limit is lowered to 60 by Biden later this year or perhaps early next, this PT will need to be re-evaluated\u2026upward. Also consider the fact that this company is NOT zero revenue now, promising billions in 2025 and beyond\u2026.it had sales of $670M in sales in 2020 and growing!! Consider also that the industry-leader in the telehealth space \u2013 TDOC \u2013 and a Cathie Wood &amp; ARK fav currently trades at 16x sales. Similar multiple for CLOV implies a $33 PT.  \n***TLDR: Whichever way you cut it, CLOV is very undervalued right now. Near term $25-30 PT and longer term has LMND-like potential in healthcare insurance***\n\nI am long CLOV because I believe that it is trying to solve a very hard and complex problem in healthcare. It deserves a lot more credit and people rooting for it to succeed.",

        "selftext": "Buffett warned newbie investors that picking great companies is more complicated than just selecting a promising industry.\n\n\"There's a lot more to picking stocks than figuring out what's going to be a wonderful industry in the future,\" said Buffett.\n\nBuffett put up a slide of all the auto companies from years go that started with the letter \"M;\" however, the list was so long it didn't fit on one slide. The \"Oracle of Omaha\" had to narrow the list to automobile manufactures that started with \"Ma\" to fit the names on one page.\n\nBuffett said there were about 2,000 companies that entered the auto business in the 1900's because investors and entrepreneurs expected the industry to have an amazing future. In 2009, there were three automakers left and two went bankrupt, said Buffett.\n\nWhether it\u2019s technology, EVs, renewables, marijuana or cyber security, many will enter these budding industries, and most will not make it. It isn\u2019t good enough to pick the sector or industry that\u2019ll grow most, you either need to time your exits perfectly, or hope you have the few that survive to cover your losses on the many that don\u2019t.",

It will require limit order of the previous close , don\u2019t worry as your order would be fill at the Theoretical Option price at the open. \n\n1. Ma - 210507- Call- 382 strike price - The PUT prices are so high it caused the Mm to buy a shit ton of shares to drive the prices of the put down on Friday . The puts @ the current moment are still high, will led to the Option Mm to buy the stock up to cause the puts prices to drop while making the calls option in increase. The call option  is way below the deviation of the price. \n\n2.  Swks - 210507 - Call- 182.5 strike price. Price is currently Out of the deviation chart  and similar to MA, the puts are far too high. This one would force the put sellers and option Mm to buy up the stock to increases the price action.",
