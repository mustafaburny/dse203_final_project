        "selftext": "I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -&gt; Aug. \n\nI beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180-&gt;300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)\n\nI did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. \n\nI did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. \n\n#High level advice:\n=========================================\n\nhttps://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/37-top-10-pieces-of-investment-advice-from-warren-buffett\n\nI picked the 7 I agree with.\n\n1. Invest in what you know\u2026and nothing more.\n2. Never compromise on business quality\n3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever\n4. Diversification can be dangerous\n5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)\n8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)\n10. Only listen to those you know and trust \n\nI firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  \n\n#General mindset:\n================\n- Keep emotions out of the market\n- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.\n- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. \n- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. \n- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)\n- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. \n\n#Application:\n==================================================================\nI was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. \n\nAs a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. \n\nBased on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good \"feel\" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). \n\nI tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. \n\nPost COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.\n\nMy hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. \n\n1. eCommerce + AdTech \n2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)\n3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)\n\nThese are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:\n\n1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?\n2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?\n3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? \n4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?\n5. Who are their customers and target demographic?\n6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.\n\nIn March, I took what I believe to be an \"educated gamble\". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.\n\nI have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.\n\nHere are the non FAANGs I chose.\n\n1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&amp;M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. \n\n2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.\n\n3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. \n\n4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.\n\n5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. \n\n6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.\n\n7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. \"Zoom parties\" and \"Zoom dates\" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.\n\n8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. \n\n10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.\n\n11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. \n\n12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. \n\n13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say \"Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?\" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.\n\n14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.\n\nMutual funds/ETFs\n1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. \n\n2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. \n\n3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... \n\nTitanvest:\nI was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.\n\n#Some things I do that that are against the grain:\n\n- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.\n\n- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.\n\n- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. \n\nOne example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. \n\nLastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. \n\nAlso, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",

        "selftext": "You\u2019ve probably seen a rising trend of bullish posts about Nvidia recently, whether it\u2019s about recent acquisitions being included in revenue, its management, or the semiconductor industry in general.\n\nYesterday, Evening Standard reported that $NVDA has locked in a takeover of Arm Ltd. from SoftBank for a reported 40 billion.\n\nThe reason this is important is that Arm owns instructions-set architectures (ISAs) for the chips within nearly every smartphone, along with a handful of other products. Usually, this isn\u2019t an issue, since SoftBank would sell the rights to produce these chips to Apple, Qualcomm, and others for a fee. \n\n$NVDA, unlike SoftBank, is an actual semiconductor company. They could potentially limit access to their ISAs so that $NVDA can become the sole producer of those chips. Or, due to SoftBank being in the sinosphere and $NVDA being American, potential tensions could arise from the recent economic sanctions.\n\nEither way, considering that the deal is essentially locked in, $NVDA is flying straight to tendie town. Arm is a powerful player in the semiconductor industry, and its acquisition by $NVDA demonstrates that the company is making big moves to become more prevalent. $NVDA could theoretically lockdown a subsector of the semiconductor market by restricting access to chips under Arm\u2019s ISA. And if the Don requests $NVDA restrict Chinese access to the ISAs, you can bet that it will get a fucking BOATLOAD of government subsidies.\n\nTL;DR $NVDA 520c 9/18",

        "selftext": "Ok, so you know how Apple has been mooning on news of the iPhone 12, and ARM MacBooks, which has totally screwed over INTC and made TSM and other suppliers to AAPL moon?\n\n(Here's the background info in case you missed the news [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS52JigV1CY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS52JigV1CY))\n\nApple was actually approached by Softbank to buy ARM but they couldn't due to ARM licensing stuff out to competitors as well, and Apple obviously has a very private philosophy too so that wouldn't work. But, they will continue to use chipsets based on ARM's architecture for the future macbooks/iphones as well ([https://wccftech.com/apple-shows-disinterest-in-buying-arm-from-softbank/](https://wccftech.com/apple-shows-disinterest-in-buying-arm-from-softbank/)). But if you just follow the money, and try to find out who actually will OWN ARM, the offer has come from none other than Nvidia, and the deal to buy ARM is all but confirmed. (seeck ingalpha.com/article/4370499-chippening-part-2-nvidia-reaches-for-outstretched-arm). And I'm sure that most of you are aware of how AAPL is trying to expand its reach into countries like India for the first time offering first-party stores and an online store, etc. This will only increase their sales numbers, and Apple will only get more bullet proof from hereon. The real story here, is in NVDA.\n\nWhen they do end up buying ARM, the merger will either be seen as A.) a value destroying buy that wasn't worth it or B.) A merger of epic proportions that inserts Nvidia into the mobile and CPU market \"Apple recently indicated it would change their use of Intel chips in Mac computers to custom made ARM-based chips. This is likely due to the desire to include a touch screen and also due to the general efficiency of the design as well as ARM's licensing of its IP to Apple. This could be the start of a major transition for chip usage among desktop computers. Moreover, this technology appears to be competitive for use in data-centers markets.\n\nNVIDIA is not currently a major competitor in the smartphone and tablet business, so acquiring ARM would expand it into new realms where ARM happens to dominate. NVIDIA did previously attempt to compete in this business, but its Tegra chips never got much market share.\"\n\nMost of you already know how durable Nvidia is, but for those of you that don't I'll leave you with these too: Nvidia's R&amp;D expense/gross profit is surprisingly low due to multiple income streams, and although it is increasing (as expected) we can expect gross profits to massively increase too with the world's largest company as its customer. Their Cash per share has grown insanely :\n\nCash Per Share ratio\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3wz4otn79j51.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=501e51a371f0d4ab402a8500a03e14b6e31f86d3\n\nAnd they have low long term debt that has barely increased, but their assets have remarkably increased, which means a low lt debt/asset ratio, just showing you how much of a powerhouse NVDA is.\n\nLT debt/total assets\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0hg0zqmo79j51.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2862927faff7933cf9600ae20f76455de0a47ee\n\nNot only that, but along with decreasing/flatlining long term debt, they have a negative cash conversion cycle, which greatly reduces opex. Financially, this is only the beginning of their buildup. Aside from just solid financials for such a revolutionary company, they have revolutionary products. Their cloud services and acquisition of Mellanox will only expand their bases. Nvidia has a vision, and it may be very far-out and hard to accomplish or it may be the most genius thing I've ever seen. I'm not sure how long this'll take to work itself out, but I wouldn't fear buying March 2021 740 calls.",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow retards, the once-in-a-life-time chance for you to get rich is here. \n\nBy the end of the week, NVDA is going to be over $500, probably to $520.\n\nWhy? Because \n\n1) they are having quarterly earnings call next Wednesday, and \n\n2) they are having a GeForce event for September 1st with RTX 3080 rumors abound, and \n\n3) NVDA is pretty much a meme stock and almost touched ATH today (ATH was $460.19 and today closes at $457.61).\n\nDo you recall something? Do you remember **NFLX on Friday, July 10**? NFLX was having quarterly earnings in the week after, and it was a meme stock (still is). It mooned by fucking 8% on that Friday (from 508 to 549).\n\nThere will be a massive run-up till the end of this week. Today's 5% is huge? Nah it is just recovering pretty much the loss in the last 3 trading sessions. This is a healthy pullback and recover. \n\nHere is what will happen: on Thursday NVDA will continue to go up by 2% \\~ 4%, and then in the early morning on Friday, NVDA will receive some analyst upgrading and the stock price will keep mooning the whole day. People are getting in for the earnings call and new GeForce event. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$520 by EOW!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: **NVDA 8/14 500c** at open tomorrow (Thursday). It was only $ $0.10 by EOD. Just fucking grab as much as you can and it will be a 100-bagger or even 200-bagger!\n\nOr if you don't have steel balls, just buy NVDA 8/14 470c.

        "selftext": "I firmly expect $OSS to run up into earnings this Thursday and potentially beyond, and I have statistics + leaks from AMD/NVIDIA to back this up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you review their [partnerships](https://www.onestopsystems.com/partners) and [financial statements](https://ir.onestopsystems.com/all-sec-filings/content/0001564590-20-013196/0001564590-20-013196.pdf), you start to wonder if their stock price is some kind of joke. They are very clearly doing much better than 95% of the pennystocks mentioned on this subreddit and have an array of high-level connections in their industry. In short, they're not struggling.\n\nNVIDIA cites them as a \"[top system maker](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/22/2050975/0/en/World-s-Top-System-Makers-Unveil-NVIDIA-A100-Powered-Servers-to-Accelerate-AI-Data-Science-and-Scientific-Computing.html)\" and are officially one of NVIDIA's [Preferred Manufacturers](https://www.onestopsystems.com/nvidia-gpus).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's rare for a company this young to perform at such a high level. By their SECOND YEAR, they generated $60 million in revenue (57% increase YoY) and already had multiple profitable quarters, which is unheard of. For comparison, they make 60x as much as GNUS, but get 1/60th of the attention. This means we get to be early.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Three Catalysts - Pick your Weapon:\n\n1. Q2 earnings this Thursday, August 6th - Their past earnings have been very very strong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Upcoming Siggraph 2020 tech conference (August 17-24) - A showcase of new military-grade Nvidia workstations/datacenters and Nvme PCIe storage/flash products)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Caught in the middle of a dick-measuring contest between AMD/NVIDIA, who both have new GPU architectures coming out (partnered with both). This is a situation that's going to unfold over time. As an OEM for both companies who are targeting PCIe 4.0 systems, OSS is going to be very pleased.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PROMISED LEAKS:**\n\nOSS currently holds the [first and only PCIe 4.0 server expansion system](https://ir.onestopsystems.com/press-releases/detail/164/oss-introduces-worlds-first-pcie-gen-4-expansion-system) that's compatible with Nvidia's A-100 card, the [most powerful processor in the world](https://www.techpowerup.com/270338/nvidia-ampere-a100-gpu-gets-benchmark-and-takes-the-crown-of-the-fastest-gpu-in-the-world). (benchmarked last week. Highest Octanebench score ever recorded.)\n\nThe CEO hinted that AMD's MI100 would be soon to follow, as [leaks from AMD](https://adoredtv.com/exclusive-cdna-and-mi100-presentation-slides-leak/) are showing specs and the clear intention to target PCIe 4.0 server systems, which OSS currently holds the majority of the market share in.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI could write a novel on this company, but I'm not going to bother. They will do well whether we talk about them or not.\n\nThey recently hired a new CEO, who's led two companies in the same industry to record revenues and one was bought out entirely by Broadcom. He also receives a [massive salary bonus](https://imgur.com/MPDnP9c) if the stock price reaches $5.50. It's clear what their intentions are.\n\nThe CEO did an interview yesterday where he mentioned that they had \"0 Covid cases on the production line\", which further bolsters my firm prediction that their quarterly/annual earnings should be very strong.",

        "selftext": "Alright guys so I'm one of the hosts on a YouTube channel named \"Max Tech\".  \nI previously did YouTube work for the channel \"Appleinsider\" since 2016, making videos on Apple products which include Mac computers with Intel chips. \n\nI also grew up playing video games and building custom PCs right when AMD started to release six-core and 8-core processors that were cheaper than Intel CPUs and targeted towards gamers.  \n\nEven though the Intel chips were better for gaming, I still bought AMD because they were cheaper. Intel maintained the lead for many years since games really only used 4 cores, and Intel chips gave more consistent frame rates for gaming.\n\nAt one point, it was clear to me and to everyone else that Intel was intentionally holding off from innovating and improving their performance because they already owned a bulk of the market share. They realized that they could make more profit by making small improvements every year, while AMD was busting their ass trying to figure out how they can compete. (it was ultimately the gaming and custom PC market) \n\nMeanwhile.. Apple was using Intel chips quite successfully in their Mac computers the like MacBooks and iMacs. And Apple was also using their XEON chips for their higher-end machines. And of course, Intel was killing it in the server market.\n\nNow in 2013, Intel announced that they were working on their new 10nm chip process and that it should be ready to launch in 2015, and they said their 7nm chips should launch in 2017. \n\nBack to Intel, over the new few years, Intel delayed 10nm to 2016... and then to 2017.. and then to late 2019... We are now in 2020 and Intel is still shipping 14+++++ nm chips for high-end machines like the 2020 5K Apple iMac that was just released yesterday. Only laptops are getting the actual 10nm chips right now. \n\nIn 2017, AMD shocked the world by announcing their new Ryzen chips, and then also their Threadripper chips, and ever since then, they've been quickly catching up to Intel in terms of both performance and price. \n\nBecause of this, Intel instantly started lowering the price of their chips, and in 2018, they finally made 6-core chips for the MacBook Pro. 8-core chips in 2019, and now 10-core chips in 2020. This is an obvious and desperate move to try and compete with AMD. \n\nBecause Intel's 10nm chips were not ready in 2015 or 2016, Apple's redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro which was thinner than ever before, had overheating issues. The overheating was severe in 2018 with the 6-core chips that Intel made in fear of AMD. \n\nThere were even leaked emails from Intel executives worried about AMD's price to performance beating out Intel. \n\nAnd right now, it is well known that AMD is making BETTER price-to-performance x86 chips. \n\nThe MOST important part of this discussion is that the tech community as a whole, including or YouTube and Reddit, are now convinced that AMD is the way to go. I've seen countless comments on my videos that are dissing on Intel chips and wishing that Apple would switch to using Intel. \n\nIf we make a build guide video using an Intel processor, we get shamed and called dumb for not using an AMD chip. Our Mac Pro videos got a ton of negative feedback because Apple is stupid for using Intel chips. Our 2020 MacBook Pro videos were getting comments dissing on Intel's 10th-gen chips. The entire community is starting to hate Intel and preferring AMD.  \n\nAMD stock has increased over 11x since they announced the first Ryzen chips in August of 2016.  \nIntel stock has only increased 38% since that same date. \n\nAnd looking towards the future.. Intel has recently delayed their 7nm chips until late 2022 or 2023. This caused their stock price to tank at they last earnings call. \n\nThere's even now a class-action lawsuit against Intel because of this delay. \n\nThis also caused their chief of chip engineering to resign, and they reorganized their entire chip team. \n\nThey've even discussed outsourcing their future 6nm, 5nm and 3nm chip production to their rival foundry TSMC because they've lost confidence in their own foundry. \n\nSo it's clear that Intel is getting killed by AMD with each passing year, and the tech community knows it. (Which is VERY important)   \n\n\nThis brings us into the Apple and TSMC portion of this DD.   \n\n\nBack in 2013, Apple announced their A7 chip for their iPhone 5s, the first 64 bit smartphone chip, and ever since then, there was a massive performance war between Apple and Qualcomm, fighting to create the fastest smartphone chips, in which Apple ultimately won. \n\n(The A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro is still much faster than the Snapdragon 865+ which was just recently released this year) \n\nStuck in the middle of this battle was TSMC, which has been the EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Apple Silicon chips for their iPhones and iPads since the A10 chip in 2016. \n\nAnd in 2018, Apple released their 11\" iPad Pro with the A12X chip manufactured by TSMC's 7nm process. This iPad from 2 years ago is so powerful that it still outperforms the new 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with Intel's 10th gen chip in both processor AND graphics performance. \n\nNow, Apple is about to announce their iPhone 12 in about a month that's gonna pack the A14 chip which is being built on TSMC's brand new 5nm process. \n\nAnd of course, the next iPad Pro will get a much improved A14X 5nm chip, and it's the same story for the Apple Silicon Mac chips that will start being released later this year in October/November. \n\nI'm of course, talking about Apple finally ditching Intel and moving forward with their own chips. This makes sense for Apple for various different reasons.\n\n1: They can run iPhone &amp; iPad apps on their Macs.\n\n2: They control both the software and hardware for incredibly amounts of performance optimization.\n\n3: They can make sure every new Mac update gets a new chip with performance improvements instead of relying on Intel to release improved chips. \n\n4: This is of course, much cheaper for Apple since they don't have to pay Intel the high price of their chips. \n\n5: They don't have to deal with overheating issues since most Intel chips are still on 14nm technology, therefore running very hot and using a lot of power.   \n\n\nAnd there's a good chance that the very first Apple Silicon Mac chips are gonna outperform the current Intel chips, stay much cooler and give you much better battery life. \n\nJust to give you some perspective in terms of how Intel's 10nm compares to TSMC's 5nm..\n\nIntel 10nm transistor density: around 100 million transistors per square millimeter.\n\nTSMC 5nm transistor density: around 171 million transistors per square millimeter. \n\n  \nTSMC has already confirmed that they're working on risk production of their new 3nm process in 2021,  with those chips going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\nSo here's what the future looks like:\n\n  \nIntel 7nm in late 2022/2023 : 240 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nTSMC 3nm shipping in 2022 Apple products: 290 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nAnd apparently, TSMC is already working on plans for their 2nm process for 2024.   \n\n\nAnd due to Intel's past, there's a very good chance that Intel could delay 7nm even further, especially since they had to restructure their entire chip team, while TSMC has been on point.   \n\n\nSo the future isn't looking very bright for Intel's chip technology compared to TSMC. No wonder why they wanted to outsource their chips from them.   \n\n\nAnd one last bit on Apple's switch to their own chips built by TSMC. \n\nApple has already given developers their transition kit which is a Mac Mini with an A12Z chip from their iPad Pro. \n\nOne developer tweeted this: \"At this point, I think that the first gen Apple Silicon machines will be faster at running x86 code than an actual x86...\"  \n\n\nWhat he means is that Apple's new Rosetta 2 emulation software is so good that he thinks it'll outperform Intel chips even though it's not running natively for ARM. \n\nSo basically, Apple made the right choice by ditching Intel.   \n\n\nAnd if Apple proves everyone wrong by coming out with incredibly great Macs thanks to their switch to their own Apple Silicon ARM-based chips, then there's a VERY good chance that the rest of the market will follow them and start developing ARM-based chips for laptops.\n\nThis will force Windows to start heavily investing in their ARM-based Windows software. \n\nAnd if you didn't already know.. Intel is FAR behind in the ARM-based chip world.   \n\n\nNow, the most common argument I hear is this: Apple is only a tiny part of Intel's business, and while that may be true.. the MOST important thing is the public's view of Intel.  \n\n\nThe tech community is already starting to despise Intel as a brand name because of their overpriced processors and the fact that AMD is beginning to CRUSH them. \n\nJust wait until Apple Silicon Macs start getting released and people realize that ARM-chips have a ton of potential, and they'll start hating Intel even more. \n\nThis will cause Intel's brand recognition and reputation to get absolutely destroyed in favor of AMD and Apple Silicon. This alone will lead to less market share. And what will happen if Nvidia or Apple buy out ARM? \n\nAnd by the way, there are now more and more ARM-based servers popping up, so there's a good chance that Intel will start to lose market share on the server side if ARM-based servers prove themselves. (They use less power so this makes sense for server farms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is that Intel just got ditched by Apple.. and they're getting killed by AMD and TSMC. ARM is coming VERY quickly and Intel is NOT ready. They have been plagued with delay after delay, and all of this drama will ruin the confidence of their staff, leading to lowered productivity. It's not looking good for Intel for the long-term.  \n\n\nAs of right now, Intel stock is very cheap, and you might make a few bucks if you trade short term.. but I wouldn't hold Intel stock long term.   \n\n\nIf you want more in-depth info with visuals and extra details, you can check out two videos I made on the Max Tech Youtube channel: \n\n\"How Intel Lost the CPU Race..\"\n\n\"Apple Silicon ARM Chips vs Intel x86 Processors for Mac?\"\n\nHopefully you enjoyed this DD.",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, just took a look at the current NVDA calls and the Greeks behind them. This is for the riskier calls this week. This is for 8/28 expiration calls. Here's what I found out (as of close of 8/21):\n\n\nOTM:\n\n\n550c: Delta=0.1270 Theta= -0.5182 Gamma=0.0060 Vega=0.1462.   Price = Ask: 2.20, Bid:2.08, Median: 2.14. IV:49.59%\n\nThis call has a current profit/loss of 12 cents per dollar increase/decrease. This call has a current decrease of 51 cents per day. This call has a current IV of 49.59(50)%, which means half of its value is due to volatility- this is further evident by the Vega being larger than the Delta - a 14 cent increase/decrease per 1% change in volatility. I wouldn't buy this call because, as of now, NVDA would have to increase in price at a rate of $6 per day just to offset the Theta loss and gain 0.12 on the call. The increase in price would likely affect the IV of the call as the week goes on - so a potential of 0.25~0.50 per day of a $5~6 increase. With a current median price of 2.14, you would need a $20-30 share price swing within 3 days to turn an okayish profit. On the fourth day, the call will be worth appx. 0.16 if the share price stagnates. Additionally, the Gamma is under 1 penny - this call has poor acceleration in regards to profit.\n\nIt's the same story up to 515c - 515c has a ridiculous Theta of -0.8485: nearly a dollar deduction in value per day.\n\n\nATM:\n\n\n510c: Delta=0.4773 Theta=-0.8658 Gamma=0.0131 Vega=0.2798. Price= Ask:11.00, Bid:10.75, Median:10.88 IV: 43.27%\n\nThis call only requires a $2 increase in share price per day to offset the Theta loss. Assuming a huge run up, the Gamma modestly works in your favor at a 0.01 increase in acceleration - but once again, the Vega is a major factor in the price at 43% IV and being over half of Delta value. This is definitely a better purchase than the OTM calls in regards to daily profitability, although at around 5X the price of the 550c. I would buy this call if I anticipated a large run up of $20-30 before the 28th. The reason for this is the Delta value - even if there was a stagnation, you would at least be able to sell this off (maybe) at half of the current purchase price.\n\n\n505c:\n\nNearly identical to 510c analysis, but a higher purchase price with a marginally better profit assuming a run up.\n\n\n500c: \n\nSame. One thing of note is that the Vega is less than 1/2 of the Delta, so this call will be more affected by actual share price as opposed to IV. If I were to do a modest debit spread, this is where the cheapest entry would be as of now for an increase in value in regards to share price. \n\n\nITM:\n\n\n495c: Delta=0.6721 Theta=-0.7768 Gamma=0.0120 Vega=0.2538 IV=42.78%\n\nThis call only has a .10 differential between Delta and Theta - meaning that at a $2 increase in share price per day, 42% of the increase is profit (.60\u00d72=1.20; 1.20-.70=.50; .50/1.20=0.4166). For ITM calls, this is the worst performing call. If I were to do a debit spread, this would be my ideal starting point in regards to frugality. In regards to performance/gains, this is the worst ITM buy for a debit spread. \n\nEverything else ITM, the delta is greater than than the Theta - so assuming at least a $1 increase in price per day, you will turn a profit.\n\nHope this helps some autist on the fence about NVDA calls this week. I did this because I was bored. If my analysis is incorrect, please let me know what is wrong because this is my first time analyzing the Greeks in regards to profit/loss. I would like to improve.",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: you really shouldn\u2019t do this, especially if you are not 95% sure the direction the stock will go within a short timeframe\n\nI discovered this completely by accident but on think or swim, if you create an OCO (on cancel order) order with very little price incriminates, multiple orders can get filled regardless of whether or not you actually have the money in you\u2019re account. You still need the money to cover the first order but in the event subsequent orders get filled before the system can cancel, the contracts are yours. For whatever reason, TD Ameritrade lets the trade play out despite the lack of funds which is somewhat impressive. One response I got was, you\u2019re a grown up, it\u2019s you\u2019re account. If things go wrong it\u2019s on you but if it works out, we won\u2019t take you\u2019re gains. \n\nFirst time \nI was trying to get rid of my spy call at open back in June. They were worth maybe $1200 according to the profit option calculator but I didn\u2019t know for sure so I set sell orders for $12, $12.05, $12.10, etc up to maybe $12.30. $12 got filled, but I guess $12.05 got filled also so I was now naked the call despite my account not being approved for it. I called them up crying, begging to get out the trade, sides like man calm down, you\u2019re up $50 on the trade, leg up or down to create a spread and you\u2019re guaranteed to win no matter what. \n\nSecond \nLam research a week before earnings. I had a good idea lam would beat but wasn\u2019t willing to bet my life on it. My account balance got wiped out maybe 95% and only shot up after lam beat and the stock rose long enough for me to unload down some poor kids throat at the high. \n\nThird time\nNvda this Friday. Nvda will hit $500 and maybe $520. I had Oco to get $500c exp sep 4 ($932 each) I got filled multiple times against my account value. Unloaded this morning for 100% gain.... Kinda hoping the stock drops so I can get back in. The dumbest thing I did was hedge by selling $520c friday instead of manning up and waiting until Monday.\n\n\nThis usually happens to me on accident. But let\u2019s say you are bullish and just know a stock will jump, theoretically you could max out you\u2019re buying power with a single order, and hope you\u2019re other orders get filled before the system can cancel them. \n\nIf you are wrong, god help you! You\u2019ll be on the hook for a lot of money.\n\nIn the screenshot below you can see I was negative $1000 account balance.\n[screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/7GXVwiM)",

        "selftext": "Listen up fuckers.\n\n\nI\u2019m not ludicrously experienced with options, but I can recognize some bullshit when I see it. This arcticle [(Intel \u2018Stunning Failure\u2019 Heralds End of an Era for U.S. Chip Sector)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stunning-failure-heralds-end-030711424.html) and a bunch of other \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b news caused $INTC to drop off the face of the earth last week. \n\n\nI kinda fail to see the drama. Intel has always outsourced it's chips. Maybe it's doing it more now, but even 8 years ago when my brother and I built our first PC's. His chip was from Mexico, mine was from Taiwan. \n\n\nFurthermore, TSMC, the company this article says Intel should sell factories to, has been the heavyweight chip maker for a decade or more.\n\n\nNvidia and AMD for example, they are the two graphics card manufacturers. BOTH of them have their chips made by TSMC. These companies do all their designing, but in the end everything is made by TSMC anyway. At least, a lions share of it.\n\n\nNow, Intel definitely has struggled in the recent market, but that's because they've demolished AMD in the performance chip market for nearly two decades. There was no reason to keep pushing their envelope, spending billions on R&amp;D for a better product. All they had to do was refine their Lake series processors and they'd continue to rake in a ton of profit. This profit was used to expand their market to the mobile industry. Particularly laptops. For a long time it was hard to get an apple product with any kind of processor that wasn't Intel.\n\n\nThey're not going away. They're not crashing.\n\n\nThey're just finally seeing AMD pass them in one market. This has caused other markets to start to shift due to uncertainty about who the \"best\" chip manufacturer is, but trust me - we will see Intel back with a fiery vengeance.\n\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Intel pops out some high core count chips that are pushing 5.0-5.5 all core clock count speeds. Once they scale down their transistor size... Oof. It's going to be a Rottweiler back in the pit. \n\n\n\nTL;DR INTC $55c 09/18, but load up on whatever the hell you want, these contracts are CHEAP",

        "selftext": "I need a veteran investor\u2019s opinion. I have been watching AMZN, TSLA, and NVDA grow like some stock market cancer. I am in a state of \u201cFOMO\u201d because I do not own any of these megalithic companies because they are so expensive, at least to me. I am 25, have about 10k in liquid, have a 401k and a full time job where I earn roughly 50k AGI. Come next week, where do I put my money? Would I be better off buying 1 stock of each and holding long term? Should I buy 1, maybe 2 option contracts on these companies? Should I dump all my money into an ETF? What do I do? I\u2019m scared to invest so much of my capital because of these rumors i\u2019m hearing of an imminent economic down fall comparable to the recession of 07-09. My initial plan for my liquid was to buy a home when the recession hits and rent it out for passive income  but with Trump\u2019s EOs it doesn\u2019t seem like that will be happening for at least another year or so. My cash is just there gaining no value. As a matter of fact it\u2019s loosing value due to inflation. What should I do with my money? I just need some genuine advise. Thank you.",

        "selftext": "$ATVI should see significant growth. It closed just under ATH from early Q4 '18 leading up to earnings with a nice run up after Take Two Interactive's beat. I expect it to continue through earnings due to a number of reasons. \n\n1. Candy Crush will Candy GUH-SH\n\n* Top grossing mobile game for the past few quarters (Candy Crush was the highest grossing game franchise in US app stores during Q1)\n* WFH means play from home, at any time of the day, no repercussions\n* Working women &amp; men handing their iPads to their children to play because there is no child care (COVID)\n* If you can't figure this one out just delete your Robinhood app\n\n2. Warzone\n\n* 50M DAU in the first TEN DAYS - 10 fucking days in Q1.\n* Growing user base during pandemic\n* Great F2P monetization with numerous buying points (battle pass, full game conversion, micro transactions) - have seen numerous folks pay for the full game after playing WZ &amp; also buying skins/guns when they typically do not spend ANY money on in game transactions\n* Wall street doesn't understand what this means for Activision. Call of Duty is one of the highest selling franchises on release for each console. Adding a F2P component, being one of the most popular games on Twitch, and capitalizing on Tik Tok's growth will be huge.  \n\n   * See an example of someone who is bullish but doesn't understand gaming: \"Activision Blizzard has been losing ground to companies like ***Riot Games*** for a while now. The [success](https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/league-of-legends-overtakes-fortnite-to-become-the-most-watched-game-on-twitch-in-2019) of its flagship title ***Fortnite*** has taken the gaming world by storm. Activision Blizzard *does not have any games that can match the popularity of Fortnite at the moment.* However, Activision Blizzard has ***arguably the most diverse portfolio of popular games***. This makes it less reliant on current gaming trends or the success of single franchises. The recent growth in popularity of relatively old franchises like World of Warcraft showcases Activision Blizzard's staying power.\" https://seek ingalpha.com/article/4362774-activision-blizzard-is-riding-high-despite-pandemic\n   * This person has a bull case for Activision while simultaneously missing that WZ is more popular than Fortnite at the moment, not knowing that Epic Games owns Fortnite, and saying \"but they have the best portfolio\".\n\n3. Overwatch\n\n* Don't follow this game as much but one of the most popular esports in a pivotal point of the gaming landscape\n* Overwatch 2 on the horizon with a loyal player base\n\n4. WOW\n\n* PC gaming has been absolutely crushing (AMD, NVDA benefited)\n* Loyal fanbase returning due to more expansion packs\n* Upcoming release this fall\n\n5. Forward Guidance\n\n* Literally impossible this isn't hugely bullish\n* Take Two just reported a very positive industry outlook\n* Q3/4 console releases are expected to make historic numbers - PS5/XB1X\n* NVDA/AMD new GPUs expected this fall with a crazy PC gaming market (many parts are sold out or selling above retail price)\n\nTLDR: Blindly throw your money at my positions for 2-5x (I was right on AMD a few days prior to the huge run)... JK read the post it's in bullets so even you can digest. Also, Take Two is up 30% from it's ATH around the same time as $ATVI.\n\n[Positions.](https://preview.redd.it/6dwlonje2we51.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5280142c107c84de12a762bfb2693b163d99c13)",

        "selftext": "Nvidia literally has the AI market in a corner with it's balls in a vice. This quarter they expect for AI sales to surpass gaming sales for the first time. There is unbelievable amounts of growth potential that nvidia WILL capitalize on. After earnings the stock will come back down and it's a good opportunity to buy into nvidia and hold for the next few months.\n\nSome of your retards will say nvidia is over valued and will have to come back down. You are absolutely correct it is over valued but so is the rest of our entire stock market. And it's gay bears like you that I buy my calls from. Of course the AI sales are priced into their EPS expectations, which is why the stock will come back down after earnings. However, it shows no signs of slowing growth and only shows signs of huge future growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: $NVDA 600c 3/19/2021. Nvidia releases earnings 8/19/2020 and it's being pumped hard right now (+$30.92 today \\[6.68%\\]). After earnings it will pull back, this will be the perfect opportunity to buy into long dated calls or buy and hold the stock for the next pump.\n\nSmol gain according to WSB but a gain none the-less from friday to today. +$1,295\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ayqdmx6pimh51.png?width=757&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fd7f9dfa06dc47975af895c54b13b96843adddd",

At 21Gb/s, a graphics card with 12pcs of GDDR6X will be able to break the 1TB/s of system bandwidth barrier!\u201d As Tom\u2019s Hardware highlights, all the evidence seems to suggest it\u2019ll be 21 Gb/s.\u201d\n\nSo Micron is providing technology for NVDA\u2019s new GPU. For people that dont use computers, this new GPU (graphics card) will be probably top 3 fastest graphics cards available to the public when it releases.\n\nGraphwise this also seems like a good play. MU is oversold on the 180 4 hr chart due to recent news that they have a surplus of 2 of their products. The last 4 times MU has been oversold on the 4h chart it has rebounded 10+% within the next couple weeks.\n\nFor the retards: MU make part for NVDA good graphics card make stock go up.\n\nPosition: MU 9/18 50c\n\nFuck the bears\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

During the height of the bull rally, I had a return of 62% (I know, it's not the best) and now I'm down to a return of 23%. \n\nAfter reading some investing books and listening to well-known finance investors on podcasts, I've sold everything in my portfolio except a few shares of AAPL and NVDA. Over the next couple weeks, I'll slowly be moving my money into Index ETFs. \n\nThe main reason I made this decision was because of the tons of snapchat and IG stories of my friends/classmates in college without masks, no social distancing, and partying on the beaches. Colleges, like mine, made last minute decisions to go fully virtual this semester, so many students signed apartment leases already. Now, my school won't require weekly covid testing and have created environments where students will live in close proximity of each other off campus when they take their classes virtually. I only imagine elementary and high schools will be just as bad since the kids will inevitably bring the virus back to their families. \n\nWith fall around the corner and no stimulus bill in sight, I can see a decent market pullback coming soon. I hope I'm wrong, but the US is definitely playing with fire by reopening schools.\n\n\nTL;DR a college senior sold most of his portfolio after fearing of a 2nd covid wave hitting college campuses",

        "selftext": "As I do here each week, here's a look ahead of some of the moves expected out of notable earnings. \n\nMy thoughts: It's interesting to see the much smaller expected moves of companies set to report this week (towards the end of earnings season) as opposed to what we saw a few weeks ago. That's probably reflective of two things, the first is that overall market volatility is much lower now (VIX \\~22). And somewhat related, these company's expected moves are now isolating their own earnings as opposed to picking up the uncertainty of other companies and the overall market. More than 90% of the other companies have already reported, including many of their peers. This is probably as pure an earnings reaction move as we've seen since the Covid selloff.\n\nLet me know in the comments if you'd like to see anything added.\n\n**Last Week**\n\n* VIX closed Friday at 22.05, down slightly on the week and the lowest level since the Spring.\n* Last week's expected move in SPY +/- 1.2%\n* Last week\u2019s actual move SPY: +0.7%\n\n**The week ahead**\n\nThis week\u2019s expected move in SPY, via Options AI technology +/- 1.3% SPY\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yhpgwkn4rlh51.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5b6a9ce53f583164b13d16019cd986c1bc3de0a\n\n**Earnings of Note**\n\nFirst here's the 1 month expected moves of stocks set to report this week as an overlay, below that is the individual expected moves into Friday and what the stocks did last earnings:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/b3e04dbcqlh51.gif\n\n**Tuesday 6:00am | HD +/-3.1% |** Last earnings close/intraday -3.0%/-3.1% [chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-17-at-8.23.53-AM.png)\n\n**Tuesday 7:00am | WMT +/-4.0% |** Last earnings close/intraday -2.1%/+3.4% [chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-17-at-8.26.29-AM.png)\n\n**Wednesday 6:30am | TGT +/-5.1% |** Last earnings close/intraday -2.9%/-3.2% [chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-17-at-8.32.30-AM.png)\n\n**Wednesday 7:00am | LOW +/-4.9% |** Last earnings close/intraday +0.1%/+5.0% [chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-17-at-8.30.06-AM.png)\n\n**Wednesday 4:20pm | NVDA +/-6.1% |** Last earnings close/intraday +2.9%/+3.6% [chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-17-at-8.35.22-AM.png)\n\n**Thursday 7:10am | BABA +/-4.9% |** Last earnings close/intraday -5.9%/-6.2% [chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-17-at-8.37.50-AM.png)\n\n**Friday 6:45am | DE +/-3.9% |** Last earnings close/intraday -1.5%/+3.92% [chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-17-at-8.39.58-AM.png)",

We all know Nvidia is killing it at the moment so I am not going to go all DD in this post. \n\nHowever, when looking at the best option plays, the NVDA ATM straddle for 08/21 is still doing 7/8% which is ridiculous. After all the upticks in the last days, there is no much upside left I believe so the best play is to buy calls in the best performing stocks in the same sector. They will get a similar boost as well but option premium is less in these stocks because they don\u2019t contain QE premium anymore. Also these sectors will still be trending up mainly because of the rotation that is still taking place within big market participants (i.e. Buffet dropping banks and picking up gold)\n\nThe best companies in sectors relevant to where Nvidia operates, as well as favorites in the current sector rotation are TSM, AMD and ASML. So my bet is to buy:  \n TSM 8/21 82C\n\nAMD 8/21 85C\n\nASML 8/21 325C",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm back from my last DD: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4mgq1/intc\\_why\\_you\\_should\\_not\\_hold\\_intel\\_stock\\_long\\_term/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4mgq1/intc_why_you_should_not_hold_intel_stock_long_term/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)  \n\n\nI'll try and make this one a bit shorter.   \n\n\nVadim Yuryev here from the YouTube channel Max Tech.  \nI've been covering a lot of Apple products and Macs for the last 4 years ever since I started working for Appleinsider. \n\nAs you all know, Apple has recently announced that they're switching to their own custom Apple Silicon Mac chips, which will of course be built exclusively by TSMC on their brand new 5nm process (World's first)\n\nWhat most people don't know is that they've been working toward this transition for many years. For example, in 2017, they dropped 32 bit app support for iOS 11. In 2018, their macOS Mojave forced developers to use their Metal framework (That's why Nvidia cards don't work anymore in eGPUs) In 2019, macOS Catalina dropped support for 32 bit apps.\n\nThese 3 steps are incredibly important to the Apple Silicon Macs coming this Fall because one of the most important features is the ability to run completely unmodified iPhone and iPad apps on day 1, which of course, are 64 bit apps that run using the Metal framework on the current Apple Silicon chips. manufactured by TSMC. \n\nBecause of this, the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon chips is gonna be much more smooth compared to the previous transition from PowerPC to Intel chips. \n\nA major benefit for the future is that app developers can build apps that have most of the code shared across all Apple devices, which minor adjustments to get the UI to scale properly from the Mac, to the iPad, to the iPhone and of course the Apple TV.\n\nAnd a huge benefit will be the ability to fix bugs and optimize code for all platforms at once instead of having to do it all separately since the main code is shared.\n\nAnd unlike the last transition, Rosetta 2 can now translate x86 app code into ARM-supported code during the install time instead of using real-time emulation. And for plugins and drivers, Rosetta 2 emulates them as well.\n\nDevelopers who have been using Apple's Developer Transition Kit with the A12Z chip from the iPad Pro have already mentioned that Rosetta 2 works incredibly well, much better than expected:  \n[https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20](https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/never\\_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20](https://twitter.com/never_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20)\n\nAnd this is with the A12Z chip, which mind you, hasn't changed in terms of processing performance from the A12X chip from 2018. This is also a chip that comes in an iPad Pro that is thinner than any iPhone ever, and has absolutely zero active cooling. \n\nThat chip from 2018 currently outperforms Intel's brand new 10th-gen 10nm chip that came in the 2020 MacBook Pro in terms of both processing and Metal graphics performance.\n\nApple Silicon Macs will of course, have active fan cooling, and Apple has already stated that their Apple Silicon chips for their Macs will be a brand new family of chips, and each Mac will have a chip built specifically for it's enclosure and it's cooling capabilities.\n\nAnd Apple has mentioned that their Silicon has been built for years with easy scalability in mind, so they can add much more cores into the new Mac chips, especially since they'll have active fan cooling. \n\nBecause of the pandemic, Apple's original plans to release a new iPad Pro this Fall with the brand new A14X chip built on TSMC's new 5nm process and a new Mini-LED display were delayed, so that's why the released the 2020 iPad Pro in March, where they basically reused the A12X chip and rebranded it.\n\nSo right now, most investors have no idea how good the A14X is gonna be.\n\nThe A13 chip from last year's iPhones already performs incredibly well in terms of single-core performance, almost neck and neck with Intel's i9-9900K.\n\nThe new A14 chip will be a major improvement, due to being the first chip built on TSMC's 5nm chip.\n\nThere will also be an A14X chip will have a massive improvement over the current A12Z chip, and let me remind you that it will be in an iPad Pro that's thin and passively cooled.\n\nThis same 5nm technology is gonna be scaled up to fit active cooled Apple Silicon Mac computers, first coming into MacBooks like the MacBook Air and the 13\" MacBook Pro, and then into the redesigned 24\" iMac. \n\nOne of the first rumored chips will be a 12-core 5nm chip built by TSMC with 8 high performance cores and 4 efficiency cores. This will likely go into the MacBook Pro. \n\nI'm almost certain that it will outperform the previous Intel-based MacBook Pros in every way. And on top of that, the new Apple Silicon chips will come with Apple's Neural engine and machine learnings accelerations. Along with that, they'll get the same HEVC hardware accelerators as well, which is now becoming the standard for video recording. \n\nBasically, the point of all of this is that TSMC's new 5nm chips that will come in the Apple Silicon Macs are gonna be much faster than anyone is expecting, and those first Macs are rumored to be coming this October or November. \n\nThese chips will shake the entire industry due to the vast performance per watt improvements and the way Apple is gonna use them in terms of their Apple devices sharing the same code. \n\nAnd if Apple succeeds in this transition, there's a very good chance that the rest of the industry will start slowly switching to ARM-based chips, which TSMC is the leader in. (Intel is way behind in ARM chip technology)\n\nBecause of this, TSMC will be confirmed as the leader in chip-making technology, and investors will jump onboard.\n\nTheir main advantage is that they're the first to 5nm, and Samsung is currently having trouble with their 5nm process. Their Note 20 Ultra isn't launching with 5nm chips like people expected.  \n\"A new [report](https://www.zhitongcaijing.com/content/detail/324146.html) out of China (via [*GizmoChina*](https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/08/05/samsung-lost-qualcomm-5nm-orders-tsmc/)), however, suggests Samsung may have lost most, if not all, of that business to Taiwanese rival TSMC\"\n\n[https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875](https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875)\n\nSo Samsung is having trouble. Intel is having trouble, ordering wafers from TSMC. AMD is ordering wafers from TSMC. Qualcomm is ordering wafers from TSMC.\n\nTSMC is now becoming the Sony of the chip-making world. (Sony owns the camera sensor market by such a vast margin that a TON of cameras come with Sony sensors)\n\nWhat if TSMC becomes the next Sony and more companies rely on them for chips instead of investing into their own chip technology? \n\nSummary: Buy Long calls. Especially while the whole market is having a down day today. Buy the dip!\n\nPositions: TSM $100c 1/15/21",

However, past spikes and falls are not good enough for me. This company is severely undervalued in all aspects and one of the very very few pennystocks I see promise in. (90% are absolute garbage)  \n[OSS Post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/hq0x80/potential_pennystock_of_the_year_oss_one_stop/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n[OSS Post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/i3mq5j/oss_likely_to_run_soon_leaks_from_amdnvidia_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  \nAt this point I feel like I could run the company myself. Their products, financials, and executive backgrounds are baffling, along with their list of customers and partners (Nvidia, AMD, intel, Boeing, Raytheon)  \n[https://www.onestopsystems.com/partners](https://www.onestopsystems.com/partners)   \n\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nToday OSS held a tech showcase at [Siggraph Tech Conference 2020.](https://register.rcsreg.com/r2/siggv2020/index.html) (You have to register to watch, Use code: OSS20 to register for free)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey went over various new military and disney-grade systems that they've been certified by NVIDIA to produce. \n\nSome key takeaways for tech nerds:  \n\n\n1. The workstations and eGPU stations are compatible with all RTX cards (2060 and up), and the AMD Radeon series. This means that when the 30-series comes out in early September, especially the 3090, they will be incorporated as the smaller 8nm die can translate to better power efficiency in their remote workstations. RNDA2 applies as well. \n2. The eGPU configurations in their stations can achieve up to 10x better benchmarks while overclocked/accelerated than average consumer stations. This is because of the dedicated chassis and pure concentration on processing power.\n3. The A-100 Datacenter systems and the RTX Quadro series systems, in their PCIe 4.0 exp systems can have their VRAM reallocated to different users on a single platform. Meaning that if PIXAR (one of their customers), wants to render on one stations and then shift to the next, all processing power can be shared and never wasted. (hard to explain)\n4. Unlike many other providers, their builds are custom. Meaning that PIXAR can request certain a build for certain applications, and it will be customized as so. The new one was showcased today. (I can't link it yet, so you need to look in the presentation to see it).\n5. These custom remote workstations (multi-GPU super computer racks) are perfect for the [military](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/24/2082633/0/en/OSS-Receives-4-3-Million-in-DSU-Purchase-Orders-for-Military-Radar-Application-as-Follow-on-to-36-Million-Supplier-Agreement.html)   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey just beat earnings for Q2, shaving so much off of their operating costs and assigning new customers. They are a [preferred OEM for Nvidia](https://www.onestopsystems.com/nvidia-gpus), and will also thrive off of AMD's new RDNA2 lineup and Intel's data-center processors.   \n\n\nThis is not a [$2.40 stock](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oss-introduces-world-first-pcie-150010777.html), and in my years of trading, I absolutely stand by that. And if the new CEO gets this company bought out like his last one (bought out by Broadcom), I would not be surprised.   \n\n\n  \n*(Caution: The Summer months of August/September are the harshest months for traders each year. Volume and liquidity is low in the market, favoring algo traders and scalpers. These are all opinions, strong ones at that. You need to do your own research and most importantly, know when it's right to sit on your cash. )*",

        "selftext": "First, let's laugh at ourselves. We never get SPAC targets right. Batting .000 at this point.  \n\n\nNow let's get down to business. You could write off Canoo as another vaporware EV company. But when you start to dig  you  see, okay, maybe these guys have something and are ahead of other EV companies that have come to market lately:  \n\n\n* They are already in pre-production testing and have built [at least 30 test vehicles](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). They've figured out how to turn their concept into a [manufactured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvWFpnUbRv8) [product](https://www.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/emobility/proof-of-concept-la-based-start-up-canoo-gets-production-ready/40572.article). \n* It's run by a team [experienced in the auto industry](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-company-overview). A lot of ex-BMW, ex-Tesla, etc. This is not another case of 'this idea is so crazy we had to hire outsiders.' \n* They built their own modular ev [skateboard](https://electrek.co/2019/12/17/canoo-eschews-traditional-vehicle-constraints-ditches-ev-battery-enclosure/) [platform](https://www.canoo.com/engineering/), similar to what large auto companies like [VW](https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/modular-electric-drive-matrix-meb-3677) or [GM](https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/ev.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2020/mar/0304-ev.html) are doing. The platform contains batteries, motors, and control systems can be adapted to a lot of different vehicle 'shells.' Hyundai deemed it credible enough that they want to use it for their own vehicles, and they [pay Canoo for engineering services](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/hyundai-taps-ev-startup-canoo-to-develop-electric-vehicles/). They seem to have relationships with legit suppliers: [Nvidia](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/startup-vehicles-drive-agx/) and [Blackberry](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-to-power-autonomy-systems-in-canoo-s-next-generation-) (QNX OS) for autonomy. [Nexen](https://www.tirebusiness.com/automotive/nexen-secures-oe-fitment-ev-skateboard-startup-canoo) for tires (still looking for their   \n battery cell supplier). \n* The leasing model is unique and perhaps unproven, but the launch plan seems [measured](https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/canoo-takes-the-covers-off-of-its-debut-electric-vehicle/), with a near-term focus on city dwellers, delivery, and [ride-shares](https://www.fleetforward.com/341195/canoo-unveils-subscription-only-ev), full autonomy longer term. \n\n&gt;The plan for 2021 is to launch in Los Angeles and have another eight cities account for the company\u2019s U.S. market. That means four on the West Coast and four on the East Coast, according to Kranz. After the launch in the U.S. we are considering launching the vehicle in China\u2026 There are 18 cities that represent 75% of the EV population in China,\n\n* They have a competent PR and social media team that gets their name out there. They've appeared in a lot of press including [Jay Leno's Garage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FIViMSeigM), NYT, Car &amp; Driver, are on the radar of analysts covering  EVs.\n\ntl;dr I'm long on Canoo.

If at the time I started I just left all my money in SPY + QQQ SHARES and didn't touch it I would be up like 10% more than I am now. But with that being said, when SPY dropped 5% 6/12 (which was a fun day to celebrate my birthday to see a -13k loss in one day) my portfolio dropped like 20% and just kept going down... so I made a pretty big fucking recovery... (165k to 222k). At absolute rock bottom, you know what my dad told me. He told me he was \"very happy\" that this happened. He said, and I quote: \"I would rather have you lose some of my money in the stock market than you lose your own money later on in life... You needed to learn that nobody makes money in the stock market! It's ok.\" Also, he apparently had way more accounts, one with way more money, which is why I'm guessing he was ok with me fucking with this one.\n\nBut then stonks started to just go up and I realized this and bought random-ass fucking calls. I bought apple calls, MSFT calls, and blah blah and that's what made me most of the money back and now I'm in the positive around 13% at 222k (started 195k).\n\nNow my dad still stands by what he told me but he thinks I'm some sort of god still and asks me every day on WhatsApp: \"[Is market close to the ](https://imgur.com/a/PL99NYY)[top?

        "selftext": "Blockbuster second-quarter earnings set the stage for the Nvidia to become the first-ever $500 billion chipmaker, Bank of America analysts said Wednesday.\n\nThe team led by Vivek Arya lifted their price target for the semiconductor company's shares to $600 from $520 in a note, implying 24% upside from Wednesday's close. Bank of America also reiterated its \"buy\" rating on the stock and praised the company's robust financials.\n\nNvidia reported better-than-expected sales and earnings on Wednesday afternoon, and its data center unit outperformed its gaming arm for the first time. The company also guided for a strong second half of the year on gaming sales growth and continued data-center strength.\n\n\"All growth roads\" lead to Nvidia reaching a half-trillion-dollar valuation, the analysts said. The company's free cash flow generation of 38% is \"best-in-class\" for all of tech, and its upcoming Ampere gaming chips set it up for strong momentum, they added. The team raised its 2020, 2021, and 2022 Nvidia profit forecasts by 10%, 14%, and 11%, respectively.\n\n\"Bigger picture, we believe NVDA has an unassailable hardware/software/developer lead in some of the largest and fastest growing markets in semis/tech,\" they wrote.\n\nNvidia only gained as much as 2% in Thursday trading after posting early losses amid a wave of profit-taking. Shares have more than doubled in 2020 as investors pile into tech bets.\nStill, the processor company needs to overcome a handful of obstacles on its climb to a $500 billion valuation. The data center sector is a \"lumpy\" one where volatile inventory build and digestion can quickly decelerate growth, the analysts said. US-China trade tensions could strike at the company's international sales. Disruptive merger and acquisition activity could also freeze the company's winning streak, they said.",

        "selftext": "Okay, so I'm writing this here rather than the options sub because this isn't a full-fledged options strategy. It's simply about covered calls and cash secured puts. \n\nTo give you some context, I've been working with my father since September, when we started running this strategy. I've also done it with my own money and realized some things about the capital requirements to be successful writing options. My dad started with about $170,000, and I started with about $45,000. I've dabbled, but I'm now leaning toward going long with about 80% of my money. This will fluctuate, but I think it's best to start with at least $100,000 if you're going to run this strategy, and that should only be no more than 40% of your portfolio if you want to be aggressive. \n\nMisconceptions: \n\n1. **Writing options is risky:** Wrong. It's literally no different than going long. Instead, you're just also collecting a premium for your troubles. The only risk here is singling out certain tickers that might not recover for some time. Hence the reason you need $100k or more: to be able to diversify your positions enough that you're not bagholding on the majority of them. \n2. **Avoid volatile stocks:** My god, this one is the most ridiculous of them all. The only reason--and I mean ONLY REASON--that you would avoid volatile tickers is because you're emotional. Volatile stocks pay higher premiums. Volatile stocks allow you to write on them at big discounts. Volatile stocks might run up before you sell the call, or allow you to collect decent premiums at higher strikes. I've seen people list stocks like Apple, NVDA, Facebook, AMD and Netflix as stocks to avoid when writing options. These are literally the very stocks that made us the most money. Volatility means absolutely nothing if the companies are good, and these companies are much more than good. \n3. **What if the market tanks:** Okay? So...what? People cite some quote about picking up pennies on a train track, when that was attributed to naked options. If you're long anyway, then you're in no different position. I have absolutely no idea why this is cited as a reason to avoid writing options. This, mathematically, makes absolutely no sense, and you cannot prove me wrong. \n4. **Long dated options:** Stop. Just stop. If you're not writing weeklies, you have no idea what you're doing. Again, math: the premiums are higher (yes, they are higher, do the math); you can better aim your strikes; and you don't have to sit there for months on end biting your nails as the market does what it does. \n5. **The object is to make as much premium as possible without my shares being assigned:** Huh? This isn't a long strategy. This is an options strategy; the whole idea is to make outsized weekly gains, between 1-4%. Any capital gains are bonus (though they can be big as well in certain cases). If you're trying to juggle going long with an options strategy, you're just caught in no-man's land. \n6. **Writing options is a neutral to bearish strategy:** Again, why would you listen to your brokerage's tutorial on options trading? Writing calls and puts works in literally any market, except for a crash, in which the only good strategy is shorting, and good luck to you on that one. \n7. **Avoid writing on stocks reporting earnings:** Huh? Again, emotions over logic. Why do I care if my shares get called away because Apple mooned at earnings? If I'm making 3-4% on premium--IN ONE WEEK--why am I getting the FOMOs? Why are you dumping Amazon because it fell 4% after earnings? Why aren't you instead selling another call at the price you bought? Stop shooting yourself in the foot. \n8. **You will miss out on dividends:** This might be the dumbest of them all. When I'm collecting 1-4% weekly, do you think I give two \\*hits about dividends? We once executed a  daily SPY put at near the market bottom in March that netted over 500% annualized. And you're bringing up *dividends*? \n9. **Taxes:** So you have to pay taxes on money you make. Would you rather not make money? Okay then what are we talking about? Also, you can use your IRA if you have enough in there. Enough said. \n\nHere's a brief overview of the strategy. You pick stocks you really like, and then you check earnings each week. Do a good balance of quality stocks and quality stocks reporting earnings, since the premiums are huge. \n\n1. You sell WEEKLY ATM calls or cash secured puts. If you're a little twitchy about the market, sell puts a little further out of the money. Let's say you sell 15 contracts. Two of them dip. You've made 3-4% in a week, so just sell cheaper calls at a strike equal to the cost of the shares. Now you can do it all over again with the shares that got assigned (or didn't if the price was flat or you sold a put). You might make slightly less this week, but with the constant gains, 1-4% per week is going to constantly increase.\n2. Now, for the stocks that you're stuck with, get creative--but be PATIENT. I recently wrote a put on BAC at 28.50. Not my best move, but now I'm waiting, looking to sell longer dated calls. \"Wait, but you just told us to do weeklies.\" With the stocks that are down, not necessarily. That's the beauty of the strategy. If you go long on BAC at 28.50 and don't sell anything, you're shit out of luck until it recovers. At least you can sell a call. Every day I look at what a 28 call with a month to expiration would net me. \"Wait, but you said to write only at the price you bought it at.\" Well, I've already made $50 on the stock, and plus, I don't think it's going to fully recover in a month. Now it's at 26.11, and I can start looking at decent premiums. If they get taken away, fine, I broke even on that one. But for every time that happens, far more often I'll be down on a stock for long enough that I sell enough calls to still make a decent 1-30% annualized profit by the time it's called away. \n3. As for choosing stocks, go with what's good. It's as simple as that. Would you buy Apple? Starbucks? eBay? Verizon? Great, then if it's a good time, such as earnings season or the stock is at a discount, go ahead with it. I like to look at the 52 week highs. It's great to buy stocks at a discount, ESPECIALLY when you've written on that stock before. I can't tell you how many contracts we've written on Apple. It's near a thousand by now. Same with NVDA and Netflix. We're aggressive, because we're emotionless. As I said before, volatility means absolutely nothing when writing options. It's your emotions. If NVDA drops 20%, fine, I don't care. It's a great stock, and at least I collected a premium. I'd happily go long NVDA, and in that case I wouldn't be making anything. I can't tell you how many times we've bought these stocks at discounts because you fools make the price fluctuate. Probably 30% of our profits are riding stocks back up and past where they were, then writing on them again when they fall again.   \nAs for choosing stocks with earnings coming out, the rules are no different; don't write a put on Nikola because the premiums are fat. I.e. don't be an idiot. But it's also about the price. My worst move ever was writing a put on WORK before the past earnings release. I like Slack, it's early but I think they're doing big things. But I sold the put during a run-up prior to earnings. Stupid. Now I'm holding the bag. HOWEVER, as proof of how great this strat is, though I sold the put at 38 strike, I'm writing long dated calls at 32. Why? Because I've already made over $600 writing on that stock. I literally can't lose. Same with Marriott. I wrote so many puts that, after writing one at 111, I could write at less than 90 and still come out even. I won't, because I know it's going to pump after the vaccine announcement, and it's still incredibly undervalued, but again, just another example of how even the losers turn out to be winners if you just run the numbers.\n4. Speaking of running the numbers, it all comes down to math. You write down the price you bought at and/or the strike you sold at. You write down the premium. Then you write down the profit and add to the premium (the difference between the price you bought and the call strike). Recently, I wrote a TMUS put at 108 prior to earnings. It pumped to 116 after--but I made $275. Do you think I give a poop what I 'missed out on' when I just made over 2.5% in one week? Multiple that by 52 weeks and what do you get? And yes, this is consistently reached. Last week we made nearly $8,000. Last month--over $30,000. \n\nMy father and I worked on a $170,000 account starting in late September of 2019. That was only about 15-20% of his portfolio, so he has a lot more than me obviously. It's now almost at 500k. In less than 10 months. This isn't a joke. People laugh at us, tell us we're lying. Could care less. Money is pouring out of our eyeballs. We did this before we even got TDA to let us sell cash secured puts (you have to ask, which is dumb). Once that started, late March was just a deluge of cash. SPY dailies were hundreds of percent annualized. \n\nI wrote this post because I'm thinking about writing a book on this strategy. It's hard though because a) people need to not believe you when you've found out how to do something that's been in front of their face the entire time, and b) as I said, a lot of it is about temperament. If you're the type that would've sold everything in March just because it was bottoming out, you shouldn't even be in the market in the first place. But more so, if you can't handle volatility, uncertainty, and can't be faithful to a plan and trust that the same things that have happened in the market since its inception will continue to happen--i.e. stocks will rise and fall, but mainly they will rise--then you can't execute this strategy. \n\nIf you fall into either camp, a) or b), I couldn't care less. If you don't believe me or need to ridicule me because it helps you feel better about your assumptions, I will still have all of the money we've made. But I'm trying desperately to tell people about this, because I do think it can help give people an opportunity to get a little more out of their portfolio, add some aggressive growth to balance out the long term gains. \n\nOne final note. I started with $45,500 this year, and am now up to about $62,000. I've added a couple grand from work, but other than that, it's just gains. However, most of that is just the investment choices I made. I can't stress enough that this strategy requires a large amount of capital. $100,000 really is a baseline, and even then I think you're a little less flexible than you ought to be. You need to be able to ride out four or five stocks that have dipped, so that you can still write ten or twenty new contracts every week and maintain the cash flow stream. I've pretty much reduced my options strategy for my account to one or two stocks a week. In fact, I might just go back to focusing solely on my dad's account until I have a lot more money to play with. \n\nOkay all, that's my bit. I needed to get that off my chest because I'm really sick of people spreading lies, myths, and generally not understanding the power of this strategy. More than that, I'm sick of the people who refuse to believe me, as if I need to make up some lie about my investing prowess on reddit. I wouldn't be the first to do that, but it's beside the point; it boggles my mind how many people will deny themselves success solely to console their ego. Just as I said about being emotionless, if you can't put money above your need to be 'right,' you're not going to last long in this business.",

        "selftext": "# Introduction\n\n(Tl;Dr Below)\n\nMultiple sources indicate that Soft Bank is interested in selling ARM Holdings, which they acquired for $32bn. Nvidia is the company indicated to buy ARM. \\[1\\]\n\nHere is why this will happen.\n\nIf we assume Soft Bank does want to sell ARM, who are the potential buyers? ARM Chips power 95% of mobile devices \\[2\\], so naturally, the big mobile device manufacturers (Apple, Samsung, Huawei... ) would have an interest in securing ARM's technologies. The problem for them is that such an acquisition would be a regulatory nightmare; any serious competitor's phone is powered by ARM - upon acquisition the acquiring company will have zero competitors to point to when asked: \"Do you control all the market, mate?\". The above effectively rules out anyone competing in the mobile phone market. Nvidia, however, remains.\n\n# What does Nvidia want?\n\nAccording to Nvidia's CFO Commentary, 50.5% of revenue in the fiscal year 2020 came from \"gaming\" - that is the selling and licensing of graphic processing units \\[3\\]. Two things to note from that: Firstly, Nvidia will want to desperately diversify their income and, secondly, Nvidia will struggle to achieve much year-on-year growth in the gaming market, as they are already dominating with 73.5% of steam users (A video game platform) using an Nvidia card \\[4\\].\n\n# What market(s) does Nvidia want to grow and diversify into?\n\nNvidia's next big market is high-performance computing. In the fiscal year 2020 \"data centre\" accounted for 27.3% of revenue \\[3\\], so Nvidia is already in this market. That this market is a focus for Nvidia can be seen in their acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, which designs networking equipment used in data centres. Their core product, GPUs, is also well suited with ever more scientific computing, technical computing, and general data processing algorithms running primarily on GPUs.\n\nNvidia is also interested in mobile-computing and GPU applications used in-game consoles (Nintendo Switch) as-well-as automotive applications. (Automotive making 6.41% of revenue in FY20 \\[3\\])\n\n# How does ARM help Nvidia in their wants?\n\nIn data centres ARM is well suited for being the primary CPU architecture used, due to the architecture's much better energy efficiency of x86. Nvidia already powers many of the most energy-efficient supercomputers and the ARM architecture can play an important role to further this. Energy efficiency is super important, as cooling and power consumption make a combined 71% of facilities cost \\[5\\].\n\nAs mentioned above, ARM powers 95% of mobile devices, so the engineering expertise will be of much use to Nvidia, if they want to develop in the automotive industries.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nNvidia has shown keen interest in developing markets in which ARM's technology expertise will be very useful. Nvidia also doesn't run into the same regulatory problems someone like Apple might, as their core product and competitors core product do not directly rely on ARM technologies. \n\nWith ARM under their belt, Nvidia will be one of the most technologically advanced chip designers and will start winning (more) in high-performance compute and mobile processing.\n\n**Tl;Dr:**\n\n**Nvidia will buy ARM from SoftBank, and thereby become one of the most advanced chip designers. Nvidia to the moon.**\n\n# Sources\n\n\\[1\\] \"NVIDIA Considers Arm Acquisition In A Deal That Could Upend The Chip Industry\", Forbes,\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2020/07/23/nvidia-considers-arm-acquisition-in-a-deal-that-could-upend-the-chip-industry/#54b895605742](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2020/07/23/nvidia-considers-arm-acquisition-in-a-deal-that-could-upend-the-chip-industry/#54b895605742)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2\\] \"SoftBank Group Corp.

        "selftext": "These times feel uneasy,  but this report will make you feel good. Here is some actual positive economic data to prove we are going up. There are many signs of growth in the underlying economy to justify today's valuations. One of the more important indicators, being the manufacturing index, was released this morning. \n\nYou can find the full report here:\n\n[https://www.markiteconomics.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/b8fe1953311a43c795488641e8b75bb7](https://www.markiteconomics.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/b8fe1953311a43c795488641e8b75bb7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKey findings:\n\n* Flash U.S. Composite Output Index at 54.7(50.3 in July).18-month high.\n* Flash U.S. Services Business  Activity  Index  at 54.8 (50.0 in July). 17-month high.\n* Flash U.S. Manufacturing  PMI  at 53.6 (50.9 in July). 19-month high.\n* Flash U.S. Manufacturing  Output  Index  at 53.9(51.7 in July).19-month high.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;U.S. private sector firms signalled a strong upturn in business activity in August, with both manufacturers and   service   providers registering expansions. Notably,  it  marked the first  rise  in service  sector activity  since  the  start  of  the  year, while goods manufacturers recorded the   fastest   increase   in production since January 2019. Adjusted for seasonal factors, the IHS Markit Flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index posted 54.7 in August, up from 50.3 at the start of the third quarter and    signalled a    strong increase    in    output. Moreover,  it marked the  sharpest  upturn  in private sector business activity since February 2019.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Driving  the  overall upturn in output  was  stronger client demand. Total new business rose for the first time    since    February and    at    a    solid    rate. Manufacturing firms registered a steeper expansion in  new  order  in flows than  in  July, while service providers signalled a  renewed increase  in sales. Companies  commonly  stated  that  new  business growth  stemmed  from  increased marketing  efforts and   the   resumption   of   client operations.   The reopening  of  economies worldwide also  helped to boost new   export   orders, with foreign   sales expanding at  the sharpest pace since  September 2014. Meanwhile, increased pressure on capacity and an associated upturn  in  outstanding  business  led  to a further expansion   of   workforce   numbers   across private  sector  firms  in  August.  The  rate  of job creation accelerated  among  service  providers,  with manufacturers   indicating   the   first   rise   in   staff numbers since February.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased on this report, I would expect unemployment claims to drop next week and continue dropping. I would also expect the continued claims to decrease, and as they literally  said in the report - I would expect more new jobs to be posted. The numbers is in this report indicate we will rapidly return to our previous baseline from a manufacturing stand point, and likely surpass it. Obviously, the industrial sector and related industries are going to get a boost in the markets.\n\nAll this happy stuff aside, do not forget the debt it took to produce this will weigh heavily on the dollar and financial balance sheets for some time. This fact will be used to instill fear in investors. I fully expect ass-hat investment bankers and hedge fund managers to continue publishing the same fear mongering bullshit they do to try to induce a panic sell-off so they can buy in cheaper. JPM, WF, GS, and all other hedge funds literally spread fear in an attempt to drive prices down so they can buy in: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI)\n\nThis same perspective - that we are rapidly recovering - was also reiterated by the Fed in their FOMC minutes earlier this week (skip to the economic section): [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20200729.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20200729.htm). The Feds were astonished so see such a swift rate of recovery, but do acknowledge we have recovered about 1/3 of the payroll lost thus far and that they do need to continue their BRRR efforts as needed to ensure this recovery continues. We are on track to be \"recovered\" in a few quarters. Keep in mind the Feds wrote this report without access or knowledge of the manufacturing index report released this morning. \n\nOne final \"fuck you bears\" is that a lot of the recent growth and recovery happened in spite of the BRRR. The feds balance sheet was reduced by 200 billion:\n\n&gt;In light of improved conditions across these markets, the Federal  Reserve's balance sheet declined over the intermeeting period from $7.2  trillion to $7.0 trillion. The decline was driven by the reductions in  repo and U.S. dollar liquidity swaps outstanding. These reductions more  than offset ongoing purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf there is a pull back, buy that shit. We are not \"crashing\", or \"tanking\", we are going up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: suck it bears, buy calls, buy stocks.\n\nPositions: I own stock in AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, ARKF, VTI, VUG, QQQ, and I'm eyeing some calls for Monday (no specifics yet). I also like doggy style and anal.",

        "selftext": "I wrote this shit up to rake in some \u20acuropoors so I could feed my cat just to realize you can't instantly publish random shit on Seeking Alpha (the site did the best to cause that impression) so here we go:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nFollowing a series of either positive (Ampere) or at least interesting (ARM) news, NVIDIA's stock has run as hot as it can possibly get over the past few weeks, almost climbing as high as $500 a share.  NVIDIA will report their earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 today after the bell. This report will define whether or not the very ambitious valuation of NVIDIA is - for now - justified or not. Let's attempt an educated guess at the numbers they're going to report tonight.\n\n**Data Center - $1900M**\n\nThe data center segment has been the major growth driver for NVIDIA since late 2016. Back then, they reported $240M revenue for Q3 of fiscal 2017. This boosted the stock by 50% in a matter of weeks. Since then this segment has been under close observation by analysts and NVIDIA has been aggressively growing it as much as they can. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang is saying that data center is now a $100B market and expects it to grow to $1T in the coming years. Last quarter NVIDIA reported a record $1,141M data center revenue. Their new superstar AI-accelaretor, the A100, already contributed to that quarter, yet it was still very new to the market. According to their last report the A100 will have solid visibility in Q2. Almost more importantly, starting\u00a0with Q2, data center will incorporate Mellanox revenue, which was\u00a0$429M last quarter. This means that had Mellanox revenue already been included last quarter, NVIDIA's data center revenue would already have surpassed their revenue from gaming. [In a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY61ExKhnfA) NVIDIA demonstrated the construction of Selene, the world's 7th fastest supercomputer. [Their A100 dominated AI benchmarking against competitors.](https://siliconangle.com/2020/07/29/nvidia-sets-16-new-performance-records-latest-mlperf-ai-benchmarks/)\u00a0The strength of the A100 combined with the inclusion of Mellanox' revenue should skyrocket their revenue from data center up to almost $2B.\n\n**Gaming - $1600M**\n\nThis quarter will be the last one of the Turing generation. You'd think that consumers would be aware of that fact and that they'd be reluctant to buy any hardware that will be obsolete within weeks. Yet demand for Turing cards, fueled by covid, has been very strong. Despite the release of NVIDIA's next high end card being a matter of weeks if not days, people are still buying used (!) 2080 tis for $1000 and above. The 2070 super ($500-600) has seen high demand and competitor AMD has not managed to make much of a dent in NVIDIA's revenue. Buyers of the RX 5700 XT reported serious driver problems, further confirming NVIDIA as the brand you go for if you want things to \"just work\". Moreover, NVIDIA has built 2 more USPs in DLSS 2.0 (AI upscaling) and RTX Voice (AI noise cancelling) in this quarter to which competition has no answer yet. Consumers describe these features as \"black magic\" and the premium for RTX cards is finally being accepted. Big graphic intense game releases such as Microsoft's Flight Simulator and Cyberpunk 2077 (delayed but upcoming) further helped demand for gaming GPUs. In Q2 of FY 2020 NVIDIA reported\u00a0$1,313M revenue from gaming, a number they should handily beat this quarter.\n\n**Automotive - $120M**\n\nLast quarter, revenue from automotive came it at $155 million which was the lowest number since quite a few quarters. NVIDIA is by no means giving up this segment, they are determined to becoming a major player in the self driving car revolution. In June, they announced a close partnership with Daimler. Starting 2024 [every single next-gen Mercedes-Benz](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/06/23/mercedes-benz-nvidia-software-defined-vehicles/) vehicle will include hardware and software from NVIDIA. While this is a great outlook, it does not help the upcoming earnings release a lot. Due to covid, NVIDIA expects revenue from the automotive segment to decline by 50%. The recent success of Tesla is helping NVIDIA in this sector, as Tesla has successfully been applying pressure on the \"dinosaurs\" of the car industry. As Tesla is building their own hardware and software for their autopilot, traditional car makers have fallen too far behind to catch up in time and have to rely on partners like NVIDIA to survive.\n\n**Professional Visualization - $340M**\n\nRelative to the rest of NVIDIA's business, ProViz has been growing very slowly, but yet steadily. What speaks against strong numbers from their ProViz business is that Turing is on it's way out. The same was the case 2 years ago with Pascal and yet NVIDIA reported a solid $281M revenue in this segment. Combine this with the fact that covid has been boosting demand due to heavily increased home office working, a solid increase in revenue can be expected.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThese guesses add up to a revenue of close to $4B. NVIDIA's guidance for this quarter was $3.65B. If this attempt at a guess of NVIDIA's revenue ends up being correct, the stock's current valuation would gain strong support. There are more factors that could come into play tonight. Play close attention to any of the following:\n\n* Any information regarding a potential purchase of ARM from SoftBank\n* Guidance for H2 data center revenue\n* A potential announcement of a stock split",

So if I can get loan cheaper, it could be in 1 year or 1.5 year..\n\nI know, market can go sideways or downhill. But what other reasons do you see that should discourage me from getting a loan?",

I decided I'd just let what I had left in those accounts be, then just take what I can save from my paychecks and DCA my way into SP500..Naturally I got bored, and started doing some nice DD/TA and turned roughly 6k into 18k with things like BA, TSLA, SQ, BABA, NVDA, nice trades. Then being the good autist that I am.. and getting greedy.. I decided let me yolo everything into NVDA 460 9/18 calls last Friday because TD Ameritrade had the earnings date as this Wednesday the 12th. Plan was I'm gonna ride this sure bet up until earnings and turn that 18k into a nice 25k in 3 days. NVDA was like 448 at the time or something. Of course I didn't do a quick Google search to verify.. cause earnings are actually 9/19. Now NVDA closed at like 433 and there is TA pointing towards 426.. my calls are in the shitter I'm down like 3.5k in these 3 days that I was supposed to be at 25k by.. and it's hurting my stomach making me have crazy thoughts like standing up to my wife's boyfriend.

        "selftext": "Hi all! I am a 29M and still in school pursuing a PhD in the USA. I have no student loans/cc debt etc.  I am living off a stipend, but I manage to put aside $600 each month to invest. I just started investing a couple of months ago and since I am not confident about what I am doing, I opened two brokerage accounts, one with Robinhood and the other with Chase. The Chase account is an \u201caggressive\u201d (meaning approx. 90% stocks) portfolio account, in which the bank handles my entire portfolio and I simply put money in it every month. The RH account is, of course, handled by me. My idea is to continue this for a year or two and ultimately consolidate all my money into one account and close the other one, depending on which performs better. \n\nIn my RH account I have/planning to have the following stocks:\n\n**Technology:** GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, FB, AMZN, BABA, INTC, TSM, QCOM, NVDA\n\n**Finance:**  BAC, JPM, PYPL, BRK.B, V, AXP, C\n\n**Communications:** T, VZ\n\n**Consumer Discretionary:** PG, MCD, WMT, DIS, KO\n\n**Industrial:** BA, LMT, DAL, AER\n\n**Healthcare:** JNJ, UNH\n\nI do not plan to invest in ETFs as of now since I am young and able to take risks. Out of the $600 I am investing each month, $300 goes to my Chase investment account and $300 goes to my RH account. I am planning to DCA by investing an equal amount in each of the stock I own in RH, so I would like to own no more than 30 stocks, preferably 25.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1) Is my strategy of having an RH account and another investing account with Chase a good one? Or should I just stick to one or the other from the get-go? Will having two investment accounts be an issue when I file my taxes?\n\n2) Does my portfolio look good? Am I well / over-diversified? Am I missing some obvious sectors? I think I might end up with way too many similar companies e.g. INTC, TSM, QCOM, and NVDA which is not really diversification. Maybe I should just pick one out of all such companies?\n\nAny other advice/comments about my portfolio are welcome. TIA!",

        "selftext": "There was a lot of speculation and anticipation for NVDA's earnings report today as it seems a lot of people thought it might not be good, or at least good enough to cover for their fast and steady ascent over the last few months. However from what I can tell it is exceedingly positive, beat expectations and their data center revenue topped gaming revenue for the first time ever. \n\nI was surprised to see the stock down ~1.5% after hours, but then again I'm new to investing and I have no idea how after hours stuff works. In any case, what are your guys' thoughts? I'm really interested to see where they go in the near future (or how they open tomorrow for that matter). I'm quite optimistic for them, I'll definitely be holding on to my two measly shares haha.",

        "selftext": "Just wondering.\n\nI started trading in February with 50k. I upped it to 100k after feeling like i knew what i was doing.  \n6-7 months later, i'm at 200k. I was wondering whether this is a success story or normal. I've done over several hundred of trades to reach this point.\n\nI thought i'd share this in case it helps anyone and also for gloating purposes. Also open to advice from more experienced people. See below what i've done to reach 100% return in 7 months.\n\n**How i pick a stock**\n\n* I look for opportunities by researching online news, reddits, i do my own technical analysis, i follow 1-2 people on tradingview who's ideas are most of the time accurate etc.\n\n**How often do i trade?**\n\n* Every few days. During non hype or Earnings/Dividend periods, i'll typically buy on one day and sell the next with \\~2-5% profit. Rarely, i'll catch a 10% pump on an individual stock.\n\n**How many stocks am i invested in at any given time?**\n\n* Usually 2. Rarely when i'm very sure that a stock will do well, i'll go 70%-100% yolo on it. \n\n**Strategy?**\n\n* The reason why i keep a small amount of stocks in my portfolio is so that i can more easily monitor/guesstimate the market sentiment. \n* I have plenty of price alerts on the stocks i monitor. If one drops by a bit, i quickly open up tradingview and see what various indicators like the RSI or F1 Ducks (as well as a few others) to see how far off my own technical analysis is. This is typically enough to tell me whether i should hold or sell and it's served me well just moments before big selloffs where I've lost only 2% instead of 8% for example.\n* During non dividend/earnings or release periods, when there's nothing special going on for a stock and it's stagnant, i'll take profits at +2-5%. During special periods, i'll take profits at 5-11%, sell and rebuy what are usually minor dips before the next pump. This means buying on one day and selling the next. Sometimes i have to use a day trade to lock in max profits.\n\n**Most traded stocks**\n\n* **AMD.** Corona AMD Q1 was easy to trade as if you did a basic technical analysis, you'd see that its very cyclical and you can easily tell where to buy in and where to exit. The Q2 earnings period was a no brainer for me. Corona bulged up the datacenter market due to computing needs. I run a video web conferencing platform similar to zoom and we grew 1300% during corona. We had to increase our datacenter capacity similarly. Near the end of Q2 is where the platform fell to 400% usage and we stopped renting many of our servers. This tells me Q3 for AMD will be normal. Stocks like Zoom will have to drop a bit. This stock made me plenty of money.\n* **TSMC.** Only traded it a few times recently when it was going up. Made me plenty of money.\n* **GOOGL.** Traded it during corona when it was at it's lows. Made me plenty of money.\n* **MSFT.** Only traded it a few times recently when it was going up. Made me decent money.\n* **NIO.** Only traded it a few times recently when it was going up. Made me money.\n* **Sutter Rock Capital.** I trade it every now and then. Made me money. Has weird +10% days.\n* **UPS.** Traded it during Corona. Made me money.\n* **Nvidia.** I trade it every now and then. Made me decent money.\n* **MGM.** Traded it during Corona. Made me money.\n* Plenty more...\n\n**Stocks i lost money on**\n\n* United States Steel. Would buy again, but to make any profit i'd need to wait several years.\n* Embraer. Would buy again at it's current price, but i'd need to wait several years for a good return. \\~400% within the decade is what i expect.\n* TherapeuticsMD\n* Nbev, Ambev. Trash, never buy these. Nbev specifically had a repeating pattern of spiking by +1300% every 2 years that was supposed to repeat this year 2020, but didn't. Was the only reason i bought it. Beyond this, it's a very mediocre penny stock. I watched one of the live earnings broadcasts, sounded like they were run by a bunch of headless chickens.\n* Constellation Brands. (Corona Beer)\n\n**What i'm currently trading**\n\nNvidia. I'm all in on Nvidia. I expect 518 by the \\~10th of September. After that, i'm looking for a good entry point on AMD which should correct itself a bit within the next 30 days as there's no more momentum by AMD right now to excuse consolidation at the 85 dollar price. Once i buy all in on AMD at a good price, i plan to leave it till the end of the year for what could be 20% profit.",

Because AMD has made great inroads in graphic cards and well-priced GPUs. But unlike NVIDIA, AMD has been chosen for MSFT and Sony's consoles, resulting in the likely 39% [predicted growth](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/24/1-big-reason-to-choose-amd-stock-over-nvidia/) in sales in 2020 alone.\n\nThat means, likely, the new cycles are going to leave AMD continuing to make significant gains with NVIDIA trailing.

        "selftext": "What's up fellow reddit dwellers,\n\nBackground story: I made it big with COSTCO after almost losing it all. Check out my previous gain post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ho75vr/40000\\_to\\_128000\\_thanks\\_wsb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ho75vr/40000_to_128000_thanks_wsb/)   \n\n\nThen I told myself I'd stop but found myself back at it and I almost lost it all again on AMZN, TSLA meme stocks. Then I went back to what I know best which is COSTCO and I hit jackpot.\n\nLesson learned: these are some golden advice\n\n1. Stop trading between 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM. \n2. Set a exit price or time and stick to it instead of being influenced by random price movements leading up to it.   \n\\- I had 225 call options on COSTCO and I kept selling half and then half and then half before the sales report came out so I left out more than 200k on the table.\n3. At the end of the day, it is gambling. Luck has to play in your favor. You can bet wisely but if you play long enough, you will end up losing it all. After you win big, liquidate your positions and take a step back, and get back into it in a few or two after you've observed the market without any pressure. If you win big like me, then just stop options and buy APPL, BA, NVDA, AMZN and sit back and let your money do work.\n\nThere are so many young people in their 20s that are YOLOing on meme stocks during this time. If you've made 2 year's worth of salary in 2 weeks of trading, don't let that change your life and values. \n\nI'm 28 and a CPA by profession with stable but modest salary. This account is my dad's IRA and I probably won't get to see any of this. I could if I wanted to but I'm not going to buy a lamborghini (used). I'll probably have a nice celebratory dinner with family and donate some money to my company which is a non-profit. \n\nStop at the top like Jordan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vczb4k54ef51.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=759e771a653b8e80ee2bf1227156995bfeb4795d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ezksuni4ef51.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f41cbf03b1cc0f2dd6a605f5a91aa89667586de2",

        "selftext": "Ok, so you know how Apple has been mooning on news of the iPhone 12, and ARM MacBooks, which has totally screwed over INTC and made TSM and other suppliers to AAPL moon?\n\n(Here's the background info in case you missed the news [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS52JigV1CY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS52JigV1CY))\n\nApple was actually approached by Softbank to buy ARM but they couldn't due to ARM licensing stuff out to competitors as well, and Apple obviously has a very private philosophy too so that wouldn't work. But, they will continue to use chipsets based on ARM's architecture for the future macbooks/iphones as well ([https://wccftech.com/apple-shows-disinterest-in-buying-arm-from-softbank/](https://wccftech.com/apple-shows-disinterest-in-buying-arm-from-softbank/)). But if you just follow the money, and try to find out who actually will OWN ARM, the offer has come from none other than Nvidia, and the deal to buy ARM is all but confirmed. (seeck ingalpha.com/article/4370499-chippening-part-2-nvidia-reaches-for-outstretched-arm). And I'm sure that most of you are aware of how AAPL is trying to expand its reach into countries like India for the first time offering first-party stores and an online store, etc. This will only increase their sales numbers, and Apple will only get more bullet proof from hereon. The real story here, is in NVDA.\n\nWhen they do end up buying ARM, the merger will either be seen as A.) a value destroying buy that wasn't worth it or B.) A merger of epic proportions that inserts Nvidia into the mobile and CPU market \"Apple recently indicated it would change their use of Intel chips in Mac computers to custom made ARM-based chips. This is likely due to the desire to include a touch screen and also due to the general efficiency of the design as well as ARM's licensing of its IP to Apple. This could be the start of a major transition for chip usage among desktop computers. Moreover, this technology appears to be competitive for use in data-centers markets.\n\nNVIDIA is not currently a major competitor in the smartphone and tablet business, so acquiring ARM would expand it into new realms where ARM happens to dominate. NVIDIA did previously attempt to compete in this business, but its Tegra chips never got much market share.\"\n\nMost of you already know how durable Nvidia is, but for those of you that don't I'll leave you with these too: Nvidia's R&amp;D expense/gross profit is surprisingly low due to multiple income streams, and although it is increasing (as expected) we can expect gross profits to massively increase too with the world's largest company as its customer. Their Cash per share has grown insanely :\n\nCash Per Share ratio has gone up from 2 to 17.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd they have low long term debt that has barely increased, but their assets have remarkably increased, which means a low lt debt/asset ratio, just showing you how much of a powerhouse NVDA is.\n\nLT debt/total assets has decreased, total long term debt hasn't increased since last year\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot only that, but along with decreasing/flatlining long term debt, they have a negative cash conversion cycle, which greatly reduces opex. Financially, this is only the beginning of their buildup. Aside from just solid financials for such a revolutionary company, they have revolutionary products. Their cloud services and acquisition of Mellanox will only expand their bases. Nvidia has a vision, and it may be very far-out and hard to accomplish or it may be the most genius thing I've ever seen. I'm not sure how long this'll take to work itself out, but I wouldn't fear buying March 2021 740 calls.\n\nTl;dr NVDA LEAPS or shares",

        "selftext": "You\u2019ve probably seen a rising trend of bullish posts about Nvidia recently, whether it\u2019s about recent acquisitions being included in revenue, its management, or the semiconductor industry in general.\n\nYesterday, Evening Standard reported that $NVDA has locked in a takeover of Arm Ltd. from SoftBank for a reported 40 billion.\n\nThe reason this is important is that Arm owns instructions-set architectures (ISAs) for the chips within nearly every smartphone, along with a handful of other products. Usually, this isn\u2019t an issue, since SoftBank would sell the rights to produce these chips to Apple, Qualcomm, and others for a fee. \n\n$NVDA, unlike SoftBank, is an actual semiconductor company. They could potentially limit access to their ISAs so that $NVDA can become the sole producer of those chips. Or, due to SoftBank being in the sinosphere and $NVDA being American, potential tensions could arise from the recent economic sanctions.\n\nEither way, considering that the deal is essentially locked in, $NVDA is flying straight to tendie town. Arm is a powerful player in the semiconductor industry, and its acquisition by $NVDA demonstrates that the company is making big moves to become more prevalent. $NVDA could theoretically lockdown a subsector of the semiconductor market by restricting access to chips under Arm\u2019s ISA. And if the Don requests $NVDA restrict Chinese access to the ISAs, you can bet that it will get a fucking BOATLOAD of government subsidies.\n\nTL;DR $NVDA 520c 9/18",

        "selftext": "Alright guys so I'm one of the hosts on a YouTube channel named \"Max Tech\".  \nI previously did YouTube work for the channel \"Appleinsider\" since 2016, making videos on Apple products which include Mac computers with Intel chips. \n\nI also grew up playing video games and building custom PCs right when AMD started to release six-core and 8-core processors that were cheaper than Intel CPUs and targeted towards gamers.  \n\nEven though the Intel chips were better for gaming, I still bought AMD because they were cheaper. Intel maintained the lead for many years since games really only used 4 cores, and Intel chips gave more consistent frame rates for gaming.\n\nAt one point, it was clear to me and to everyone else that Intel was intentionally holding off from innovating and improving their performance because they already owned a bulk of the market share. They realized that they could make more profit by making small improvements every year, while AMD was busting their ass trying to figure out how they can compete. (it was ultimately the gaming and custom PC market) \n\nMeanwhile.. Apple was using Intel chips quite successfully in their Mac computers the like MacBooks and iMacs. And Apple was also using their XEON chips for their higher-end machines. And of course, Intel was killing it in the server market.\n\nNow in 2013, Intel announced that they were working on their new 10nm chip process and that it should be ready to launch in 2015, and they said their 7nm chips should launch in 2017. \n\nBack to Intel, over the new few years, Intel delayed 10nm to 2016... and then to 2017.. and then to late 2019... We are now in 2020 and Intel is still shipping 14+++++ nm chips for high-end machines like the 2020 5K Apple iMac that was just released yesterday. Only laptops are getting the actual 10nm chips right now. \n\nIn 2017, AMD shocked the world by announcing their new Ryzen chips, and then also their Threadripper chips, and ever since then, they've been quickly catching up to Intel in terms of both performance and price. \n\nBecause of this, Intel instantly started lowering the price of their chips, and in 2018, they finally made 6-core chips for the MacBook Pro. 8-core chips in 2019, and now 10-core chips in 2020. This is an obvious and desperate move to try and compete with AMD. \n\nBecause Intel's 10nm chips were not ready in 2015 or 2016, Apple's redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro which was thinner than ever before, had overheating issues. The overheating was severe in 2018 with the 6-core chips that Intel made in fear of AMD. \n\nThere were even leaked emails from Intel executives worried about AMD's price to performance beating out Intel. \n\nAnd right now, it is well known that AMD is making BETTER price-to-performance x86 chips. \n\nThe MOST important part of this discussion is that the tech community as a whole, including or YouTube and Reddit, are now convinced that AMD is the way to go. I've seen countless comments on my videos that are dissing on Intel chips and wishing that Apple would switch to using Intel. \n\nIf we make a build guide video using an Intel processor, we get shamed and called dumb for not using an AMD chip. Our Mac Pro videos got a ton of negative feedback because Apple is stupid for using Intel chips. Our 2020 MacBook Pro videos were getting comments dissing on Intel's 10th-gen chips. The entire community is starting to hate Intel and preferring AMD.  \n\nAMD stock has increased over 11x since they announced the first Ryzen chips in August of 2016.  \nIntel stock has only increased 38% since that same date. \n\nAnd looking towards the future.. Intel has recently delayed their 7nm chips until late 2022 or 2023. This caused their stock price to tank at they last earnings call. \n\nThere's even now a class-action lawsuit against Intel because of this delay. \n\nThis also caused their chief of chip engineering to resign, and they reorganized their entire chip team. \n\nThey've even discussed outsourcing their future 6nm, 5nm and 3nm chip production to their rival foundry TSMC because they've lost confidence in their own foundry. \n\nSo it's clear that Intel is getting killed by AMD with each passing year, and the tech community knows it. (Which is VERY important)   \n\n\nThis brings us into the Apple and TSMC portion of this DD.   \n\n\nBack in 2013, Apple announced their A7 chip for their iPhone 5s, the first 64 bit smartphone chip, and ever since then, there was a massive performance war between Apple and Qualcomm, fighting to create the fastest smartphone chips, in which Apple ultimately won. \n\n(The A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro is still much faster than the Snapdragon 865+ which was just recently released this year) \n\nStuck in the middle of this battle was TSMC, which has been the EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Apple Silicon chips for their iPhones and iPads since the A10 chip in 2016. \n\nAnd in 2018, Apple released their 11\" iPad Pro with the A12X chip manufactured by TSMC's 7nm process. This iPad from 2 years ago is so powerful that it still outperforms the new 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with Intel's 10th gen chip in both processor AND graphics performance. \n\nNow, Apple is about to announce their iPhone 12 in about a month that's gonna pack the A14 chip which is being built on TSMC's brand new 5nm process. \n\nAnd of course, the next iPad Pro will get a much improved A14X 5nm chip, and it's the same story for the Apple Silicon Mac chips that will start being released later this year in October/November. \n\nI'm of course, talking about Apple finally ditching Intel and moving forward with their own chips. This makes sense for Apple for various different reasons.\n\n1: They can run iPhone &amp; iPad apps on their Macs.\n\n2: They control both the software and hardware for incredibly amounts of performance optimization.\n\n3: They can make sure every new Mac update gets a new chip with performance improvements instead of relying on Intel to release improved chips. \n\n4: This is of course, much cheaper for Apple since they don't have to pay Intel the high price of their chips. \n\n5: They don't have to deal with overheating issues since most Intel chips are still on 14nm technology, therefore running very hot and using a lot of power.   \n\n\nAnd there's a good chance that the very first Apple Silicon Mac chips are gonna outperform the current Intel chips, stay much cooler and give you much better battery life. \n\nJust to give you some perspective in terms of how Intel's 10nm compares to TSMC's 5nm..\n\nIntel 10nm transistor density: around 100 million transistors per square millimeter.\n\nTSMC 5nm transistor density: around 171 million transistors per square millimeter. \n\n  \nTSMC has already confirmed that they're working on risk production of their new 3nm process in 2021,  with those chips going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\nSo here's what the future looks like:\n\n  \nIntel 7nm in late 2022/2023 : 240 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nTSMC 3nm shipping in 2022 Apple products: 290 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nAnd apparently, TSMC is already working on plans for their 2nm process for 2024.   \n\n\nAnd due to Intel's past, there's a very good chance that Intel could delay 7nm even further, especially since they had to restructure their entire chip team, while TSMC has been on point.   \n\n\nSo the future isn't looking very bright for Intel's chip technology compared to TSMC. No wonder why they wanted to outsource their chips from them.   \n\n\nAnd one last bit on Apple's switch to their own chips built by TSMC. \n\nApple has already given developers their transition kit which is a Mac Mini with an A12Z chip from their iPad Pro. \n\nOne developer tweeted this: \"At this point, I think that the first gen Apple Silicon machines will be faster at running x86 code than an actual x86...\"  \n\n\nWhat he means is that Apple's new Rosetta 2 emulation software is so good that he thinks it'll outperform Intel chips even though it's not running natively for ARM. \n\nSo basically, Apple made the right choice by ditching Intel.   \n\n\nAnd if Apple proves everyone wrong by coming out with incredibly great Macs thanks to their switch to their own Apple Silicon ARM-based chips, then there's a VERY good chance that the rest of the market will follow them and start developing ARM-based chips for laptops.\n\nThis will force Windows to start heavily investing in their ARM-based Windows software. \n\nAnd if you didn't already know.. Intel is FAR behind in the ARM-based chip world.   \n\n\nNow, the most common argument I hear is this: Apple is only a tiny part of Intel's business, and while that may be true.. the MOST important thing is the public's view of Intel.  \n\n\nThe tech community is already starting to despise Intel as a brand name because of their overpriced processors and the fact that AMD is beginning to CRUSH them. \n\nJust wait until Apple Silicon Macs start getting released and people realize that ARM-chips have a ton of potential, and they'll start hating Intel even more. \n\nThis will cause Intel's brand recognition and reputation to get absolutely destroyed in favor of AMD and Apple Silicon. This alone will lead to less market share. And what will happen if Nvidia or Apple buy out ARM? \n\nAnd by the way, there are now more and more ARM-based servers popping up, so there's a good chance that Intel will start to lose market share on the server side if ARM-based servers prove themselves. (They use less power so this makes sense for server farms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is that Intel just got ditched by Apple.. and they're getting killed by AMD and TSMC. ARM is coming VERY quickly and Intel is NOT ready. They have been plagued with delay after delay, and all of this drama will ruin the confidence of their staff, leading to lowered productivity. It's not looking good for Intel for the long-term.  \n\n\nAs of right now, Intel stock is very cheap, and you might make a few bucks if you trade short term.. but I wouldn't hold Intel stock long term.   \n\n\nIf you want more in-depth info with visuals and extra details, you can check out two videos I made on the Max Tech Youtube channel: \n\n\"How Intel Lost the CPU Race..\"\n\n\"Apple Silicon ARM Chips vs Intel x86 Processors for Mac?\"\n\nHopefully you enjoyed this DD.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: Long AMD. AMD will hit $100 by Feb 2021.\n\nSamsung is ditching expensive Qualcom Snapdragon 875 chipset and they will be mounting Exynos 1000 chipset with AMD's RADEON GPU for the new Galaxy s21.\n\nQualcom announced their new Snapdragon 875 chipset to be at least 25% more expensive than previous generation. That is $250 phone manufactures have to pay. Smartphones are becoming more and more expensive, and most of the flagship phones cost around $1k. That price tag is too high for average Joe and this price will go higher as Qualcom increasing their chipset price.\n\nGoogle, Xiaomi, LG are all using Qualcom chipset and they will soon follow what Samsung is doing.\n\nAlso with screens getting bigger, more GPU power is needed. That's where AMD comes in with their affordable GPU. Whether Galaxy s21 success or not, CPU Chipset + GPU will be the new trend in smartphone market, and bet my ass AMD will lead market as the front runner.\n\nsources:\n\n[https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Exynos-1000-with-AMD-Radeon-GPU-rumored-to-feature-only-in-the-Galaxy-S21-Ultra-Exynos-brand-change-being-contemplated-too.483452.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Exynos-1000-with-AMD-Radeon-GPU-rumored-to-feature-only-in-the-Galaxy-S21-Ultra-Exynos-brand-change-being-contemplated-too.483452.0.html)\n\n[https://www.digit.in/news/mobile-phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-875-price-leaked-55100.html](https://www.digit.in/news/mobile-phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-875-price-leaked-55100.html)",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm back from my last DD: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4mgq1/intc\\_why\\_you\\_should\\_not\\_hold\\_intel\\_stock\\_long\\_term/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4mgq1/intc_why_you_should_not_hold_intel_stock_long_term/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)  \n\n\nI'll try and make this one a bit shorter.   \n\n\nVadim Yuryev here from the YouTube channel Max Tech.  \nI've been covering a lot of Apple products and Macs for the last 4 years ever since I started working for Appleinsider. \n\nAs you all know, Apple has recently announced that they're switching to their own custom Apple Silicon Mac chips, which will of course be built exclusively by TSMC on their brand new 5nm process (World's first)\n\nWhat most people don't know is that they've been working toward this transition for many years. For example, in 2017, they dropped 32 bit app support for iOS 11. In 2018, their macOS Mojave forced developers to use their Metal framework (That's why Nvidia cards don't work anymore in eGPUs) In 2019, macOS Catalina dropped support for 32 bit apps.\n\nThese 3 steps are incredibly important to the Apple Silicon Macs coming this Fall because one of the most important features is the ability to run completely unmodified iPhone and iPad apps on day 1, which of course, are 64 bit apps that run using the Metal framework on the current Apple Silicon chips. manufactured by TSMC. \n\nBecause of this, the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon chips is gonna be much more smooth compared to the previous transition from PowerPC to Intel chips. \n\nA major benefit for the future is that app developers can build apps that have most of the code shared across all Apple devices, which minor adjustments to get the UI to scale properly from the Mac, to the iPad, to the iPhone and of course the Apple TV.\n\nAnd a huge benefit will be the ability to fix bugs and optimize code for all platforms at once instead of having to do it all separately since the main code is shared.\n\nAnd unlike the last transition, Rosetta 2 can now translate x86 app code into ARM-supported code during the install time instead of using real-time emulation. And for plugins and drivers, Rosetta 2 emulates them as well.\n\nDevelopers who have been using Apple's Developer Transition Kit with the A12Z chip from the iPad Pro have already mentioned that Rosetta 2 works incredibly well, much better than expected:  \n[https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20](https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/never\\_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20](https://twitter.com/never_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20)\n\nAnd this is with the A12Z chip, which mind you, hasn't changed in terms of processing performance from the A12X chip from 2018. This is also a chip that comes in an iPad Pro that is thinner than any iPhone ever, and has absolutely zero active cooling. \n\nThat chip from 2018 currently outperforms Intel's brand new 10th-gen 10nm chip that came in the 2020 MacBook Pro in terms of both processing and Metal graphics performance.\n\nApple Silicon Macs will of course, have active fan cooling, and Apple has already stated that their Apple Silicon chips for their Macs will be a brand new family of chips, and each Mac will have a chip built specifically for it's enclosure and it's cooling capabilities.\n\nAnd Apple has mentioned that their Silicon has been built for years with easy scalability in mind, so they can add much more cores into the new Mac chips, especially since they'll have active fan cooling. \n\nBecause of the pandemic, Apple's original plans to release a new iPad Pro this Fall with the brand new A14X chip built on TSMC's new 5nm process and a new Mini-LED display were delayed, so that's why the released the 2020 iPad Pro in March, where they basically reused the A12X chip and rebranded it.\n\nSo right now, most investors have no idea how good the A14X is gonna be.\n\nThe A13 chip from last year's iPhones already performs incredibly well in terms of single-core performance, almost neck and neck with Intel's i9-9900K.\n\nThe new A14 chip will be a major improvement, due to being the first chip built on TSMC's 5nm chip.\n\nThere will also be an A14X chip will have a massive improvement over the current A12Z chip, and let me remind you that it will be in an iPad Pro that's thin and passively cooled.\n\nThis same 5nm technology is gonna be scaled up to fit active cooled Apple Silicon Mac computers, first coming into MacBooks like the MacBook Air and the 13\" MacBook Pro, and then into the redesigned 24\" iMac. \n\nOne of the first rumored chips will be a 12-core 5nm chip built by TSMC with 8 high performance cores and 4 efficiency cores. This will likely go into the MacBook Pro. \n\nI'm almost certain that it will outperform the previous Intel-based MacBook Pros in every way. And on top of that, the new Apple Silicon chips will come with Apple's Neural engine and machine learnings accelerations. Along with that, they'll get the same HEVC hardware accelerators as well, which is now becoming the standard for video recording. \n\nBasically, the point of all of this is that TSMC's new 5nm chips that will come in the Apple Silicon Macs are gonna be much faster than anyone is expecting, and those first Macs are rumored to be coming this October or November. \n\nThese chips will shake the entire industry due to the vast performance per watt improvements and the way Apple is gonna use them in terms of their Apple devices sharing the same code. \n\nAnd if Apple succeeds in this transition, there's a very good chance that the rest of the industry will start slowly switching to ARM-based chips, which TSMC is the leader in. (Intel is way behind in ARM chip technology)\n\nBecause of this, TSMC will be confirmed as the leader in chip-making technology, and investors will jump onboard.\n\nTheir main advantage is that they're the first to 5nm, and Samsung is currently having trouble with their 5nm process. Their Note 20 Ultra isn't launching with 5nm chips like people expected.  \n\"A new [report](https://www.zhitongcaijing.com/content/detail/324146.html) out of China (via [*GizmoChina*](https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/08/05/samsung-lost-qualcomm-5nm-orders-tsmc/)), however, suggests Samsung may have lost most, if not all, of that business to Taiwanese rival TSMC\"\n\n[https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875](https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875)\n\nSo Samsung is having trouble. Intel is having trouble, ordering wafers from TSMC. AMD is ordering wafers from TSMC. Qualcomm is ordering wafers from TSMC.\n\nTSMC is now becoming the Sony of the chip-making world. (Sony owns the camera sensor market by such a vast margin that a TON of cameras come with Sony sensors)\n\nWhat if TSMC becomes the next Sony and more companies rely on them for chips instead of investing into their own chip technology? \n\nSummary: Buy Long calls. Especially while the whole market is having a down day today. Buy the dip!\n\nPositions: TSM $100c 1/15/21",

        "selftext": "Microchip is a semiconductor company out of Arizona with a Mkt. Cap of about $26 Billion. They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",

You could've exited anytime on Friday for a profit except the last 15 mins of trading.  AAPL stock split enthusiasm and tiktok buyout rumors by MSFT(now canned) drove it past 325 eclipsing the stimulus paycheck pause\n\nLooking into next week, again for the SPY we need to think in terms of Geopolitik Say AMZN struck a deal in South Asia and MENA regions, they're set to dominate the ecommerce market there, oh just one problem. all the goods from vietnam / US can't get there because the South China Sea is being blockaded. Or GOOG invents an improvement to instant results, ie Mind Results, results pop up on your android even before you type anything, and it works on 50 different languages. Whoops won't matter if they are banned in Asia due to US loosing allies over there. Tiktok case is the reverse example of this.\n\nWho makes the most money ultimately comes down to who have MORE GUNS(and wins wars),  we will see how this play out over the next few months along with the rona pandemic. It's been this way for thousands of years ever since Roman times. This view is also echoed by the world's biggest Hedge Funds.\n\n***\"Ray Dalio's, chairman of Bridgewater capital(160B AUM) 2nd article on Geopolitics\"***\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-cycle-united-states-dollar-part-2-ray-dalio/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-cycle-united-states-dollar-part-2-ray-dalio/)\n\n&gt;Governance between countries is very different from governance within countries.  That is because within countries there are laws and standards of behavior that govern, whereas between countries raw power matters most, and laws, rules, and even mutually agreed treaties and organizations for arbitration such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization don't matter much.  Operating internationally is like operating in a jungle in which there is survival of the fittest and most anything goes.  That is what makes having a strong military so important.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Where the US Is in Its Big Cycle The stats seem to suggest that the US is roughly 75% through that cycle, +/- 10%.

        "selftext": "Hi all! I am a 29M and still in school pursuing a PhD in the USA. I have no student loans/cc debt etc.  I am living off a stipend, but I manage to put aside $600 each month to invest. I just started investing a couple of months ago and since I am not confident about what I am doing, I opened two brokerage accounts, one with Robinhood and the other with Chase. The Chase account is an \u201caggressive\u201d (meaning approx. 90% stocks) portfolio account, in which the bank handles my entire portfolio and I simply put money in it every month. The RH account is, of course, handled by me. My idea is to continue this for a year or two and ultimately consolidate all my money into one account and close the other one, depending on which performs better. \n\nIn my RH account I have/planning to have the following stocks:\n\n**Technology:** GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, FB, AMZN, BABA, INTC, TSM, QCOM, NVDA\n\n**Finance:**  BAC, JPM, PYPL, BRK.B, V, AXP, C\n\n**Communications:** T, VZ\n\n**Consumer Discretionary:** PG, MCD, WMT, DIS, KO\n\n**Industrial:** BA, LMT, DAL, AER\n\n**Healthcare:** JNJ, UNH\n\nI do not plan to invest in ETFs as of now since I am young and able to take risks. Out of the $600 I am investing each month, $300 goes to my Chase investment account and $300 goes to my RH account. I am planning to DCA by investing an equal amount in each of the stock I own in RH, so I would like to own no more than 30 stocks, preferably 25.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1) Is my strategy of having an RH account and another investing account with Chase a good one? Or should I just stick to one or the other from the get-go? Will having two investment accounts be an issue when I file my taxes?\n\n2) Does my portfolio look good? Am I well / over-diversified? Am I missing some obvious sectors? I think I might end up with way too many similar companies e.g. INTC, TSM, QCOM, and NVDA which is not really diversification. Maybe I should just pick one out of all such companies?\n\nAny other advice/comments about my portfolio are welcome. TIA!",

By the end of the day the DJIA -104.53 (.38%) was well off its +363 high and the NASDAQ was the big loser -185.54 (1.69%).  The S&amp;P 500 was -26.78 (.80) after being withing a few dollars of a new high, the Russell -9.57 (.6%), and the only winner the DJ Transports +24.59 (.23%).  Market internals were 1:1 on the NYSE but 1.5:1 down on the NASDAQ.  Volume was slightly higher than average for an August day.  The major feature of the day was the massive selloff in the precious metals.  Gold was down $125/oz. at the low and finished $1946.30 -93.40 (6%) while the Silver was lower by $3.21 to $26.049 after hitting an intraday low of $24.48.  The change at the close was 12%.  I would assume that we would see some follow-thru tonight and tomorrow early, but I bought the NEM September $65 / 70 call spread for $1.45.  This is basically the same trade I made last month on the August expo $60/65 spread @ $1.30 that we sold @ $3.20.  We also had the TBT 9/18 15 calls @ $ .40 that we sold today half @ $ .68, and the second half @ $ .74 just before they fell back to $ .55.  Not bad, with YTD now back to +34%.\n \n\nTonight\u2019s closing comment video  https://youtu.be/EvsCZy_K1sw\n\n\nSECTORS: We didn\u2019t have much corporate news today but QCOM won an appeals court ruling on an anti-trust case and the stock ignored the selloff and finished the day $108.83 +2.47 (2.3%).  That made it a standout as the rest of technology was hit hard again today.  It was the 3rd day down for the NASDAQ since its new closing high at $11,108.07 last Thursday.\nThe biggest news of the late day was the announcement that TESLA (TSLA) declared a 5:1 stock split.  While this is really just straight arithmetic, it does create some demand for the shares now, since when the stock split becomes effective at the end of August you would have 5 times the shares at 1/5 of the price.  But it does promote the purchase of \u201cround lots\u201d as opposed to \u201codd lots.\u201d  Does it really increase demand?  Not really, but most stocks (like AAPL) do seem to rise on the news.  TSLA certainly did, closing $1374 -44, and then on the news rallied to its current $1467.20, over $90 higher.\nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN +.82, BGS -.46, FLO +.20, CPB -.63, CAG -.49, MDLZ -.49, KHC -.16, CALM +.19, JJSF -.35, SAFM +2.10, HRL -.31, SJM -.84, PPC +.27, KR -.58, and PBJ #33.32 -.37 (1.13%).\n \nBIOPHARMA was LOWER with BIIB -10.32, ABBV +.19, REGN -9.38, ISRG -8.00, GILD +.35, MYL +.39, TEVA -.07, VRTX -6.87, BHC +.16, INCY -1.32, ICPT -.25, LABU -6.96, and IBB $132.28-2.59 (1.92%).\nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.95, CGC -.54, CRON -.06, GWPH -3.52, ACB -.14, NBEV -.02, CURLF -.38, KERN -.29, and MJ $12.95 +.01 (.08%).\n\nDEFENSE:  was HIGHER with LMT +3.03, GD +2.94, TXT -.18, NOC +6.27, BWXT +.22, TDY +1.75, RTX +.16, and ITA $172.14 +.91 (.53%).\n\n \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with M -.16, JWN +.07, KSS +.55, DDS +.66, WMT -1.33, TGT -1.22, TJX +1.08, RL +1.77, UAA +.27, LULU -8.95, TPR +.12, CPRI +.31, and XRT $50.60 -.39 (.76%).\n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL -12.81, AMZN -63.15, AAPL -10.52, FB -5.50, NFLX -14.89, NVDA -10.20, TSLA +50.43, BABA +.87, BIDU +.08, CMG -11.00, CAT +1.23, MSFT -3.,85, BA +.98, DIS +1.86, and XLK $112.00 -1.42 (1.25%).\nPLEASE BE AWARE THAT THESE PRICES ARE LATE MARKET QUOTES AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE 4:00 CLOSES.\n \n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +2.42, JPM +3.58, BAC +.47, MS +1.22, C +1.17, PNC +3.32, AIG +.52, TRV +.80, AXP +1.70, V +1.46, and XLF $25.31 +.29 (1.16%).\n \nOIL, $41.61 -.33. Oil was higher in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied in the morning on news of production cutbacks from Iraq. The stocks were HIGHER with XLE $38.20 -.13 (.34%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,946.30 -93.40, was a continuation rally and a new recovery high of $2,089.20, but we collapsed and fell as far as $1,919 -124 before coming back slightly.  Tonight, we are currently trading lower again at $1,915.70 \u2013 30.00.  While I like the gold down here, I will have to wait and see how it acts overnight.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $11,435 -580.

        "selftext": "Alright guys so I'm one of the hosts on a YouTube channel named \"Max Tech\".  \nI previously did YouTube work for the channel \"Appleinsider\" since 2016, making videos on Apple products which include Mac computers with Intel chips. \n\nI also grew up playing video games and building custom PCs right when AMD started to release six-core and 8-core processors that were cheaper than Intel CPUs and targeted towards gamers.  \n\nEven though the Intel chips were better for gaming, I still bought AMD because they were cheaper. Intel maintained the lead for many years since games really only used 4 cores, and Intel chips gave more consistent frame rates for gaming.\n\nAt one point, it was clear to me and to everyone else that Intel was intentionally holding off from innovating and improving their performance because they already owned a bulk of the market share. They realized that they could make more profit by making small improvements every year, while AMD was busting their ass trying to figure out how they can compete. (it was ultimately the gaming and custom PC market) \n\nMeanwhile.. Apple was using Intel chips quite successfully in their Mac computers the like MacBooks and iMacs. And Apple was also using their XEON chips for their higher-end machines. And of course, Intel was killing it in the server market.\n\nNow in 2013, Intel announced that they were working on their new 10nm chip process and that it should be ready to launch in 2015, and they said their 7nm chips should launch in 2017. \n\nBack to Intel, over the new few years, Intel delayed 10nm to 2016... and then to 2017.. and then to late 2019... We are now in 2020 and Intel is still shipping 14+++++ nm chips for high-end machines like the 2020 5K Apple iMac that was just released yesterday. Only laptops are getting the actual 10nm chips right now. \n\nIn 2017, AMD shocked the world by announcing their new Ryzen chips, and then also their Threadripper chips, and ever since then, they've been quickly catching up to Intel in terms of both performance and price. \n\nBecause of this, Intel instantly started lowering the price of their chips, and in 2018, they finally made 6-core chips for the MacBook Pro. 8-core chips in 2019, and now 10-core chips in 2020. This is an obvious and desperate move to try and compete with AMD. \n\nBecause Intel's 10nm chips were not ready in 2015 or 2016, Apple's redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro which was thinner than ever before, had overheating issues. The overheating was severe in 2018 with the 6-core chips that Intel made in fear of AMD. \n\nThere were even leaked emails from Intel executives worried about AMD's price to performance beating out Intel. \n\nAnd right now, it is well known that AMD is making BETTER price-to-performance x86 chips. \n\nThe MOST important part of this discussion is that the tech community as a whole, including or YouTube and Reddit, are now convinced that AMD is the way to go. I've seen countless comments on my videos that are dissing on Intel chips and wishing that Apple would switch to using Intel. \n\nIf we make a build guide video using an Intel processor, we get shamed and called dumb for not using an AMD chip. Our Mac Pro videos got a ton of negative feedback because Apple is stupid for using Intel chips. Our 2020 MacBook Pro videos were getting comments dissing on Intel's 10th-gen chips. The entire community is starting to hate Intel and preferring AMD.  \n\nAMD stock has increased over 11x since they announced the first Ryzen chips in August of 2016.  \nIntel stock has only increased 38% since that same date. \n\nAnd looking towards the future.. Intel has recently delayed their 7nm chips until late 2022 or 2023. This caused their stock price to tank at they last earnings call. \n\nThere's even now a class-action lawsuit against Intel because of this delay. \n\nThis also caused their chief of chip engineering to resign, and they reorganized their entire chip team. \n\nThey've even discussed outsourcing their future 6nm, 5nm and 3nm chip production to their rival foundry TSMC because they've lost confidence in their own foundry. \n\nSo it's clear that Intel is getting killed by AMD with each passing year, and the tech community knows it. (Which is VERY important)   \n\n\nThis brings us into the Apple and TSMC portion of this DD.   \n\n\nBack in 2013, Apple announced their A7 chip for their iPhone 5s, the first 64 bit smartphone chip, and ever since then, there was a massive performance war between Apple and Qualcomm, fighting to create the fastest smartphone chips, in which Apple ultimately won. \n\n(The A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro is still much faster than the Snapdragon 865+ which was just recently released this year) \n\nStuck in the middle of this battle was TSMC, which has been the EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Apple Silicon chips for their iPhones and iPads since the A10 chip in 2016. \n\nAnd in 2018, Apple released their 11\" iPad Pro with the A12X chip manufactured by TSMC's 7nm process. This iPad from 2 years ago is so powerful that it still outperforms the new 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with Intel's 10th gen chip in both processor AND graphics performance. \n\nNow, Apple is about to announce their iPhone 12 in about a month that's gonna pack the A14 chip which is being built on TSMC's brand new 5nm process. \n\nAnd of course, the next iPad Pro will get a much improved A14X 5nm chip, and it's the same story for the Apple Silicon Mac chips that will start being released later this year in October/November. \n\nI'm of course, talking about Apple finally ditching Intel and moving forward with their own chips. This makes sense for Apple for various different reasons.\n\n1: They can run iPhone &amp; iPad apps on their Macs.\n\n2: They control both the software and hardware for incredibly amounts of performance optimization.\n\n3: They can make sure every new Mac update gets a new chip with performance improvements instead of relying on Intel to release improved chips. \n\n4: This is of course, much cheaper for Apple since they don't have to pay Intel the high price of their chips. \n\n5: They don't have to deal with overheating issues since most Intel chips are still on 14nm technology, therefore running very hot and using a lot of power.   \n\n\nAnd there's a good chance that the very first Apple Silicon Mac chips are gonna outperform the current Intel chips, stay much cooler and give you much better battery life. \n\nJust to give you some perspective in terms of how Intel's 10nm compares to TSMC's 5nm..\n\nIntel 10nm transistor density: around 100 million transistors per square millimeter.\n\nTSMC 5nm transistor density: around 171 million transistors per square millimeter. \n\n  \nTSMC has already confirmed that they're working on risk production of their new 3nm process in 2021,  with those chips going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\nSo here's what the future looks like:\n\n  \nIntel 7nm in late 2022/2023 : 240 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nTSMC 3nm shipping in 2022 Apple products: 290 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nAnd apparently, TSMC is already working on plans for their 2nm process for 2024.   \n\n\nAnd due to Intel's past, there's a very good chance that Intel could delay 7nm even further, especially since they had to restructure their entire chip team, while TSMC has been on point.   \n\n\nSo the future isn't looking very bright for Intel's chip technology compared to TSMC. No wonder why they wanted to outsource their chips from them.   \n\n\nAnd one last bit on Apple's switch to their own chips built by TSMC. \n\nApple has already given developers their transition kit which is a Mac Mini with an A12Z chip from their iPad Pro. \n\nOne developer tweeted this: \"At this point, I think that the first gen Apple Silicon machines will be faster at running x86 code than an actual x86...\"  \n\n\nWhat he means is that Apple's new Rosetta 2 emulation software is so good that he thinks it'll outperform Intel chips even though it's not running natively for ARM. \n\nSo basically, Apple made the right choice by ditching Intel.   \n\n\nAnd if Apple proves everyone wrong by coming out with incredibly great Macs thanks to their switch to their own Apple Silicon ARM-based chips, then there's a VERY good chance that the rest of the market will follow them and start developing ARM-based chips for laptops.\n\nThis will force Windows to start heavily investing in their ARM-based Windows software. \n\nAnd if you didn't already know.. Intel is FAR behind in the ARM-based chip world.   \n\n\nNow, the most common argument I hear is this: Apple is only a tiny part of Intel's business, and while that may be true.. the MOST important thing is the public's view of Intel.  \n\n\nThe tech community is already starting to despise Intel as a brand name because of their overpriced processors and the fact that AMD is beginning to CRUSH them. \n\nJust wait until Apple Silicon Macs start getting released and people realize that ARM-chips have a ton of potential, and they'll start hating Intel even more. \n\nThis will cause Intel's brand recognition and reputation to get absolutely destroyed in favor of AMD and Apple Silicon. This alone will lead to less market share. And what will happen if Nvidia or Apple buy out ARM? \n\nAnd by the way, there are now more and more ARM-based servers popping up, so there's a good chance that Intel will start to lose market share on the server side if ARM-based servers prove themselves. (They use less power so this makes sense for server farms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is that Intel just got ditched by Apple.. and they're getting killed by AMD and TSMC. ARM is coming VERY quickly and Intel is NOT ready. They have been plagued with delay after delay, and all of this drama will ruin the confidence of their staff, leading to lowered productivity. It's not looking good for Intel for the long-term.  \n\n\nAs of right now, Intel stock is very cheap, and you might make a few bucks if you trade short term.. but I wouldn't hold Intel stock long term.   \n\n\nIf you want more in-depth info with visuals and extra details, you can check out two videos I made on the Max Tech Youtube channel: \n\n\"How Intel Lost the CPU Race..\"\n\n\"Apple Silicon ARM Chips vs Intel x86 Processors for Mac?\"\n\nHopefully you enjoyed this DD.",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm back from my last DD: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4mgq1/intc\\_why\\_you\\_should\\_not\\_hold\\_intel\\_stock\\_long\\_term/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4mgq1/intc_why_you_should_not_hold_intel_stock_long_term/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)  \n\n\nI'll try and make this one a bit shorter.   \n\n\nVadim Yuryev here from the YouTube channel Max Tech.  \nI've been covering a lot of Apple products and Macs for the last 4 years ever since I started working for Appleinsider. \n\nAs you all know, Apple has recently announced that they're switching to their own custom Apple Silicon Mac chips, which will of course be built exclusively by TSMC on their brand new 5nm process (World's first)\n\nWhat most people don't know is that they've been working toward this transition for many years. For example, in 2017, they dropped 32 bit app support for iOS 11. In 2018, their macOS Mojave forced developers to use their Metal framework (That's why Nvidia cards don't work anymore in eGPUs) In 2019, macOS Catalina dropped support for 32 bit apps.\n\nThese 3 steps are incredibly important to the Apple Silicon Macs coming this Fall because one of the most important features is the ability to run completely unmodified iPhone and iPad apps on day 1, which of course, are 64 bit apps that run using the Metal framework on the current Apple Silicon chips. manufactured by TSMC. \n\nBecause of this, the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon chips is gonna be much more smooth compared to the previous transition from PowerPC to Intel chips. \n\nA major benefit for the future is that app developers can build apps that have most of the code shared across all Apple devices, which minor adjustments to get the UI to scale properly from the Mac, to the iPad, to the iPhone and of course the Apple TV.\n\nAnd a huge benefit will be the ability to fix bugs and optimize code for all platforms at once instead of having to do it all separately since the main code is shared.\n\nAnd unlike the last transition, Rosetta 2 can now translate x86 app code into ARM-supported code during the install time instead of using real-time emulation. And for plugins and drivers, Rosetta 2 emulates them as well.\n\nDevelopers who have been using Apple's Developer Transition Kit with the A12Z chip from the iPad Pro have already mentioned that Rosetta 2 works incredibly well, much better than expected:  \n[https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20](https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/never\\_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20](https://twitter.com/never_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20)\n\nAnd this is with the A12Z chip, which mind you, hasn't changed in terms of processing performance from the A12X chip from 2018. This is also a chip that comes in an iPad Pro that is thinner than any iPhone ever, and has absolutely zero active cooling. \n\nThat chip from 2018 currently outperforms Intel's brand new 10th-gen 10nm chip that came in the 2020 MacBook Pro in terms of both processing and Metal graphics performance.\n\nApple Silicon Macs will of course, have active fan cooling, and Apple has already stated that their Apple Silicon chips for their Macs will be a brand new family of chips, and each Mac will have a chip built specifically for it's enclosure and it's cooling capabilities.\n\nAnd Apple has mentioned that their Silicon has been built for years with easy scalability in mind, so they can add much more cores into the new Mac chips, especially since they'll have active fan cooling. \n\nBecause of the pandemic, Apple's original plans to release a new iPad Pro this Fall with the brand new A14X chip built on TSMC's new 5nm process and a new Mini-LED display were delayed, so that's why the released the 2020 iPad Pro in March, where they basically reused the A12X chip and rebranded it.\n\nSo right now, most investors have no idea how good the A14X is gonna be.\n\nThe A13 chip from last year's iPhones already performs incredibly well in terms of single-core performance, almost neck and neck with Intel's i9-9900K.\n\nThe new A14 chip will be a major improvement, due to being the first chip built on TSMC's 5nm chip.\n\nThere will also be an A14X chip will have a massive improvement over the current A12Z chip, and let me remind you that it will be in an iPad Pro that's thin and passively cooled.\n\nThis same 5nm technology is gonna be scaled up to fit active cooled Apple Silicon Mac computers, first coming into MacBooks like the MacBook Air and the 13\" MacBook Pro, and then into the redesigned 24\" iMac. \n\nOne of the first rumored chips will be a 12-core 5nm chip built by TSMC with 8 high performance cores and 4 efficiency cores. This will likely go into the MacBook Pro. \n\nI'm almost certain that it will outperform the previous Intel-based MacBook Pros in every way. And on top of that, the new Apple Silicon chips will come with Apple's Neural engine and machine learnings accelerations. Along with that, they'll get the same HEVC hardware accelerators as well, which is now becoming the standard for video recording. \n\nBasically, the point of all of this is that TSMC's new 5nm chips that will come in the Apple Silicon Macs are gonna be much faster than anyone is expecting, and those first Macs are rumored to be coming this October or November. \n\nThese chips will shake the entire industry due to the vast performance per watt improvements and the way Apple is gonna use them in terms of their Apple devices sharing the same code. \n\nAnd if Apple succeeds in this transition, there's a very good chance that the rest of the industry will start slowly switching to ARM-based chips, which TSMC is the leader in. (Intel is way behind in ARM chip technology)\n\nBecause of this, TSMC will be confirmed as the leader in chip-making technology, and investors will jump onboard.\n\nTheir main advantage is that they're the first to 5nm, and Samsung is currently having trouble with their 5nm process. Their Note 20 Ultra isn't launching with 5nm chips like people expected.  \n\"A new [report](https://www.zhitongcaijing.com/content/detail/324146.html) out of China (via [*GizmoChina*](https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/08/05/samsung-lost-qualcomm-5nm-orders-tsmc/)), however, suggests Samsung may have lost most, if not all, of that business to Taiwanese rival TSMC\"\n\n[https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875](https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875)\n\nSo Samsung is having trouble. Intel is having trouble, ordering wafers from TSMC. AMD is ordering wafers from TSMC. Qualcomm is ordering wafers from TSMC.\n\nTSMC is now becoming the Sony of the chip-making world. (Sony owns the camera sensor market by such a vast margin that a TON of cameras come with Sony sensors)\n\nWhat if TSMC becomes the next Sony and more companies rely on them for chips instead of investing into their own chip technology? \n\nSummary: Buy Long calls. Especially while the whole market is having a down day today. Buy the dip!\n\nPositions: TSM $100c 1/15/21",

        "selftext": "Microchip is a semiconductor company out of Arizona with a Mkt. Cap of about $26 Billion. They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",

AAPL stock split enthusiasm and tiktok buyout rumors by MSFT(now canned) drove it past 325 eclipsing the stimulus paycheck pause\n\nLooking into next week, again for the SPY we need to think in terms of Geopolitik Say AMZN struck a deal in South Asia and MENA regions, they're set to dominate the ecommerce market there, oh just one problem. all the goods from vietnam / US can't get there because the South China Sea is being blockaded. Or GOOG invents an improvement to instant results, ie Mind Results, results pop up on your android even before you type anything, and it works on 50 different languages. Whoops won't matter if they are banned in Asia due to US loosing allies over there. Tiktok case is the reverse example of this.\n\nWho makes the most money ultimately comes down to who have MORE GUNS(and wins wars),  we will see how this play out over the next few months along with the rona pandemic. It's been this way for thousands of years ever since Roman times.

That is because within countries there are laws and standards of behavior that govern, whereas between countries raw power matters most, and laws, rules, and even mutually agreed treaties and organizations for arbitration such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization don't matter much.

        "selftext": "Hi all! I am a 29M and still in school pursuing a PhD in the USA. I have no student loans/cc debt etc.  I am living off a stipend, but I manage to put aside $600 each month to invest. I just started investing a couple of months ago and since I am not confident about what I am doing, I opened two brokerage accounts, one with Robinhood and the other with Chase. The Chase account is an \u201caggressive\u201d (meaning approx. 90% stocks) portfolio account, in which the bank handles my entire portfolio and I simply put money in it every month. The RH account is, of course, handled by me. My idea is to continue this for a year or two and ultimately consolidate all my money into one account and close the other one, depending on which performs better. \n\nIn my RH account I have/planning to have the following stocks:\n\n**Technology:** GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, FB, AMZN, BABA, INTC, TSM, QCOM, NVDA\n\n**Finance:**  BAC, JPM, PYPL, BRK.B, V, AXP, C\n\n**Communications:** T, VZ\n\n**Consumer Discretionary:** PG, MCD, WMT, DIS, KO\n\n**Industrial:** BA, LMT, DAL, AER\n\n**Healthcare:** JNJ, UNH\n\nI do not plan to invest in ETFs as of now since I am young and able to take risks. Out of the $600 I am investing each month, $300 goes to my Chase investment account and $300 goes to my RH account. I am planning to DCA by investing an equal amount in each of the stock I own in RH, so I would like to own no more than 30 stocks, preferably 25.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1) Is my strategy of having an RH account and another investing account with Chase a good one? Or should I just stick to one or the other from the get-go? Will having two investment accounts be an issue when I file my taxes?\n\n2) Does my portfolio look good? Am I well / over-diversified? Am I missing some obvious sectors? I think I might end up with way too many similar companies e.g. INTC, TSM, QCOM, and NVDA which is not really diversification. Maybe I should just pick one out of all such companies?\n\nAny other advice/comments about my portfolio are welcome. TIA!",

        "selftext": "The past couple month ive been really into the stock market. Ive been trading stocks only because i cannot seem to understand options (I wish i did), with some good success. Examples would be:  \n\n\nAMD = +37%   \nATVI = +28%   \nQCOM = +12%   \nRBC GLOBAL DIVIDEND GROWTH FUND = +12%  \nZDJ = +16%  \n\n\nIve had some a few losses but trying to keep a low loss so for that im okay. What im really wondering is when to get out a stock. I know im suppose to have a \"plan\" for when to get out but i mean these stocks have clear potential to go higher. Is there a rule of thumb of when to get out of a stock with profits ? or something like get out if you loose your porfits drop by 5 % ex +20% -&gt; +15% then go out. ?",

        "selftext": "\n \nFor Trading August 12th\n \nTSLA 5:1 SPLIT\n \nGOLD / SILVER COLLAPSE\n \nDJIA CLOSES 450 OFF HIGH\n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a slightly higher start on DJIA and S&amp;P-500 but general weakness in the NASDAQ, again.  By the end of the day the DJIA -104.53 (.38%) was well off its +363 high and the NASDAQ was the big loser -185.54 (1.69%).  The S&amp;P 500 was -26.78 (.80) after being withing a few dollars of a new high, the Russell -9.57 (.6%), and the only winner the DJ Transports +24.59 (.23%).  Market internals were 1:1 on the NYSE but 1.5:1 down on the NASDAQ.  Volume was slightly higher than average for an August day.  The major feature of the day was the massive selloff in the precious metals.  Gold was down $125/oz. at the low and finished $1946.30 -93.40 (6%) while the Silver was lower by $3.21 to $26.049 after hitting an intraday low of $24.48.  The change at the close was 12%.  I would assume that we would see some follow-thru tonight and tomorrow early, but I bought the NEM September $65 / 70 call spread for $1.45.  This is basically the same trade I made last month on the August expo $60/65 spread @ $1.30 that we sold @ $3.20.  We also had the TBT 9/18 15 calls @ $ .40 that we sold today half @ $ .68, and the second half @ $ .74 just before they fell back to $ .55.  Not bad, with YTD now back to +34%.\n \n\nTonight\u2019s closing comment video  https://youtu.be/EvsCZy_K1sw\n\n\nSECTORS: We didn\u2019t have much corporate news today but QCOM won an appeals court ruling on an anti-trust case and the stock ignored the selloff and finished the day $108.83 +2.47 (2.3%).  That made it a standout as the rest of technology was hit hard again today.  It was the 3rd day down for the NASDAQ since its new closing high at $11,108.07 last Thursday.\nThe biggest news of the late day was the announcement that TESLA (TSLA) declared a 5:1 stock split.  While this is really just straight arithmetic, it does create some demand for the shares now, since when the stock split becomes effective at the end of August you would have 5 times the shares at 1/5 of the price.  But it does promote the purchase of \u201cround lots\u201d as opposed to \u201codd lots.\u201d  Does it really increase demand?  Not really, but most stocks (like AAPL) do seem to rise on the news.  TSLA certainly did, closing $1374 -44, and then on the news rallied to its current $1467.20, over $90 higher.\nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN +.82, BGS -.46, FLO +.20, CPB -.63, CAG -.49, MDLZ -.49, KHC -.16, CALM +.19, JJSF -.35, SAFM +2.10, HRL -.31, SJM -.84, PPC +.27, KR -.58, and PBJ #33.32 -.37 (1.13%).\n \nBIOPHARMA was LOWER with BIIB -10.32, ABBV +.19, REGN -9.38, ISRG -8.00, GILD +.35, MYL +.39, TEVA -.07, VRTX -6.87, BHC +.16, INCY -1.32, ICPT -.25, LABU -6.96, and IBB $132.28-2.59 (1.92%).\nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.95, CGC -.54, CRON -.06, GWPH -3.52, ACB -.14, NBEV -.02, CURLF -.38, KERN -.29, and MJ $12.95 +.01 (.08%).\n\nDEFENSE:  was HIGHER with LMT +3.03, GD +2.94, TXT -.18, NOC +6.27, BWXT +.22, TDY +1.75, RTX +.16, and ITA $172.14 +.91 (.53%).\n\n \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with M -.16, JWN +.07, KSS +.55, DDS +.66, WMT -1.33, TGT -1.22, TJX +1.08, RL +1.77, UAA +.27, LULU -8.95, TPR +.12, CPRI +.31, and XRT $50.60 -.39 (.76%).\n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL -12.81, AMZN -63.15, AAPL -10.52, FB -5.50, NFLX -14.89, NVDA -10.20, TSLA +50.43, BABA +.87, BIDU +.08, CMG -11.00, CAT +1.23, MSFT -3.,85, BA +.98, DIS +1.86, and XLK $112.00 -1.42 (1.25%).\nPLEASE BE AWARE THAT THESE PRICES ARE LATE MARKET QUOTES AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE 4:00 CLOSES.\n \n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +2.42, JPM +3.58, BAC +.47, MS +1.22, C +1.17, PNC +3.32, AIG +.52, TRV +.80, AXP +1.70, V +1.46, and XLF $25.31 +.29 (1.16%).\n \nOIL, $41.61 -.33. Oil was higher in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied in the morning on news of production cutbacks from Iraq. The stocks were HIGHER with XLE $38.20 -.13 (.34%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,946.30 -93.40, was a continuation rally and a new recovery high of $2,089.20, but we collapsed and fell as far as $1,919 -124 before coming back slightly.  Tonight, we are currently trading lower again at $1,915.70 \u2013 30.00.  While I like the gold down here, I will have to wait and see how it acts overnight.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $11,435 -580. After breaking out over $10,000 we have had a \u201crunning correction\u201d pushing prices toward $12,000, reaching a recovery high of $12220 yesterday. We had added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97, but sold 250 shares today @ $13.93. GBTC closed $12.54 -1.15 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "QCOM and Huawei just agreed to a $1.8B settlement on a patent infringement case thats been lingering:\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/seismic-semi-shifts-qcom-nvda-211809341.html\n\nBeyond the settlement, it looks like QCOM is now open to supply chips to Huawei for their phones which opens up huge revenue opportunities.\n\nAlso, (I know seeking alpha is a speculative website...) there is good evidence that QCOM is a leader in 5G chips for mobile:\n\nhttps://seeking alpha.com/article/4364578-doubling-down-on-qualcomm\n\nQCOM is trading at $110 today after reporting great earnings last week. Their PE ratio looks high at 36 currently ($113 share price / 3.55 [2019 Annual EPS]) = 31.83. TDA has them at a PE of 41 but I don't know how they're doing their math.\n\nThe settlement will add $0.75 to annual EPS as paid out over multiple years. In addition to added markets, this may finally be a chance for QCOM to take off.\n\nIf the projections are true, the forward PE ratio of QCOM moves from around 31 to 19, as the price increase hasn't been factored in yet to accommodate the EPS projections.\n\nDoes anyone else feel bullish on QCOM in this competitive silicon manufacturing world?",

I wish I had bought way more than $1K worth when they were sitting at $55 per share.
