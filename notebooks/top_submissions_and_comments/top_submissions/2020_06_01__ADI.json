MARKs AI Thermal cameras are amazing for the Asia Market especially since China has recently reported a lot of corona cases.\n\nTheir thermal cameras are perfect for dense countries so China could be a big client for MARK.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/remark-tech-combat-covid-19-100245088.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/remark-tech-combat-covid-19-100245088.html) \n\nTheir thermal cameras are in very high demand right now and they are closing deals with business left and right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMARK has made a deal with China Mobile to provide all of its 17,800 stores with AI technology enabling \u201cfacial-ID, traffic counting, and smart queue management.\u201d \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis data will allow the company to streamline and optimize traffic flow in its stores by giving customers information about the nearest stores and number of customers in each one, and it allows them to get in line for a customer service agent before they arrive, via an online ticketing system.\n\nSuch technology can significantly improve customer service, making for happier customers and a more successful brand. Additionally, by reducing foot traffic, these solutions can slow the spread of coronavirus and help companies operate smoothly with reduced physical capacity in stores.\n\nThe potential revenue on this deal would be massive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsidering that the thermal cameras aren't the cheapest, it would cost China Mobile millions of dollars to equip all their 17,800 stores.\n\nMARK is going to have their wallers filled with straight-up cash which they will be using to further expand their business and technology.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/remark-stock-pandemic-proof-bet-145421478.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/remark-stock-pandemic-proof-bet-145421478.html) \n\nTheir app Sharecare has already been launched and will be providing users with virtual healthcare. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSharecare offers AI-enhanced healthcare and it\u2019s had a lot of attention from celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Dr. Oz. Celebrity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVirtual healthcare offers a cheaper alternative to visiting healthcare professionals, which is an important factor in the Presidential campaign in which healthcare costs will once again be a big thing. Plus, the pandemic forced people to use remote healthcare services. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs there are more cases, more people will be using Sharecare which will further improve revenues and publicity for MARK.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTDOC is a powerful example of how growing interest in virtual healthcare was accelerated by the pandemic. \n\nThe company said that the number of virtual visits it facilitated at the start of April was more than 100% higher than in March. Demand for virtual healthcare will likely continue to be strong going forward. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf MARK can successfully pull off what TDOC is doing, the stock will skyrocket with their revenues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Technicals:**\n\nStock Info:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**-** Usual 10-day volume of 8.23M.\n\n\\- Usual 3-month volume of 34.32M.\n\nThis is a very good volume for a penny stock, it provides easy buying and selling of the stock and it ensures that there will be movement in the stock price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Shares outstanding are 99.38M.\n\n\\- Float is 85.71M.\n\nIt would be better to see a lower float since the lower the float the easier it is to move up the stock price, but this isn't a bad float.\n\nNot that many benefits from a float like this other than it's harder to push down the price but the same goes for trying to push up the price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- 26.23% of shares are being held by insiders.\n\n\\- 14.19% of shares are being held by institutions.\n\nSo many insiders holding the stock could cause a massive dump in the stock price if they decided to sell-off.\n\nIt isn't all bad though, this also shows that the insiders are confident that the stock price will go up since it is part of their paycheck.\n\nA good number of institutions hold the stock, institutions usually invest in stocks that will increase in price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Short % of float is 15.43%\n\n\\- Short % of shares outstanding is 14.52%.\n\nThis is both good and bad. The good is that there is potential for a big short squeeze which will force many people to start mass buying the stock, this will of course boost the stock price by quite a bit.\n\nThe bad part is that this shows that a good part of investors aren't confident that the stock price will go up. The lower the confidence the more paper hands traders there will be which will make the price fall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIndicators:\n\nThese are based on the 1-day indicators.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoving Averages:\n\n\\- Candles above 5 SMA, buy rating.\n\n\\- Candles below 10 SMA, sell rating.\n\n\\- Candles below 20 SMA, sell rating.\n\n\\- Candles below 30 SMA, sell rating.\n\n\\- Candles above 50 SMA, buy rating.\n\n\\- Candles above 100 SMA, buy rating.\n\n\\- Candles above 200 SMA, buy rating.\n\n\\- Candles are neutral on IC, hold rating.\n\n\\- Candles are below VWAP, sell rating.\n\n\\- Candles are above HMA, buy rating.\n\nMoving Averages give MARK a buy rating.

MARK will be making bank on this deal and will use the money to improve its technology which will further potential revenue.\n\nMARKs app Sharecare could become a big success. Most people will not be leaving their houses and Sharecare will take advantage of that by bringing virtual healthcare to people. The potential revenue on this one is massive.\n\nThe conference will hopefully boost the stock price by quite a bit considering that they will be discussing so many things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR;DR: These are some quick buy and sell points.\n\n\\- Buy point is if MARK rebounds to around $2.33-$2.29.\n\n\\- Instant buy point is if MARK breaks the $2.95 hourly resistance with some buffer.\n\n\\- Sell point is if MARK falls below the hourly 50 SMA.\n\n\\- Instant sell point is if MARK falls below the hourly $2.13 support.\n\nRemember, this is not a very short term play, July 6 will be a big day for the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease take everything with a grain of salt, markets are being volatile.\n\nThese points are more suited for the volatility of the market and should work better than before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice, I'm not a financial professional.\n\nDo not buy this stock just because of this DD.\n\nI'm not to be held liable for any losses or missed out gains due to this DD.\n\nI do not currently hold any shares of this stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease trade responsibly and take days off when your account is falling.",

Mexico and the US have a tightly coupled trading relationship. The USMCA stands to invigorate that relationship and emphasize successes in energy production, manufacturing price parity, and tech-invoked trade access. The exercising of law will result in institutional confidence, resulting in reasonable profits from July-September.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Mexico is Buy American as a nation. It has a tightly coupled relationship with American output.](https://preview.redd.it/jcz0alawji751.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a85687aafa11d3bf4e600e380f08fdea89eea52)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- NAFTA ends June 30th and the USMCA goes into effect July 1st. The US is the last nation ready to prepare the changes.\n\n\\- Trump will soon be under pressure for some form of economic stimulus. This may be in the form of an infrastructure bill by the time September or the election rolls around.\n\n\\- The USMCA modernizes up cross border digital trade and seeks to modernize some structural changes that have transformed in the energy industries invoking industrial surplus. This will increase the rate of exchange\n\n\\- These changes from Facebook (WhatsApp), Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Shopify, Cloudflare, Paypal, and other important supply chain players like **SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS** to supercharge trade between the two nations.\n\n\\- These changes also encourage energy production between US &amp; Mexico, where Mexico has fallen behind and Texas has exceeded.\n\n\\- **NO** this DD is not about the obvious auto-manufacturing benefit. It is an important factor but there is plenty of evidence that only focuses on that element of the USMCA.\n\n\\- Kansas City Southern is one of the ten Class-I Railroads of the US. It is the **ONLY** Class-I Railroad that connects the US &amp; Mexico and runs along the Gulf of Mexico.  This results in streamlined cross-border energy and product trades. This also means that **KSU** **stands to agnostically benefit from economic improvements in energy output and nation building from both the US &amp; Mexico.**\n\n\\- Mexico is an important bulwark nation for the US to bolster as a partner against Chinese economic threat. Its relationship with US is far different than international partners like Germany, India, and Japan. There is a far greater efficiency potential between the two nations across many industries related to logistics, mining, energy, manufacturing, telecom, and agriculture.\n\n\\- Mexico's higher education and English learners have rapidly increased as Mexico radically approaches middle incomes and its narcotics problem. By most accounts, the US is least behind in terms of social policy regarding The Drug War. The US stands to adapt and benefit most rapidly from the economic bottleneck the Drug War has produced.\n\n\\- Migration is complex between the two nations. It is arguably a symbiotic relationship regarding wages, education, crime, and currency parity with respects to US &amp; Mexico.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1994, the signing of NAFTA was a consequential inflection point in economic history.](https://preview.redd.it/73u5e39bki751.png?width=3045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a8296fa4d5fb1797d141f936c4809c683b022e4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Mexico serves as important trading vector and access point to increase global price efficiencies in auto markets, energy, materials, agriculture, and labor.](https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Product\n\nKansas City Southern is a relatively small railroad compared to other systems like Union Pacific. You can argue that this is beneficial as is allows the railroad to execute and iterate more rapidly to changes and optimize for efficiencies that larger railroads cannot.\n\nKSU does this with **Precision Railroad Scheduling** along with other Class-I railroads but to great effect. In simple terms, this means that railroads prioritize the scheduling of arrival and departures over the weight and output of each train run. This has resulted in\n\n* Greater speed\n* Greater flexibility to economic changes (Amazon, energy, etc)\n* Greater competition to trucking\n* Increased fuel efficiency\n* Greater economic output\n* Reduced costs for rail trade\n\n*This is an excellent primary for economic growth.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[List of traded goods managed by KSU](https://preview.redd.it/jwed8v3hoi751.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a1cb82b7dcfa7ab59a727bc50991c9d303e3ef7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Diversified to benefit &amp; reflect Mexican-American progress](https://preview.redd.it/6qvks6g0oi751.png?width=2386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=422e6aa0728e13e9fab0a76893522317a015a9cb)\n\n# \n\n[Institutional restructuring](https://preview.redd.it/bd6h7tpzoi751.png?width=543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3958e442f2cce7001739fbc333689ba5c7a56379)\n\n# \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Market ineffeciencies will rebalance with USMCA changes.](https://preview.redd.it/kjlml0x5pi751.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a4a562b56d075fd1b6c6229f823aa8e5718c3f3)\n\n# \n\n# # The Macroeconomic view of Texas &amp; Nuevo Leon's economic zones\n\nThe reality is that there are logistical positions in Texas and Monterrey trade vectors that is strategically advantageous. Monterrey is a trading city located near the southern border that operates as an important global industrial zone for products and services delivered from Samsung, MSCI Financial, Toyota, Siemens, and the like because the region's geography permits it.\n\nThe story is quite simple. Mexico needs more energy output. Texas has it. Mexican can grow it. The USMCA is designed to directly benefit the economies of Mexico &amp; Texas.\n\nMonterrey, of course, is not the only important vector in Mexico that KSU falls under.

Around this time you also began to see new products in ESports like [Twitch.tv](https://Twitch.tv) which would \"stream\" video.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat had happened was that tech companies discovered a more cost effective way of delivering video and it was through controlling the actual pipeline. You would receive atomized content as needed rather than waiting for blocks of video to be received on your end (this was problematic in early Youtube days with broadband and DSL)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe paradigm began to shift. Cloud computing and asynchronous models began to gain steam in the developer profession. We began a defining chapter of web optimizations that still continue today with serverless computing, real-time data, and growing user-experiences.

Do you remember when you had to check your email?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, developers are able to create or distribute product and services using networking and data center functions.

This, on top of its rapidly growing developer platform, is consequential for many reasons as a market-mover in the industry.`\n\n`# In Short`\n\n`CloudFlare so far has been shredding forward across multiple technical markets competing against by:`\n\n`- Competing marketshare against CISCO, Palo Alto Networks, and other hardware customers`\n\n`- Offering a way to not lock your organization into a big tech vendor`\n\n`- Promoting security and challenging Big Tech's direction with web development`\n\n`- Forming positive relationships with Shopify, Facebook, JD, Twitter, Baidu, TOR, and Microsoft`\n\n`- Pioneering the ease-of-use privacy movement with` [`1.1.1.1`](https://1.1.1.1/) `and distributing VPNs.`\n\n`- Growing a rapid, robust, cost-effective, and secure network across the world`\n\n`- _Providing a development platform that promotes the use extremely powerful and 'cutting edge' web computing._ **-&gt; YOU ARE HERE**`\n\n`- Creating a better internet.`\n\n`_**Cofounder of NPM - a primary pioneer in the cloud market**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951310-7164c400-a7e5-11ea-8675-e265e7c15336.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951310-7164c400-a7e5-11ea-8675-e265e7c15336.png)`)`\n\n`# The Thesis`\n\n`The economic value and convergence between e-commerce, global networking speeds, and video advancements is not anywhere close to realized. There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall economic development cycle. This timeframe has been accelerated greatly due to global market lockdowns and further risk of lockdown.`\n\n`Physical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world. Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950869-9c99e400-a7e2-11ea-8373-3e6f2b42b4bc.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950869-9c99e400-a7e2-11ea-8373-3e6f2b42b4bc.png)`)`\n\n`Infrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates. This market is **BIG** and no one or two players will be large enough to capture the market. It ranges from manufacturers, energy departments, web products, hospitals, governments, and so on. Security is serviced differently based on the industry. This much is obvious - a hospital will clearly protect patient records more closely than a manufacturer controlling the runtime of their high-speed machining assembly line.`\n\n`_**ZScaler servicing manufacturing, IT, and industrial operations**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950190-a5d48200-a7dd-11ea-8208-567a6345c005.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950190-a5d48200-a7dd-11ea-8208-567a6345c005.png)`)`\n\n`_**CloudFlare prioritizing hospital security over web retailers**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950400-6e66d500-a7df-11ea-8814-212983bade56.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950400-6e66d500-a7df-11ea-8814-212983bade56.png)`)`\n\n`_**Amazon &amp;&amp; Facebook angling for web retailers over hospitals**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950431-a66e1800-a7df-11ea-933e-1ac98bda30e8.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950431-a66e1800-a7df-11ea-933e-1ac98bda30e8.png)`)`\n\n`_**Fastly executes on video and media delivery**_`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950653-45474400-a7e1-11ea-9e73-bdf121115612.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83950653-45474400-a7e1-11ea-9e73-bdf121115612.png)`)`\n\n`The need for secure video, transactions, VR, and user experiences will be dramatically shot up and this is evident across many exciting technologies like Apple VR, Google Gaming, Square Banking, Facebook Shops with VR shopping, Microsoft software automations, and government developments.`\n\n`NET is one of the best positioned companies to pioneer this market at scale.`\n\n`# Market drivers &amp; a brief history of modern computing`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951016-9bb58200-a7e3-11ea-8398-151ec1df2bae.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951016-9bb58200-a7e3-11ea-8398-151ec1df2bae.png)`)`\n\n`The history of CDNs took a much larger turn when YouTube and Netflix became big players in data production and needed to cooperate with Internet Service Providers to manage the new dam and tunnels of water that the market had created.`\n\n`As many of you know, video data is large and streaming high quality videos at high speed to millions of users in real time was no laughing matter. Around this time you also began to see new products in ESports like` [`Twitch.tv`](https://twitch.tv/) `which would \"stream\" video.`\n\n`What had happened was that tech companies discovered a more cost effective way of delivering video and it was through controlling the actual pipeline. You would receive atomized content as needed rather than waiting for blocks of video to be received on your end (this was problematic in early Youtube days with broadband and DSL)`\n\n`The paradigm began to shift. Cloud computing and asynchronous models began to gain steam in the developer profession. We began a defining chapter of web optimizations that still continue today with serverless computing, real-time data, and growing user-experiences. At this time you began to notice that you no longer had to refresh your web page to receive new data. Remember when Facebook started to notify you rather than you checking your notifications? Do you remember when you had to check your email?`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951531-e1c01500-a7e6-11ea-87c0-f7bcdf9e6ffd.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951531-e1c01500-a7e6-11ea-87c0-f7bcdf9e6ffd.png)`)`\n\n`Today, developers are able to create or distribute product and services using networking and data center functions. This is largely what is recognized as cloud and serverless computing. This is has many consequences but primarily allows for unbelievably fast responses and avenues for user experiences.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951289-5003d800-a7e5-11ea-9aaf-c5b44063a66e.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951289-5003d800-a7e5-11ea-9aaf-c5b44063a66e.png)`)`\n\n`# What is serverless computing?`\n\n`Serverless computing allows a 25 year old developer like me run 5 different businesses on my dinky little Macintosh while I let Google and Cloudflare run my servers under an extremely cheap pricing model.

Facebook's investment in Akamai and its personal networking infrastructure allowed them to create a product that was fast, cheap and would work in various rural or economic conditions. Snapchat never stood a chance in the global social media landscape as a result.`\n\n`![image](`[`https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951349-b7218c80-a7e5-11ea-9901-abd22b1f776e.png`](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951349-b7218c80-a7e5-11ea-9901-abd22b1f776e.png)`)`\n\n`# What's special about CloudFlare as a network?`\n\n`What CloudFlare specifically offers against its competitors is its **privacy-first approach** and its quality of engineering. CloudFlare is essentially a distributed private content delivery network (pCDN) with a massive infrastructure effort to send data around the world safely and cheaply.`\n\n`This is fundamentally consequential as we are seeing massive nations tackle issues with how data can be utilized or privatized.`\n\n`Privacy and speed sells.

There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall development cycle. \n\nPhysical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world.  Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.\n\nThe need for secure video, transactions, VR, and user experiences will be dramatically shot up and this is evident across many exciting technologies like Apple VR, Google Gaming, Square Banking, Facebook Shops with VR shopping, Microsoft software automations, and government developments.\n\nInfrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates. NET is one of the best positioned companies to pioneer this market.\n\n[This graph has been crunched where 2019 skips straight to 2021-2023 levels.](https://preview.redd.it/2u6ede9bul251.png?width=1392&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95bf6696f2deaec72d5b3cce869d0aef5d2e59f9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# My motivation\n\nCloudFlare is releasing and bolstering support for streaming, video, and communications as a security-first cloud provider in the following week. This, on top of its rapidly growing developer platform, is consequential for many reasons as a market-mover in the industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# In Short\n\nCloudFlare so far has been shredding forward across multiple technical markets competing against by:\n\n\\- Competing marketshare against CISCO, Palo Alto Networks, and other hardware customers \n\n\\- Offering a way to not lock your organization into a big tech vendor\n\n\\- Promoting security and challenging Big Tech's direction with web development\n\n\\- Forming positive relationships with Shopify, Facebook, JD, Twitter, Baidu, TOR, and Microsoft\n\n\\- Pioneering the ease-of-use privacy movement with [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) and distributing VPNs.\n\n\\- Growing a rapid, robust, cost-effective, and secure network across the world \n\n\\- \\*\\*Providing a development platform that promotes the use extremely powerful and 'cutting edge'  computing. -&gt; YOU ARE HERE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Co-founder of NPM, a system developers used to send software modules.

A content delivery network.\n\nCDNs are distributed datacenters. This technology has been rapidly improving in the past 5 years and has drastically reduced the cost of business for small businesses and enterprises alike.\n\nThinking trucking logistics. You need to load up and send heavy duty materials, safely, quickly, and across multiple checkpoints along a highway.\n\nAn easy way to think about CDNs is to imagine it as the E in 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution).

Snapchat never stood a chance in the global social media landscape as a result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# What's special about CloudFlare as a network?\n\nWhat CloudFlare specifically offers against its competitors is its privacy-first approach.
