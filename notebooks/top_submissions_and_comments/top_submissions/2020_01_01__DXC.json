        "selftext": "Hey guys. I have to write about whether I think DXC Technology is worth investing in or not. One slide is to show how DXC compares to its competitors (IT service companies). This is what I wrote:\n\nDXC lags behind the three companies in their stock share price at $35.33 in comparison to Accenture's $209.41, TCS's $2,202, and IBM's $143.89. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to make sure I am not interpreting the information wrong so please help me. What exactly does it mean or what does that info tell you about DXC in comparison to those other companies? Does it mean its less valuable than those ones?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",
