        "selftext": "$DXC is an IT provider like Accenture, Cognizant, Infosys that fell by the way side. Previous management sucked. Too many managers and service quality was poor - both fixable issues. \n\nNew CEO of DXC Mike Salvino was second in command at Accenture. He is rightsizing, divesting non-core parts and fixing the service quality. \n\nACN has 44B of revenue and 125B market cap. \n\nDXC has 18B of revenue and 12B market cap. \n\nThis is his second conference call, the previous one(first one) he outlined changes but he had just started and there were no results yet as he had just started.

        "selftext": "Good afternoon fellow autists and retards,\n\nAs we are entering earnings season, many companies have started to release their Q1\u20192020 earnings and I believe the general consensus is that, they\u2019re going to suck, because you know, Covid-19 happened. But what about the rest of 2020?\n\n**Q2\u20192020, Q3\u20192020 earnings and possibly Q4\u20192020 earnings**\n\nHere\u2019s a few things I\u2019m expecting regarding Q2\u20192020 and Q3\u20192020\n\nI\u2019m expecting many balance sheets using aggressive accounting methods to be \u201ccleaned out\u201d. This means that companies will switch from using aggressive revenue recognition, having inflated assets value and deferring their expenses to subsequent periods to recognizing their revenue when the payment is received, recognizing their assets at historical cost, and expensing their charges when they occur. \n\nI believe they will use the Covid-19 pandemic as scapegoat to finally clean their balance sheet/income statements. But why now? Because earnings were going to suck anyways, might as well throw everything out right? You fucking bet. Expect a lot of non-cash charges (changes in accounting methods) and legacy costs which are costs incurred by a company in prior years under different leadership or when the entity's priorities and resources were different. Key words here: Different. Leadership. I believe newly appointed CEOs will the opportunity Covid-19 provides and throw everything out. They\u2019re going to clean the closet. Skeletons are coming out boys and gals.\n\nCEOs: \u201cWe were used to defer charges to next quarter? Yeah, let\u2019s not fucking do that anymore. Who cares, earnings were going to fucking suck anyways. Oh, and by the way, I\u2019m not the one to blame for this, it was past management\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\n**Q1\u20192021 earnings**\n\nSo we know both Q2\u20192020, Q3\u20192020 and possibly Q4\u20192020 are going to suck ass. But what about Q1\u20192021 earnings tho? The exact opposite; they\u2019re going to be gangbusters. Why? Because not only Y/Y they\u2019re being compared to Q1\u20192020 which were pretty much non-existent, but all those legacy costs and accounting changes will be accounted for/priced in. And the new CEOs will look like godsend individuals. And the hammered companies will bounce back.\n\nKnowing this, here\u2019s a list of newly appointed CEOs (2019 and 2020) :\n\n\u00b7 IBM (IBM)                               \u00b7 Disney (DIS)\n\n\u00b7 Rite Aid (RAD)                        \u00b7 Accenture (ACN)\n\n\u00b7 Fox Corportation (FOX)        \u00b7 Cognizant (CTSH)\n\n\u00b7 HSBC (HSBC)                          \u00b7 ViacomCBS (VIAB)\n\n\u00b7 SAP (SAP)\n\n**TLDR:** Worse than expected earnings for the rest of the year for companies with newly appointed CEOs, and gangbusters in 2021.",
