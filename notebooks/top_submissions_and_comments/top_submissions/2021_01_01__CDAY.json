        "selftext": "**TL;DR:** FPAC is a large Fintech SPAC with strong management, reduced founder shares (14.7%), undervalued in comparison to its peers, and it wouldn't surprise me if they announce an LOI or DA quite soon (within the next 2 months) for several reasons as stated below (mainly based upon its history/similarities with their previous SPAC). \n\n# Far Peak Acquisition Corp (FPAC) Pre-LOI SPAC \u201cFundamentals\u201d\n\n**Industry Target**: Fintech. From their website [https://www.farpeak.com/](https://www.farpeak.com/), it clearly says \u2018A focus on Fintech\u2019 in big letters. Certainly, Fintech is currently one of the hottest industries to target.\n\n**Trust Value Size**: $600M. This is the 5th largest Fintech SPAC based on info from spactrack.net. Although large trust sizes aren\u2019t totally necessary to be considered a strong SPAC, this tells me that large investors have enough confidence in the management team and their plan to throw lots of money at them. It also means that FPAC can appeal to Fintech companies that are looking for larger amounts of funding (e.g. Plaid).\n\n**Founder Shares %**: 14.7%. This is a fair amount lower than the standard 20% founder shares that most SPAC management teams require. Out of the top 10 largest Fintech SPACs, this is the 2nd lowest founder share %-- with AJAX being the lowest at 10% and remaining 8 all at 20%.\n\nThis is attractive for reasons as stated in FPAC\u2019s prospectus: \u201cWe believe the relatively smaller number of our Founder Shares\u2026will make us an attractive candidate for a business combination target as we will offer an overall lower cost of capital compared to other special purpose acquisition companies.\u201d Essentially, a company give away a lower amount of ownership if they IPO with FPAC.\n\n**Team**:\n\n**Thomas Farley**: He was the president of the NYSE from 2013-2018. Under him, the NYSE improved trading market share from 58% to 63% and listed 27 of the last 28 initial public offerings that raised over $1 billion in proceeds during this period, including Snapchat and Alibaba. Now that he\u2019s running a SPAC, the experience and connections he developed as NYSE president seem to be quite relevant. Basically, prior to joining the SPAC world, he already had several years of successfully convincing and taking $1B+ companies public. Previously, he was the Chairman and CEO of Far **Point** Acquisition Corp, which took fintech company Global Blue public in early September. I have a lot more to say about Far Point and what happened with their Global Blue merger later on, so stay tuned for that.\n\n**David Bonanno**: He previously served as the Director of Social Finance at SoFi and was a SoFI board member from 2015-2019. Since then, he\u2019s been involved in various Fintech venture capital activities. He was also a key member of their previous SPAC, Far **Point** Acquisition Corp, along with Thomas Farley.\n\n# Comparison with the Top 10 Largest Pre-LOI Fintech SPACs:\n\nThe average price of these other large pre-LOI Fintech SPACs is $12.23 for commons and $3.25 for warrants. FPAC just split yesterday and is currently trading at a common price of $10.28 and warrant price of $2.16, and so it seems like it has quite some room to increase, even pre-LOI. \n\n|SPAC Ticker|Name|Target Focus|Trust Value|Founder Shares %|Common Price|Warrant Price|Prominent Leadership / Directors / Advisors|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|WPF|Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp|Fintech|$1,035,124,456|20%|$11.70|2.86|Bill Foley (Chairman of Fidelity National Financial and Black Knight; Owner of NHL Team: Vegas Golden Knights)|\n|AJAX|Ajax I|Software, Fintech, Consumer|$804,990,900|10%|$12.10|3.48|Dan Och (Fmr CEO, Och-Ziff Capital Management Group),Glenn Fuhrman (Co-founder, MSD Capital),Steve Ells (Founder/Fmr Exec Chairman &amp; CEO, Chipotle),Jim McKelvey Jr. (Co-founder, Square),Kevin Systrom (Co-founder/Fmr CEO, Instagram),Anne Wojicki (Co-founder/CEO, 23andMe)|\n|FTOC|FTAC Olympus Acquisition|Tech, Fintech|$754,750,141|20%|$10.52|2.05|Betsy Cohen (Founder/Fmr CEO Bancorp; Director, FinTech Acquisition I, II, III)|\n|DGNR|Dragoneer Growth Opportunities Corp.|Software, Internet, Media, Consumer / Retail, Health-care, IT, Financial Services / Fintech|$690,000,000|20%|$14.24|4.45|Marc Stad (Founder/Managing Partner, Dragoneer),David Ossip (CEO of Ceridian HCM Holding, Sarah Friar (CEO, Nextdoor and Former CFO, Square)|\n|FPAC|Far Peak Acquisition Corporation|Fintech, Financial Services|$600,000,000|14.7%|$10.28|2.16|Thomas Farley (Chairman, Global Blue; Fmr President, NYSE)|\n|SCOA|ScION Tech Growth I|Fintech|$575,000,000|20%|(Units haven't split yet)|(Units haven't split yet)|Andrea Pignataro (Founder/CEO, ION Investment Group),Mathew Cestar (Fmr Managing Director, Credit Suisse)|\n|HZAC|Horizon Acquisition Corp|Financial Services, Fintech, Insurance Tech|$543,984,330|20%|$10.48|1.85|Todd Boehly (Founder/CEO, Elridge),Haroon Mokhtarzada (Founder/CEO of Truebill),Safwan Shah (Founder/CEO of PayActiv)|\n|MOTV|Motive Capital Corp|Fintech, Financial Services|$414,000,000|20%|(Units haven't split yet)|(Units haven't split yet)|Dina Dublon (Fmr CFO, JPMorgan Chase; Director, PepsiCo),Blythe Masters (Fmr Exec Committee member, JP Morgan; Fmr CEO, Digital Asset)|\n|LEAP|Ribbit LEAP, Ltd.|Fintech|$402,500,000|20%|$14.98|5.12|Meyer Malka, Founder of Ribbit Capital (VC firm invested in Robinhood, Coinbase, Brex)|\n|FUSE|Fusion Acquisition|Fintech, Asset Management, Wealth Management|$350,108,734|20%|$11.59|2.97||\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Prior History with Far Point Acquisition Corp\n\nBased on FPAC\u2019s pre-LOI SPAC \u201cfundamentals\u201d and comparison with other large pre-LOI Fintech SPACs, it\u2019s clear to me that FPAC (Far **Peak** Acquisition Corp) is already a good buy. But I\u2019ve also taken a deep dive into the history of their previous SPAC that traded under the same symbol (FPAC, Far **Point** Acquisition Corp) and **here\u2019s where things really get interesting**.\n\nIn early Sep 2020, Far Point brought Global Blue, the leading payments solution provider for international shopping, to market. Far Point reached a high of $15.93 and after dumping post-merger like a lot of SPACs, it\u2019s recovered a good amount and is now trading at $12.23. What\u2019s pretty crazy though is that after announcing the merger in January 2020, FPAC\u2019s board later unanimously recommended shareholders to reject the merger agreement in May 2020. Apparently due to the unprecedented drop in travel activity due to COVID-19, FPAC changed their initial investment thesis and realized that international shopping would reduce as a result of reduced international travel. By that time, they couldn\u2019t take back their definitive agreement and all they could do is ask shareholders to reject. Ultimately, shareholders still passed the agreement\u2014that\u2019s a whole another story. But the takeaway is, I\u2019ve never heard of a recommendation to reject a merger by the SPAC sponsor! They\u2019re the ones who recommended it in the first place and have a lot to lose if a merger falls through.\n\nCould it be that FPAC was just doing their best to protect shareholder interests? That might be part of the motivation, but FPAC\u2019s deadline to merge with a company was coming up and just a few months away (Sep 2020). If the merger was rejected, the FPAC team would only have had another few months to come to a merger agreement with a whole different company and if they didn\u2019t, the FPAC team would have lost many millions of dollars and nearly 2 years of effort.\n\n**So, was the FPAC team willing to risk many millions of dollars and 2 years of effort? I don\u2019t think so. A more rational reason is that the FPAC team was very confident they could announce, vote, and merge with a different Fintech company very soon after the Global Blue merger vote would have been rejected.**\n\nOK this seems plausible, but we need more evidence, right? Well, this hypothesis is strongly validated when we look at their new SPAC\u2019s (Far **Peak**) prospectus. Three times in their prospectus it says, \u201cDuring their tenure of executive management for Far **Point**, Mr. Farley and Mr. Bonanno identified over **150** potential Fintech targets and had direct discussions with over **100** of them, leading to confidential diligence processes with **19** potential targets and **two signed letters of intent (with Global Blue and one other potential target)** prior to Far Point\u2019s initial business combination with Global Blue.\u201d So, it seems that Far Point had LOIs with 2(!) companies. I tried finding what this other mystery company was, but I guess they never announced it.\n\nMore information that supports this hypothesis: their new SPAC (Far Peak) raised the exact same amount of funding as Far Point ($550M) and Far Peak\u2019s registration occurred (Oct 2020) almost right after Far Point\u2019s merger with Global Blue (Sep 2020). Finally, their new SPAC\u2019s prospectus communicates that they are looking for a Fintech company with an enterprise value of $2.0B+, which is pretty close to what they valued Global Blue at ($2.6B+). It\u2019s as if before the merger with Global Blue was approved, the FPAC team already had an agreement in place with another Fintech company to supply $550M under similar terms as Global Blue. So, after the Global Blue merger went through, they just decided to quickly start another SPAC with the same amount of funding and with the same terms so they could quickly close the deal with this other Fintech company.\n\nBased on all of this, I believe FPAC will announce a merger with a different Fintech company very soon\u2014quite possibly within the next 2 months. The only reason why they wouldn\u2019t would be if they feel they have a solid chance at getting an agreement with an even better Fintech company that was not considering the SPAC route during their time with Far Point (e.g. Plaid).\n\n**TL:DR summary on FPAC:**\n\n\u00b7 Targeting Fintech and has an impressive management team\n\n\u00b7 Has a reduced founder shares amount (14.7%) as compared with the typical SPAC founder shares amount (20%)\n\n\u00b7 Is undervalued ($10.28 commons, $2.16 warrants) in comparison to its Pre-LOI large Fintech peers ($12.23 commons, $3.25)\n\n\u00b7 Very likely close to an agreement with a company based upon the following details/history with their previous SPAC:\n\no With their previous SPAC, they already conducted confidential due diligence with 19 Fintech companies and had 2 signed LOI (one with Global Blue, and one with another mysterious company)\n\no They were willing to unanimously recommend shareholders to vote against the merger with Global Blue with only a few months left in their previous SPAC\u2019s life\n\no Their new SPAC has raised the exact same amount ($550M) as their previous SPAC\n\no Their new SPAC began registration activities (Oct 2020) right after their previous SPAC (Sep 2020)\n\no Their new SPAC is targeting a company with enterprise value of $2.0B+, and their merger with Global Blue valued Global Blue at $2.6B\n\no Their new SPAC only has 14.7% founder shares as compared with their previous SPAC\u2019s 20%, which suggests they don\u2019t think the effort to find a merger candidate will be as difficult this time around\n\no I think the only reason that they wouldn\u2019t announce an LOI or DA within the next 2 months is if they\u2019re in talks with a new Fintech target that previously was not considering the SPAC route (e.g. Plaid) during the time of their previous SPAC\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.farpeak.com/](https://www.farpeak.com/)\n\n\\[2\\] Far Peak\u2019s Prospectus: [https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-305664/](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-305664/)\n\n\\[3\\] Far Point\u2019s Prospectus: [https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-18-191167/](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-18-191167/)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://spactrack.net/](https://spactrack.net/)\n\n\\[5\\] [https://www.barrons.com/articles/dan-loebs-far-point-now-opposes-2-6-billion-global-blue-deal-51588892389](https://www.barrons.com/articles/dan-loebs-far-point-now-opposes-2-6-billion-global-blue-deal-51588892389)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://www.barrons.com/articles/spacs-dont-always-go-smoothly-global-blue-could-still-end-happily-51598101200](https://www.barrons.com/articles/spacs-dont-always-go-smoothly-global-blue-could-still-end-happily-51598101200)",
