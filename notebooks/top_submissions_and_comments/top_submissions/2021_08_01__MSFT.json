        "selftext": "**TL;DR at bottom.**\n\nHere's your obligatory bear post for the day/week/whatever.\n\nI'm not an expert but I do have some qualifications that lead me to believe that the global economy is in for some trouble.  I could be wrong, of course, and actually my entire theory is predicated on that fact.  Still, I feel I am sure enough in my convictions to the point where this statement is worth making.  You may disagree with the worthiness of this post, and of course, the premise behind it.  That's fine;  I'm just here to share the way I see things.\n\nWhat's certain is that, even if one may see the warning signs of a looming crisis, it's near impossible to tell when that crisis might be.  I have no idea.  All I know is I see some precariousness and warning signs right now.  So, without further ado:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Uncertain Nature of the World**\n\nThe world is uncertain.  Black swan events happen, and they happen frequently.  Again, some people may have some inkling of them, but it's hard if not impossible to predict these things with any degree of certainty.  Some examples that come to mind (please excuse the lack of chronological ordering): the Covid-19 pandemic, September 11th, the Global Financial Crisis, the John F. Kennedy assassination, Columbus discovering America, the Challenger/Colombia space shuttle disasters, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand leading to WW1, the Great Depression, the Black Death, the storm that destroyed the Spanish Armada, the Wehrmacht crossing the Ardennes, the smart phone / internet revolution, etc.  The last one is interesting if you ever saw *Back to the Future: Pt. 2.*  The most they predicted were flying cars, but not smart phones or internet.\n\nBut I digress.  These events are part and parcel of life, and the major events of history do not happen in a linear fashion.  Sure, we may be able to connect the dots after the fact, but when they happen it's almost unbelievable; we seem to be taken utterly by surprise.  Just think: apart from Bill Gates or someone like that, which one of us normal folk thought we'd be dealing with a pandemic this time 2 years ago?  I certainly didn't imagine it.\n\nAnd it happens in our personal lives too.  You meet someone.  You have a break up.  You get injured.  You get sick.  You lose a loved one.  You fall in love.  Who knows.  Life is very, very unpredictable.\n\nDon't get me wrong; that doesn't mean I don't think we should try.  Science helps. We can form hypotheses and test them.  This adds a lot of certainty to a world that is very uncertain.  But even Einstein would admit that some things are simply out of our grasp:\n\n\"What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly, and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of humility.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Folly of Economics**\n\nI studied economics.  I was very interested in Econ 101 and decided to make that my major.  Later, however, I was disappointed in what I learned.  I don't know.  There was just too much mathematical formulating and analysis.  I didn't feel, really, that I had learned much of anything that was actually relevant and applicable to the real world.  To be honest, at the time I just thought I was an idiot and bad at math - blaming myself rather than the field, as a young, lost kid might be prone to do.  Looking back, however, I think there were serious shortcomings that I had picked up on but did not have the tools to express.\n\nI'm not saying that there isn't a place for that sort of analysis in the study of economics: I imagine there is.  I just don't think that it should be the singular focus of the whole field.  Indeed, while mathematical equations are imperative for pure math and even for practical applications like physics and chemistry, can they really be applied with the same rigorous veracity to the study of something so complex and changeable as the economy?\n\nFormer economic advisor at the Bank of International Settlements William White argues that instead of looking at the economy through equations and equilibria, we should be viewing the economy as a [complex adaptive system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system#:~:text=A%20complex%20adaptive%20system%20is,the%20behavior%20of%20the%20components.&amp;text=The%20Complex%20Adaptive%20Systems%20approach%20builds%20on%20replicator%20dynamics).  You know, like a garden.  You have an idea in mind of what you want to plant and where, but some plants die, some don't, weeds pop up, there might be an infestation.  The whole thing is quite unpredictable because it depends on an enormous amount of variables interacting with each other.  Well, that's a lot like the economy.  (Read more here: [Recognizing the Economy as a Complex, Adaptive System: Implications for Central Banks](https://williamwhite.ca/2018/04/22/recognizing-the-economy-as-a-complex-adaptive-system-implications-for-central-banks/))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Folly of Modern Central Banking**\n\nThe folly here follows naturally from the aforementioned ontological error in the field of economics: we think the economy is predictable and controlable.  Cut interest rates here, buy assets there, and we're good to go.  If only it were that simple.\n\nLook at the data we're looking at right now.  Despite absolutely unprecedented amounts of liquidity being pumped by the Federal Reserve (and by other central banks around the world), we're still unable to get people back to work.  Check out the [ADP numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/private-companies-added-330000-jobs-in-july-according-to-adp-far-short-of-the-653000-estimate.html) today: 653,000 new positions were expected in July, but the actual result was a miss of just over half (330,000).  If you've been paying attention to the data in past months as well, you've noticed consistent misses in employment.  And how about inflation?  YoY inflation hikes are expected due to base effects from the pandemic last year, but MoM inflation has been coming in consistently higher than expected.  All of this makes you wonder: does the Fed really have things under control?  *Could* they have things under control?\n\nI would argue that you can't solve structural employment issues by throwing the liquidity at the markets.  The problem is not liquidity, there's plenty of it: the problem is structural mismatches, as well as other factors like people preferring to take extended unemployment rather than working.  You can't fix that with more liquidity.  One of the most respected modern economists, Paul Krugman, would probably say \"well, it can't hurt\".  And according to their models, it can't.  Unfortunately economists and central bankers seem to do be doing their absolute best to turn their blind eye to clear asset bubbles.  SPX is up nearly 48% since pandemic lows less than 18 months ago, while the Nasdaq is up nearly 58% in the same period. Meanwhile the real economy has been absolutely hammered.  The [Shiller PE ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) is at 38.25 at time of writing - a level unseen since prior to the bursting of the dot-cum bubble.  It is clear that there is a severe disconnect between fundamentals and asset prices due to excessive liquidity system.\n\nIf the Fed manages a controlled walk down of interest rates, and earnings continue to grow into current valuations, then no problem, right?  Right.  It's possible.  But that would be hoping for the best.  William White argues that it's more rational to prepare for the worst rather than naively hoping for the best.  A long series of things would have to go according to plan for this bubble to be \"defused\", and any number of unforeseen events could arise in order to knock the whole plan off track.  Some examples come to mind (and these are just the ones that we can fathom... the whole point is that there are more that we probably can't): Delta variant or other Covid-related scares, geopolitical tensions with China/USA/Taiwan, inflation running hotter than expected, etc.\n\nAnd speaking of inflation, why in the world is the Federal Reserve so confident that inflation is transitory?  As I mentioned above, YoY and MoM inflation expectations have come in consistently higher than expectations over the course of the last few months, oftentimes to the tune of 70-80%.  If whoever is making these predictions is getting it so wrong in regards to the numbers, who's to say that they aren't getting it wrong in regards to it being transitory?\n\nLook, it very well may be; the supply chain disruption argument is a valid and strong one.  But nobody has a crystal ball. The Fed is not an all-seeing eye where they can simply predict exactly what is going to happen.  One might hope that the Fed would be more prudent and humble in their analysis of the situation.\n\nAnd certainly the Fed has a long history of getting things wrong.  In early 2007 Ben Bernanke famously declared that subprime was \"contained\".  Just a few months later, when the crisis did begin to arise, Jim Cramer called out Bernanke for \"being an academic\" and for being out of touch with the situation on the ground.  Look, I don't really like Cramer, but I do believe he was in the right at this particular moment.  This sub won't allow me to link it here, but I recommend looking up \"Cramer tells Bernanke to wake up\" on YouTube.  It's worth a watch.\n\nLet's not forget that, even before either of these two events, the Fed absolutely failed to anticipate the crisis in the first place.  Later they would say that such a crisis was unpredictable, and totally based on panic.  But they forget the fact that people like Dr. Michael Burry, of Big Short book and film fam, did see it coming.  All of the people in that book saw it coming.  Even [William White saw it coming, and warned Alan Greenspan of it at Jackson Hole in 2003.](https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/the-man-nobody-wanted-to-hear-global-banking-economist-warned-of-coming-crisis-a-635051.html) The Fed, however, did not see it coming.  Bernanke would also claim that the crisis was nothing more than old-fashioned financial panic, and that if not for the panic it would have been the equivalent of nothing more than \"a bad day in the stock market\".  This is a convenient view for him to take, as it alleviates him of all responsibility for completely bungling the situation.  Even [Paul Krugman challenges Bernanke's assertion that it was all related to financial panic and not at all tied to fundamentals in the housing market](https://www.google.com/search?q=Paul+Krugman+Great+recession+bernanke&amp;oq=paul+krugman+&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59l3j35i39j69i60l3.2811j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8).\n\nOf course, Bernanke and those around him would hold on to their view that nobody could have seen the crisis coming, and go on to congratulate themselves for rescuing the country and the world from a crisis that they themselves had failed to prevent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Where We Are Today**\n\nAnd that brings us to where we are today, with massive monetary stimulus coming from the Fed and all major central banks as a response to the Covid-19 crisis.  The response to 2008 was seen, rightfully in many ways, as a success.  By injecting liquidity into markets when they needed it most, the Fed and other central banks were able to stave off the next Great Depression.  Unfortunately, however, apart from taking into the account their failure to prevent the crisis in the first place, central banks have also failed to take into account the limitations of their policies.  Not only have their policies become less effective, but they've also opened the door for a dangerous array of unintended consequences (William White talks about both issues [here](https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf)).  William White also says that, contrary to what the Fed seems to believe, monetary policy \"is no free lunch\".\n\nRecovery since 2008 has been asymmetric: we seem to be trying to fix deep, structural problems via simple injections of liquidity. Meanwhile, inequality grows, the poor get poorer, and political and social unrest continue to grow as a result.  It's a dangerous path to go down, and rather than try to explain it myself , I would recommend reading the White paper I linked above.  One clear and present danger I see today, which White mentioned in the paper, is the presence of serial bubbles: the dot-com bubble led to the housing bubble, and the housing bubble has led to the current stock market bubble, only to be aggravated by the Covid crisis and the Fed's response to it (ironically causing a new bubble in the housing market as well).  If something unforeseen were to happen, these bubbles could pop, causing lasting damage to Main Street.\n\nOne issue that I see now is that, if we were to have another crisis, what more could be done?  How much higher can the Fed expand their balance sheet?  How much more deficit spending can the federal government engage in?  I believe that we are dangerously close to exhausting our policy options.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, it's possible that everything works out just fine.  The issue, however, may be in assuming that everything will go according to plan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What To Do as an Investor**\n\nI'm not an expert at this, but I would not tell anyone to go cash right now.  I would say, however, that it may be wise to hold a larger cash percentage than you're normally accustomed to.  If you normally hold 5% in your portfolio, for example, then maybe you'd consider holding 10-15%.  This will provide for buying opportunities in the event that we do have a major correction, and it will also help to preserve capital.  That said, full cash does not seem to be the way to go.  If you're waiting for a crash, you may be waiting forever.\n\nWhat I would recommend, and this seems pertinent to a lot of what I see on this subreddit, is diversification.  I see people with dangerous allocations into overvalued tech stocks (\"buy Microsoft at any valuation\"), holding 3-4 tech stocks as their whole portfolio, a 2-fund portfolio with levered funds UPRO and TQQQ, etc.  I see people holding ARK funds and other \"disruptive\" tech with unproven track records.  I see people recommending lump sums right now, because, \"on average\", they do better.\n\nIf it were me, I would diversify and play it more conservatively.  VOO would be infinitely better than UPRO, for example.  A diversified portfolio of blue-chips which very well may (and should) include stocks like Microsoft would be infinitely better than *only* holding Microsoft.  Patient dollar cost averaging would probably be more wise than dumping one's life savings into an S+P 500 index fund at the moment.\n\nI would also encourage people to look at fundamentals.  One should never, IMO, feel the urge to pay for a stock 30, 35, or 50+ times earnings just because of \"future growth potential\".  It's a gamble.\n\nIn the end, all of these strategies that I am opposed to may end up working out and may even end up doing better than my conservative approach.  The problem, however, is what happens if they don't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR, Summary, and Final Thoughts**\n\nAs humans we seem to have a problem with humility.  In some ways I think it's painful for us to accept our limitations and fragility.  Thus, it's easier for us to pretend that the world is predictable, orderly, and within our control.  This fallacy has made it's way into the field of economics and by extension into central banks and the Federal Reserve.  Current policies, encouraged by the \"success\" of 2008, operate under the fallacy that the economy is orderly and able to be controlled surgically, rather than admitting the unpredictability of the economy as a complex adaptive system and taking measures to be ready for when black swan events can and do occur.\n\nAs a society and as investors, we can certainly hope for the best, and sometimes the best does manifest itself and such optimism does lead to better outcomes for those who profess it.  However, perhaps a more prudent, realistic approach would be to prepare for the worst, or at the very least recognize our limitations and put measures in place in order to mitigate any potential disruptive events.\n\nGood luck and best wishes to all.",

        "selftext": "**Disclaimer : This article was written to supplement my Options Trading Exit Strategies video. Those looking for more in depth explanations and examples should refer to the video, which can be found on my profile. Happy Trading!**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWhat\u2019s poppin\u2019 bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy \u201cguide\u201d. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There\u2019s two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you\u2019re caught skimping on either end, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn\u2019t glamourous, it\u2019s absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it\u2019s crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Types of Exits\n\nThere\u2019s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I\u2019ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Fundamental Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company\u2019s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you\u2019re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you\u2019ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Technical Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it\u2019s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Psychologic Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I\u2019ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Fundamental Exits\n\n**Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news.** More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is \u201cconfirmed\u201d, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn\u2019t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlgorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It\u2019s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they\u2019re at a huge advantage since they **have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits.** This means that algos don\u2019t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn\u2019t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**In our hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL has just reported earnings.** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price \u201ctanks\u201d, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to \u201cpriced in\u201d.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn\u2019t priced in.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. **Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we\u2019ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run.** News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can\u2019t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can\u2019t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there\u2019s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should **always sell the news.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Earnings\n\nThis is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you\u2019re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you\u2019ll get front run by algos and they\u2019ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the \u201cpriced-in\u201c news being wrong. You\u2019ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that \u201cbeat\u201d can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Product Launches\n\nThis is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL announces that they\u2019re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that\u2019s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven\u2019t explicitly said they\u2019re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn\u2019t tank would be if they announced that they\u2019re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you\u2019re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Fundamental News Events\n\nThis pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it\u2019s probably best to exit your position before that since you\u2019ve honestly got no idea what\u2019s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we\u2019re traders, not gamblers, it\u2019s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Exits\n\nTechnical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don\u2019t have much experience in the area, I\u2019ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Exiting Around Support and Resistance\n\nThis is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it\u2019s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. **Whenever you start to approach an area which you\u2019ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade.** If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it\u2019ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won\u2019t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAn awesome example of this would be the [$CLF chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/9/9ymcqFZF.png) As we can tell, CLF trades in a nice ascending channel. In this case, we can use our trendlines to easily identify when to exit our trades in order to capture the maximum amount of our gains, saving us massive headaches. Once we get near any of the yellow trendlines, we should consider taking an exit since we\u2019re likely going to bounce off of it. Another great example of similar price movement can be found in [$AMD\u2019s chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/LzNxfKpr.png) It trades off of supports and resistances very consistently, allowing us to bag consistent gains. However, unlike CLF, AMD often has breakouts to the upside or downside, making it trickier to trade in the event of a breakout.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou may be wondering if there\u2019s any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don\u2019t hold. Although I don\u2019t recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you\u2019ll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it\u2019s going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you\u2019re trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you\u2019ve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It\u2019s a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there\u2019s been a breakout, and you\u2019re clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don\u2019t prefer it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Gaps\n\nBefore we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur. [**Gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock moves sharply without any trades being placed.**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/asVEHysx.png) Usually this happens as a result of a positive or negative catalyst affecting a stock outside of regular trading hours, resulting in a respective gap up or down the following day. A \u201cgap\u201d refers to a gap in the stock's price as a result of no trades being conducted within that range. Gaps are created because of low volume (technically no volume), and as a result, are prone to getting \u201cfilled\u201d very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it\u2019s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. **The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance.** As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we\u2019re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUnderstanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we\u2019re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there\u2019s no trading volume within the gap, there\u2019s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we\u2019re at the second resistance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**If this concept was unclear or confusing, refer to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ) which has in-depth examples complete with visuals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Clear Skies and Falling Knives\n\nA clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think [$AMZN\u2019s recent run to $3750,](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6E9FplY9.png) or [$CRSR\u2019s initial run to $50.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EHxx1rVZ.png) A falling knife is the flipside of that, and refers to when a stock is essentially in freefall - like $NKLA when people found out Trevor Milton is a rat, or $WKHS when they lost the government contracts. In both situations, it can be extremely difficult to know when you should exit your trade since we don\u2019t have any technical levels to go off of, and as a result, we don\u2019t know when to anticipate a bounce. Even if we did have a general idea of where it was going to bounce, the market often over reacts, resulting in us blowing past our initial mark before starting our initial recovery.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The simplest way to play these situations is with a trailing stop.** Trailing stops were invented for situations like these, and they\u2019re honestly one of the most effective yet under-utilized tools. Set the stop, and it\u2019ll trail the stock as it moves. When a stock is carving out new highs, or plunging to new lows, a properly set trailing stop will let you get as close to maximum profits as possible while still allowing you to stay in the trade if we experience some turbulence along the way. If your trailing stop is set properly, you shouldn\u2019t get stopped out of the trade from natural market movements, and will only be forced out once we\u2019ve found a new high or low. I\u2019m not going to teach you how to properly set trailing stops as that\u2019s beyond the scope of this article, but it\u2019s something I may write about in the future given that enough people are interested.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Alternatively, if you want to abuse basic human psychology, you could also look to exit your position around whole numbers.** Humans are weird creatures, in the sense that we like \u201cwhole\u201d things - stock prices are no exception. You better believe there\u2019s going to be buyers or sellers setting up shop at nice, round numbers. Think $20, $50, $100, etc. If a stock is making a miracle run from $10, and is approaching $20, you better believe there\u2019s going to be a large number of people looking to take profits at the $20 mark, and as a result, you should look to exit the position around there. Again, this isn\u2019t a 100% concrete theory, and sometimes these levels won\u2019t hold at all, but it\u2019s still something to keep in mind. More on this later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Caveats\n\n**Please note, that these technical exits won\u2019t hold true given that a company's underlying fundamentals have changed. A stock's technical charts and indicators are only to be used as a summary of a company's fundamentals.** Technicals summarize the price action which is driven by the underlying fundamentals. If the fundamentals of a company change, the technical indicators and charts will also change, thereby making our old technical charts void. This is an extremely important concept that most traders and investors do not fully understand. Technicals summarize fundamentals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf $MSFT announces that they\u2019re coming out with a time machine, don\u2019t expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they\u2019ve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don\u2019t expect the nearest level of support to hold - it\u2019s void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it\u2019s new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Technicals are only to be used as a summary of a company\u2019s current fundamentals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Psychological Exits\n\nPsychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren\u2019t necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can\u2019t give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Screenshot Theory\n\nThis is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places - **If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.** If you\u2019re taking screenshots of your unrealized profits to flex on your friends, or random internet people, it\u2019s probably time to sell out of that position. The only reason you feel the need to flex your gains is because it\u2019s a life altering amount of money. I don\u2019t care what the fundamentals, or technicals say at that point. Cash out of the casino, and realize those gains. If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Individual Gain Theory\n\nThis concept refers to when you\u2019re trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to \u201ctrade\u201d money which you also needed elsewhere. If you\u2019re ever in a situation where you\u2019re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Whole Numbers\n\nHumans are weird creatures - we like \u201cwhole\u201d or \u201cround\u201d stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you\u2019re cognizant of it, you\u2019re not going to think to yourself \u201cimma buy $CLF at 21.83\u201d. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you\u2019re trading, there\u2019s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You\u2019ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Emotional Exits\n\nThis concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. **The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it\u2019s potential gains, step away from the trade.** You\u2019re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There\u2019s a very high chance you\u2019re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn\u2019t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you\u2019ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to \u201cdiamond hands-ing\u201d your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou need to be conscious of the fact that you\u2019re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there\u2019s no going back. You\u2019re not trading on fundamentals, and you\u2019re not trading on technicals either. You\u2019re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it\u2019s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that\u2019s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nAll in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader.

        "selftext": "I have yet to get into the market. For the first time I have some money to \"play\" with. I'm pretty risk averse and not into wild swings, big gambles, or huge payouts. Basically I just want my money to just sit in the bank and not lose value (inflation), while maybe getting some multiple back with little risk.\n\nIt just so happens I am not into the idea of picking stocks by value, but rather by my interest in it. So I played a blind game of picking and analyzed the returns over the last \\~10years.\n\nI picked \"stable\" tech company stocks: **Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon**\n\nI picked one \"wild card\" tech stock: **Tesla**\n\nAnd one market-adjacent investment: **Bitcoin** (if I picked today, it might be an NFT)\n\n  \nI put in $5K each (**$30k total**), buying at the first day of the year and selling on the same date two years later. Again, all blind strategies.\n\n**My average return on each 2year period turned out to be 1.8x** on the \"stable\" stocks. Meaning my $30K grew to $54K. There was no 2year period which had a loss. The highest 2yr brought an average return of 4x, and the lowest was about 1.3x. So over the entire blind 10 year experiment, there wasn't even a chance of losing money.\n\nObviously if I was a bit more scrupulous on the buying/selling strategies, and reinvesting gains into subsequent years my returns would escalate, to the point where it would likely overtake my normal yearly working income.\n\nSo this is just my noob-who-knows-nothing strategy that just came to my mind because I hate the idea of eyeing stocks, and getting wrapped up in the day-to-day investment strategies.\n\nUnless I'm missing something fundamental, why don't people just use the market in this way? It seems all but guaranteed to earn some multiple back, you don't have to constantly eye it and... I just don't know what I'm missing.\n\nYes, I \"blindly\" picked good stocks that everyone knows hasn't gone down in value, but that's what I would do today. So if I started today with similarly positioned stocks I imagine my returns would be similar.\n\n  \nBy all means if I'm missing something please let me know because I'm possibly about to put real money down and if I'm missing something big please put me in my place. Any advice would be appreciated!",

        "selftext": "**Disclaimer : This article was written to supplement my Options Trading Exit Strategies video. Those looking for more in depth explanations and examples should refer to the video, which can be found on my profile. Happy Trading!**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWhat\u2019s poppin\u2019 bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy \u201cguide\u201d. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There\u2019s two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you\u2019re caught skimping on either end, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn\u2019t glamourous, it\u2019s absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it\u2019s crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Types of Exits\n\nThere\u2019s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I\u2019ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Fundamental Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company\u2019s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you\u2019re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you\u2019ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Technical Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it\u2019s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Psychologic Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I\u2019ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Fundamental Exits\n\n**Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news.** More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is \u201cconfirmed\u201d, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn\u2019t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlgorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It\u2019s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they\u2019re at a huge advantage since they **have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits.** This means that algos don\u2019t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn\u2019t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**In our hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL has just reported earnings.** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price \u201ctanks\u201d, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to \u201cpriced in\u201d.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn\u2019t priced in.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. **Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we\u2019ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run.** News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can\u2019t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can\u2019t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there\u2019s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should **always sell the news.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Earnings\n\nThis is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you\u2019re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you\u2019ll get front run by algos and they\u2019ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the \u201cpriced-in\u201c news being wrong. You\u2019ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that \u201cbeat\u201d can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Product Launches\n\nThis is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL announces that they\u2019re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that\u2019s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven\u2019t explicitly said they\u2019re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn\u2019t tank would be if they announced that they\u2019re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you\u2019re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Fundamental News Events\n\nThis pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it\u2019s probably best to exit your position before that since you\u2019ve honestly got no idea what\u2019s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we\u2019re traders, not gamblers, it\u2019s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Exits\n\nTechnical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don\u2019t have much experience in the area, I\u2019ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Exiting Around Support and Resistance\n\nThis is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it\u2019s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. **Whenever you start to approach an area which you\u2019ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade.** If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it\u2019ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won\u2019t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAn awesome example of this would be the [$CLF chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/9/9ymcqFZF.png) As we can tell, CLF trades in a nice ascending channel. In this case, we can use our trendlines to easily identify when to exit our trades in order to capture the maximum amount of our gains, saving us massive headaches. Once we get near any of the yellow trendlines, we should consider taking an exit since we\u2019re likely going to bounce off of it. Another great example of similar price movement can be found in [$AMD\u2019s chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/LzNxfKpr.png) It trades off of supports and resistances very consistently, allowing us to bag consistent gains. However, unlike CLF, AMD often has breakouts to the upside or downside, making it trickier to trade in the event of a breakout.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou may be wondering if there\u2019s any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don\u2019t hold. Although I don\u2019t recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you\u2019ll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it\u2019s going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you\u2019re trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you\u2019ve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It\u2019s a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there\u2019s been a breakout, and you\u2019re clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don\u2019t prefer it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Gaps\n\nBefore we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur. [**Gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock moves sharply without any trades being placed.**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/asVEHysx.png) Usually this happens as a result of a positive or negative catalyst affecting a stock outside of regular trading hours, resulting in a respective gap up or down the following day. A \u201cgap\u201d refers to a gap in the stock's price as a result of no trades being conducted within that range. Gaps are created because of low volume (technically no volume), and as a result, are prone to getting \u201cfilled\u201d very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it\u2019s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. **The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance.** As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we\u2019re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUnderstanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we\u2019re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there\u2019s no trading volume within the gap, there\u2019s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we\u2019re at the second resistance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**If this concept was unclear or confusing, refer to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ) which has in-depth examples complete with visuals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Clear Skies and Falling Knives\n\nA clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think [$AMZN\u2019s recent run to $3750,](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6E9FplY9.png) or [$CRSR\u2019s initial run to $50.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EHxx1rVZ.png) A falling knife is the flipside of that, and refers to when a stock is essentially in freefall - like $NKLA when people found out Trevor Milton is a rat, or $WKHS when they lost the government contracts. In both situations, it can be extremely difficult to know when you should exit your trade since we don\u2019t have any technical levels to go off of, and as a result, we don\u2019t know when to anticipate a bounce. Even if we did have a general idea of where it was going to bounce, the market often over reacts, resulting in us blowing past our initial mark before starting our initial recovery.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The simplest way to play these situations is with a trailing stop.** Trailing stops were invented for situations like these, and they\u2019re honestly one of the most effective yet under-utilized tools. Set the stop, and it\u2019ll trail the stock as it moves. When a stock is carving out new highs, or plunging to new lows, a properly set trailing stop will let you get as close to maximum profits as possible while still allowing you to stay in the trade if we experience some turbulence along the way. If your trailing stop is set properly, you shouldn\u2019t get stopped out of the trade from natural market movements, and will only be forced out once we\u2019ve found a new high or low. I\u2019m not going to teach you how to properly set trailing stops as that\u2019s beyond the scope of this article, but it\u2019s something I may write about in the future given that enough people are interested.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Alternatively, if you want to abuse basic human psychology, you could also look to exit your position around whole numbers.** Humans are weird creatures, in the sense that we like \u201cwhole\u201d things - stock prices are no exception. You better believe there\u2019s going to be buyers or sellers setting up shop at nice, round numbers. Think $20, $50, $100, etc. If a stock is making a miracle run from $10, and is approaching $20, you better believe there\u2019s going to be a large number of people looking to take profits at the $20 mark, and as a result, you should look to exit the position around there. Again, this isn\u2019t a 100% concrete theory, and sometimes these levels won\u2019t hold at all, but it\u2019s still something to keep in mind. More on this later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Caveats\n\n**Please note, that these technical exits won\u2019t hold true given that a company's underlying fundamentals have changed. A stock's technical charts and indicators are only to be used as a summary of a company's fundamentals.** Technicals summarize the price action which is driven by the underlying fundamentals. If the fundamentals of a company change, the technical indicators and charts will also change, thereby making our old technical charts void. This is an extremely important concept that most traders and investors do not fully understand. Technicals summarize fundamentals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf $MSFT announces that they\u2019re coming out with a time machine, don\u2019t expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they\u2019ve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don\u2019t expect the nearest level of support to hold - it\u2019s void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it\u2019s new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Technicals are only to be used as a summary of a company\u2019s current fundamentals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Psychological Exits\n\nPsychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren\u2019t necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can\u2019t give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Screenshot Theory\n\nThis is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places - **If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.** If you\u2019re taking screenshots of your unrealized profits to flex on your friends, or random internet people, it\u2019s probably time to sell out of that position. The only reason you feel the need to flex your gains is because it\u2019s a life altering amount of money. I don\u2019t care what the fundamentals, or technicals say at that point. Cash out of the casino, and realize those gains. If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Individual Gain Theory\n\nThis concept refers to when you\u2019re trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to \u201ctrade\u201d money which you also needed elsewhere. If you\u2019re ever in a situation where you\u2019re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Whole Numbers\n\nHumans are weird creatures - we like \u201cwhole\u201d or \u201cround\u201d stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you\u2019re cognizant of it, you\u2019re not going to think to yourself \u201cimma buy $CLF at 21.83\u201d. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you\u2019re trading, there\u2019s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You\u2019ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Emotional Exits\n\nThis concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. **The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it\u2019s potential gains, step away from the trade.** You\u2019re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There\u2019s a very high chance you\u2019re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn\u2019t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you\u2019ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to \u201cdiamond hands-ing\u201d your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou need to be conscious of the fact that you\u2019re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there\u2019s no going back. You\u2019re not trading on fundamentals, and you\u2019re not trading on technicals either. You\u2019re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it\u2019s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that\u2019s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nAll in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader.

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood Morning everyone.\n\nFirstly, clearing the air. This is not financial advice. This is not a P&amp;D. I am long on this sector because I believe Autonomous driving / Augmented Reality technology are the next big play.\n\nLet\u2019s start with someone we\u2019re all familiar with. Cathie Wood. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHqdzbtJvzY&amp;ab\\_channel=CasgainsAcademy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHqdzbtJvzY&amp;ab_channel=CasgainsAcademy) \n\nHeavily invested in Tesla, Cathie firmly believes that autonomous driving above all other sectors has the potential for heavy volatility and exponential growth in the coming years. Big car brands across the board such as Ford, Gm, VW, have invested / continue to invest billions in the EV shift and, by association, in the vision of an autonomous-driving future. It\u2019s no secret that Tesla has been leading that charge, almost single handidly focing automakers to change their company outlook towards EV and it\u2019s no different with autonomy. Even Cathy says she\u2019s pressing companies she's invested in to forego short term gains in the interest in of pushing for further autonomous development. \n\nRegulators Increase Focus on Crashes of Self Driving Cars. \n\n[https://www.barrons.com/articles/nhtsa-self-driving-cars-accidents-tesla-51625083151](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nhtsa-self-driving-cars-accidents-tesla-51625083151) \n\nFOXCONN Revs up autonomous driving plans with first car announcement. \n\n[https://www.verdict.co.uk/foxconn-to-roll-out-almost-autonomous-vehicle/](https://www.verdict.co.uk/foxconn-to-roll-out-almost-autonomous-vehicle/)\n\nBig Tech Wants Eyes on Screens Instead of Roads. \n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-car-obsession-taking-160005986.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-car-obsession-taking-160005986.html) \n\nGM Says it will now spend 35 billion on electric and autonomy. \n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-says-it-will-now-spend-35-billion-on-electric-and-autonomous-cars-130043491.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-says-it-will-now-spend-35-billion-on-electric-and-autonomous-cars-130043491.html) \n\nThere is an unspoken consensus among automakers aside from Tesla, (despite using it to train their vision system) that the path to full vehicle autonomy must include LiDar in some fashion, with all of them putting forward different ideas on how to incorporate it. The number of companies that produce LiDar technology are many. Companies like Luminar(LAZR), Innuvusion(INVZ), and Velodyne(VLDR).  Here, i\u2019ll try and break down which company I believe will eventually beat out other competitors and gain the most overall market share. \n\nMy bet is that Microvision will be the overall market leader in Augmented Reality and Autonomous driving. With relentless investments in R&amp;D over their stories 28yr history, the technology they\u2019ve developed and the and that the products they\u2019re producing are earning them the well deserved label of \u201cBest in Class\u201d as their CEO suggests. While there are many different points of contention on which company has the best product, there are very *few* un-obscured methods, of drawing comparison among them; So, we\u2019ll try and narrow down to just a few points that I personally think are important for LiDar. \n\n1. Point Cloud\n2. Scalability \n3. Cost \n4. Time to Market \n\nVelodyne, AEye, Innoviz, and Microvision utilize MEMS (Micro-electronic Mechanical Systems) to deliver their point cloud. The understanding is that the use of MEMS provides the clearest and easiest path to achieving dense point clouds but also the quickest path to scalability  for the ultimate end goal of product integration. \n\nThere are quite a few variations of the competing LiDar products form various companies and each one ultimately achieves their specs in different ways, so it can be pretty difficult to nail down the precise comparisons or differences between them. However, Microvision is unique for a couple different reasons 1) They\u2019re the only company to fully affirm that their product will be available *for sale* in small quantities starting Q4 *this year,* giving them a supreme leg-up against the competition*.* 2) Boasting a long-range-LiDar that can maintain 200m distance with up to 20+million points per second @ 30hz, (that\u2019s times tiny lazers go pew pew in seconds, get reflected back to the Lidar, captured and processed), their specs go far beyond what any company will be able to achieve in the next several years. 3) Finally, this LiDar module is the only one capable of measuring the speed of a vehicle relative to the speed of the vehicle the Module is attached to. No other manufacturer has been able to achieve this in any iteration of their products. \n\nFrom the Q2 2020 earnings call: \u201c**Demonstrate the disruptive nature of our automotive Lidar that would output more than 20 million points per second at 30 Hz, have a range greater than 200 meters operable in full sunlight**\u201d - CEO Sumit Sharma\n\nFrom a PR announcing progress on the Long Range Lidar Feb 10th 2021: \u201c**Our LRL Sensor will also output velocity of moving objects relative to an ego vehicle across our dynamic field of view in real-time 30 Hz sensor output.**\u201d\n\n[https://ir.microvision.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/269/microvision-inc-announces-progress-on-its-automotive-long](https://ir.microvision.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/269/microvision-inc-announces-progress-on-its-automotive-long) \n\nNext, Scalability and cost. Microvison\u2019s small from isn\u2019t quite unique but it is the most efficient according to the company. The LRL Module allows the product to be effectively hidden without sacrificing the LiDar\u2019s visibility. Several newer generations of their sensor technology have already been developed, resulting in a clear road map for future scale and mass integration with sales expected to begin Q4 2021. Expected costs of each sensor is estimated at &lt;$1,000 granting automakers access to an inexpensive and high quality sensor that is ready for production sooner than any other companies projected time to market. \n\n All of these points together and you get:\n\nMicrovision will have the \u201cBest in Class\u201d first to market LiDar that will take the lead above competitors and leave companies struggling to catch up. \n\nBut of course, we have to save the best for last. LiDar isn\u2019t the only vertical under Microvision\u2019s belt. Microvision is currently developing technology to address the high growth Augmented reality market. Their MEMS scanners also provide the best solution to this; Namely, in Microsoft\u2019s augmented reality product, the Hololense. \n\nForm the Q2 Conference Call **yesterday** Aug. 4th 2021: \u201cEarly applications of our technology included **heads up displays for the U.S. military and automotive systems.** In the market today, our technology can be found in **Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens2 product**. In the past, we\u2019ve worked with other global brands to incorporate our core technology into their consumer products. Our hardware and software teams know what it takes to develop technology that meets or exceeds extremely high expectations. Our core technology has proven 4 its ability to successfully perform and scale to mission critical standards. Our team is very experienced and has a pedigree of delivering products that have the potential to open large markets with our laser beam scanning technology.\u201d - Sumit Sharma CEO\n\n[https://ir.microvision.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/341/microvision-announces-second-quarter-2021-results](https://ir.microvision.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/341/microvision-announces-second-quarter-2021-results) \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgSumYa36xU&amp;ab\\_channel=s2upid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgSumYa36xU&amp;ab_channel=s2upid) \n\nSeveral big name  fortune 500 companies have been consistently utilizing the Hololense to streamline different areas of their business, the most prominent being Manufacturing, Supply-chain, Health services, etc. \n\nToyota Simplifies Complex Repairs and accelerates training with the Hololense 2. \n\n[customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/862482-toyota-motor-company-manufacturing-azure-holo-lens](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/862482-toyota-motor-company-manufacturing-azure-holo-lens) \n\nThe Augments Virtual Machine Future of Surgery is Here. \n\n[https://www.freethink.com/technology/the-augmented-virtual-human-machine-future-of-surgery-is-here](https://www.freethink.com/technology/the-augmented-virtual-human-machine-future-of-surgery-is-here)\n\nReviews of the product are filled with praise and lauded for the breakthrough in engineering. \n\nOther addressable markets include Military, where the tech is presumed to be  currently undergoing testing in the US Army with the IVAS (Integrated Visual Augmentation System). \n\nArmy\u2019s Augmented Reality goggles show that it may have finally cracked the code for developing technology. \n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/vikrammittal/2020/12/20/ivas-program-shows-that-army-can-move-at-speed-of-technology/?sh=521b56eb4ab6](https://www.forbes.com/sites/vikrammittal/2020/12/20/ivas-program-shows-that-army-can-move-at-speed-of-technology/?sh=521b56eb4ab6) \n\nThe tech earned praise from the government awarding Microsoft with a $22 billion contract to develop, produce, and manage the technology (resulting ins a sympathetic bump in shareprice for Microvision back in April, despite having no *official* ties back then.) The same light engine in the Hololense is presumably used in the IVAS. These are also all before addressing the broad consumer market which for consumer AR is expected to reach \\~90b within the next five years. \n\nFor the automotive market? Several hundred million cars are currently on the road today providing a vastly untapped marked primed and ready for exponential growth. \n\nFrom Microvision Q2 CC 2021: \u201c**We believe this product could someday be considered a standard for ADAS safety**\u201d - Sumit Sharma. \n\nDrawing from the many different points, in my opinion there is only one conclusion; Microvision, is a highly qualified and supremely undervalued company. With supremely experienced leadership, ready to go proven solutions in high exponential-growth markets gives Microvision the competitive edge and ability to take full advantage of the S-curve that Cathy Wood spoke about in the beginning; Tapping two huge markets simultaneously with the same technology. And if you\u2019re unconvinced, then think of it like this. Even if Microvision is only capable of competing at about the average of other companies in both markets, this still provides the opportunity for the company to gain significant market share in **both** sectors which means they are *still* supremely undervalued. \n\nI believe Microvision is the winner. \n\nGood Luck, Microvision. Good Luck, Longs. \n\nAll credit and research goes to Microvision, it\u2019s employees, developers, leaders and dedicated investors. For hard fought years of effort and dedication, both the company and the people who support it deserve nothing less than the title of\n\n\u201cBest in Class.\u201d",

Buffett explains just how this works but take him at his word for it.\n\nIn a nutshell, if a company earns $1 at a P/B of 1.00 then it can return $1 to its shareholders.\n\nIf the P/B is too high, then that company must enlarge buybacks (less than ideal) or dividends (worst option) to return value to its shareholders.\n\nMSFT was well within normal limits of P/B up until this recent run. This recent run has entirely demolished its P/B.\n\n* Historical P/B \\~ 3.0\n* Current P/B \\~ 15+\n\nWhat this means is that MSFT cannot possibly return value to its shareholders like it used to. The value now exists solely in the price it is currently at. And MSFT doesn't appear to have a way to dig out of this hole.\n\nIts revenue per employee is declining, not increasing, and its future growth rate is flat, not increasing therefore not justifying the recent valuation.\n\nTo be honest, bravo to whoever made money on the recent MSFT run - but based on the resultant damage to its P/B ratio - I can't say that the return was justified fundamentally.\n\nPlenty of other stocks including Buffetts and MSFT before the last 2 years returned great value to their shareholders without blowing-up their P/B.\n\nWhen the P/B is high there's only one place to go...down - or sideways while bleeding off excess cash in stock buybacks or dividends.",

        "selftext": "In my last post, I went over how to value stocks based on the discounted cash flow of a company. If you haven't read it yet, [start here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o8ygn4/how_stocks_are_valued_part_1_discounted_cash_flow/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) This post will go over ***relative valuation***, rather than the absolute value of a company.\n\n# Comparables\n\nWhen you're buying a house, how do you determine what the fair value of the house is? Appraisers often look at similar homes in the neighborhood to get an idea of how much the house should be worth.\n\nIf the house on 123 Potato Street were similar to all the other houses on Potato Street but was selling for 20% more than the average, odds are it's not going to sell. This concept of comparing assets to similar assets also applies in stock valuation.\n\n# How Do We Compare Stocks?\n\nRemember that stocks just represent a fraction of a company's future earnings. For similar companies with similar industries, earnings, and, $1 in earnings for company A should be worth the same as $1 of earnings for company B.\n\nA lemonade stand that makes $10 on Potato Street should be worth about the same to an investor as a lemonade stand that makes $10 somewhere else in the same neighborhood. If one is valued at $100 and the other at $120, the first lemonade stand might be undervalued.\n\nThere are several metrics we can use to compare stocks. Some ratios include:\n\n1. Price to Earnings (P/E). This ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by its earnings per share. For example, WFC and BAC are (at a glance) similar companies since they're both in the same industry. It makes sense that they have similar P/E ratios, with WFC at 13.16 and BAC at 12.83. However, we see that BAC is relatively cheaper as we pay less for each dollar of earnings compared to WFC.\n2. Price to Sales (P/S). This is similar to P/E, except that we compare the stock price to the revenue of a company instead of its earnings. This is good for companies that aren't profitable yet, since comparing negative P/E ratios seems a bit silly. Uber, for example, has a P/S of 7.40. If we use only P/S to compare Uber to Lyft, which has a P/S of 8.71, UBER seems to be the better investment since we're paying less for each dollar of revenue.\n3. Price to Earnings Growth (PEG). This ratio measures the stock price as a ratio to the company's earnings growth (typically over the next 1-3 years). This ratio is calculated as the P/E divided by the earnings growth rate. For example, if AAPL has a P/E of 28.3x and a growth rate of 1.3%, AAPL has a PEG of 22.6x. MSFT has a higher P/E (35.09x), but because of its higher growth rate of 8.9%, has a much lower PEG of 3.92x.\n\nWe can use these ratios (and others) to identify whether stocks are relatively undervalued compared to other similar stocks, or we can compare stocks to the industry average. If we buy companies that are relatively cheaper compared to their peers, we should (in theory) perform better over time.\n\n# Short Term Relative Value Trading Strategies\n\nWe can also make relative value in the short term. \n\nA common retail trader\u2019s strategy is to buy a stock for a few days or a few weeks, hoping to scalp a few dollars and turn a profit. However, what if the market drops? Your stock could outperform the market by only falling 3% while the market falls by 10%. You were right but you still lost money due to your market exposure.\n\nHedge funds also bet on stocks, except instead of looking for a return on a single stock, they bet on stocks going up or down relative to another. They buy stock A and short-sell stock B, hoping A will outperform B. This is aptly named the Long-Short trading strategy or the pairs trade. If A falls 3% but B drops 5%, the hedge fund makes money overall.\n\n# Short Term Relative Value Trade Examples\n\nHow can we apply this to our trading? What if we think GME will outperform AMC? At $161 its may or may not be a good idea to be strictly long GME. However, we can hedge by shorting AMC. If all meme stocks crash, we still make money as long as GME doesn\u2019t fall as much as AMC does. If GameStop stays flat, we make money when AMC falls. (Of course, if you think AMC is the winner you can just inverse the above strategy)\n\nWe can apply this strategy to stocks in similar industries such as GM/F, V/MA, and KO/PEP.\n\nA second example would be a pairs trade I closed earlier last week.\n\nGoogle has two classes of (publicly traded) shares: GOOGL (Class A) which has voting rights, and GOOG (Class C) which has none.\n\nTheoretically, GOOGL should always be more expensive because they have voting rights, but because Alphabet is conducting share buybacks of GOOG exclusively, GOOGL was cheaper for a while - [We can see this in the trading view chart here.](https://imgur.com/a/Qng5vyG)\n\nBy buying GOOGL and shorting GOOG, I\u2019m betting the gap between the two stocks will close. I don\u2019t care if the market rises, falls, or goes sideways. I don\u2019t even care if google falls 50%. The only thing I\u2019m betting on is that GOOGL will be the same price as GOOG eventually, and after Alphabet announced it would start buybacks of both share classes, the gap closed.",

Ive been trading MSFT, TSLA, APPL etc. for a couple months now. My only loss was on Tesla. But i still was positive for the 2 months. I wonder how the wash sales will affect me.

It was famous for providing P2P torrenting services in China back in the 2000s and everyone had to use it because download speeds were slow. Now they have evolved to a Hybrid(Centralized+Decentralized) Cloud Computing + CDN provider + Edge-Computing + BlockChain company while still operates a segment that provides video streaming and generates revenue by selling memberships. (A smaller Netflix)\n\n**Core business is - Decentralized Cloud Computing/CDN**Their core business utilizes **idle** bandwidth, CPU processing power and storage in an everyday user\u2019s house and use it to provide Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Content Delivery Network (CDN), Edge Storage Service (ESS), and other cloud services for corporates while giving those who share these resources a cut.\n\nXunlei has sold many computing devices (imagine a bunch of headless computers like x86 and Raspberry Pis) to average chaps like you and me to run as their servers at home in the day and you\u2019ll get paid in cash in proportion to how much you've worth you have provided. Their decentralized network is unique within China and has 2 million active nodes within China. Their employees are expert researchers in the decentralized space and many engineering leads are hires from Tencent, Baidu, Microsoft, Google. Their cloud computing segment is generating half of their total revenues 28M USD while the other half is from membership revenue from their video streaming platform.\n\n**What are the benefits of Decentralized CDN**\n\n**Reduced load times**\n\nDecentralized content delivery networks can reduce load times \u2014 particularly for those who live outside of major city centers.\n\n**Improved Data Security**\n\nBy spreading the load between more nodes, there is a reduced risk that a breach will cause massive loss of data.\n\n**Validate BlockChain transactions**\n\nBlockchain is one of the technologies that is part of the core technologies the CCP wants China to be a leader in and these decentralized nodes will also be validating blockchain transactions.\n\n**Their customers**\n\nYou might be thinking, I've never heard of this company and tech giants in China such as AliBaba Tencent and Baidu would be the ones providing most of the CDN and Cloud Computing services anyway, so they're probably gonna be squeeze out by tomorrow.\n\nSurprise.

        "selftext": "I'm leaning toward GS because it has a few unique characteristics going for it. It's IV is good - on par with Tech, it's price is high which raises premium further, unlike AAPL and MSFT it isn't making giant runs which makes it harder to predict, and it also pays out \\~2.3% dividend which acts like a keel to price fluctuation.\n\nRight now the annualized return for 15.9% in premiums on GS is at 0% chance of being assigned. I think Probability calculators are a bit wonky though so I look at the gamma weighted strikes and most of the weight is around 375, which means for a \\~16% annualized return on bi-weeklies you have a very high chance (even with the delta around 0.30) of not even getting assigned or getting assigned near a top that you can buy back in at or wait for a dip.\n\nMSFT is \\~45% probability of assignment for 11.4% annualized return.\n\nAAPL is about the same (trading in tandem) and about 12.8% annualized return.\n\nSo I think GS has a pretty strong, relatively risk free, money pi\u00f1ata that largely unable to be seen unless you look at the options chains and the Greeks.\n\nGiven their dividend payouts are small - MSFT and AAPL both have to make up an approximately 6% gap in return on their share price if you take the risk of \\~45% assignment to earn the annualized rate of return on premiums mentioned above. And I think that may be do-able, by share price both AAPL and MSFT are juggernauts of return.\n\nBut, then it comes down to if ones strategy should be to seek out ores of premium. And GS somehow seems to fall into a vein of gold.\n\nA bit about the sector differences. I think Tech is waning into a mature state for the supposed bull run of the fall-to-spring season. But, given the inflationary environment, banks are tee'd well for a stronger-than-average bull run.\n\nI've read differing opinions on why future rate hikes aren't raising the 10yr rate over the 2yr rate yet, and the argument I lean upon is the liquidity that a lot of big players are sitting on, they are still gobbling up the 2years driving their prices up relatively to 10year.\n\nWhen that changes, the banks positions (less so GS but it trades tandem) will be much stronger than it appears now.",

        "selftext": "**Disclaimer : This article was written to supplement my Options Trading Exit Strategies video. Those looking for more in depth explanations and examples should refer to the video, which can be found on my profile. Happy Trading!**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWhat\u2019s poppin\u2019 bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy \u201cguide\u201d. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There\u2019s two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you\u2019re caught skimping on either end, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn\u2019t glamourous, it\u2019s absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it\u2019s crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Types of Exits\n\nThere\u2019s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I\u2019ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Fundamental Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company\u2019s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you\u2019re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you\u2019ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Technical Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it\u2019s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Psychologic Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I\u2019ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Fundamental Exits\n\n**Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news.** More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is \u201cconfirmed\u201d, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn\u2019t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlgorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It\u2019s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they\u2019re at a huge advantage since they **have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits.** This means that algos don\u2019t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn\u2019t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**In our hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL has just reported earnings.** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price \u201ctanks\u201d, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to \u201cpriced in\u201d.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn\u2019t priced in.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. **Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we\u2019ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run.** News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can\u2019t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can\u2019t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there\u2019s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should **always sell the news.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Earnings\n\nThis is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you\u2019re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you\u2019ll get front run by algos and they\u2019ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the \u201cpriced-in\u201c news being wrong. You\u2019ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that \u201cbeat\u201d can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Product Launches\n\nThis is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL announces that they\u2019re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that\u2019s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven\u2019t explicitly said they\u2019re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn\u2019t tank would be if they announced that they\u2019re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you\u2019re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Fundamental News Events\n\nThis pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it\u2019s probably best to exit your position before that since you\u2019ve honestly got no idea what\u2019s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we\u2019re traders, not gamblers, it\u2019s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Exits\n\nTechnical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don\u2019t have much experience in the area, I\u2019ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Exiting Around Support and Resistance\n\nThis is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it\u2019s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. **Whenever you start to approach an area which you\u2019ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade.** If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it\u2019ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won\u2019t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAn awesome example of this would be the [$CLF chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/9/9ymcqFZF.png) As we can tell, CLF trades in a nice ascending channel. In this case, we can use our trendlines to easily identify when to exit our trades in order to capture the maximum amount of our gains, saving us massive headaches. Once we get near any of the yellow trendlines, we should consider taking an exit since we\u2019re likely going to bounce off of it. Another great example of similar price movement can be found in [$AMD\u2019s chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/LzNxfKpr.png) It trades off of supports and resistances very consistently, allowing us to bag consistent gains. However, unlike CLF, AMD often has breakouts to the upside or downside, making it trickier to trade in the event of a breakout.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou may be wondering if there\u2019s any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don\u2019t hold. Although I don\u2019t recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you\u2019ll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it\u2019s going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you\u2019re trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you\u2019ve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It\u2019s a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there\u2019s been a breakout, and you\u2019re clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don\u2019t prefer it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Gaps\n\nBefore we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur. [**Gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock moves sharply without any trades being placed.**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/asVEHysx.png) Usually this happens as a result of a positive or negative catalyst affecting a stock outside of regular trading hours, resulting in a respective gap up or down the following day. A \u201cgap\u201d refers to a gap in the stock's price as a result of no trades being conducted within that range. Gaps are created because of low volume (technically no volume), and as a result, are prone to getting \u201cfilled\u201d very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it\u2019s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. **The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance.** As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we\u2019re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUnderstanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we\u2019re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there\u2019s no trading volume within the gap, there\u2019s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we\u2019re at the second resistance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**If this concept was unclear or confusing, refer to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ) which has in-depth examples complete with visuals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Clear Skies and Falling Knives\n\nA clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think [$AMZN\u2019s recent run to $3750,](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6E9FplY9.png) or [$CRSR\u2019s initial run to $50.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EHxx1rVZ.png) A falling knife is the flipside of that, and refers to when a stock is essentially in freefall - like $NKLA when people found out Trevor Milton is a rat, or $WKHS when they lost the government contracts. In both situations, it can be extremely difficult to know when you should exit your trade since we don\u2019t have any technical levels to go off of, and as a result, we don\u2019t know when to anticipate a bounce. Even if we did have a general idea of where it was going to bounce, the market often over reacts, resulting in us blowing past our initial mark before starting our initial recovery.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The simplest way to play these situations is with a trailing stop.** Trailing stops were invented for situations like these, and they\u2019re honestly one of the most effective yet under-utilized tools. Set the stop, and it\u2019ll trail the stock as it moves. When a stock is carving out new highs, or plunging to new lows, a properly set trailing stop will let you get as close to maximum profits as possible while still allowing you to stay in the trade if we experience some turbulence along the way. If your trailing stop is set properly, you shouldn\u2019t get stopped out of the trade from natural market movements, and will only be forced out once we\u2019ve found a new high or low. I\u2019m not going to teach you how to properly set trailing stops as that\u2019s beyond the scope of this article, but it\u2019s something I may write about in the future given that enough people are interested.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Alternatively, if you want to abuse basic human psychology, you could also look to exit your position around whole numbers.** Humans are weird creatures, in the sense that we like \u201cwhole\u201d things - stock prices are no exception. You better believe there\u2019s going to be buyers or sellers setting up shop at nice, round numbers. Think $20, $50, $100, etc. If a stock is making a miracle run from $10, and is approaching $20, you better believe there\u2019s going to be a large number of people looking to take profits at the $20 mark, and as a result, you should look to exit the position around there. Again, this isn\u2019t a 100% concrete theory, and sometimes these levels won\u2019t hold at all, but it\u2019s still something to keep in mind. More on this later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Caveats\n\n**Please note, that these technical exits won\u2019t hold true given that a company's underlying fundamentals have changed. A stock's technical charts and indicators are only to be used as a summary of a company's fundamentals.** Technicals summarize the price action which is driven by the underlying fundamentals. If the fundamentals of a company change, the technical indicators and charts will also change, thereby making our old technical charts void. This is an extremely important concept that most traders and investors do not fully understand. Technicals summarize fundamentals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf $MSFT announces that they\u2019re coming out with a time machine, don\u2019t expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they\u2019ve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don\u2019t expect the nearest level of support to hold - it\u2019s void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it\u2019s new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Technicals are only to be used as a summary of a company\u2019s current fundamentals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Psychological Exits\n\nPsychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren\u2019t necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can\u2019t give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Screenshot Theory\n\nThis is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places - **If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.** If you\u2019re taking screenshots of your unrealized profits to flex on your friends, or random internet people, it\u2019s probably time to sell out of that position. The only reason you feel the need to flex your gains is because it\u2019s a life altering amount of money. I don\u2019t care what the fundamentals, or technicals say at that point. Cash out of the casino, and realize those gains. If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Individual Gain Theory\n\nThis concept refers to when you\u2019re trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to \u201ctrade\u201d money which you also needed elsewhere. If you\u2019re ever in a situation where you\u2019re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Whole Numbers\n\nHumans are weird creatures - we like \u201cwhole\u201d or \u201cround\u201d stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you\u2019re cognizant of it, you\u2019re not going to think to yourself \u201cimma buy $CLF at 21.83\u201d. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you\u2019re trading, there\u2019s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You\u2019ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Emotional Exits\n\nThis concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. **The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it\u2019s potential gains, step away from the trade.** You\u2019re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There\u2019s a very high chance you\u2019re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn\u2019t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you\u2019ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to \u201cdiamond hands-ing\u201d your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou need to be conscious of the fact that you\u2019re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there\u2019s no going back. You\u2019re not trading on fundamentals, and you\u2019re not trading on technicals either. You\u2019re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it\u2019s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that\u2019s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nAll in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader.

        "selftext": "**Disclaimer : This article was written to supplement my Options Trading Exit Strategies video. Those looking for more in depth explanations and examples should refer to the video, which can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ) Happy Trading!**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWhat\u2019s poppin\u2019 bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy \u201cguide\u201d. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There\u2019s two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you\u2019re caught skimping on either end, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn\u2019t glamourous, it\u2019s absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it\u2019s crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Types of Exits\n\nThere\u2019s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I\u2019ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Fundamental Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company\u2019s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you\u2019re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you\u2019ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Technical Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it\u2019s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Psychologic Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I\u2019ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Fundamental Exits\n\n**Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news.** More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is \u201cconfirmed\u201d, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn\u2019t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlgorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It\u2019s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they\u2019re at a huge advantage since they **have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits.** This means that algos don\u2019t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn\u2019t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**In our hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL has just reported earnings.** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price \u201ctanks\u201d, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to \u201cpriced in\u201d.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn\u2019t priced in.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. **Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we\u2019ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run.** News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can\u2019t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can\u2019t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there\u2019s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should **always sell the news.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Earnings\n\nThis is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you\u2019re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you\u2019ll get front run by algos and they\u2019ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the \u201cpriced-in\u201c news being wrong. You\u2019ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that \u201cbeat\u201d can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Product Launches\n\nThis is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL announces that they\u2019re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that\u2019s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven\u2019t explicitly said they\u2019re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn\u2019t tank would be if they announced that they\u2019re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you\u2019re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Fundamental News Events\n\nThis pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it\u2019s probably best to exit your position before that since you\u2019ve honestly got no idea what\u2019s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we\u2019re traders, not gamblers, it\u2019s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Exits\n\nTechnical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don\u2019t have much experience in the area, I\u2019ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Exiting Around Support and Resistance\n\nThis is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it\u2019s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. **Whenever you start to approach an area which you\u2019ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade.** If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it\u2019ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won\u2019t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAn awesome example of this would be the [$CLF chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/9/9ymcqFZF.png) As we can tell, CLF trades in a nice ascending channel. In this case, we can use our trendlines to easily identify when to exit our trades in order to capture the maximum amount of our gains, saving us massive headaches. Once we get near any of the yellow trendlines, we should consider taking an exit since we\u2019re likely going to bounce off of it. Another great example of similar price movement can be found in [$AMD\u2019s chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/LzNxfKpr.png) It trades off of supports and resistances very consistently, allowing us to bag consistent gains. However, unlike CLF, AMD often has breakouts to the upside or downside, making it trickier to trade in the event of a breakout.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou may be wondering if there\u2019s any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don\u2019t hold. Although I don\u2019t recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you\u2019ll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it\u2019s going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you\u2019re trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you\u2019ve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It\u2019s a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there\u2019s been a breakout, and you\u2019re clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don\u2019t prefer it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Gaps\n\nBefore we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur. [**Gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock moves sharply without any trades being placed.**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/asVEHysx.png) Usually this happens as a result of a positive or negative catalyst affecting a stock outside of regular trading hours, resulting in a respective gap up or down the following day. A \u201cgap\u201d refers to a gap in the stock's price as a result of no trades being conducted within that range. Gaps are created because of low volume (technically no volume), and as a result, are prone to getting \u201cfilled\u201d very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it\u2019s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. **The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance.** As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we\u2019re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUnderstanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we\u2019re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there\u2019s no trading volume within the gap, there\u2019s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we\u2019re at the second resistance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**If this concept was unclear or confusing, refer to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ) which has in-depth examples complete with visuals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Clear Skies and Falling Knives\n\nA clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think [$AMZN\u2019s recent run to $3750,](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6E9FplY9.png) or [$CRSR\u2019s initial run to $50.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EHxx1rVZ.png) A falling knife is the flipside of that, and refers to when a stock is essentially in freefall - like $NKLA when people found out Trevor Milton is a rat, or $WKHS when they lost the government contracts. In both situations, it can be extremely difficult to know when you should exit your trade since we don\u2019t have any technical levels to go off of, and as a result, we don\u2019t know when to anticipate a bounce. Even if we did have a general idea of where it was going to bounce, the market often over reacts, resulting in us blowing past our initial mark before starting our initial recovery.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The simplest way to play these situations is with a trailing stop.** Trailing stops were invented for situations like these, and they\u2019re honestly one of the most effective yet under-utilized tools. Set the stop, and it\u2019ll trail the stock as it moves. When a stock is carving out new highs, or plunging to new lows, a properly set trailing stop will let you get as close to maximum profits as possible while still allowing you to stay in the trade if we experience some turbulence along the way. If your trailing stop is set properly, you shouldn\u2019t get stopped out of the trade from natural market movements, and will only be forced out once we\u2019ve found a new high or low. I\u2019m not going to teach you how to properly set trailing stops as that\u2019s beyond the scope of this article, but it\u2019s something I may write about in the future given that enough people are interested.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Alternatively, if you want to abuse basic human psychology, you could also look to exit your position around whole numbers.** Humans are weird creatures, in the sense that we like \u201cwhole\u201d things - stock prices are no exception. You better believe there\u2019s going to be buyers or sellers setting up shop at nice, round numbers. Think $20, $50, $100, etc. If a stock is making a miracle run from $10, and is approaching $20, you better believe there\u2019s going to be a large number of people looking to take profits at the $20 mark, and as a result, you should look to exit the position around there. Again, this isn\u2019t a 100% concrete theory, and sometimes these levels won\u2019t hold at all, but it\u2019s still something to keep in mind. More on this later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Caveats\n\n**Please note, that these technical exits won\u2019t hold true given that a company's underlying fundamentals have changed. A stock's technical charts and indicators are only to be used as a summary of a company's fundamentals.** Technicals summarize the price action which is driven by the underlying fundamentals. If the fundamentals of a company change, the technical indicators and charts will also change, thereby making our old technical charts void. This is an extremely important concept that most traders and investors do not fully understand. Technicals summarize fundamentals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf $MSFT announces that they\u2019re coming out with a time machine, don\u2019t expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they\u2019ve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don\u2019t expect the nearest level of support to hold - it\u2019s void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it\u2019s new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Technicals are only to be used as a summary of a company\u2019s current fundamentals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Psychological Exits\n\nPsychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren\u2019t necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can\u2019t give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Screenshot Theory\n\nThis is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places - **If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.** If you\u2019re taking screenshots of your unrealized profits to flex on your friends, or random internet people, it\u2019s probably time to sell out of that position. The only reason you feel the need to flex your gains is because it\u2019s a life altering amount of money. I don\u2019t care what the fundamentals, or technicals say at that point. Cash out of the casino, and realize those gains. If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Individual Gain Theory\n\nThis concept refers to when you\u2019re trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to \u201ctrade\u201d money which you also needed elsewhere. If you\u2019re ever in a situation where you\u2019re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Whole Numbers\n\nHumans are weird creatures - we like \u201cwhole\u201d or \u201cround\u201d stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you\u2019re cognizant of it, you\u2019re not going to think to yourself \u201cimma buy $CLF at 21.83\u201d. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you\u2019re trading, there\u2019s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You\u2019ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Emotional Exits\n\nThis concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. **The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it\u2019s potential gains, step away from the trade.** You\u2019re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There\u2019s a very high chance you\u2019re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn\u2019t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you\u2019ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to \u201cdiamond hands-ing\u201d your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou need to be conscious of the fact that you\u2019re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there\u2019s no going back. You\u2019re not trading on fundamentals, and you\u2019re not trading on technicals either. You\u2019re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it\u2019s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that\u2019s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nAll in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader. I hope this writeup was informative and useful to you all! **If you want some more in depth explanations of each concept, alongside some detailed examples, refer to my Options Trading Exit Strategies video, which you can find [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ)** If you have any questions, feel free to drop em below and I'll do my best to help you out!

It was famous for providing P2P torrenting services in China back in the 2000s and everyone had to use it because download speeds were slow. Now they have evolved to a Hybrid(Centralized+Decentralized) Cloud Computing + CDN provider + Edge-Computing + BlockChain company while still operates a segment that provides video streaming and generates revenue by selling memberships. (A smaller Netflix)   \n\n\n**Current** **Main focus is on Decentralized Cloud Computing/CDN**  \nTheir core business is utilizing **idle** bandwidth, CPU processing power and storage in an everyday user\u2019s house and use it to provide Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Content Delivery Network (CDN), Edge Storage Service (ESS), and other cloud services for corporates while giving those who share these resources a cut.  \n   \nXunlei has sold many computing devices (imagine a bunch of headless computers like x86 and Raspberry Pis) to average chaps like you and me to run as their servers at home in the day and you\u2019ll get paid in cash in proportion to how much you've worth you have provided. Their decentralized network is unique within China and has 2 million active nodes within China. Their employees are expert researchers in the decentralized space and many engineering leads are hires from Tencent, Baidu, Microsoft, Google. Their cloud computing segment is generating half of their total revenues 28M USD while  the other half is from membership revenue from their video streaming platform.\n\n**What are the benefits of Decentralized CDN**\n\n**Reduced load times**\n\nDecentralized content delivery networks can reduce load times \u2014 particularly for those who live outside of major city centers.\n\n**Improved Data Security**\n\nBy spreading the load between more nodes, there is a reduced risk that a breach will cause massive loss of data.  \n\n**Validate BlockChain transactions**\n\nBlockchain is one of the technologies that is part of the core technologies the CCP wants China to be a leader in and these decentralized nodes will also be validating blockchain transactions.\n\n**Their customers**\n\nYou might be thinking, I've never heard of this company and tech giants in China such as AliBaba Tencent and Baidu would be the ones providing most of the CDN and Cloud Computing services anyway, so they're probably gonna be squeeze out by tomorrow. \n\nSurprise Bitch.

        "selftext": "**Disclaimer : This article was written to supplement my Options Trading Exit Strategies video. Those looking for more in depth explanations and examples should refer to the video, which can be found on my profile. Happy Trading!**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWhat\u2019s poppin\u2019 bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy \u201cguide\u201d. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There\u2019s two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you\u2019re caught skimping on either end, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn\u2019t glamourous, it\u2019s absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it\u2019s crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Types of Exits\n\nThere\u2019s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I\u2019ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Fundamental Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company\u2019s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you\u2019re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you\u2019ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Technical Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it\u2019s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Psychologic Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I\u2019ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Fundamental Exits\n\n**Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news.** More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is \u201cconfirmed\u201d, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn\u2019t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlgorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It\u2019s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they\u2019re at a huge advantage since they **have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits.** This means that algos don\u2019t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn\u2019t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**In our hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL has just reported earnings.** \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price \u201ctanks\u201d, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to \u201cpriced in\u201d.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn\u2019t priced in.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. **Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we\u2019ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run.** News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can\u2019t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can\u2019t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there\u2019s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should **always sell the news.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Earnings\n\nThis is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you\u2019re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you\u2019ll get front run by algos and they\u2019ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the \u201cpriced-in\u201c news being wrong. You\u2019ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that \u201cbeat\u201d can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Product Launches\n\nThis is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL announces that they\u2019re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that\u2019s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven\u2019t explicitly said they\u2019re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn\u2019t tank would be if they announced that they\u2019re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you\u2019re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Fundamental News Events\n\nThis pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it\u2019s probably best to exit your position before that since you\u2019ve honestly got no idea what\u2019s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we\u2019re traders, not gamblers, it\u2019s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Exits\n\nTechnical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don\u2019t have much experience in the area, I\u2019ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Exiting Around Support and Resistance\n\nThis is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it\u2019s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. **Whenever you start to approach an area which you\u2019ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade.** If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it\u2019ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won\u2019t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAn awesome example of this would be the [$CLF chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/9/9ymcqFZF.png) As we can tell, CLF trades in a nice ascending channel. In this case, we can use our trendlines to easily identify when to exit our trades in order to capture the maximum amount of our gains, saving us massive headaches. Once we get near any of the yellow trendlines, we should consider taking an exit since we\u2019re likely going to bounce off of it. Another great example of similar price movement can be found in [$AMD\u2019s chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/LzNxfKpr.png) It trades off of supports and resistances very consistently, allowing us to bag consistent gains. However, unlike CLF, AMD often has breakouts to the upside or downside, making it trickier to trade in the event of a breakout.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou may be wondering if there\u2019s any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don\u2019t hold. Although I don\u2019t recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you\u2019ll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it\u2019s going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you\u2019re trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you\u2019ve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It\u2019s a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there\u2019s been a breakout, and you\u2019re clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don\u2019t prefer it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Gaps\n\nBefore we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur. [**Gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock moves sharply without any trades being placed.**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/asVEHysx.png) Usually this happens as a result of a positive or negative catalyst affecting a stock outside of regular trading hours, resulting in a respective gap up or down the following day. A \u201cgap\u201d refers to a gap in the stock's price as a result of no trades being conducted within that range. Gaps are created because of low volume (technically no volume), and as a result, are prone to getting \u201cfilled\u201d very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it\u2019s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. **The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance.** As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we\u2019re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUnderstanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we\u2019re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there\u2019s no trading volume within the gap, there\u2019s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we\u2019re at the second resistance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**If this concept was unclear or confusing, refer to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ) which has in-depth examples complete with visuals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Clear Skies and Falling Knives\n\nA clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think [$AMZN\u2019s recent run to $3750,](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6E9FplY9.png) or [$CRSR\u2019s initial run to $50.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EHxx1rVZ.png) A falling knife is the flipside of that, and refers to when a stock is essentially in freefall - like $NKLA when people found out Trevor Milton is a rat, or $WKHS when they lost the government contracts. In both situations, it can be extremely difficult to know when you should exit your trade since we don\u2019t have any technical levels to go off of, and as a result, we don\u2019t know when to anticipate a bounce. Even if we did have a general idea of where it was going to bounce, the market often over reacts, resulting in us blowing past our initial mark before starting our initial recovery.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The simplest way to play these situations is with a trailing stop.** Trailing stops were invented for situations like these, and they\u2019re honestly one of the most effective yet under-utilized tools. Set the stop, and it\u2019ll trail the stock as it moves. When a stock is carving out new highs, or plunging to new lows, a properly set trailing stop will let you get as close to maximum profits as possible while still allowing you to stay in the trade if we experience some turbulence along the way. If your trailing stop is set properly, you shouldn\u2019t get stopped out of the trade from natural market movements, and will only be forced out once we\u2019ve found a new high or low. I\u2019m not going to teach you how to properly set trailing stops as that\u2019s beyond the scope of this article, but it\u2019s something I may write about in the future given that enough people are interested.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Alternatively, if you want to abuse basic human psychology, you could also look to exit your position around whole numbers.** Humans are weird creatures, in the sense that we like \u201cwhole\u201d things - stock prices are no exception. You better believe there\u2019s going to be buyers or sellers setting up shop at nice, round numbers. Think $20, $50, $100, etc. If a stock is making a miracle run from $10, and is approaching $20, you better believe there\u2019s going to be a large number of people looking to take profits at the $20 mark, and as a result, you should look to exit the position around there. Again, this isn\u2019t a 100% concrete theory, and sometimes these levels won\u2019t hold at all, but it\u2019s still something to keep in mind. More on this later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Caveats\n\n**Please note, that these technical exits won\u2019t hold true given that a company's underlying fundamentals have changed. A stock's technical charts and indicators are only to be used as a summary of a company's fundamentals.** Technicals summarize the price action which is driven by the underlying fundamentals. If the fundamentals of a company change, the technical indicators and charts will also change, thereby making our old technical charts void. This is an extremely important concept that most traders and investors do not fully understand. Technicals summarize fundamentals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf $MSFT announces that they\u2019re coming out with a time machine, don\u2019t expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they\u2019ve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don\u2019t expect the nearest level of support to hold - it\u2019s void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it\u2019s new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Technicals are only to be used as a summary of a company\u2019s current fundamentals.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Psychological Exits\n\nPsychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren\u2019t necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can\u2019t give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Screenshot Theory\n\nThis is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places - **If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.** If you\u2019re taking screenshots of your unrealized profits to flex on your friends, or random internet people, it\u2019s probably time to sell out of that position. The only reason you feel the need to flex your gains is because it\u2019s a life altering amount of money. I don\u2019t care what the fundamentals, or technicals say at that point. Cash out of the casino, and realize those gains. If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Individual Gain Theory\n\nThis concept refers to when you\u2019re trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to \u201ctrade\u201d money which you also needed elsewhere. If you\u2019re ever in a situation where you\u2019re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Whole Numbers\n\nHumans are weird creatures - we like \u201cwhole\u201d or \u201cround\u201d stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you\u2019re cognizant of it, you\u2019re not going to think to yourself \u201cimma buy $CLF at 21.83\u201d. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you\u2019re trading, there\u2019s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You\u2019ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Emotional Exits\n\nThis concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. **The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it\u2019s potential gains, step away from the trade.** You\u2019re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There\u2019s a very high chance you\u2019re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn\u2019t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you\u2019ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to \u201cdiamond hands-ing\u201d your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou need to be conscious of the fact that you\u2019re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there\u2019s no going back. You\u2019re not trading on fundamentals, and you\u2019re not trading on technicals either. You\u2019re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it\u2019s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that\u2019s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nAll in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader. I hope this writeup was informative and useful to you all! **If you want some more in depth explanations of each concept, alongside some detailed examples, refer to my Options Trading Exit Strategies video, which you can find [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ)** If you have any questions, feel free to drop em below and I'll do my best to help you out!
