Well, it simply isn\u2019t, and any stock that gets a DD here which includes \u201cwell citadel is short and the float is 40%\u201d might as well be thrown out of the window.\n\nInvest in ideas on why the company might intrinsically grow. Is it a good business, is it cash flowing, is it growing revenues organically, is there a lot of dilution, how strong is the balance sheet, what unique problems is the business solving. There are the questions that every investor should be asking, no matter if they are a growth or value investors.\n\nStop trying to become the next DFV - this was a very rare opportunity in which he capitalized, it most likely won\u2019t happen again in the near term future. \n\nThere is a reason why WSB was a very good predictor of good plays prior to the meme mania, and why it is not anymore. There are no original ideas popping up, everyone is recycling the same bullshit DD built up in nothing more than \u201chey this company is partnering with this company\u201d, \u201chey shitadel and mevlin are short this, let\u2019s fuck them one more time\u201d, \u201clook at the **pattern**, it has to go up\u201d. \n\nIf you don\u2019t think that funds adjusted their risk models to account for potential short squeezes and hedge accordingly, you should not be in the finance markets, especially trying to go toe to toe with the big boys. \nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/ken-griffins-citadel-flagship-hedge-fund-returns-8percent-in-september-during-market-sell-off.html\n\nThere is a reason why in the past half a year majority of people here lost money, the same strategy that worked once might not work again - the ability to constantly adapt and create unique opportunities based on research you do yourself is what makes you rich, not ganging up on a stock that is shorted and trying to pump it. \n\nI frankly just want to help out new investors who are still passionate in the markets - I\u2019ve been here since 2017, and back then people would have original perspectives based on proprietary research and unique strategies, not the same strategy recycled 1000 times.",

        "selftext": "I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven\u2019t counted it up, but it\u2019s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I\u2019m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I\u2019d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. \n\nThese are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.\n\n**Understand the Trading Environment**\n\nOne mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.\n\n**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can\u2019t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. \n\nIn between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that\u2019s more likely to pull back.  It\u2019s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).\n\nI try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don\u2019t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. \n\n**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**\n\nThe sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it\u2019s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.\n\nLast year\u2019s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don\u2019t bet against this trend, it\u2019s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I\u2019m dirt. \n\nLast year you couldn\u2019t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. \n\nOne of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don\u2019t overpay for the options, it works. I don\u2019t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I\u2019m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.\n\n**Make The VIX Your Friend**\n\nThe VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It\u2019s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. \n\nAnother interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don\u2019t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I\u2019ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. \n\n**Selecting Trades &amp; Investments**\n\n**Have an Allocation Plan**\n\nThe first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:\n\n* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.\n* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It\u2019s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.\n* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.\n* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. \n* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It\u2019s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I\u2019ll let you know in 10 years if it works.\n* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  \n* 1% in other things I can\u2019t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.\n\n**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**\n\nUnless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. \n\nI\u2019ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. \n\nMy favorite tools to use are Zack\u2019s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack\u2019s VGM measures a stock\u2019s value, growth rate, and momentum. It\u2019s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what\u2019s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. \n\nThe list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.\n\nA friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don\u2019t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there\u2019s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it\u2019s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   \nI use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn\u2019t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it\u2019s because there\u2019s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&amp;P but haven\u2019t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they\u2019d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn\u2019t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.\n\nI use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.\n\nFidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.\n\n**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**\n\nIf you\u2019ve invested actively for a while, you\u2019ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. \n\nI\u2019ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What\u2019s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. \u201cGoldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode\u201d), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. \n\nI am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.\n\n**Good Things Come in Pairs**\n\nJust about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I\u2019ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it\u2019s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. \n\nSimilarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it\u2019s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.\n\n**Exercise Financial Discipline**\n\nEven when I\u2019ve been successful picking investments, I\u2019ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We\u2019ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That\u2019s usually the moment I\u2019ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:\n\n1. Take Profits Often.   \nWhen an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  \nIf you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn\u2019t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  \n\n2. Fail Fast.   \nIf the option price sinks to -50% in value, it\u2019s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there\u2019s negative news driving this, I\u2019m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  \n\n3. Profit Both Ways.   \nIf a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \\~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year\u2019s returns for Visa.  \n\n4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   \nI have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should\u2019ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  \nOn the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don\u2019t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don\u2019t chase the perfect trade. It\u2019s a white whale. Just make money.  \n\n5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   \nThis is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn\u2019t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   \nSo if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there\u2019s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",

        "selftext": "I'll get straight to the point. **Everyone,** and I mean **EVERYONE**, is hunting down that next 'GME/AMC' style squeeze.\n\nThey want to be in it 'early'. They want to be on the cusp of the 'next big squeeze', and join the ranks of those who 'HODL'd GME and AMC over the past year.\n\nThis is easy to see. Flocks of people move from stock to stock as soon as it gets mentioned. They want to match the 'ape monicker' and get creative marketing names 'Spartans, Progs, etc.. to match the 'ape community' that was formed.\n\nWhen in reality, these squeezes are far and few between.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I have made money off these constant rotations. That aside, this is my FAVORITE play and the one I have put the most effort into... $SDC.\n\n**Here are my thoughts on why I believe $SDC has what it takes to take on the Meme title and join GME and AMC as a true meme-style rally/squeeze.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1.** **SDC has been well known:**\n\n**$SDC** already has a huge amount of exposure. When it comes to short squeezes, exposure is EVERYTHING. You NEED people to **actually know** about the company. On top of that, you need volume and price action to work in your favor to apply pressure (via increased share price, margin requirements, and cost to borrow) against the opposing short positions. $SDC **has** this exposure. It's highly talked about, and you have tons of eyes on the sidelines. A simple 5+% move like today can suddenly cause a MASSIVE shot in upwards sentiment. It gets everyone to FOMO in and turns what was a 5% day into a 15% day almost immediately.\n\n**2. Management Favors Retail:**\n\nManagement is in RETAILS FAVOR. I will say this OVER and OVER again. BECAUSE GME's management favored retail and because AMC's management favored retail, that is the TRUE reason these stocks had the momentum they did. These companies put RETAIL FIRST. Yes, AMC had to raise capital, but they did that WITH transparency to retail. AND, they did that AFTER MOST RETAIL made a KILLING riding the stock to almost $40. If you haven't been paying attention $SDC is on retails side. Just like Adam Aron, SDC's CFO is making constant retail appearances and inviting retail to ask questions to get them involved. Retail only wins, if, AND ONLY IF, the company works WITH retail; not against.\n\nOn top of that we, DON'T want dilution when we have the momentum of a squeeze. SDC has made it clear they don't plan to dilute on retail. Even when they had to do a dilution round in the past they made sure there was a clause that the stock had to go up 100% from that current price before the dilution could be realized. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED. We need a stock/management team that puts retail first, and I believe SDC has that checked as well.\n\n**3. Fundamentals Matter on Psychology**\n\nFUNDAMENTALS. Now, don't tell me fundamentals don't matter in a squeeze. They do. At the very least, the COMPANY/STOCK behind the squeeze does. There is a psychological play in every squeeze. As the price goes up, more and more people are making profits. On the flip side, as the price goes down, more and more people are losing money. Why did AMC and GME squeeze? **THEY DIDN'T SELL**.\n\nYou can't tell me the fact that there was nostalgia for your childhood GameStop, or the fact that people were excited to get out of these pandemic lockdowns, and go back to the movies, didn't have a HUGE effect on the psychological sentiment behind these stocks? You **knew** the companies you were buying and trying to squeeze, and they gave you/them confidence.\n\nWhen stock is down, your **CONVICTION** is what keeps you from selling. You have to know **WHAT YOU OWN**. If you're playing a squeeze on some penny stock you have never heard of before now, **YOU CAN'T TELL ME** you will have a high conviction when things go south. **NO-ONE** wants to be the one holding a bag of a no-name company if a squeeze doesn't turn out and the stock drops.\n\nThis is another reason I love $SDC. **PEOPLE KNOW WHO THEY ARE.** Unless you are living under a rock or didn't watch any tv AT ALL during the pandemic these past 2 years, you have seen a Smile Direct Club ad. I'm not saying Smile Direct has the nostalgia, GME or AMC have/had. But they for sure have more retail confidence and or more well know (as as company) than any of the most recent 'brand new' squeeze plays of late.\n\nYou cant tell me you had ANY idea what/who some of these random squeeze companies were prior to the squeeze play being called out. And this is VERY important. Have you noticed SDC has had a cult-like following DESPITE dropping 20% over the past few weeks? People are dropping hundreds of thousands if not MILLIONS into this company with the conviction that it's going up because **THEY KNOW** what/who the company actually is.\n\nLong story short, the better a company is known, the more confident the average trader will feel when it dips. The more confident = less selling. less selling on a short squeeze = \ud83c\udf19.\n\n4. **Fundamentals are debatable (fundamentals continued)...**\n\nThe fundamentals are debatable. This is a follow up to number 3.\n\nAMC and GME had 'debatable fundamental value. They didn't have 100% of people thinking AMC and GME were going to turn the boat around and make a profitable company (hence why they were so shorted). It took VISION, vision that they COULD have a future. And that 'potential' allowed people to speculate, and in turn, allowed them to confidently buy the stock.\n\nSDC has that same 'speculative' future. 50% of people see its potential... how it has SO MUCH growth potential for SO MUCH more, especially when compared to ALGN. On the flip side, you have 'every dentist and their dog' bashing the company and saying why it's going to fail. The similarities to that of GME and AMC (when they were trading in the $5's) isn't lost on me. People also said they were going **NOWHERE** and that people on this sub were throwing money in the garbage. Look at them now.\n\n**5. Stats**\n\n**The float, short interest etc...:**\n\nOne thing I have seen said over and over \"the float is too big to move\". That is a **BUNCH OF SH$\\*.**\n\nThe float is around **100M**. AMC's was **NEAR 500M**. You give $SDC 1/5 of the volume and attention that $AMC had and your golden. That aside, you **DONT WANT A LOW FLOAT STOCK**. If a company has a float of say 20M and has 50% short interest. That means there are only 10 million shares on loan/shorted.\n\nIf a stock has having 100M+ in volume a day, shorts could cover in literally an hour if they wanted (not days) and no one would even know from the buying pressure. On top of that, you cant tell me shorts are '**really sweating**' when there are only 10 million shares of stock (lets say its trading at say $2), and the CTB is going up. That's only 20 million dollars to be short 50% of this hypothetical penny stocks float.\n\nThey have less capital at risk, '*less skin in the game*', on these low float stocks. Yes, they can pop fast, but they can be shorted down JUST AS FAST. The risk just isn't there, and the momentum DIES FAST AS WELL.\n\nWhy do you think it has been SO HARD to bring down AMC and GME once they FINALLY started to have MAJOR momentum. **THE BIG FLOAT!** A big float will make it **HARDER** to bring a squeeze down once the squeeze is in motion. On top of that, they have **WAYYYY** more money at risk. In the case of $SDC 45.86 MILLION Shares. At $6 a share, that's **229 million dollars** on the line. **OVER** **1/4 BILLION dollars** they are having to pay over 250% CTB on. Now that, **THAT**, can make shorts think twice. That can actually make a dent in their hedge funds bankroll. **That is what we NEED.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ghndfe38cqr71.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7719dbe2c935c68213bff6d1d0eb1cbfe10040f\n\nAnyway, all in all, these are just a FEW the reasons I think $SDC can join the ranks of $GME and $AMC. I have made other posts going over the companies fundamentals, future outlook as a 'long play' etc.. But this is about its *MEME-ability*. It has all the potential, now it just needs the retail movement. Are you going to be on the right side of this play? Are you going to 'get in early',? just like you wished you did with AMC and GME? If we play our cards right we have the control here. Just BTFD and hold on tight! \ud83d\udc8e \ud83e\udd1a\n\n**tl;dr: $SDC has management that is on the side of retail. The company is well known and has all the components of becoming the next big meme rally next to AMC and GME. So BTFD (but this isn't financial advice) \ud83d\ude09**\n\n.....\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n**IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ JUST, BUY AND HODL TO THE MOON \ud83c\udf19!!! WE DESERVE OUR TENDIES!** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n.... (again not financial advice) \ud83d\ude09!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: This is not dd. This is opening a discussion for a certain factor of the gme report that is causing controversy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a lot of speculation about whether the GME report suggests that shorts have not closed. The core of this comes down to the seeming disparity between this figure 5 and figure 6 of the report.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2pvs79nfdu71.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acd07db860fbef8fa7ca174479e2292812df46b3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ssomo32zfdu71.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24fd26f5e629a2e944ecac2ae22c4a937b1263b9\n\nThe figure 5 graph suggests that short interest fell by as much a 30% pre-new year which corresponds to a necessary buy volume of 21 million shares. Yet, when we look at figure 6, the cumulative buy volume by short-sellers doesn't seem to come close. Additionally, by feb 12 the short interest was reported around 30% (according to marketbeat) which translates to an almost 100% drop in si. A drop that big would require an average short buy volume of 4.4 million per day (70 mil/16 days). Yet figure 6 shows data not even close to that figure. This would imply extremely high levels of covering between febuary 5th and febuary 12th which doesn't seem reflected in the price action over that period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do the 'apes' say: Many individuals who are bullish on gme believe that this is evidence that the short interest data being reported is faulty in some manner. They believe that the low penalties for misrepresenting short interest are causing short hedge funds to underreport their positions. We all know that the short interest heavily affects the price movement of GameStop so this has some plausibility. Others suggest that the positions are being hidden through ftds or option tomfoolery. This is potentially less plausible because the reports specifically talks about ftds and it seems like they would have mentioned options if they could hide shorts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do the gay bears say: Many gay bears have generally responded by arguing that the 'apes' are seeing largely what they want to see. The report clearly states that the shorts covered and that the short interest is low (relatively speaking). Why would the SEC do something convoluted like make conflicting graphs? 'Apes' are being conspiratorial and are interpreting it wrong if they are getting such a bizarre result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your interpretations of this data? I want to move the dialogue from unhelpful comment fights to here. (Any math I do is meant to be generally illustrative not 100% accurate)",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI did put a lot of research into the current situation for quite some time and finally build a portfolio I am 100% behind long-term. However, the more I learned, the more sure I am that we will experience a market crash rather soon, than late.\n\nI am not here to debate whether or not you think this is true, but the situation for this thought game is that we might see a crash similar in numbers, not principle like 2008' all over again.In general, during times of high inflation, most businesses will not come out well. The earnings will go up, but they need to put more money into their own business to even stay in the same place. A hedge for this are companies that can easily scale their business without needed money flow. I am looking at you Facebook, who can place 10% more ads, Adobe who can increase their product price without fear of losing customers, Apple, Microsoft...\n\nThe theory behind this discussion would assume that GameStop is a good hedge and to some degree AMC as well, I even heard that from the high ups in a very big, german bank, which is incredibly weird since they were against it months ago and did not even want to talk about it in the first place. This assumes that the crash is happening because of said theory I explained below in short in an edit. It does not mean that a high percentage of the entire portfolio should persist of them, but a chunk just in case might be a very good idea. The market is more complex than many think.\n\nAnother hedge and long term hold can not be mentioned in this sub, but you might guess what it is. Sadly, we cant debate this here. Has to do with weird blocks and tokens, latter of which might change the whole gaming industry and I am thankfully in the position where I can take constant profits from it in percentages that sound absolutely insane.\n\nSo, in case of this **theoretical** scenario, I would like to get everyone's opinion on this. I want to be clear, I value every single opinion and would love the most input possible. In case of no crash, my investments should grow steadily, but in case of a crash due to named circumstance, they would skyrocket. Again, this is purely theoretical, I do not want to discuss whether or not it is happening, but what you would do in case it will happen in the near future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: How would you hedge against a potential market crash ala 2008 due to Evergrande + GameStop and the overall situation?**\n\n*Since I got downvoted to hell on a different subreddit for even mentioning GME and spreading the word, I will add the theory behind GameStop again, even though most of you might know this already.*\n\n*The theory: The most part of the stock is traded in Dark Pools and all the shorting Hedge Funds are telling us that they closed their position, which is mathematically impossible. Do the research yourself. So, what I think is happening, is that all the shorts are actually synthetic and not real shares. There is tons and tons of proof of it, too much to even deny at this point. They exercise and sell deep ITM calls in order to get the FTDs. So basically, they are passing them from one to another, to another.*\n\n*Think of it like this, a good analogy I found: You get a credit card with 10.000$ on it, max it out and have to repay next month. However, you have endless credit cards, so you can get another credit card and \"pay\" the 10.000$ with that. The debt is still there, its just getting passed. You can do that forever. Now you need more money, so you do this all over again and keep digging the grave deeper and deeper. In this theory, multiple times the float and continuing. In order to stop that, you have to lock the float entirely, which is why everyone is currently directly registering their shares. IF this is true, I do not have to explain the potential outcome. There is simply too much proof as that I can deny that at all.*\n\n*Computershare confirmed this:Quote from their Twitter: \"Shares held directly on the books of US companies through a transfer agent are not held at DTCC. As such, shares are not available to be loaned for any means within the security markets. Computershare is a registered transfer agent &amp; therefore does not lend shares in any capacity\"*\n\n*I need to admit I am a bit disappointed by the negative response from a lot of people, but I would like to keep this open and come back one year later, I will simply take all the downvotes from here. I will still read everything and appreciate any opinion on the topic.*\n\n*Cheers, have a nice week everyone!*",

        "selftext": "Hi, gang. Non-ape here. Never been in GME, never posted about it. Mostly hate ape culture and rhetoric and have largely abandoned WSB for greener pastures because of it. \n\nHOWEVER. Was looking at the GME chart today, wanting to see how it held up during the current downturn. That's when I noticed something interesting. Whenever GME gets beaten down, it tends to spend a couple of months fighting a descending-triangle-shaped downtrend. It eventually battles out of that trend, and initially the progress is slow. BUT...once it recaptures a major DMA support, it RUNS LIKE HELL at some point in the  next 1-5 days. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[IT'S COMING \\(?\\)](https://preview.redd.it/b5bvcut0hgt71.png?width=4187&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fa893791f975f6b0e9e922964bc3c509f23597d)\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Well, because today it broke out above both the 20 and the 50 DMAs. Could be nothing. But, this is WSB. So, I'm going to buy some fucking 1dte options and see what happens. \n\nPositions: 50 195c 10/15",

        "selftext": "So many ppl lost money in all the tickers, cause we retails are divided by the hedgies, look what happen with GME and AMC.  We won because we are focus. I have cashed out all my earnings to all in on PSFE because the exact same scenario is happening. I all in in GME at 30 and it rose to 300. I've put my capital in AMC at 3 and it rose to 70. PSFE is the next GME, igaming revenue up 70%, transactional volume up 41%, no pipe is selling but stocks tank to 7 from 19.\n\nRecently I bought in affirm at 60, when it got shorted down from 100, good news happened and it rose 100%. We all want the next AMC and I am quite certain PSFE is the next. It monopolize Canada's igaming market by having a 100% share and 75% share in the US. All of the big betting players are a client of PSFE.\n\nNone of the pipe has sold here, bill foley with 30m shares, dan loeb with 41m shares. Blackrock just bought in at 8.3m shares at $12. This will explode soon. Shorts are trapped with &gt;10% float just like AMC was when it was at $8.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09EV/Rev ratio : $83.91EV/FCF ratio : $87.86Average: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :\u00a0$50.75EV/Rev ratio :\u00a0$44.64EV/FCF ratio :\u00a0$44.18Average : $46.52\n\n\\- Paysafe Powers Online Payments for Montana Lottery\u2019s Sportsbook\n\n\\- Paysafe Streamlines Payments for Interactive Wagering With Fubo Gaming in US\n\n\\- bunq Partners With Paysafe to Enable Cash Deposits for Digital Banking\n\n\\- Paysafe Expands Betfred USA Sports Partnership Through Income Access Deal\n\n\\- Paysafe Completes Acquisition of PagoEfectivo\n\n\\- Paysafe to Acquire viafintech\n\n\\- Paysafe to Acquire SafetyPay\n\nPaysafe acquire these companies in cash unlike Square and Paypal with stocks. These means the shareholders and board think its undervalued. Many of the buyers are stucked in at $12. I am in at $9 with 35k shares. Affirm has 2x since. I bought AMC at $12 sit to $5 and rose to $60.\n\nThis is not financial advice, do your own DD. But this just might be the next netflix. :)",

        "selftext": "I want to highlight one of Citadel's and Susquehanna's recent short plays as new 13F filings indicates they are making a large short play on Tilray (TLRY).\n\nThere's been a few discussions on WSB along with several other Subs on questionable price actions on a number of stocks including TLRY. A good amount of these questionable price actions can be spotted just by looking at the 1-minute to 5-minute price charts with volume. You can see that volume is generally consistent throughout the day but as the price gets closer to a major support price level, sudden extremely large sell orders tend to appear out of nowhere just to push the price through support and then suddenly disappear. I started to notice this issue for TLRY about 2 months ago as it wasn't the case earlier. \n\nI sense that this has to do with short sellers so I started to do a little digging and this is what I have found: \n\n[Yes, Citadel is involved](https://preview.redd.it/5ndscitmpvq71.png?width=1681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1585a48c981e8a67d2651a38e98c85c8fba624bc)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pb2a11dopvq71.png?width=1624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5c88604ec72975d95b17b6aba7534ebd85627b3\n\nAs indicated above, both Citadel and Susquehanna have started taking large short positions in TLRY. Keep in mind that these companies are required to file 13Fs within 45 days of their transactions and as these numbers were only the disclosures in August (Which was when these mini sell volume spikes started), the total short interest amounts could currently be considerably higher. It is also publicly known that institutional short sellers have been reducing their short positions before short interest filing dates and increasing back their short positions after the filing date in order to stay under the radar. Who wants to bet that these guys are actually doing that? \n\nKeep in mind this is also a double edged sword, as they will be more vulnerable to a short squeeze. \n\nI also want to highlight that Bank of America this morning just randomly downgraded CGC (One of Tilray's Top Peers) pushing the entire sector down. This is at the same time when other analysts actually upgraded CGC which makes BOA's rating stand out quite a bit. As you can see BOA above just started to increase its short positions in Tilray in August as well. \n\nIt seems that TLRY is the biggest target in the public cannabis space since it is the most liquid and actually traded on a real American exchange with the largest volume in the space. This is why even though nothing but good news is coming out of Tilray and the cannabis sector overall, the stock goes down on times when it shouldn't. \n\nThese are the people are you are playing against and as we know from stocks like GME or AMC, companies like Citadel just don't play fair.",

        "selftext": "Do you know about AAPL, the original cult stock?\n\nWell, it\u2019s now the largest company in the world.\n\nThe AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. \n\nDIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant.\n\nLet's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to r/pcmasterrace or other similar places, the cult vibe is relentless and unending. Their only position being: INTC and Epic(private company) bad. AMD, NVDA, Valve daddies good.\n\nAnd look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult!\n\nOf course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE.\n\nCult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical.\n\nI am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC.\n\nAMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.\ud83d\ude02\nINTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction.\n\nBut does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals.\n\nIt\u2019s supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think).\n\nAlso, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevator valuation is highly likely.\n\n\nNow, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything?\nIf the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. \n(I am not saying you shouldn\u2019t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult)\n\nAs long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely.\n\nWith all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making.

        "selftext": "I get it, the idea of $ASTS seems too good to be true. When you hear people saying it could be a 10x, or a 100x, yet the shares don\u2019t budge, it\u2019s easy to just file it as \u201cmust be a pump.\u201d Do employees think it\u2019s a pump? Where you see top technical talent betting with their careers, it\u2019s useful to see what type of people are joining a pre-revenue company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3olke9lzus71.png?width=842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d54df62bfdd5ffdec00a3c24fa4d078cc533977\n\nA key aspect when analyzing a pre-revenue venture capital bet like $ASTS is to focus on the Company\u2019s success at building its team and attracting \u201cA\u201d talent. $ASTS is effectively a Series C stage company and if it\u2019s legit, we should see a steady flow of talent joining the company. Think about it from the perspective of a talented engineer \u2013 would you go join a company that was going to flop? If you were a radio frequency PhD or a satellite payload specialists, you\u2019d have an informed view on whether this project would work and whether you\u2019d want to join the company. The best positioned companies with the best prospects should attract talent like a tractor beam. These people aren\u2019t reading Reddit, they are learning about an opportunity from industry and deep technical perspectives\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dcncyzkmzus71.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83c5c6f2f4433919f312baa5116c144e9f60b8d2\n\nLet\u2019s start with some of the more recent hires, who necessarily get less equity and therefore require more certainty of outcome to join. Let\u2019s meet Pat, who joined 5 months ago. Pat is a veteran, starting in the U.S. Airforce before spending 20+ years at Boeing and Raytheon and until recently, was at Blue Origin. Pat kept the F-18 fighter jet in the sky.  I bet he can keep something in orbit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ai1wlrnzus71.png?width=780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0985f8cbd484bfa6425c6cf6de570543f8b29747\n\nBut first\u2026this one\u2019s for all the single ladies\u2026let\u2019s meet Carl! Imagine your delight when you meet this Masters from John Hopkins in Space Systems Engineering and who casually says his day job is, \u201cMission Operations\u201d at a space company. So hot. Another poach from Blue Origin, as you\u2019ll soon see is a trend\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/szdb8rsozus71.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06796e728ed352da89ddce81fbed950c89e634fb\n\nBut since $ASTS is a massively spy satellite in the air, we know it wouldn\u2019t be complete unless it was attracting some hardcore Israelis into the org. Shalom, let\u2019s meet Ron. Ron joined 4 months ago from NextSilicon (which raised $200MM in VC money). Trading one VC rocket ship for another? Interesting question since Ron was making a calculation on personal upside and would have been in an equity position in his old job. Ron will be working on $ASTS\u2019s semiconductors for mass production of the Blue Birds. We unfortunately cannot show Ron\u2019s face. Mossad rules!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7vsvyaypzus71.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52b37cd514bb34c59c16ad137c259a9616fb37e3\n\nLet\u2019s get back to an issue near and dear to my heart: low taxes. Let\u2019s meet Jose, who lives in America\u2019s own tax haven\u2026MIAMI!!! No surprise that Jose is an accountant. This is an interesting hire \u2013 as a former PwC partner, Jose has already made a lot of money. He\u2019d also have a good network to prevent joining some loser company, e.g. Theranos. He\u2019s probably known CEO Abel for a long time and got the inside look on joining $ASTS. This hire also shows that $ASTS is building scale in its organization, not some placeholder finance team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kl0e2wzqzus71.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2de794eadaf1c5cdb9b09319bd54ed99eca6fe63\n\nSo $ASTS is already set to count the money, but how will they get their birds reliably in the air? DE-FENSE. DE-FENSE. Actually, defense. And not the opposite of offence, but actually just hiring a ton of people from the military complex where failure means death, or submission to a new Chinese overlord. In what amounts to a great online dating profile tag, John says about his time at defense contract, L3, \u201cI\u2019m here to ensure that our products function 100% of the time because our war righters rely on this equipment.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mr24h9xszus71.png?width=762&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92809091fcc2c64cbd2d61cfd05ec5154d56b0f9\n\nBut how will $ASTS actually build satellites? Who knows, TLDR. Kidding\u2026Ken knows the answer. Ken has excelled throughout his career with the top operational jobs at large defense companies. This guy has been at the top of companies that cannot fail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3hxnp9kuzus71.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16a40fd6e14e7777718be563c36bbb7e728cbfdd\n\nLet\u2019s go back to a blast from the past\u2026the BP oil spill. Were you one of those people tied to the webcam watching oil bellow out? If you were, you\u2019d know that subsea oil operations make space look easy. Meet Andrea. Trained at Shell, she went on to make sure Jeff Bezos had a nice trip to \u201cspace.\u201d\\* Another Blue Origin alumnus bailing for the promising pastures of $ASTS\n\n\\*not really space\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gz69y3uvzus71.png?width=696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50e024674f8321068a5487002395b772e9dfba61\n\nNever hurts to have some NASA alumnus, right? Let\u2019s meet Lee! After 20 years at Honeywell as Director of Space Computers, Lee went to Orbital and then NASA. In his bio, he notes, \u201cSpacemobile is up and available.\u201d Is it now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9qac81xzus71.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d99b3db487aefa38385c3b42f5caab81f666377b\n\nIt\u2019s becoming evident that Jeff Bezos needs to include free shipping for his Blue Origin employees because they are leaving to join $ASTS. Meet Lenny. Lenny hails from Blue Origin and its holiness SpaceX and is now part of the Spacemob. For those who don\u2019t know, the Spacemob wears these boots. That\u2019s how we know when we are among friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgjfoi7yzus71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65a07d5bf95d1b69caefb7a02f37a62f5ad6fc9e\n\nNow there\u2019s been a lot of FUD about whether ASTS\u2019s satellites will unfold. As such, it makes sense that ASTS would hire a few mechanical engineers. Let\u2019s Meet Justin, who had been the Director of Engineering at Northrup Grumman after a long career at Orbital. He\u2019s now $ASTS\u2019s Chief Mechanical Engineer. Let $ASTS spread its wings!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4b2iakfzzus71.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1399b6d93fcc27c58a8fa160b2662ab43c8d51bf\n\nOn this topic, when people ask how $ASTS will unfold its satellite, or question whether it\u2019s too big, well\u2026.Hui-Wen is laughing at you. This CTO launched 2.5 ton birds into the sky while you were still buying video games at $GME. His middle name is \u201cPayload Specialist.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xaqllja10vs71.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a4f2909151b4081862961d6353ec96d7944e8e3\n\nNow here\u2019s a real \u201cgotcha\u201d moment\u2026.Not so fast you paper-handed traders who sold $ASTS at $7 per share. Meet Mark, the VP of Engineering Programs at $ASTS. Mark is impressive. I\u2019ll bet on him. Seem like a guy whose next best job opportunity is at a Wendy\u2019s? I think not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r69d4dl20vs71.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96ec5761dc9f75e9b04e5ca05416f6dfa185b3ca\n\nSome people have a specialty they develop over the course of a career and leverage it for maximum impact. Let\u2019s meet Peter. Peter has a PhD in Satellite MIMO Radio Propagation. Can you imagine if Peter saw my original YOLO post on WSB and tried to make sense of the world? Separately, Peter\u2019s wife was psyched when he got a new job so he\u2019d move all this sh\\~t out of their living room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z7tbe6s40vs71.png?width=582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51965698108bca1a3bf313787eaebcbb5507153d\n\nSo we have a lot of smart engineers. Maybe they just like to build stuff but have no idea how to make money. Glad you asked. Let\u2019s meet Scott. This senior Barclays banker is rumored to have resigned and joined $ASTS by calling his superiors via the Bluewalker experimental satellite phone, \u201cNew phone, dis Scott from Space\u2026I\u2019m out.\u201d Legend. Scott had been $ASTS\u2019s banker so would have seen all the DD. When a banker quits his job to join his client, you should probably take note. He\u2019s got better information than you do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flc5isw50vs71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6f18844e8c46c909c7abafd5159cc31c65a3595\n\nNow it\u2019s time to get serious. Dr. Zhi Zhong, who goes by John, is not a newbie to space. He\u2019s not \u201cfiguring it out\u201d on the job. Remember when ET wanted to phone home? The Dr. was still getting his PhD, but he has since figured out how to make it happen. Glad the doctor is on call! Check out his own words on $ASTS in the blurb below. John brings a nuke to a knife fight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i625uw870vs71.png?width=667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4771b7c1cc7a22087485701c0abef54e529f8821\n\nAnd finally, we end with the big enchilada. When aliens ask to be taken to our leader, they will be taken to Dr. Ray. Ray is an MIT PhD and former professor who is now the Chief Scientist at $ASTS. I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say that we have some elite talent here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u5rr4f590vs71.png?width=689&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cbf9737cccba6642504ca2034eebe1c2aae7c48\n\nAnd there is your overview on what type of talent $ASTS has been able to attract. It helped me understand whether others who have true technical competence saw the same opportunity that I saw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65i59x6a0vs71.png?width=674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f0dde056c6e1a64a4c0edd878b5e36b60aeebbf\n\nWhat\u2019s my angle here? I own a lot of stock, have held it for \\~10 months, and look forward to the story unfolding. Retail investors come and go, but for those who are looking to better understand a potentially great long-term story, I hope the above helps de-mystify a stock that\u2019s pitched with \u201chuge upside\u201d yet can sometimes be lumped in with a lot of other stocks.\n\nI'm not a financial advisor but just wanted to share some of my own work as I research this stock.\n\nProof of position below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tic7kd9b0vs71.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dd574b6e8289b114fced9cab33059c84d12a67a",

        "selftext": " So far, I have only covered the possibility of short squeeze of $SDC (see link below in previous post)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pymseb/sdc\\_cost\\_to\\_borrow\\_just\\_picked\\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pymseb/sdc_cost_to_borrow_just_picked_up/)\n\nBut there is something more important than that.\n\nThere are many stocks that show the possibility of a short squeeze,\n\nbut among them, there are reasons why we should focus on $SDC and invest a lot.\n\nAs discussed in the previous post, the data on the short squeeze was the most perfect with $PROG, but the most important reason is the value and potential of the company.\n\nMany institutions hold stocks at an average unit price of $10 or more.\n\nI would like to write an opinion and analysis on why SDC became the target of short selling and why the judgment of short selling is wrong.\n\n==================================\n\n**contents**\n\n1. The Future Value of SmileDirectClub\n2. Issues with SmileDirectClub\n3. Danger\n4. Conclusion and Consideration\n\n==================================\n\n**1. The Future Value of SmileDirectClub**\n\n..**1). Trends for orthodontics (increasing demand)**\n\nBased on the growth of orthodontic-related companies, the demand for orthodontics is growing explosively around the world, and $SDC also has explosive growth potential in this trend.\u200b\n\nLet's take a look at some of the very important companies involved.\n\n....**(1). ALGN (Align Technology)**\n\n$ALGN is in the business of developing, manufacturing and selling orthodontic 3D printers.\n\nIt is amazing to see the growth of this company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cgme1ae094t71.png?width=1234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38e1a65da40402d87932df5be28bead49c928bb6\n\nThe stock price has risen 58527 % from its lowest point ($1.26) to the maximum ($737.45), and is currently at $643.56, up 51076 %.\n\nNumber of shares: 79.01 M\n\nMarket cap: 50803 M $\n\n....**(2). XRAY (Dentsplay Sinora)**\n\n$XRAY is also in the business of developing and selling dental equipment in addition to orthodontic 3D printers.\n\nThe growth rate of this company is also surprising.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xob4n5194t71.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d30b10c2d58957d678859f436b83ce5b798d70c\n\nIt reached the high of $69.54, which is 13120 % higher than the low of $0.53, and is now 10949% higher at $58.03.\n\nNumber of shares: 218.55 M\n\nMarket cap: 12682.46 M $\n\nIn addition to this, the main tickers are\n\n\\* Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC)\n\n\\* 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD)\n\netc., but I'll skip these.\n\nEven dental care/treatment around the world is expensive, so unless you are upper-middle class or higher, you have not been able to straighten your teeth well. In particular, there **were** many negative views on corrections for beauty.\n\nHowever, the explosive growth of orthodontic equipment companies,\n\nSeeing that orthodontic for beauty are now increasingly popular with the young generation in many countries,\n\nDemand for orthodontics has exploded in recent years and is expected to increase in the future.\n\n..**2). the importance of price**\n\nOrthodontic at SDC is generally much cheaper than actual visits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sy97rxb294t71.png?width=631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ee9eecc22555d2309e75ca6a39122f3252f29a4\n\nIn addition, due to the pandemic, masks have become commonplace and the frequency of going out has greatly decreased.\n\nAt this time when people are not showing their teeth, more and more people want to have orthodontic treatment, and SDC has a very strong advantage in this regard.\n\nFor this expensive orthodontic treatment to **become common**, it must not be too burdensome for the middle class to afford.\n\nAnd SDC is one of the most affordable solutions,\n\n**I think SmileDirectClub will lead the way among companies that make orthodontics universal for beauty in the future.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxia739394t71.png?width=1301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=199d252b1f65280620b3bf2f37e6eb325ceb4776\n\nGet a smile with just 3$ per day!\n\n..**3). Sales and operating profit**\n\nLet's look at the change in sales of $SDC.\n\nAnnual Sales Trend\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0f7mte3494t71.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ba5e57a124b05cc5714e50f822fe8bef84d6e15\n\nMonthly Sales Trend\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l1q6orp494t71.png?width=1245&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f956a9c60c70052624836f7a434ea3d1bf391d6\n\nSDC's quarterly sales are doing pretty well. I think this has a big impact on showing good results in marketing as well.\n\nSince this orthodontic treatment is highly likely to become a trend from the young generation, reviews and promotions through SNS will spread very quickly during the transition period when orthodontic treatment becomes common. In fact, SDC can easily find promotional materials on SNS, Youtube, and TV.\n\nPoor operating profit is one of the biggest causes of recent short selling attacks, and in fact, ignorant 'self-proclaimed analysts' cite operating profit as the reason for 'the reason you should not buy SDC'.\n\nBut the reason why the operating profit is currently poor is largely due to the cost of plant expansion, new patent development, and business expansion into new countries.\n\n\\--------------------ref----------------------------\n\nItem 2. Properties\n\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Nashville, Tennessee. We also lease our manufacturing facilities in Antioch, Tennessee and Columbia, Tennessee, where we expect to open a second manufacturing facility. We have 114 SmileShops across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Hong Kong, U.K., Germany, and Singapore all of which are either leased or licensed from our retail partners. Lastly, we lease our facility in San Jose, Costa Rica and our facility in Cartago, Costa Rica. Management believes the terms of the leases are consistent with market standards and were arrived at through arm\u2019s-length negotiation.\n\n( Reference : File number 21907839 , 10-Q, page : 52 )\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the 10-Q filing, the number of manufacturing plants and retail shops are increasing.\n\nIt is an accurate approach to the business core elements of the current SDC.\n\n\\---------------------ref------------------------------\n\nKey Business Metrics\n\nWe review the following key business metrics to evaluate our business performance:\n\nUnique aligner order shipments\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we shipped 374,982 and 453,053 unique aligner orders, respectively. Each unique aligner order shipment represents a single contracted member. We believe that our ability to increase the number of aligner orders shipped is an indicator of our market penetration, growth of our business, consumer interest, and our member conversion.\n\nAverage aligner gross sales price\n\nWe define average gross sales price (\u201cASP\u201d) as gross revenue, before implicit price concession and other variable considerations and exclusive of sales tax, from aligner orders shipped divided by the number of unique aligner orders shipped. We believe ASP is an indicator of the value we provide to our members and our ability to maintain our pricing. Our ASP for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1,797 and $1,771, respectively. Our ASP is less than our standard $1,950 price as a result of discounts offered to select members.\n\n( Reference : File number 21907839 , 10-Q, page : 57 )\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe core business element of SDC presented in 10-Q is to secure a large number of orders, and recently sales are good and capacity is increasing, so operating profit is negative.\n\n..**4). Alabama State Dental Association is so territorial but Fair Trade Commission recognized SDC business.**\n\nSDC was planning to expand into Alabama, but the Alabama Dental Association requested SDC to stop remote/visual orthodontic diagnosis and treatment, and SDC abandoned its expansion plan to Alabama.\n\nHowever, the Fair Trade Commission said that this was an unreasonable request and violated the antitrust law and that SmileDirectClub's business was justified as a result of a 5-0 vote.\n\n[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/alabama-board-dental-examiners-agrees-settle-ftc-charges-it](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/alabama-board-dental-examiners-agrees-settle-ftc-charges-it)\n\nAlabama Board of Dental Examiners Agrees to Settle FTC Charges that It Unreasonably Excluded Lower Cost Online and Teledentistry Providers from Competition\n\nTo settle FTC charges that its actions violated the antitrust laws, the Board of Dental Examiners of Alabama has agreed to stop requiring on-site supervision by licensed dentists of alignment scans of prospective patients\u2019 mouths seeking to address misaligned teeth or gaps between teeth.\n\nSDC is fighting these existing dental associations' territory and regulations,\n\nI sent an inquiry email to SDC regarding these.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q01nub1694t71.png?width=1581&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f132df1bdbf9f2a8d94bee213aa8cf7faa81178a\n\nIn this regard, SDC received a reply that it would deal with it in more detail when it released 3Q earnings.\n\n..**5). $SDC is the only Tele-Dentistry company listed on Nasdaq**\n\nThe link below is a list of US Tele-Dentistry companies, and SmileDirectClub is the only listed company.\n\n[https://www.beckersdental.com/teledentistry/36105-10-teledentistry-companies-to-know.html](https://www.beckersdental.com/teledentistry/36105-10-teledentistry-companies-to-know.html)\n\nThis means that there is no competition for $SDC in the Nasdaq market, there is sufficient liquidity to invest in marketing,\n\nIt is the best company that can monopolize a percentage of the Tele-Dentistry market.\n\n**2. Issues with SmileDirectClub**\n\n..**1). Legal issues with NBC ( CNBC ).**\n\nLast year, SDC filed a $2.85 billion lawsuit alleging that NBC deliberately distorted SDC.\n\n[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/smiledirectclub-sues-nbc-285-billion-1295347/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/smiledirectclub-sues-nbc-285-billion-1295347/)\n\nThe lawsuit is still ongoing. If SDC win, it is possible to secure a huge amount of funds with strong recognition.\n\n..**2). Short-Squeuze play on Reddit**\n\nBased on the content of my previous post about the possibility of short squeeze and the general information above, reports that I was trying to play a short squeeze on Reddit.\n\n[https://twitter.com/KristinaParts/status/1437884294249201669?s=19](https://twitter.com/KristinaParts/status/1437884294249201669?s=19)\n\nGME, AMC, and then SDC, MEMEs started to become popular.\n\n..**3). Analyst raises target price**\n\nBelow is Analyst's upward revision of the $SDC target price (starting price of $5.25 -&gt; target price of $11)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pz36eg/credit\\_suisse\\_analyst\\_matt\\_miksic\\_gives/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pz36eg/credit_suisse_analyst_matt_miksic_gives/)\n\n**3. Danger**\n\nThe short-term risks of SDC are hard to find out now. So let's take a look at three long-term risks.\n\n..**1). Risks from audits after exiting emerging growth companies**\n\nSDC, as an emerging growth company, receives exceptions from audits, and if sales exceed 1.08 B, it will be eliminated from the emerging growth company, and there is a high risk of being attacked by short selling according to financial reporting.\n\nIn fact, according to the investment prospectus of SDC, it is possible to speculate that the current sales are intentionally lowered to some extent because the company intends to take full advantage of the advantages of 'emerging growth companies'. It is a story of the distant future. No need to worry right now.\n\n..**2). Possibility of dilution of Class A common stock by pre-IPO investors**\n\nThe number of issued shares is 118.87 M , the current share price is 6.5 dollars, and the current market capitalization is 773 M $ ( 972 billion won).\n\nThe total number of diluted shares including pre-IPO investor volume (common share B) is 387,61 M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0v6zqi8894t71.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12cad7c7cf680cef8d008bb15a5db1ed0d64f51\n\nReference : 10-Q, page 1\n\nThe lock-up release date for common stock B was released on August 16, 19, 180 days after the submission of S-1.\n\nSo far, a total of 1.2M common stock B has been diluted with common stock A.\n\nClass A change: 104,825,858 -&gt; 118,869,656\n\nClass B change: 281,863,766 -&gt; 269,243,501\n\n**Even after the lockup was lifted, the conversion of common stock B to common stock A was only diluted by 4.5%, a small amount for a year and a half. Moreover, considering the diluted unit price (over $10), the current share price is $6.5, so the possibility of a share price decline due to the dilution of common stock B is very low.**\n\n..**3). Redemption of convertible bonds**\n\nThe convertible bonds issued on February 9, 21st had a conversion rate of 55.3710 shares per 1000$ conversion rate, and were converted to the common share A price of $18.06 per share.\n\nAccording to the contents of convertible bonds, the bill is due on February 1, 26, and from August 1, 25, the issuer of the note can request redemption.\n\nIn addition, according to the will of the company, from February 6, 24, if the stock price at that time is higher than the stock price when the bill was issued, early redemption is possible.\n\nTherefore, the possibility that SDC's common stock A will be diluted due to convertible bonds is a very distant future, and it is not something to be concerned about much at present.\n\n\\------------------------ref---------------------------------\n\nItem 1.01.\n\nEntry into a Material Definitive Agreement.\n\nIndenture and Notes\n\nOn February 9, 2021, SmileDirectClub, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) entered into an indenture (the \u201cIndenture\u201d), between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d), pursuant to which the Company issued $650,000,000 principal amount of the Company's 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The Company has also granted the initial purchasers of the Notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the Notes were first issued, up to an additional $97,500,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes (\u201cOption Notes\u201d). On February 9, 2021, the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase $70,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Option Notes.\n\nThe Notes will be the Company\u2019s senior, unsecured obligations and will be (i) equal in right of payment with the Company\u2019s existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company\u2019s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to the Company\u2019s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including our credit facility and trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\n\nThe Notes will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes will not accrete. The Notes will mature on February 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before August 1, 2025, noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after August 1, 2025, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its Class A common stock, at the Company\u2019s election. The initial conversion rate is 55.3710 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $18.06 per share of Class A common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a \u201cMake-Whole Fundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.\n\nThe Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time, and from time to time, on or after February 6, 2024 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company's Class A common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice. In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.\n\nIf certain corporate events that constitute a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then, then noteholders may require the Company to repurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company\u2019s Class A common stock.\n\n(Reference:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001775625/000110465921016943/tm214449d4\\_8k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001775625/000110465921016943/tm214449d4_8k.htm))\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**4. Conclusions and considerations**\n\n**$SDC This is on the movement, not a moment.**\n\nThe demand for orthodontics is explosively popular all over the world, and SDC is a company that has great advantages. It is also the largest company in the Tele-Dentistry industry and is the only listed company on Nasdaq.\n\nIn view of the move to continuously increase marketing and production capacity,\n\nSDC is a company with great potential to continue increasing its market share by leading the future Online &amp; Tele-Dentistry, and believes that its share price will rise by at least several hundred% in the next few years.\n\nWhen 3Q earnings are announced in November, no one knows whether the short selling will be more aggressive or if the results will exceed expectations and result in an earnings surprise.\n\nThere is one more thing to remember. Long position institutions have already formed strong support at $5, and there has never been any class B dilution near this price range. Therefore, we believe that the current share price is more safe than risky.\n\nIn the short term, there is a high possibility that the stock price will rise quickly due to the pressure on short selling.\n\nIf a squeeze occurs in order to maximize profits (to hold as many shares of $SDC as possible in the long term), as explained in Chapter 3. Risk, there is a factor that will decrease in the long run, so some of them will be forced to sell. , I think it would be good to collect stocks steadily over the long term.\n\nps.

        "selftext": "The stock market has definitely changed over the last year. Corruptions being put to light, borrowed stocks running out of inventory, and shit being thrown in every direction possible. But one thing ive seen the most from WSB since joining are the smoothed brained diaper boys who thought they could come here to make big bucks off of the next big meme. \n\nThese same diaper babies have now been complaining about losing gains because \u201cWSB said $WISH was the way to go and now im down $3k\u201d. If theres one thing that even im able to understand as fresh meat, its that WSB is not a place for financial advice. Its a zoo where the ape pen never gets it\u2019s shit cleaned out, so the retards have nothing better to do than to throw it against the wall.\n\nIf you came here to make big bucks off of the next meme stock, then you should only be looking into $GME and $AMC as those are the meme stocks you came here to make gains on. FUD is a bitch and you\u2019re the slut. You want to invest big into $CLOV because some \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bmade $10k on puts, thats on you. But dont bitch  later because you bought $4k in stocks then lost $3.5k two months after. Thats just the spirit of the thread.\n\nTL;DR: stop soiling yourself, take the diaper off and fling it at the nearest ape to your left.

        "selftext": " \n\nThe covid lockdown has cause a surge in interest for the stock market. Additionally the media coverage on AMC and GME cause a massive surge in users for WSB. This also breed a new toxic community of users that try to take advantage of investors that are still learning the ropes.\n\n**Where can you find these trading gurus?**\n\nTiktok, instagram, youtube and even reddit has a number of so called trading gurus that will try to lure to either their trading platform or discord server\n\n**What's the issue?**\n\nA number of these users will charge a ridiculous monthly or yearly fee to obtain \"signals\" for their plays. What's interesting about these signals is 90% of the time they will be too late to enter when they're posted. Additionally they will also usually never post a loss or simply ignore a stock that doesn't go up.\n\nIt should also be noted that a lot of these guys use paper accounts or photoshop investment pages to show millions in their investment account to lure the idea that they're always right.\n\nThere's servers that will sell bots that post plays and claim its their own when in reality its to have a server that has paying users.\n\n**Why is it bad to follow these guys?**\n\nYes, there can be some plays where you might hit, but it gives a falsified image and view on the market itself. You will not learn the fundamental skills needed and in fact, anyone can be these trading gurus if you understand the technical skills behind measuring a stock based on a chart. Remember everyone is a trading god in a bull market. A majority of these users will either delete everything or run away when a bear market comes.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAs a disclaimer, I am not a investor who is like these guys, but I've been trading enough that I was able to purchase my house, buy a new car and enjoy a better life with the gains, but this is only cause I did my DD and its a bull market.

        "selftext": "*This following was written by James Stafford of OilPrice.com and appeared in* Investment Watch Blog *on 2/7/21:*\n\nThere is a massive threat to our capital markets, the free market in general, and fair dealings overall. And no, it\u2019s not China. It\u2019s a homegrown threat that everyone has been afraid to talk about. Until now.\n\nHordes of new retail investors are banding together to take on Wall Street.\u00a0 They are not willing to sit back and watch naked short sellers, funded by big banks, manipulate stocks, harm companies, and fleece shareholders.\n\nThe battle that launched this week over GameStop between retail investors and Wall Street-backed naked short sellers is the beginning of a war that could change everything.\n\nIt\u2019s a global problem, but it poses the greatest threat to Canadian capital markets, where naked short selling\u2014the process of selling shares you don\u2019t own, thereby creating counterfeit or \u2018phantom\u2019 shares\u2014survives and remains under the regulatory radar because Broker-Dealers do not have to report failing trades until they exceed 10 days.\n\nThis is an egregious act against capital markets, and it\u2019s caused billions of dollars in damage.\n\nMake no mistake about the enormity of this threat: Both foreign and domestic schemers have attacked Canada in an effort to bring down the stock prices of its publicly listed companies.\n\nIn Canada alone, hundreds of billions of dollars have been vaporized from pension funds and regular, everyday Canadians because of this, according to Texas-based lawyer James W. Christian. Christian and his firm\u00a0are heavy hitters in litigation related to stock manipulation and have prosecuted over 20 cases involving naked short selling and spoofing in the last 20 years.\n\n*\u201cHundreds of billions have been stolen from everyday Canadians and Americans and pension funds alike, and this has jeopardized the integrity of Canada\u2019s capital markets and the integral process of capital creation for entrepreneurs and job creation for the economy,\u201d*\u00a0Christian told Oilprice.com.\n\n**The Dangerous Naked Short-Selling MO**\n\nIn order to \\[legally\\] sell a stock short, traders must first locate and secure a borrow against the shares they intend to sell. A broker who enters such a trade must have assurance that his client will make settlement.\n\nWhile \u201clong\u201d sales mean the seller owns the stock, short sales can be either \"covered\" or \"naked.\" A\u00a0*covered short*\u00a0means that the short seller has already \u201cborrowed\u201d or has located or arranged to borrow the shares when the short sale is made.\u00a0Whereas, a\u00a0*naked short*\u00a0means the short seller is selling shares it doesn\u2019t own and has made no arrangements to buy. The seller cannot cover or \u201csettle\u201d in this instance, which means they are selling \u201cghost\u201d or \u201cphantom\u201d shares that simply do not exist without their action.\n\nWhen you have the ability to sell an unlimited number of non-existent phantom shares in a publicly-traded company, you then have the power to destroy and manipulate the share price at your own will.\n\nAnd big banks and financial institutions are turning a blind eye to some of the accounts that routinely participate in these illegal transactions because of the large fees they collect from them.\u00a0These institutions are actively facilitating the destruction of shareholder value in return for short term windfalls in the form of trading fees. They are a major part of the problem and are complicit in aiding these accounts to create counterfeit shares.\n\nThe funds behind this are hyper sophisticated and know all the rules and tricks needed to exploit the regulators to buy themselves time to cover their short positions. According to multiple accounts from traders, lawyers, and businesses who have become victims of the worst of the worst in this game, short-sellers sometimes manage to stay naked for months on end, in clear violation of even the most relaxed securities laws.\n\nThe short-sellers and funds who participate in this manipulation almost always finance undisclosed \u201cshort reports\u201d which they research &amp; prepare in advance, before paying well-known short-selling groups to publish and market their reports (often without any form of disclosure) to broad audiences in order to further push the stock down artificially. There\u2019s no doubt that these reports are intended to create maximum fear amongst retail investors and to push them to sell their shares as quickly as possible.\n\nThat is market manipulation. Plain and simple.\n\nTheir MO is to short weak, vulnerable companies by putting out negative reports that drive down their share price as much as possible. This ensures that the shorted company in question no longer has the ability to obtain financing, putting them at the mercy of the same funds that were just shorting them. After cratering the shorted company\u2019s share price, the funds then start offering these companies financing usually through convertibles with a warrant attachment as a hedge (or potential future cover) against their short; and the companies take the offers because they have no choice left. Rinse and Repeat.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing madness, brokers are often complicit in these sorts of crimes through their booking of client shares as \u201clong\u201d when they are in fact \u201cshort\u201d. This is where the practice moves from a regulatory gray area to conduct worthy of prison time.\n\nNaked short selling was officially labeled illegal in the U.S. and Europe after the 2008/2009 financial crisis.\n\nMaking it illegal didn\u2019t stop it from happening, however, because some of the more creative traders have discovered convenient gaps between paper and electronic trading systems, and they have taken advantage of those gaps to short stocks.\n\nStill, it gets even more sinister.\n\nAccording to Christian, \u201cglobal working groups\u201d coordinate their attacks on specifically targeted companies in a \u201cMafia-like\u201d strategy.\n\nJournalists are paid off, along with social media influencers and third-party research houses that are funded by what amounts to a conspiracy. Together, they collaborate to spread lies and negative narratives to destroy a stock.\n\nAt its most illegal, there is an insider-trading element that should enrage regulators. The MO is to infiltrate a company through disgruntled insiders or lawyers close to the company. These sources are used to obtain insider information that is then leaked to damage the company.\n\nOften, these illegal transactions involve paying off \u201cinformants\u201d, journalists, influencers, and \u201cresearchers\u201d are difficult to trace because they are made from offshore accounts that are shut down once the deed is done.\n\nLikewise, the \u201cshorts\u201d disguised as longs can be difficult to trace when the perpetrators have direct market access to trading systems. These trades are usually undetected until the trades fail or miss settlement.\u00a0 At that point, the account will move the position to another broker-dealer and start the process all over again.\n\nThe collusion widens when brokers and financial institutions become complicit in purposefully mislabeling \u201cshorts\u201d as \u201clongs\u201d, sweeping the illegal transactions under the rug and off of regulatory radar.\n\n\u201cSpoofing\u201d and \u201clayering\u201d have also become pervasive techniques to avoid regulator attention. Spoofing, as the name suggests, involves short sellers creating fake selling pressure on their targeted stocks to drive prices lower. They accomplish this by submitting fake offerings in \u201clayers\u201d at different prices to create a mirage.\n\nFinally, these bad actors manage to skirt the settlement system, which is supposed to \u201cclear\u201d on what is called a\u00a0T+2 Basis. That means that any failed trades must be bought or dealt with within 3 days. In other words, if you buy on Monday (your \u201cT\u201d or transaction day), it has to be settled by Wednesday.\n\nUnfortunately, Canadian regulators have a hard time keeping up with this system, and failed trades are often left outstanding for much longer periods than T+2. These failing trades are constantly being traded to reset the settlement clock and move the failing trade to the back of the line. The failures of a centralized system\u2026\n\nAccording to Christian, it can be T+12 days before a failed trade is even brought to the attention of the IIROC (the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada)\u2026\n\n**Prime Brokers and Banks are Complicit**\n\nThis is one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest profit center and fines levied against them are merely a minor cost of doing business.\n\nSome banks are getting rich off of these naked short sellers. The profits off this kind of lending are tantalizing, indeed. Brokers are lending stocks they don\u2019t own for massive profit and sizable bonuses.\n\nThis layer of what many have now called a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d is the toughest for regulators to deal with, regardless of the illegal nature of these activities.\n\nPrime brokers lend cash account shares that are absolutely not allowed to be lent. They lend them to short-sellers in order to facilitate them in settling their naked shorts.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the regulators are in the dark on this. They are, in fact, handing out fines, left and right\u2014both for illegal lending and for mismarking \u201cshorts\u201d and \u201clongs\u201d to evade regulatory scrutiny. The problem is that these fines pale in comparison to the profits earned through these activities.\n\nAnd banks in Canada in particular are basically writing the rules themselves, recently making it easier (and legal) to lend out cash account shares.\n\nNor do law firms have clean hands. They help short sellers bankrupt targeted companies through court proceedings, a process that eventually leads to the disappearance of evidence of naked shorts on the bank books.\n\n\u201cHow much has been stolen through this fraudulent system globally is anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d says Christian, \u201cbut the number begins with a \u2018T\u2019 (trillions).\u201d\n\nThe list of fines for enabling and engaging in manipulative activity that destroys companies\u2019 stock prices may seem to carry big numbers from the retail investor\u2019s perspective, but they are not even close to being significant enough to deter such actions:\n\n\u2013 The SEC charged Citigroup\u2019s principal U.S. broker-deal subsidiary in 2011 with misleading investors about a $1 billion collateralized debt obligation (CDO) tied to the U.S. housing market. Citigroup had bet against investors as the housing market showed signs of distress. The CDO defaulted only months later, causing severe losses for investors and a profit of $160 million (just in fees and trading profits). Citigroup paid $285 million\u00a0to settle these SEC charges.\n\n\u2013 In 2016, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. agreed to pay\u00a0$15 million\u00a0to settle SEC charges that its securities lending practices violated federal regulations. To wit: The SEC found that Goldman Sachs was mismarking logs and allowed customers to engage in short selling without determining whether the securities could reasonably be borrowed at settlement.\n\n\u2013 In 2013, a Charles Schwab subsidiary was found liable by the SEC for a naked short-selling scheme and fined $8.2 million.\n\n\u2013 The SEC charged two Merrill Lynch entities in 2015 with using \u201cinaccurate data in the course of executing short sale orders\u201d, fining them $11 million.\n\n\u2013 And most recently, Canadian Cormark Securities Inc and two others came under the SEC\u2019s radar. On December 21, SEC instituted cease and desist orders\u00a0against Cormark. It also settled charges against Cormark and two other Canada-based broker deals for \u201cproviding incorrect order-making information that caused an executing broker\u2019s repeated violations of Regulation SHO\u201d. According to the SEC, Cormark and ITG Canada caused more than 200 sale orders from a single hedge fund, to the tune of more than $660 million between August 2016 and October 2017, to be mismarked as \u201clong\u201d when they were, in fact, \u201cshort\u201d\u2014a clear violation of Regulation SHO. Cormark agreed to pay a penalty of $800,000, while ITG Canada\u2014one of the other broker-dealers charged\u2014agreed to pay a penalty of $200,000. Charging and fining Cormark is only the tip of the iceberg. The real question is on whose behalf was Cormark making the naked short sells?\n\n\u2013 In August 2020, Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) was fined $127 million over civil and criminal allegations in connection with its role in a massive price-manipulation scheme.\n\nAccording to one Toronto-based Canadian trader who spoke to Oilprice.com on condition of anonymity,\u00a0*\u201ctraders are the gatekeeper for the capital markets and they\u2019re not doing a very good job because it\u2019s lucrative to turn a blind eye.\u201d*\u00a0This game is set to end in the near future, and it is only a matter of time.\n\n*\u201cThese traders are breaking a variety of regulations, and they are taking this risk on because of the size of the account,\u201d*\u00a0he said.\u00a0*\u201cThey have a responsibility to turn these trades down. Whoever is doing this is breaking regulations \\[for the short seller\\] and they know he is not going to be able to make a settlement. As a gatekeeper, it is their regulatory responsibility to turn these trades away. Instead, they are breaking the law willfully and with full knowledge of what they are doing.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cIf you control the settlement system, you can do whatever you want,\u201d*\u00a0the source said.\u00a0*\u201cThe compliance officers have no teeth because the banks are making big money. They over-lend the stocks; they lend from cash account shares to cover some of these fails \u2026 for instance, if there are 20 million shares they sold \u2018long\u2019, they can cover by borrowing from cash account shares.\u201d*\n\n**The Naked Truth**\n\nIn what he calls our \u201cominous financial reality\u201d, Tom C.W. Lin, attorney at law, details how \u201cmillions of dollars can vanish in seconds, rogue actors can halt trading of billion-dollar companies, and trillion-dollar financial markets can be distorted with a simple click or a few lines of code\u201d.\n\nEvery investor and every institution is at risk, writes Lin.\n\nThe naked truth is this: Investors stand no chance in the face of naked short sellers. It\u2019s a game rigged in the favor of a sophisticated short cartel and Wall Street giants.\n\nNow, with online trading making it easier to democratize trading, there are calls for regulators to make moves against these bad actors to ensure that North America\u2019s capital markets remain protected, and retail investors are treated fairly.\n\nThe recent GameStop saga is retail fighting back against the shorting powers, and it\u2019s a wonderful thing to see \u2013 but is it a futile punch or the start of something bigger? The positive take away from the events the past week is that the term \u201cshort selling\u201d has been introduced to the public and will surely gather more scrutiny.\n\nWashington is gearing up to get involved. That means that we can expect the full power of Washington, not just the regulators, to be thrown behind protecting the retail investors from insidious short sellers and the bankers and prime brokers who are profiting beyond belief from these manipulative schemes.\n\nThe pressure is mounting in Canada, too, where laxer rules have been a huge boon for manipulators. The US short cartel has preyed upon the Canadian markets for decades as they know the regulators rarely take action. It is truly the wild west.\n\nJust over a year ago, McMillan published\u00a0a lengthy report on the issue from the Canadian perspective, concluding that there are significant weaknesses in the regulatory regime.\n\nWhile covered short-selling itself has undeniable benefits in providing liquidity and facilitating price discovery, and while the Canadian regulators\u2019 hands-off approach has attracted many people to its capital markets, there are significant weaknesses that threaten to bring the whole house of cards down.\n\nMcMillan also noted that \u201cthe number of short campaigns in Canada is utterly disproportionate to the size of our capital markets when compared to the United States, the European Union, and Australia\u201d.\n\nTaking Wall Street\u2019s side in this battle,\u00a0Bloomberg notes that Wall Street has survived \u201cnumerous other attacks\u201d over the centuries, \u201cbut the GameStop uprising could mark the end of an era for the public short\u201d, suggesting that these actors are \u201clong-vilified folks who try to root out corporate wrongdoing\u201d.\n\nBloomberg even attempts to victimize Andrew Left\u2019s Citron Research, which\u2014amid all the chaos\u2014has just announced that it has exited the short-selling game after two decades.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. Short sellers, particularly the naked variety, are not helping police the markets and route out bad companies, as Bloomberg suggests.\u00a0**Naked short sellers are not motivated by moral and ethical reasons, but by profit alone.**\u00a0They attack good, but weak and vulnerable companies.\u00a0**They are not the saviors of capital markets, but the destroyers.**\u00a0Andrew Left may be a \u201ccasualty\u201d, but he is not a victim. Nor likely are the hedge funds with whom he has been working.\n\nIn a petition initiated by Change.org, the petitioners urge the SEC and FINRA to investigate Left and Citron Research, noting: \u201cWhile information Citron Research publishes are carefully selected and\u00a0distributed\u00a0in ways that do not break the law at first sight, the SEC and FINRA have overlooked the fact that Left and Citron gains are a result of distributing catalysts in an anticipation of substantial price changes due to public response in either panic, encouragement, or simply a catalyst action wave ride.\u00a0Their job as a company is to create the most amount of panic shortly after taking a trading position so they and their clients can make the most amount of financial gains at the expense of regular investors.\u201d\n\nOn January 25th, the Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce\u00a0published its final report for Ontario\u2019s Minister of Finance, noting that while naked short selling has been illegal in the United States since 2008, it remains a legal loophole in Canada. The task force is recommending that the Ministry ban this practice that allows for the short-selling of tradable assets without first borrowing the security.\n\nThe National Coalition Against Naked Short Selling \u2013 Failing to Deliver Securities (NCANS), which takes pains to emphasize that is not in any way against short-selling, notes: \u201cNaked short-selling transfers the risk exposure and the hedging expense of the derivatives market makers onto the backs of equity investors, without any corresponding benefit to them. This is fundamentally unfair, and must stop.\u201d ###\n\n**Have You Contacted Your Congressional Representative Regarding Illegal Naked Short-Selling?** [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockLaunchers/comments/ni4tos/have\\_you\\_contacted\\_your\\_congressional/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockLaunchers/comments/ni4tos/have_you_contacted_your_congressional/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

        "selftext": "See these links below with a recent examination by FINRA in August, and a recent transcript speech from a current SEC commissioner from a few days ago. It seems they're okay with retail traders trading options but want to look into options approval and highly leveraged positions taken by novice traders...somehow, and to quote the SEC commissioner directly:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Given these changes in market access, it may be that the options account approval rules are due for a review, and I look forward to thinking this through with my colleagues. I am also thinking about the implications of this phenomenon more broadly, particularly the consequences of increased numbers of retail investors using leveraged investment strategies subject to margin calls that they may not be able to meet. That may not come to pass, but, again, it\u2019s important to consider how to modernize our regulations to meet new trends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/targeted-examination-letters/targeted-examination-letter-option-account-opening-and-supervision](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/targeted-examination-letters/targeted-examination-letter-option-account-opening-and-supervision)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/crenshaw-2021-09-24?utm\\_medium=email&amp;utm\\_source=govdelivery#\\_ftn34](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/crenshaw-2021-09-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso see Barbara Roper here who was just added into the SEC's roster as Senior Advisor to the Chair who said the following on options trading + approval:\n\n \n\n&gt;There are a number of issues that are sure to get attention from regulators in the wake of the Robinhood/GameStop events. In particular, regulations related to payment for order flow, best execution, options trading and short selling seem like top candidates for a long-overdue review.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The issue that is of particular interest to me, however, is how regulators will go about updating our sales practice rules to apply to trading apps, like Robinhood, that incorporate psychological nudges and gamification to encourage conduct \u2014 like frequent trading and trading in options \u2014 that is profitable for the firm, but not necessarily good for its customers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those are practices a traditional broker could never recommend to the typical Robinhood customer under the sales practice rules. Robinhood argues, however, that it doesn't make recommendations, so the sales practice rules don't apply. Regulators will need to decide whether they agree and, if so, where the line lies between a \"nudge\" and a recommendation.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Long before the GameStop events raised the ante, Massachusetts regulators were already arguing in an enforcement action that at least some of Robinhood's features crossed that line. Even if regulators conclude that gamification and nudges aren't recommendations per se, they will still need to decide how those features should be regulated.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In our view, firms need to be held accountable for how they design their apps and platforms to ensure that investors aren't abused. I feel confident that issue will get the attention it deserves in coming months.\n\n[https://www.protocol.com/braintrust/financial-regulation-after-gamestop-robinhood?rebelltitem=5#rebelltitem5](https://www.protocol.com/braintrust/financial-regulation-after-gamestop-robinhood?rebelltitem=5#rebelltitem5)\n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Turning risk into a game  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \"The way the app is set up, gamification is used to nudge investors into those practices that are most profitable to Robinhood \u2013 frequent trading, trading on margin and trading options,\" said Barbara Roper,\u00a0director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer advocacy group. \"This is not remotely appropriate for unsophisticated, new investors.\"   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Roper said that if\u00a0a brokerage were really designing a system with the interest of the investor in mind, traders would face hurdles\u00a0before being able to trade options or trade on margin, which means trading with borrowed money. They would have to pass tests to make sure they understood the risks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Instead of that, they make it as easy as possible,\" she said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/02/18/robinhood-stock-wealthy-traders-gamestop-hearing-roaring-kitty/4442330001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/02/18/robinhood-stock-wealthy-traders-gamestop-hearing-roaring-kitty/4442330001/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cThe options trading rules are overdue for review,\u201d Ms. Roper said. \u201cThere are supposed to be safeguards in place that limit option trading to more sophisticated traders or at least make sure investors understand the risks.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Instead, Robinhood and other platforms allowed any investor to buy options with the push of a button.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe S.E.C. will need a hypothesis. Mine is that the problem is largely a problem of leverage and that leverage comes about by the trading of options rather than individual shares,\u201d said James Cox, a securities professor at Duke University School of Law. \u201cWe may need to really think whether there needs to be a limit on how many options a person can have and is able to execute.\u201d\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/business/economy/yellen-gamestop.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/business/economy/yellen-gamestop.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Senator Pat Toomey, the ranking minority member on the Senate Banking Committee wrote a letter to SEC chairman Gary Gensler about regulation just the other day advocating against it. \n\n[https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/toomey\\_letter\\_to\\_gensler\\_on\\_digital\\_engagement\\_practices.pdf](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/toomey_letter_to_gensler_on_digital_engagement_practices.pdf)",

        "selftext": "There is a stock that closed on Friday at $9.29, that has every chance of being just as big an opportunity. \n\nIt has a CEO that has said you need to be a trillion dollar company to get off the mat. I think that is his goal! They are at the top of their game in a number of product areas. They have suffered in the past from having their hands tied by NDA\u2019s but things are changing and they can now take credit for their own work.\n\nThey have gone from having 1 US office to signing a 10 year lease on a second US office and opening a sales office in Nuremberg in Germany. \n\nTheir board of directors includes a number of staff who have worked at Google and Ford amongst other places. \n\nThey have no debt. At the last earnings call they had $145 million in the bank. \n\nThey have had Microsoft as a customer since 2017 because Microsoft couldn\u2019t make the Hololens without this company\u2019s tech. They have also been crucial in Microsoft winning a $22 billion contract with the US army, and there are likely to be other orders in due course from other armed forces.\n\nThey also have Sharp Foxconn as a customer (you know, the massive company who make iPhones for Apple).\n\nThey have invented tech that is heavily patented that should mean they are a part of any smart glasses that ever become available to buy.\n\nTalking of patents, they have nearly 500 patents.\n\nThey have also created picop projectors that knock spots off the Amazon glow product, and will hopefully get its moment of glory in the near future.\n\nThen we get to the biggest cherry on the biggest cake of all.\n\nThey have spent at least 10 years perfecting best in class automotive LIDAR. They have been working with tier 1/OEM\u2019s and mobility as a service companies for at least a couple of years. They built their product to exceed the spec that manufacturers gave to them. They can double its capability if needed and although it is a very slim profile and only the size of a VHS cassette, the CEO has said they can halve the size if needed! It can be fitted discreetly where your rear view mirror is positioned. It doesn\u2019t negate the stylish appearance of your car, and does not affect its aerodynamics. It means it can even be fitted to convertibles and cars with sun roofs. Initially they planned to produce one luxury LIDAR model, but due to high demand from the prospective customers they have launched 4 versions, the premium model plus a short range, a medium range and a long range ( which can all be used to complement any other systems installed under prior agreements). Their premium version and the long range one have a range of 250 metres. Their LIDAR does not suffer any issues in bright sunshine, it works the same in any weather day or night. It has also been designed to suffer zero interference from any other nearby LiDAR units. It has the highest resolution of any existing LIDAR. The CEO has said they are aiming at a cost under the $1000 mark and that the profit manager is 50%. So that\u2019s a maximum profit of $500 per unit. They have said they envisage maybe 4 units per vehicle. So that\u2019s scope for up to $2000 profit per vehicle. Now we know they have multiple interested companies and it is only a matter of time before orders are placed as they have said the first units can be shipped in this quarter! Let\u2019s take VAG in Germany as an example. They produce 200,000 electric cars per month. Never mind however many petrol or diesel cars. 200,000 at $2000 profit per vehicle is $400,000,000 potential profit per month!!!! That is $4.8 billion per year. For just electric cars in Europe from just one manufacturer!\n\nNow consider how much profit there could be from other manufacturers - Ford, BMW, Bugatti, Renault, Peugeot, Fiat, Ferrari, and then US and Canada and Asian countries.it\u2019s mind blowing how much potential there is for the LIDAR market.\n\nDr Luce recently left a CEO position at Optoflux to become head of sales for Europe and Asia. Ask yourself why someone would take a step down in title. His comment was that he believes this company will take a significant share of the market. \n\nThey showcased their LIDAR at the IAA show in Germany, leaving no doubt they are best in class. Better than any other LIDAR that exists or that is in development.\n\nThey own the patents, they own the hardware and they own the software. They can sell to any company that wants to include this tech in their vehicles.\n\nSo - \n\n*Better than any other LIDAR with highest resolution \n*works in sunlight and nighttime \n*zero interference \n*slim profile and can be even smaller if needed and fitted discretely inside the windscreen\n*cheaper than others\n*Scaleable\n*4 versions to suit all needs\n*units available this quarter\n*made by a team who have proved their pedigree through having Microsoft as their customer for 4 1/2 years.\n\nThe company, in case you haven\u2019t already guessed is Microvision. \n\nFor anyone who is thinking, oh but that was a pump and dump in April. Yes there was hype, as when the A sample was confirmed as being complete rumours did the rounds that Microvision might be bought out. But they weren\u2019t and I don\u2019t think they will be for sale. They are in the strongest place they have ever been and this is finally their time. The world has finally caught up with their tech and is ready to embrace their genius. \n\nNow there will be some who will post negative stuff on this post, I get it. I don\u2019t care. I have enough shares that I and my family will be set for life when this plays out. To anyone who knew what they held, this was never a short term trade, it\u2019s a chance to be in from the start of their success. We don\u2019t know precisely when. But we know it is inevitable that this will soar in the very near future and surpass any pump and dump. But cheers to you all for April as that just led to it being even more shorted than it was before, which will only serve to enhance our profits when those sales orders get announced. There is a very good reason (well millions actually!) why Jeffries included MIcrovision on a list with GameStop and AMC of stocks that they wouldn\u2019t allow people to short. It\u2019s recently taken someone on here over 6 weeks to transfer his 205000 Microvision shares because he suspects his broker hadn\u2019t actually bought his shares and couldn\u2019t quickly buy them. \n\nNow, back to my opening question. If you could turn back time would you want to buy into Google or Amazon or Apple for under $10?\n\nIf so then this is likely to be the closest opportunity like that you will ever get.  Can you afford to not be a part of it? Or will you kick yourself forever, wishing if only\u2026.we can\u2019t turn back the clock for Google or Amazon or Apple, but now is the time to get in on Microvision, and have a tale for your kids or grandkids.\n\nI will happily say I told you so to anyone who doesn\u2019t act on this, when they are dominating the market, which they will.",

        "selftext": "I find it fascinating how anti-BRPM this sub is! \n\nAt the risk of being downvoted to oblivion - I haven't been this excited about a SPAC since CCIV (-400k February checking in woohoo!). \n\nNow it seems there are two major arguments against it:\n\n1 - The valuation is outlandish, the Steelers are worth 3.5B how can these gamer kids be worth 1B!\n\n2 - The revenue projections are completely unrealistic.\n\nBoth are valid arguments, but i hate to see this sub stop there and dismiss it all together. Traditionally, i'd pick apart those two arguments and tell you why they *are* worth the billion and that they'll be able to achieve these monster rev targets by executing on X,Y and Z. However, this is not your granpapi's market anymore and fundamentals (while still obviously a critical component) are not the end all be all. \n\nInvestments need to be looked at with a third lens (beyond value/growth), and we have a number of examples that have proved this to be not only true but wildly profitable. \n\nMaybe this is a stretch, maybe it isn't - but this strikes me as incredibly similar to the Tesla valuation years back. How can a car company that produces a small fraction of the number of vehicles in circulation, be worth more than every other car company combined? They'll never hit their rev projections and how can there possibly be room for any alpha for the investor? Social media platforms were also poo-poo'd for their lack of profitability - but we now all know well that it's the number of active FREE users, the audience size if you will that we value above all. It's not at all unusual for disruptors like this with massive upsides but a tough value argument to face scrutiny at the onset.\n\nBringing it home:\n\n* FaZe is very nearly a cult and a very large cult of impressionable Gen Z / Millennials lead by mega popular, highly visible stars at that. \n   * It's easy to bash crypto and NFT's (trust me i'm right there with you) but this subset of the population has made these industries goliaths, and i believe e-sports is up next. \n      * A quick stat to support without trying to get technical: prize pools for these events are ridiculously huge. We're talking about 35 million dollars for the 'super bowl' winners of a video game tournament DOTA in 2019. This is a number that's increasing notably YoY and represents only a single tournament for a single game for a single year.\n* IF we can agree that e-sports has a serious future, something i think the numbers do without a doubt support (Whether we old pigskin focused fuddy-duddy's like it or not), then this has legs.\n* FaZe clan now represents the only **direct** channel for investors to get a piece of this action, and no Twitch being .00000005% of amazon does not count. \n* This is a new market and success stories have routinely stemmed from untraditional sources.\n   * Discord and twitter furu's instead of TA, WSB / hivemind 'stonks only go up mentality' vs quarterly earnings reports.... dare i say video game superstars w/360 million+ followers vs Jim Cramer?\n   * Meme potential is staggering. Playboy went parabolic for goodness sakes (lol). SPCE, GME, AMC, FAZE? Would shock me if it *didn't* get lumped in with that bunch. \n\nMy point here is this - Faze has more followers than ALL OF THE PGA COMBINED. I'd have trouble understanding how that alone isn't worth more than a B in today's world. There are certainly questions around how they'll translate financial success out of this massive follower-base and so on, but at 11.70 a share, i'm betting on the side that says they do.\n\nI hope you all at least re-examine the business case for it, setting aside traditional notions of value (scary to even type that), and strap in for some good 'ol asymmetric risk with me (and a bunch of preteen fanboys!).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/og6sn25nuvv71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da5871a361108819b78ff95ae7a43505c7b8e07a",

        "selftext": "Is it even worth it to buy one or two shares of anything?\n\nHi all, noob trader here, joined with the GME rush and have stayed in and learned some things in my time. \nIn my time I\u2019ve tried to diversify and get shares in multiple stocks and sectors. I even had a few shares of Fun before the launch and I made a small profit off that; keyword small. \n\nI\u2019m still learning and trying to up my strategy and actually have an exit strategy. &amp; obviously each share isn\u2019t a million dollar play, most of the time. But should I be doing diversifying as much? For example I have 1 share of Ford, and I\u2019m even up like 34% which is great but it\u2019s like 16 dollars now, maybe 4 profit. Should I have put more into it when I bought the one share because I believed in it to try to maximize profits? I\u2019ve heard of day trading but not really my speed I think. \n\nAny responses or discussions appreciated!",

        "selftext": " \n\nROOT is the definition of playing the long game which I always said I was playing with ROOT. We do have some upcoming interesting events that could propel it forward in the short to medium termt though. I've summarized below to share with you.\n\nIn the updated $Carvana and $ROOT Commercial Agreement they state that the Product Integration Plan will be completed within 30 days from commencement date which is Oct 1st. If Carvana buying up to 30% of the company for prices up to 6x the current share price doesn't excite you, then I do not know what will! Root issued this 30% in 8 short/long term warrants exercisable at $10-$30/share and up to 129M shares of Class A common stock which represents the 30% of Root ownership fully diluted as of Aug 2021. As we have seen posted many time, there is a strong assumption that an acquisition could take place in the near future.\n\nRoot is aware they need to reduce costs and are doing so both on the selling and general admin cost side but also by using their new tech, i.e. UBI 4.0. Expect to hear about these results soon.\n\nLook I don't know what is going to happen, but Root looks primed for the long term turn around darling backed by Carvana. If we could get a solid retail base it would speed up the increased share price. I'm looking for $27+ which was the IPO price only 1 year ago.\n\n**Possible catalysts:**\n\n**- Technical Analysis**\n\nThis is a 1 year falling wedge pattern lets break it out!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1Y1D Falling Wedge](https://preview.redd.it/4ostsgreq1t71.png?width=1923&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ea8f3587fa2879efac2afbe984b4b5edd0175f1)\n\n1Y1D Falling Wedge\n\n**- Oct 15th Call Expiration**\n\nMassive open interest for expiration this Friday, mainly out of the money though. It looks like it is getting pinned under $5 to have all this expire worthless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Oct Option Chain](https://preview.redd.it/5n666ekgq1t71.png?width=1335&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d26c479061c33a79d61908281c2644c7a8038ef)\n\nOct/Nov Call Option Chain\n\n**- Nov 1st Completion of Product Integration Plan**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Integration Plan](https://preview.redd.it/oiav51vdq1t71.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9772165e28f31c9a6e456336cda617eea6c1f5ac)\n\n**- Nov 4th Carvana Earnings Report**\n\nExpect to hear an update from Carvana on the Root deal.\n\n**- Approx. Nov 15th Root Earnings Report**\n\n\\- Expect to hear about cost benefits resulting from UBI 4.0, projections for the year and hopefully updated cost benefits from the plan in place.\n\n\\- Possible new CFO as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[UBI 4.0 Benefits](https://preview.redd.it/031yv8qhq1t71.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b115aadf97dd83e513678fefa9f5d75966f7415f)\n\n**- When will Shorts start to Cover?**\n\nNo one knows but short interest is over 35% and over 50% of volume in Dark Pool. Similar to AMC and GME lots of Dark Pool trading is occurring. Septeber saw a massive Short Interest increase. We are getting closer but when? Do not know for sure.

        "selftext": "First DD post so bear with me.\n\nI know alot of you dumb retards have lost a killing on tesla puts, but this time it's different. Famous last words I know.\n\nAnyway so I was looking into why tesla stock was pumping so hard lately. I know they have been producing more, and tesla vehicles are pretty badass, but it didn't make any sense to me.\n\nEnter DTCC haircut rules starting tomorrow. \n\nFor those of you that don't know, or live under a fucking rock, start paying attention to these rules because they can change alot in the markets. \n\nTLDR on haircuts : they are going to force sell any over leveraged firms stock, AA+ credit ratings at a rate of 5%-35% of their holdings and anything with a lower credit rating is going to be 100% liquidated. \n\nNow that we have that out of the way, \n\nTesla has a credit rating of BBB meaning any over leveraged firm with holdings of tesla are going to have every fucking penny of their tesla holdings liquidated and pumped onto the market.\n\nGuess what firm has a massive position in tesla!? Cmon, you'll never guess! Ahh you there in the back! \n\nUhh, Citadel?\n\nCitadel you say,? Yes, and Susquehanna.God damn you retards are good.\n\nThat's fucking right retards. Citadel and Susquehanna have huge stakes in tesla.... Surely you aren't retarded enough to think that this big tesla move was anything but a fucking pump n dump to get more collateral for what's coming. \n\nThe only thing I can think could help a tesla dump is the new nscc rules about instead of selling all the shares on the market, they take them and give collateral back to the firm at a discounted price. Hopefully for the markets sake this rule would apply here, but if not, TESLA PUTS WILL FUCKING PRINT THESE NEXT FEW WEEKS, also AMC/GME to the moon. :)\n\n\n\nTLDR: TESLA PUTs will print with these new dtcc haircutting rules liquidating any stock with a credit rating under AA+.

I then lost even more playing with GME options over time and stopped touching it around May (I think).\n\nAnyway, after I saw it spike a few times, and maintain a much higher price than it was at right before and after January, I started looking at it again.

        "selftext": " To my fellow WSB investors,\n\nI would like to share with this community a high probability short squeeze set up play to $GME and $AMC based on fundamental and technical rationale. I am constantly monitoring short set up tickers on Fintwit, WSB, etc. (I keep a technical record &amp; alert) as they've gotten popular and I have finally found a set up that is fundamentally sound- meaning high ROI, high probability, and low % of risk. These setups take time and most of the time, a long ass time. This is not a YOLO, HODL, etc. play and I never thought that $GME and $AMC were ever these types of plays. This is key as you are able to average down and hold safely for long term compounded gains.\n\nRoot Insurance ($ROOT) has finally made it to the top of my list as my highest conviction play this year. I've watched and played tickers like $MVIS, $CLOV, and now $SDC (all of these tickers are short term momo plays), but I strongly believe $ROOT is a technical/fundamental stock that emulates $GME/$AMC in the long term. I want to make sure you all understand that one of the main reasons why $GME/$AMC was so successful was because they're both high conviction \"marathon\" plays and not \"sprints\". This is what differentiates $ROOT vs. other ticker plays because it is currently a \"marathon\" play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is a marathon play that will lead to a high probability setup, high ROI, and low risk on investment? You need to have been present and study the fundamentals of $GME/$AMC vs. all other short term tickers that pumped and then dumped. The reasons why $GME/$AMC were successful and why $ROOT is setup to do the same are:\n\n1. High Conviction: The investors need to believe and be confident that they can hold these stocks until their price targets have been met. This is through stocks being fundamentally undervalued, vengeance, high risk/reward, M&amp;A, retail business familiarity (i.e. AMC theatres, Gamestop shop), etc. You need high conviction as when scalpers or hedge funds sell and change the momentum downwards, high conviction investors do not sell but are able to hold (we believe in long term gains).\n2. High Institutional Ownership: As much as $GME/$AMC were shorted by hedge funds, they also had a high % of institutional investors. This is absolutely needed as they are able to hold a significant amount of the total outstanding float over a long period of time. Then this just leaves the shares float and the short float as a percentage of the shares float. i.e. $GME at times had ownership levels greater than 100% which confirmed naked shorting and FTD's taking place by short hedge funds.\n3. High Short Interest: Short Interest needs to be above 25% of the float at the minimum.\n4. Partnership or Benefactor: You need to have a benefactor or partner (high profile) who is willing to create support (large volume entry price) or hard carry/pull the price up if needed, especially on dips. Deepfuckingvalue is the sponsor for $GME and $AMC has Trey/CEO/Mark Cuban, etc.\n5. Fundamentals: Retail was already very familiar with AMC theatres and Gamestop stores. Fundamentals didn't matter as much because the price levels were so low due to Covid depressed demand. However, fundamentals like cash on hand, book value, Price/book value, Price/cash, revenue, net income, earnings, future earnings are all relevant. This is how you are able to determine floor prices or value for companies, future price targets, gauge risk vs. reward, compare similar industry companies to one another, etc.\n6. Technicals: $GME/$AMC were marathon plays and the squeeze didn't happen overnight (90% preparation/10% execution). What we noticed was high volatility in buying/selling, but every single dip was being bought- this created higher conviction holders day after day which reduced the amount of share float to be traded which created less of the float to be able to be shorted significantly. The short ladder attacks was also challenging to overcome, but we overcame it over time. Over a period of time, less and less shares were available to be shorted and we also noticed higher failure to delivers (FTD's) in which hedge funds were not returning borrowed shares (i.e. naked shorting). WSB caught this and made hedge funds pay. ITM/OTM call options were also being bought heavily which meant the shorts had to delta hedge or make sure they had the shares available in case the call expired ITM.\n\n[$AMC\\/$GME Squeeze Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/aa7kcvn8sft71.png?width=1019&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b19fb4e4cf800cdbd2d477ec5d20095452608fd8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$AMC FTD](https://preview.redd.it/zmqx4i1jsft71.png?width=991&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bd529f4f1ed5db964d84756a24564f4909f929f)\n\n7. Hooke's Law: \"*The force exerted on a spring is directly proportional to the distance it moves as a result of the force*.\" Just like how a highly compressed spring works, overtime the amount of compression/tension that was applied to the spring released and caused the greatest of short squeezes. The more time it takes to compress a spring, the farther it will jump.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**To my fellow WSB investors, now for the explanation on $ROOT (I'm taking this information from other sources on WSB as well).**\n\nRoot is a 6 year old car insurance tech company that uses telematics (collecting locational data and machine learning to make decisions) to decide which drivers they would like to insure/not insure. The more data they gather, the better decisions they'll be making to improve their loss ratio (profitability from charging premiums vs. paying out money which is an insurer's business model). Getting approval is difficult and it's state by state but they're approved in 32 States now. They also have an enterprise division which is the tech/telematics division of the company and is able to offer software as a service (SaaS). They are supplying their data to fleet management companies as well as other insurers which is another revenue stream.\n\nRoot had their IPO in late 2020 at $27/share and a $6.7B market cap. As of 10/8, they closed at $5/share (-81.4%) and $1.27B market cap. Per Finviz, their sales are $260M/yr, net income of $-500M/yr, book/share value of 3.06, price/book of 1.63, cash/share value of 3.76, and price/share value of 1.33. The net income is negative due to the high OpEx (operational expenditure on marketing, etc.). Fundamentally based on the amount of cash they have ($1.0B), they are undervalued based on their P/B and P/C compared to other insur-tech companies. They also have 249M total shares outstanding, 97M shares float, and a short float % of 34% although their most recent Fintel/FINRA Dark Pool Short Volume is 53%. Per Yahoo finance, Root has 75% of the float held by institutions at/above $11/share!

Root has also issued 8 short/long term warrants exercisable at $10-$30/share and up to 129M shares of Class A common stock which represents 30% of Root ownership. As WSB already pointed out, this is a strong assumption that an acquisition could take place in the near future. I consider Carvana to be Root's benefactor. Their latest catalyst on 10/12/21 also included a 7% overall investment of outstanding shares by Schusterman Interests.\n\nTechnicals are self explanatory on this 1 year 1 day chart. This is a 1 year falling wedge pattern (beautiful!) with an RSI at 30-35 and an imminent breakout. You cannot get a chart as beautiful/predictable as this.

There is a high uncertainty that these options will expire worthless as hedge funds pin the price to collect the premiums that are high IV.

The reasoning is due to high conviction long term holders, high institutional ownership (75% of float) at an average price &gt;$11/share, high short interest at 35% and 52% on dark pool data, benefactor/partnership with Carvana where an M&amp;A above 30% equity is possible, fundamentally undervalued based on price/book of 1.66 and price/cash of 1.33, technically on a yearly falling wedge/imminent breakout setup, and Hooke's Law where this setup is a highly compressed loaded spring.

        "selftext": "# This post will dive into one of the most important concepts in options trading.\n\n# Understanding this concept will change the way you think about options trading (for the better). The concept is called volatility.\n\nAs an option trader, you are expressing a view on volatility... some know this and others don't :P\n\nBecause options expire, we now have be aware not just of what direction the stock will move, but *by how much* it will move in a given time period.\n\nNote: you can find the previous parts of this series on my profile.\n\nIf you have questions about this post, please leave a comment and I will get back to you.\n\nLet's get started!!\n\n# Example 1: Comparing 2 stocks.\n\nLets say we are looking at $AMC and $KO (Coca Cola), and we want to compare how each of these stocks moves over a 3 day period.\n\nIf we look at KO, this is a company that has been around for a long time. We understand how much money they make, how they make it, what their future revenue is likely to be, etc.. So on a day to day basis, we shouldn't expect massive swings in the stock price.\n\nPerhaps on day 1 we see the stock move +1%, then -1% on day 2, and then +2% on day 3.\n\nBut what if we looked at AMC?\n\nFrom what we know about AMC, it moves a lot. It could move up 10% 1 day, down 15% the next day and the back up 20% on the third day!\n\nThinking about these two stocks. It's should be clear that KO is much more stable than AMC. There is a lot less risk on KO than AMC.\n\n# So, which of these stocks do you think would have more costly options?\n\nThe reason AMC options would be more pricey relative to $KO is because there is more *risk* that AMC moves a lot. Remember, the options market tries to price what is going to happen in the future.. Since it is a lot more probable that AMC moves 10% tomorrow than Coca Cola, *the options of AMC imply more future big move risk than the options for KO.*\n\n**The simple way to put this would be:** ***AMC is more volatile than KO.***\n\nIf both stocks were trading at $100 per share, we would expected a $100 strike call option on AMC to be much more expensive, since there's a higher chance of it having a bigger move. Remember! In a trade, there is a buyer and a seller.\n\nSo if that option on AMC was only like $2, we would all want to buy them, and no one would want to sell them, so the price would go up (supply and demand).\n\n# So why do we care about volatility?\n\nIt's the factor that the market looks at to determine how much the options should be trading for.\n\nMost retail traders are *price insensitive* in the options space. They are more focused on the *exposure* the options give them, rather than the cost of the option. But as we move through this lesson.. really start to think about the value of options. If we can go out and find an option trading for $10 that is really worth $5, we've found a really good trade. So let's try to tie everything here back to *the value of options.*\n\n# Checkpoint summary 1:\n\n1. Volatility is simply the size of the move for a given stock.\n2. The a big factor in the price of options is how volatile the market thinks a stock will be in the future\n3. Since volatility is a big part of how the market prices options, we can say that the option prices *imply future volatility*.\n4. volatility is not direction. fundamentally it is the size of the moves, not the direction the stock goes.\n5. If you are trading options, you are trading volatility. Understanding volatility is an important part of understanding how to trade options.\n\n# The 3 Circles of Volatility\n\nNow that we understand (in general) what volatility is, we need to understand that there are *different forms of volatility* that impact every single stock. To explain this, theres a demonstration made by Predicting Alpha that explains it really well. It's called the **3 circles of volatility**.\n\n# There are 3 forms of volatility that impact any given stock.\n\n1. The first form of volatility is called **market volatility**.\n\nThe market has volatility. All of the stocks we can look at exist within the market. Let's say the market crashes. All of the stocks that we are looking at would also take a huge hit. The market overhands all of the stocks we look at, and what happens to the overall market impacts all of the stocks.\n\n[All stocks exist within the market, and are therefore subject to what happens to the market.](https://preview.redd.it/cbppljlin1t71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b0ded0cb0d5b558f3008f4a1efe67f9f7482d17)\n\n2) The second form of volatility is called **non-event volatility**\n\nLet's say we zoomed in and looked at one stock in particular. We would find another form of volatility called *non-event volatility.* Non event volatility is the movement of a stock on its regular day to day. How has the company been doing? Does it move on average 1% a day? or 10% a day? For example, $KO is going to have less non event volatility than $AMC. Different stocks move different amounts regularly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Each stock has its unique day to day movement, specific to the trading around that company.](https://preview.redd.it/4147qqrbm1t71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84e86d5ee4777cb3f564d2578916a5afcfadfbcd)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) The third form of volatility is called **event volatility**\n\nIf we zoom in a bit further, we see that within each company there are key events that drive big movement in the share price. Earnings events, product releases, drug approvals, etc. Company events introduce new information into the market, leading to \"jumps\" in share price that we typically wouldn't see. Because of this, events can drive short bursts of high volatility for a stock.\n\n[Within the regular movement of a stock, there are big events that drive short bursts of rapid stock movement.](https://preview.redd.it/emm3b69am1t71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2291be9a53ffa643efa9a93703aa698600456551)\n\nBy taking these 3 forms of volatility into consideration, we are able to understand what's causing the stock to move, or impacting the price of the options.\n\nFor example, If the stock market crashes, it will overshadow the non-event volatility of a company. Even though the stock maybe moves only 1% a day on average, a market crash could cause it to move a lot more.\n\nFor another example, When GME was moving like crazy over the last few months, event volatility around their earnings releases was almost the same as non-event volatility, almost as if no \"event impact\" was being priced in.\n\n# Relating it back to options\n\nLet's say we are looking at an option expiring in 30 days. Taking into consideration the 3 forms of volatility, the market is going to try to determine how much the stock is likely to move over the next 30 days.\n\nIf the stocks trading at $100 and the at-money call and put are each going for $5 (5% of the share price), we can add them up and see that the \"range\" the market implies (the at-the-money straddle) is $10 in price, or 10% of the share price.\n\nThis tells us that the market thinks the stock will move up or down 10% in the next 30 days. The option prices are reflecting the *market implied volatility*.\n\nLet's say in the middle of those 30 days there is an earnings event. We can now says that the market volatility , non event volatility AND event volatility are all a part of the \"10% up or down\" that the market is baking into the price of the options.\n\n[All 3 forms of volatility are impacting this option. Can you think of how the event volatility can skew our view on the time period?](https://preview.redd.it/o1enqjj8m1t71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55e6e9fc6f3a8526c23bbdcb7051cd6a18b89d76)\n\nWhy is this important? Well, if we know there is an earnings event in the middle of that time period, we can use the 3 circles to think that *a lot of the 10% move the market is implying might happen on that 1 day, and we will see very small moves on the other 29 days.* We can use some analytics tools to try to separate the event and non event volatility to understand if this is the case, which is really useful for selling options and knowing *exactly what you are selling.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[We can extract the event volatility from the non-event\\/market volatility. This helps us understand how much the market is implying for the event, and how the value of options will change after the event passes.](https://preview.redd.it/o8rck0o6m1t71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2e27dde1e3bb5669d9aec66f27bf95ddab48f0c)\n\nThe picture above shows the term structure for DAL and how much earnings event volatility is priced into the different DTEs (earnings is this week).\n\n# A cool thing about the 3 circles of volatility is that we can isolate which one we want to trade\n\nDepending on what you think is mispriced, you can isolate one of the forms of volatility. For example, If you just want to trade an earnings event, you can structure your trade to remove a lot of market and non-event volatility!\n\nMore on this in a future post where we talk about earnings trading.\n\n# Checkpoint summary 2:\n\n1. There are 3 forms of volatility that impact a stock. Market volatility, non-event volatility, and event volatility.\n2. Market volatility is like the \"tide that rises and lows all ships\", non-event volatility is the day to day movement of a stock, and event volatility is a short burst of big movements caused by new information coming into the market (earnings, product releases, etc).\n3. The option price reflects the impact of each of these 3 forms of volatility within the days to expiration of the option.\n4. We can isolate different forms of volatility depending on what we want to trade.\n\n# Implied VS Realized Volatility.\n\nImagine you are at a horse-racing track, and you want to place a bet on the next race.\n\nYou take a look at the odds, and see that the horse named Seabiscuit has 4:1 odds on it coming first place. Nice! The market is saying that you only need to risk 1 to make 4 if Seabiscuit comes in first. You do some math, and you think that theres a 50% chance he will come in first (market is implying about a 25% chance) and decide it's a good bet. So you place your bet.\n\nThen the race starts, and even though he was off to a good start, Seabiscuit ends up coming in 4th place. Damn.\n\nWhen you went to place the bet, the market gave you a bet you could choose to take. The market was *implying a certain likelihood of that horse winning*.\n\nThen the race started , and the *realized outcome,* or what actually ended up happening was that Seabiscuit lost the race.\n\nThis is like what happens in the options space..\n\n**Implied volatility** is how much the market *thinks* the stock will move in the future.\n\n**Realized volatility** is *how much the stock actually ends up moving.*\n\n# How does the market determine implied volatility?\n\nThe basic way to think about this, is that the market participants look at the 3 circles of volatility and make an opinion about how much each of them will impact the stock between now and the option's expiration. The market consensus on each form of volatilities impact will then become the *market implied volatility*.\n\nIf the stock moves more than what was implied, the buyer makes money.. If the stock moves less than what is implied, the seller makes money (there is nuance to this, but for this lesson we are keeping it simple).\n\n**note**: There are tools out there that help you graph and analyze the difference between implied and realized volatility. You can get some basic charts in most brokerages. My preferred tool is Predicting Alpha Terminal which allows me to do some unreal analysis.\n\nFor example, here's the IV/RV ratios for $KO and $AMC.\n\n[There are tons of analytics specific to volatility. The insights help us understand the value of options better, and therefore make more money trading.](https://preview.redd.it/kovfuu04m1t71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b3afacbcd6bdb598d3c39ed1e6061096986e011)\n\nIt's pretty cool. This shows us the gap between the implied and realized volatility for each of those companies on the same graph. Looks like they have both steadied out to a similar spread.\n\n# Checkpoint summary 3:\n\n1. Implied volatility is how much the market thinks the stock will move in the future\n2. realized volatility is how much the stock actually ends up moving\n3. If we have a different opinion from the market, and we end up being closed to what the stock \"realizes\" , we should make money.\n\n# OK so we understand the \"bet the market presents us with\" (implied volatility), and \"what actually ends up happening\" (realized volatility), but how do we know what side of the trade to be on?\n\nYou remember in the horse racing example how we said that you think the odds of Seabiscuit winning are 50%, but the market is implying a 25% chance? This is an extremely important part of the example.\n\nThe reason it is so important, is because *that is why you took the bet!*\n\nThink about it. If you agree with the bookie on his odds and likelihood of winning, why would you take the bet? You know that he skews the odds a bit in his favor (revisit my post on expected value if you need to), so taking that bet would have negative expectancy.\n\n# The reason we took the trade is because our forecast for the race was different from the market.\n\n# We do the same thing in the option market.\n\nThe market presents us with options priced at a particular implied volatility level. *Our job is to come up with our own forecast of future volatility.*\n\nYou can think of your \"forecast\" as your opinion on things. If the market thinks a stock isn't going to move a lot, but you think it will, options are cheap. If the market is implying that the stock will move more than you think it actually will, options are expensive.\n\nIf we can develop a really solid forecast of future volatility, options trading becomes pretty straight forward. Now of course, if it were easy to do we would all have matching lambos already. But this is the fun of trading, the better opinions you can develop, and the better you can express those opinions, the more money you should make.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n*\"Gold slips away from the person who invests gold into purposes through which they are not familiar\"*\n\nThat is a quote from a book called The Richest Man in Babylon that often comes to mind when I see traders getting into trades without understanding the product and space they are participating in.\n\nTo be honest, a lot of times it's this lack of familiarity that can drive inefficiencies that more sophisticated traders profit from.\n\nLet's keep in mind that options are volatility products. Let's strive to learn more about how these products are priced and how to create good views of the future. There is plenty of opportunity for retail traders to make money, but it all starts by understanding the product we trade, and how to trade it.\n\nIf you have questions, please leave them in the comments below and I will do my best to get back to everyone.\n\n# In my next post, I will dive into how to isolate event volatility for earnings trades, and how I have been able to make a living trading earnings events as a primary strategy.\n\nHappy trading everyone.\n\n\\~AG",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI did put a lot of research into the current situation for quite some time and finally build a portfolio I am 100% behind long-term. However, the more I learned, the more sure I am that we will experience a market crash rather soon, than late.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is the issue: If I pull out all of my cash right now, potential Hyperinflation, which I think will be upcoming, will burn through my cash. If not, the market might crash and a good chunk of certificates might be of no value anymore. I currently have 5x leveraged K.O. Long certificates on Apple, MSFT, Biontech and Alibaba with a small amount of money (in total around 15% of my entire portfolio are derivatives), the rest are pure shares. I expected all of them to perform decent in times of hyperinflation, since they can easily adjust their prices to counteract high inflation and institutions will stick to them anyways. Ofcourse, more reasons than that. However, my biggest asset is the Vanguard FTSE All World ETF with around 25% of my total portfolio. How can I expect this ETF to move if the USA and China collapse? If those collapse, Europe might be next.  \n\n\nNow, the catch. I did so much research, learned constantly and came to the conclusion, which I am not here to debate whether or not you think is true, that we might see something like 2008 all over again. The theory behind it would assume that GameStop is the current best hedge and to some degree AMC as well, even heard that from the highs up from a bank when I talked to my bank guy, which is incredibly weird. I should mention, I am from Germany, so things are not as heated here.\n\nAnother hedge and long term hold can not be mentioned in this sub, but you might guess what it is. Sadly, we cant debate this here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, in case of this scenario, I would like to get everyone's opinion on this. I want to be clear, I value every single opinion and would love the most input possible. In order to get knocked out, the stocks mentioned above would need to fall 20% in total. In case of no crash, they would be my go to investments, ontop of a few other non mentioned with the same principal. Again, this is purely theoretical, I do not want to discuss whether or not it is happening, but what you would do in case it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: How would you hedge against a potential market crash ala 2008 due to Evergrande and Gamestop, or just generally if you are not familiar with the topics.",

Deep learning models can basically convert any kind of data (image, audio, 3d models, etc.) into vectors, so in a way, a vector database can store any kind of data. With a vector database, you can search similar vectors. So, with deep learning and vector databases, it is possible to perform a similarity search for any kind of data...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy idea is to input a snippet of a stock, see if it matches a snippet of a stock from the past:\n\n1. We use some deep learning algorithms to extract features (vectors) from stock retrospective data (snippet).\n2. Store the features in a vector database.\n3. Search similar stock snippets that are stored in the database using new stock snippets.\n4. Wait until one stock snippet looks similar to GME during pre short squeeze... \n\nThe features for a stock can be a stock's price history, technical indicators, news, Reddit mentions, etc.\n\nCan we find the next GME using this? If there is a stock that has a very similar trend to GME in terms of technical indicators, retail investors' emotions, etc. \n\nTheoretically, if the retrospective data of stocks have a correlation with their future price movement, this is definately possible.\n\nJust a thought. But maybe I am on to something...\n\nRoast me plz :)",

It's coming down to the 200 day moving average and long term support, where it could be setting up to breakout of the downtrend it's been in since May.\n\nI recommend waiting for it to breakout and hold above the downtrend line and 20 day moving average (which are at about $190 now) with a spike in volume before starting a position. If this happens I think it will run to at least the August high at about $230 and could go much higher if the Ape Army returns.\n\nDecember Earnings and the holiday shopping season are also potential catalysts for a run, but we probably also need the overall market to stop bleeding for this to play out.\n\nI think it could continue to be rangebound for another couple weeks, but we are setting up for a big move one way or another after that. If you want to get in now I'd recommend setting a stop loss just below the 200 day moving at around $150.\n\nDisclaimer: No Position now, but I might start one soon if we get a breakout.",

        "selftext": "To begin, I found out about stocks in January of this year when a friend of mine sent a post about something called GME from WallStreetBets. I never knew anything about stocks at the time and in less than one month in the market, my portfolio was already up 100% from the GME squeeze. But little did I know this would be a huge mistake for me because my mentality entering the stock market wasn't actually trading stocks, instead, it was gambling.\n\nFast forward a couple of months later my portfolio is doing alright until I discover something called options. You can already see where this is starting to go. Even though I read so many times \"if you don't know what you're doing, avoid options\", \"don't put in what you're not willing to lose\" etc. I still dove right in. I knew absolutely nothing about them other than I can either make a ton of money, or I could lose a ton of money. I've made some insane returns on some of my calls, but I've lost a lot more. It's been a cycle of trying to win back the money I lost over and over and over again. I tell myself I will only put in what I'm willing to lose, see it go up x percent, add more, and then lose more than I was willing to lose. I also had issues with taking profits. I could be up 100% and still want to see more returns until I lost almost all of it. \n\nIt wasn't with just options either. I would FOMO things like penny stocks, panic sell at the bottom, see it rise up again, enter with a new position, use all my day trades, and then lose even more money. The problem I had was impatience. I tried holding stocks such as Apple, Microsoft, S&amp;P 500 etc. but I wanted to see instant returns. \n\nNow, I am currently down 85% from when I first began trading, and the money I've lost could have definitely gone towards my college tuition which I am barely paying off. Luckily, my living situation is fine but it would still be nice to have that money. I know I've paid a hefty price for the \"stock market tuition\" but I am really wondering where to go from here. Should I just pull out of all my positions? Take a break? Invest long term? Take the time to learn how the market works? Or is there a deeper issue here that I am not understanding? \n\nI hope someone else can also read this post and know what not to do in the stock market.",

It didn't crap itself to the bottom like every other high IV stock out there. It just kind of squeezed to the middle with no real action overall. Theta gang had happy times here. But ... theta gang happiness also means there's consolidation in the waters. Consolidation in the waters means there's room for upswing (or downswing), but prob not much sideways trading for much longer.  GME went from \ud83d\ude36 to \ud83d\ude10 to \ud83d\ude80 to \ud83d\udca6 to \ud83d\udca5 to \ud83d\ude80 to \ud83d\ude10 back to \ud83d\ude80 and then  \ud83d\ude10/\ud83d\ude36 ever since. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other notable crayons:** \n\nMoney flow is increasing. That's a good thing especially when you see consolidation in the waters. \n\nBad signs I see are that it's GME and everyone hates on it these days + the selloffs in the past few months mean that we're not at the precipice of \ud83d\ude80 or \ud83d\udca6 tomorrow, but so likely by ... hopefully November 19th (..cough..cough). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: \u23f3..\ud83d\udd1c..**\ud83d\ude10 to \ud83d\ude80 to \ud83d\udca6",

        "selftext": "I have managed to successfully turn 10K in savings into 4k with my great stock picks. Mostly options that seem never to make me any money, not nearly as much as i have lost. I have 4000, most of it is invested in GME right now. I have a few monthlies, a spy 410 put for 10/27 and another 390 put for oct 27. I bought HSBC puts that got destroyed over the last 2 weeks. they expired today and lost me about 500$.   So right now I am ready to go 180 degrees against my picks. I am at 75% pick rate for spy, however the options I buy, get crushed when the price goes the opposite way before going the way i expected it to. Say i think spy will drop. Its at 444. I get a put for 435 a few  days out. The price spikes to 447, then slowly drops to 440. Even though i was right in the direction, when it spiked the value dropped, but when the price dropped, the value does not recover anything close to what it lost due to the spike. Is there a way to get around this? I am okay with paying my fair share of tuition, but is it too much to ask to get a fucking win now and again? I have worked my ass off my whole life and this is more mentally stressful than anything ive done. I want to make it work. Can anyone steer me towards soemthing that will help me win this game? I make great picks, my timing is just off. how do i learn to have the discipline to turn a profit ? If youre going to hammer at me and tell me to quit then dont bother commenting, I am only looking for positive reinforcement or constructive criticism",

        "selftext": "What up, nerds? Long time no post. I come bearing gifts of knowledge. Whatever you do with that knowledge is up to you.\n\n**THE KNOWLEDGE:**\n\n**$HOOD** is getting primed for a massive short squeeze. All the much-touted WSB metrics are lining up -- and this time they exist in **reality**, and not simply in the minds of inexperienced market newbies experiencing cognitive dissonance when their stock fails to squeeze for the 6th month in a row, and who are puzzled by terms like \"reverse repo\" but are emboldened by rocket emojis and new accounts sporting the \"diamond hands snoo\" avatars. Whew, a lot to unpack there. Anyway, come with me on this journey. Let's do a dive.\n\n**What is $HOOD?**\n\nWe all know about Robinhood, but do we *really*? Everyone knows they shut down trading of GME, AMC, and a bunch of other meme stocks back in January. But did you know that Robinhood was one of at least [**18 different brokers**](https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/l6uur7/payne_sounds_off_on_wall_st_over_gamestop_all_of/gl34eks/?context=3) that shut down trading of these stocks? WSB \"fan favourite\" SOFI is even on that list. Many of you probably didn't know that! That's because Robinhood was set up by the big boys with big bucks to be the fall guy.\n\n**Think about it:**\n\n* Why else would all of these other brokers shutting down trades be memory-holed?\n* Why would none of these other brokers be summoned by Congress to explain their role in shutting down trading?\n* Why would Robinhood &amp; Vlad not publicize the fact that over a DOZEN other brokers did the exact same thing?\n\nThis begs the question -- why would Robinhood accept its \"fall guy\" status? Logically, because they would get something in return.\n\nFast forward to today.\n\n**$HOOD primed for a squeeze**\n\nLet's look at some very basic metrics that indicate $HOOD has huge squeeze potential:\n\n[https://fintel.io/ss/us/hood](https://fintel.io/ss/us/hood)\n\n**Short share availability:** 0. There are no shares available to short. This limits downward pressure.\n\n**Short borrow rate:** 175%. If rates stay the same and the stock price stays the same for the next year, theoretically you could make 175% from lending out your shares. In reality, some brokers split evenly these gains with their clients. For example, if you trade with Interactive Brokers, that means that, if the stock stayed in $40 for the next year and borrow rates stayed the same, you'd make $35 per share. This is another positive catalyst because people shorting the stock would actually have to pay $70 per year per share in interest fees, making it as expensive as a high-class Luxembourgeois hooker to hold this stock. They'd be paying **$70 a year in hopes that the stock drops a few dollars** (because, realistically, there's no way it will go to $0 within a year). It doesn't take a wrinkled brain to see that that investment is FUCKED.\n\n**Days to cover:** 6.7. At current trading volume, it would take almost 7 days for shorts to close their positions. That means that, if the stock starts to pump, the pressure will build exponentially on the stock's price as more and more volume comes in and moves the share price higher.\n\n**Fails to deliver:** I personally think this metric is bullshit, but a lot of newbie autists see castles in these tea leaves, so I've included it anyway. 1 million FTDs yesterday. 8 million over the past week. Something something rocket emoji diamond emoji.\n\n**Options premiums:** Options are hilariously mispriced. Call options are just about 1/3 the value of put options. In other words, it's 3x more expensive to bet that the stock is going to the downside on an already hilariously overcrowded trade than it is to bet that it will go up. Recall that downside is limited while upside is theoretically infinite. Math moment:  \u221e &gt; 40\n\n\"*But, moron who made a horrendously terrible bet on HYLN,\"* you say, *\"doesn't all of this just indicate that people think $HOOD is a piece of shit stock and is really just going to tank?\"*\n\nWell, my ruthless friend with eidetic memory, that *could* be the case, however...\n\n**Consolidation:** For the past month and a bit, HOOD has been touching tips, meat logging, docking, whatever you kids call it nowadays, with $40. Big buys keep coming in at this level. In fact, there was a 250k buy on the 5m candle today.\n\n**Call sweeps:** Large purchases of call options expiring over the next month are being purchased. Huge purchases of call sweeps are what caused AMC to spike a few months ago. People with big money could be betting that AMC is going to fly. Or they could be purchasing cheap insurance to protect themselves if HOOD really does squeeze. Either scenario indicates a squeeze is not a distant probability.\n\n**Earnings:** Robinhood has earnings coming up in October. This is going to be a hell of a catalyst, one way or another. Either the stock flies like RKT did in March 2021, when it doubled in price over a couple of days. Or it could sink like RKT did in March 2021, when it almost halved in price over a couple of days. Hell, it could even do both, like RKT did in March 2021! The market is a fickle mistress, my friends. One thing I find unlikely is that hedge funds will keep their short uncovered heading into earnings.\n\n**Logic:** The early investors who all came together to rescue HOOD from their liquidity crisis via cash infusions -- what do you think THEY'RE getting from that deal? Do you think these bankers and fund managers saved Robinhood from the kindness of their hearts? No, Robinhood raised capital by selling them shares, but these guys have to get something out of it too. Let's see, they collaborated before to shut down trading of meme stocks... I wonder what could happen next...\n\nNow, IMO all of these factors combine to make a squeeze extremely likely, but nothing is guaranteed. Let's take a quick look at the bearish arguments:\n\n**Bear talk**\n\n**1. \"Robinhood is evil and I'm not going to buy their shares, and neither is anyone else\"**\n\nHonestly, and this might be an unpopular opinion, but I truly could not give less of a dick about the immoral shit-doings of a company I own stock in. My baby-dick coin purse isn't going to affect geopolitics, or un-fuck the SEC, or suddenly spawn a spine in the backs of US lawmakers. Sure, Vlad is a dingdong, Robinhood gamifies gambling, and the company shut down the buy button (along with MANY other brokers, as I pointed out, although I will concede that Robinhood held out longer than others). That's all beside the point. Why? Well, I don't know about you, but I'm in this bitch to make money, not to make some hackeneyed fucking social commentary.\n\n**2. SEC recently granted permission to early investors to sell shares**\n\n[This](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-early-investors-granted-sec-144753648.html) is a more legitimate concern IMO. When these shares unlock, these early investors could create downward pressure on the stock if they start selling. This would give shorts more fuel while simultaneously sending the share price lower. Still, my experience in the market is that bad news like this is priced in at the very last minute.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, do you think these early investors will want to sell HIGH or will they want to sell LOW? I anticipate they will do anything to pump the share price before these shares unlock, dumping their bags on shorts that got caught with their pants down. And the perfect catalyst is right around the corner: **earnings**. As I mentioned, there could be a run up to earnings as shorts seek to limit risk by closing before earnings; the stock could pump post-earnings and incredible results -- whatever it is, these early investors can only sell ***after*** earnings, and even then, they can't sell all of their shares -- (not that I think they would even if they could). You think these early investors -- the hedge funds and financiers that helped rescue Robinhood from their liquidity crisis -- do you think they're going to sit around with their nuts in their hands and watch the stock price plummet leading up to the date they're allowed to sell? No way. They're going to pump that mother fucker for as much as it's worth, and then about ten times more. Hell, they might even ask Robinhood to disable the \"Sell\" button. After all, there's precedent for it now!\n\n**3. Payment-for-order-flow will be banned!!!!! Robinhood will lose a ton of their revenue!!!!!!!**\n\nNo it won't. Robinhood was able to pull billions from a hat recently. You think one of the hottest fintech companies is going to go tits up after such a large and high-profile cash infusion? Fucking **LOL**. PFOF is here to stay, and there's plenty of articles online about why that's the case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there you have it, the bullish and the bearish. If anyone has any valid counterpoints, I welcome them with open arms in the comments. Knowledge is money, and dissenting opinions shouldn't be downvoted and reviled simply because they disagree with you. Keep your eyes peeled in the comments section for angry people who post false or inflammatory information. Let's get this bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr: Robinhood ticks all the boxes for a short squeeze, and I don't give a fuck about your tin-pot market commentary.**\n\nDisclaimer: This post represents opinions, not advice. I'm long on the stock via shares and options.\n\nedit: Lot of people throwing shade via downvotes. Get in the comments and make a fucking point or stay salty.",

        "selftext": "I did very well on DWAC and just wanted to share my analysis with people- after the fact. Learning from what you did wrong (what you missed, etc.) is just as important as learning from what you did right. For people who did or didn't participate in the trade, I think it's worth taking some time for introspection. I think many people are clouded with tilt/anger from having missed it instead of stopping to say \"why did I miss it\". I'll try to walk through my thought process in real-time.\n\n**Wednesday night, hear about the DA, laugh at the absurdity of the situation, then check the prices.**\n\nWait, why are the warrants so cheap.. they're only like 50 cents? Oh.. I see, the DA came out after hours, so the market didn't have time to react to it, that makes sense.... But the stock has huge block trades of volume that traded, that's sketchy, oh wait, yeah, that also makes sense given the players. I can throw in a bid for $1.10 wts and see if I snag some.\n\n**Review Deck, finish in about 15 seconds.**\n\nWell the absurdity of the situation hasn't changed. Let's go check the daily spacs thread and see if those guys caught anything I'm missing.. nope, the whole situation is ridiculous.\n\n**Start thinking about scenarios...**\n\nMost obvious scenario is that this is just a dud and doesn't go anywhere. Trump and the Company are pretty gross, market probably won't like this, it probably won't go anywhere. From a valuation perspective, this probably doesn't make any sense to invest. Then again, don't forget that SPACs have NAV floor- don't dismiss things outright. Would I be a buyer at $9.50? Yes.. $10?.. probably yes.. $10.50..? Maybe?\n\n**Talk to some of my friends about this (at 11pm EST)...**\n\nSPACs (and investments in general) are going through a speculative cycle. Is DWAC something that people would want to speculate on? Is this meme-able? Well Trump probably is/can be a pretty big meme... He also has a really big megaphone, 35... 40% of the US population still genuinely love the guy. They're throwing hundreds of millions of dollars into his campaign/PACs etc.. would/could they do the same on the stock? If DOGE can goto $0.80, IRNT to $70, GME to $400, etc, can this be the next one?\n\n**Lets explore the meme angle... What does it take to meme?**\n\nIt basically just takes everyone to plow into a \"low float\" stock and push it up. It goes up as a function of the amount of money pouring into it, vs the size of the float. How big is the DWAC float? 30 million. We're not talking 2M Redemption squeeze levels, but $300m isn't a lot of money... Could/Would DJT himself buy it up just to promote himself...? possibly/probably? The guy hasn't really had a \"win\" in a while, he could either manufacture one, or at the very least, he would start bragging about the win if \"his media IPO went up a lot on day 1\". In fact, if it did start running, we'd expect him to start telling his base to invest in his company. (This isn't that different than Chamanth telling people to buy his SPACs back in January).\n\n**What would be the signs of it memeing?**\n\nRealistically, retail interest, and trading volume are the most important factors. What are the numbers we're looking for? Check comps of past retail pumps/etc. and you'll see 50m+ or 100m+ shares traded in a day are sort of the norms. If 100m (1B of notional value) shares trade, I can pretty much guarantee the stock is going to be up beyond $20 per share. Check stocktwits followers.. strange, only about 1000. This is discouraging but it's also really early and retail are slow to react.\n\n**Talk it out with the friends to think about position sizing.**\n\nWe want a position at $10 (it's basically risk free). How about $11.. how much risk do we want to take? How about $12?\n\nSizing should be about risk (not capital). Buying at $11 is half as risky as $12 since you have your $10 NAV floor in place. Decided to pick up 50k shares at $11 on the open. If this doesn't work out, we're down about $50k. There's a decent chance other people are \"quick\" like us and will also be trying to buy in premarket, so we want to get in at 4AM market open and hopefully pick off stale sell orders in the order book.\n\n**What's our sell strategy?**\n\nScenario 1: There's a chance this stock just drills to NAV and sits there forever, and we'll hold for a bit then eventually sell everything at the max loss. (maybe 80% this happens.. but if this doesn't happen, how does the remaining 20% split up into outcomes...?)\n\nScenario 2: It does moderately well, say goes to $15 ish, rally fizzles. (maybe 60%?)\n\nScenario 3: It may be a real retail pump, like IRNT/ARQQ, etc and goes to $40ish? (maybe 30%)\n\nScenario 4: It may be a crazy retail pump, like GME, and it goes to $200-$400? (maybe 2%?)\n\nScenario 5: It may be a new retail pump we've never seen before, and it goes beyond $500. (1%?)\n\nDo market caps matter (In a retail pump, yes and no. From a valuation perspective no, from a gross $$ required to push the price higher, it becomes very difficult for a $50B market cap company to double, etc.)\n\nThe goal is to allocate some of the position to all of the scenarios since you have no idea which one will happen. Most people already do this, it's just trimming your position on the way up. Diamond hands are for undisciplined investors that trade dollars for karma. Always scale out of your position, and don't blame yourself for selling too soon. With this we have a clear trading plan, buy the position, and then close about 60% at $15ish, another 30% at $35ish\n\n**Okay, got our buy plan, and our sell plan, time to execute.**\n\nIt's around 1am and we've spent 3 hours talking about good old DJT and the absurdity of markets and memes. This isn't a trade we normally participate in but things line up and look reasonable. Markets open at 4AM and we want to be first in the order book to buy. Setup premarket orders for $10.25, $10.50, $11.00, and $11.50. Oh, don't forget the Unit, throw some orders in for the UNIT as well in case other people miss that.\n\n**Get up at 3:55AM and get ready!**\n\nAt 4AM, I distinctly remember seeing none of my trades fill and with about 1900 shares trading the market was sitting at 13.50bid x 14.75ask.... Buying 50k at $11 is a pipe dream at this point in time. The stock trades a bit more and prices creep up a little higher, there's an iceberg seller at $16.00, seems to have sold 40k+ shares so far, and hasn't moved. $16 is such... a.. shitty... price... They're probably one of the insider-traders that picked up a 500k block yesterday. Where are all the arbs? They're holding 30M shares of this and none of them are selling. Is it because they're still asleep, or because they're smart enough to hold and sell at higher prices (like in Jan/Feb 2021). We're at like 80k shares traded at $16 which is a fair amount of retail demand... that's an interesting/notable sign.\n\nIt's honestly an agonizing decision but we still think the scenarios we've laid out are plausible, but the risk/reward at these levels are terrible compared to before. Settle on buying 5k shares at $16.00, and pick up some warrants at $4.00. If we wake up and the stock is $10 and the warrants are $1.50, we're gonna be down about $50k and it's gonna suck. Time for a nap.\n\n**7AM**\n\nWell that was the worst $50k alarm clock that I've ever had, I wish I slept through it. Those damn arbs finally woke up and are just pummeling the stock and selling every... single... tick.. Well, this looks pretty over. But is it? The volume traded is like.. 15m shares and it's only 7:10AM.. that's pretty crazy volume, in fact, at this rate we'll be well over 100m shares by the end of the day.. and if it trades that much, it's basically impossible that it'll still be sub $11.00.... Why are the arbs selling so aggressively, what do they know that I don't? Nothing.. so why are they selling, don't they see this massive buying pressure? Then again, their playbook has changed over the last 4 months since not a single \"DA Pop\" has survived... they're just happy to get anything above $11. I think they're misreading this situation, and I ... think? we should buy more here. It's $10.50, we're down nearly $50k, but there's only about 50 cents of risk left in the stock before NAV floor. So lets buy 25k more shares here (adds $12.5k of risk)... and some units that seem to be trading slightly below their component prices too! Should we buy more wts? Well, they're $1.70, and if this deal is a scam and it falls apart, there's like $1.20 in downside on the wts, meanwhile the stock only has $0.50ish in risk. Given the stock is less risky than the warrant, it's better to buy the stock.\n\n**9AM-10AM**\n\nVolumes are huge, stock twits followers up to 2k, still not a lot, but notably higher. Check to see if Apan-man is saying anything about the situation, his analysis matches ours, with trading volumes as high as they are now, we're forecasting 200m+ traded today and this thing is almost definitely going above $20. Apan-man has wts, we have stock, he always likes wts... in this case if you're betting on a meme/moon we know the wts will lag the stock significantly so we want to stick to the stock position. The thesis has changed, we're more bullish, we rework our scenario analysis, add more stock.\n\nThe rest of the day is actually less interesting. Mainly just trimming the position as it goes higher and monitoring newsfeeds to look for key catalysts. Most importantly we were convinced DJT would come out and toot his own horn, which shockingly never happened. Still looking for it to happen.\n\n**Postscript**\n\nHoldings are significantly smaller now after a ton of trimming all the way up. Hope you enjoyed reading my synopsis of the trade and learned something from it, I definitely learned a lot just by writing it because it made me think through all of the events and what decisions were being made at the time with the information we had. Or maybe this whole post is just chest thumping of someone who thinks he's smart that really just got lucky. It's up for you to decide-\n\nLast but not least, here's the gainprn for those who are into that sort of thing. Please note this is not a YOLO (I despise irresponsible money management), the actual risk taken on this position was not very large relative to the portfolio size.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6u1fal17ubv71.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c87df53f945ac5969424e15f2fd2c5d158b6d5da",

        "selftext": "RDBX (formerly SGAM) is debuting today and I believe it represents a strong investment opportunity. Most people seem to be excited about the small float (2M shares), but that's only part of the story. The most exciting thing to me is that at $10, it's valued at a forward P/E of 2.3 and has a brand awareness that rivals that most well-known brands in the world.\n\n**Redbox's Financials and 2.3 P/E**\n\nHere are Redbox's financials:  [https://imgur.com/DtQRLFU](https://imgur.com/DtQRLFU) \n\n||2019|2020|2021|2022|2023| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Rev ($M)|829|546|400|906|1112| |Ebitda ($M)|196|114|40|193|237| |New Movies in Theaters|140|69|59|140|140|\n\nAt $10, Redbox is valued at a market cap of $447M and enterprise value of $693M. In 2019, they generated a revenue of $829M and EBITDA of $196M (83% of that being FCF). In 2020 and 2021, the revenue dropped to $546M and $400M, with EBITDA at $114M and $40M respectively. Most people will assume that 2020/2021 dropped because Redbox suddenly fell out of favor, but the actual explanation is that the number of new movies released in 2020/21 were dramatically less than in normal years due to COVID. The average person on Reddit probably has super-fast internet, but there are many rural places in the US that don't have access to fast-internet and rely on Redbox for lag-free movie consumption. Additionally, Redbox's rentals are priced at $2 whereas the equivalent digital rental would be $6, making it a strong option for value-shoppers. \n\nLook at this graph to see how closely their legacy business (physical rentals) revenue tracks with the number of new movie releases per year: [https://imgur.com/a/uAVc0Lz](https://imgur.com/a/uAVc0Lz)\n\nIn 2019 there were 140 new movies, 2020 there were 68 new movies, 2021 there were 59 new movies, and in 2022 it is expected to return to a normal level of 140 new movies. \n\n**Redbox's Brand Exposure**\n\nJust about everyone knows Redbox and has positive feelings associated with the brand (cheap family movie nights). This is backed up by the fact that they have 40 million loyalty members, 43 million app downloads with a 4.8 rating, and 40,000 kiosks (more locations than Starbucks and McDonalds combined). \n\nTheir brand awareness makes me think that this will do on despac, as having a well-known brand is key to generating retail interest as we are well aware with companies like GME, AMC, and even recently WeWork and infamously, DWAC. Throwing out GME and AMC may sound like a pump, but the similarities are undeniable with Redbox having a movie rental disc business that is perceived to be dying. Redbox's profitability and valuation are way more attractive than GME and AMC ever did though even at their lowest points. \n\n**Pivot to Digital**\n\nRedbox's fast-growing digital business by itself would likely justify its entire valuation if it was any other SPAC. In 2019, their digital business had $20M rev, 2020 had $40M rev, and $2021 is expected to have $55M. Their 40 million loyalty members represent people that are late tech adopters, and so they have a promising opportunity to capitalize on a large segment of people that have not been already captured by other apps. Furthermore, Redbox is trying to make the experience simple for them, by combining various streaming apps/services into their one Redbox digital platform. This way, users don't have to download and sign into many different apps to see all of the available content. \n\nDisclosure: holding 50k warrants and 2k commons, not investment financial advice\n\nFurther references:\n\n[Investor Presentation](https://seaportglobalacquisition.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Redbox-Seaport-Global-Investor-Presentation-September-2021.pdf)\n\n[Investor Webcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWZq-LAXb8k)",

Key resistance coming up.\n\n# $AMC\n\n[$AMC 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/9o4i0rfhggu71.png?width=2326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e2394aa8854e7e95c979e73d7d5a56b9d4a057c)\n\nBroke a little **broadening descending wedge** of it's own and is running towards the same key resistance. It's sitting around **45.60**. Clear that, and **49.40** is next, followed by **65.01**. Invalid under **39.30** support.\n\n# $RKT\n\n[$RKT 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/cgb5qdeoggu71.png?width=2326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a99b5d7ced50b83f79d3333edc9099a9e1b72add)\n\nBroke a key downtrend and is headed toward it's first resistance at **18.04.** Above that is **21.65.** Invalid under **16.48** support.\n\n# $BB\n\n[$BB 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/1yegnonuggu71.png?width=2326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4343140ee6882d9800af8c522fc8655c4243a11)\n\nBroke two important trendlines, back tested one of them yesterday - and took off today. On it's way to **11.73** resistance.

Also broke two downtrends. Key resistance just above at **11.55.** Next up is **12.48,** then **20.69.** Invalid under **9.90** support.\n\n# $CLNE\n\n[$CLNE 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/djpvsz1bhgu71.png?width=2326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=128e7df45e273507aa3bbffa23f503f96f673781)\n\nBroke a descending wedge. Wouldn't call it a falling wedge because it extended so far down from the up move it came from. Just means don't look for far price targets. Coiling between **9.46** and **8.63.** Invalid between the lower level, but above can see **12.67.** After that (unlikely) **14.53.**\n\n\\---\n\n*Use these as roadmaps, not absolute predictions*\n\n*Not Financial Advice*",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, I've always had this question ever since adopting the value investing mindset: how does passive investing make sense? We define passive investing as DCAing into a low cost cap-weighted index fund such as SPY and VOO. This is considered to be the magic formula these days, and everyone recommends it (including Buffet). However, if you look at it from a value investing standpoint, it doesn't make a whole lotta sense to me. For argument's sake we'll look at SP 500. A lot of companies in the SP 500 are over-priced, such as Tesla (and even GME was in the SP 500 at some point I think). I would never invest in such over-priced companies, so why would I invest in SP 500? Is it simply due to the simplicity, diversification and the emotion independence? Another interesting perspective is the SP 500 is sort of a buy high sell low scheme. Companies enter the SP 500 when its valuation is high and leaves once it's beaten down - again makes no sense from a value perspective.\n\nThen on the other hand, passive investing is proven to work and even fund managers have a hard time beating the market...\n\nI'm seeing a lot of contradictions here, can anyone shed some light?",

        "selftext": "In this post we're going to check on all of our favorite meme stonks and see if they've got anything left in the tank from a technical analysis standpoint. Come one and come all and hear my tale, whether you're a distraught bagholder ape or someone looking to get in on what I believe may be the final moonshot. Not a financial advisor blah blah blah you know the thing.\n\nFirst off, none of these plays work without Meme Stonk Frenzy Round 3. We had Round 1 late January with GME being the big runner, round 2 early June with AMC melting faces, and while this doesn't make Round 3 a sure thing, I'd like to think retail isn't dead, the shorts haven't covered, and with Tesla being overbought as hell and the Trump Pump near a conclusion, money will flow back into the fucking MEMES.\n\n[The Big Triangle Thingy You've Probably Seen 1,000 Times Already](https://preview.redd.it/7wz09ua0vvv71.jpg?width=1841&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29b78952cc21ea41be357476a63d691169d2ddf7)\n\nAh yes. The fan favorite. I often wonder if u/TheRoaringKitty has secretly cashed in his tendies and escaped all this madness, but then I remember he's not a paper handed bitch, as I'm sure all of you aren't either. Either way, the GME saga could be coming to a massive close in the form of one last big move. Having briefly just broken below the 200 day simple moving average yesterday and bouncing back well, a break to the upside could make everything right in the world once again and bring GME back near 300 territory. A break and hold below the 200 MA is a possible sign of more downside to come. I have to admit the risk to reward here is juicy and am looking to fire up a few 200C  Jan 2022 and will add more upon confirmation of a breakout  of this massive triangle to 300 and beyond. Green line I have there is around 250 where it may be wise to take profits as the hedgies will try to short ladder attack as the perevious resistance of 240ish is broken. Oh yeah and the yellow line is beginning of 2022 so if we don't get a move by then we're prob fucked imo.\n\nGME TLDR: hold 200 MA, breakout top of triangle, then moon.\n\n[Another Triangle Thingy but Not Quite as Big](https://preview.redd.it/d28ufb91yvv71.jpg?width=1829&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc047671ee092bccd4412db8eeb2a0c5ee12c3bb)\n\nAnd now for the second meme that has become many apes meme stonk of choice. This guy has been coiling for a while since the absolute monster rip and like GME could be primed for another move. Sitting at the bottom of our nicely developing trendline, this is another great risk to reward opportunity. 50 would be a take profit zone as the shorts will look to hold it down there at previous resistance but hey, we know you apes aren't selling for that cheap. Red line could be a stop loss for those of you with wrinklier brains at about 32. 200 MA is catching up but not really a factor like GME. Break of 50 MA could easily fuel us to break the wedge and then to 50 and beyond.\n\nAMC TLDR: hold lower trendline, break top of triangle, then moon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Different Triangle Thingy Already Broken to Upside](https://preview.redd.it/16y3bd712wv71.jpg?width=1833&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3aa8314e63d9eac4c37e89f296758ce13e1c98a)\n\nDon't think I forgot about the meme stonk little brother, BB. This was to many not nearly on the same level as GME or AMC, but my how the tables have turned. This meme has actually gotten a LOT of good news (not going to include here but check it out) and many consider it to be more a fundamental play than meme at this point. But don't let them fool you, BB will be there aboard the rocket ship too when Round 3 begins. Already broke our wedge with nice volume a few days ago and has pulled back nicely to the 200 MA. Hold of this and a break above that blue dotted line near 12.25 should get us back to 15+ in no time.\n\nTLDR: Hold 200 MA, break 12.25, then moon.\n\nThese are just the big 3 I've seen upside in, but I'm sure there's many more memes to be had. Be fully prepared to lose all the money you put in as an options play, but if you go stocks then you can control your risk a lot better. Don't take this as real financial advise, as I'm just a fellow retard looking to be ready for Meme Frenzy Round 3.",

        "selftext": "In my opinion, now is the time to hedge long equity portfolio exposure, as there are multiple headwinds that the market will face over the next 12 months, which have only strengthened dramatically since the beginning of 2021, and yet despite this, the S&amp;P 500 has garnered more than 23% in returns during this same time-period. Please see below for my thoughts:\n\n1.  Inflation has proven to be more than transitory. Yes, I do believe that there are some parts of inflation that will likely be transitory and due to supply and demand equilibrium imbalances (supply constraints). We have seen this occur in certain commodities such as lumber, which reversed heavily from recent highs, and I also believe new automobiles is another category that will likely wane to some degree, as computer chip shortages are slowly rectified. This theoretically should bring the cost of used automobiles down over time as well. Despite all of this, the most concerning area of inflation is centered in residential real estate, specifically average rents, and owner\u2019s equivalent rents (OER). This area has been skyrocketing, being fueled by a low interest rate environment, a tight housing market with limited supply and lack of ramp up in building, and commodity input price increases. Given how large of an impact rental pricing and OER pricing has on overall consumer health, I expect this to be a major factor in macro-economic health. Furthermore, rental real estate is typically a fixed contract term length, which often extends to 12 months or more, therefore this inflation will prove to be \u201csticky\u201d.\n\n2.  The Federal Reserve (Fed) has indicated its plans to begin tapering their bond purchases. In simple terms, this is equivalent to injecting less money into bank reserves at the Fed. This in itself is likely not very meaningful, as there is so much excess liquidity in bank reserves that cannot enter into the real economy, as lenders do not have the risk appetite to lend as aggressively as they did pre-pandemic. A large part of this is the overall indebtedness of the average borrower, given the high accumulation of debt to cover cash flow shortfalls over the last 12 months. The real concern around Fed bond purchase tapering is simple. It indicates to the market that the Fed sees inflation as potentially more than transitory and that interest rate hikes are on the near-term horizon. The Fed is only tapering to avoid a situation where they are forced to raise rates to combat inflation, without having tapered first. In a global economy that is highly levered with consumer, corporate, and fiscal debts, along with financial and real asset valuations being at historical valuation levels, a material rise in interest rates is likely to weigh heavily on debt rollovers, which weighs on profits. Furthermore, as interest rates rise, they present an alternative to risk assets, which can weigh heavily on valuations. We had a 40-year bull market in bonds that has appeared to have leveled off, as the USA is not set up for negative nominal interest rates, even if real yields are currently negative. If the Fed must aggressively combat inflation, interest rates are the only tool in their bag as we know it. Ask former Fed Chairman Paul Volker how that went in the late 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s.\n\n3.  Intense speculation, or as former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke famously stated, \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d. It does not take much effort to scan the financial markets and find large swaths of intense speculation. A few to note include the ever-persisting emergence of SPACs, the GameStop, Nokia, Blackberry, dodge coin, and other debacles, excessive use of trading margin that is bordering all-time highs, intense call option volume across indices and individual stocks, the heavy emergence of novice retail traders, an entirely imprudent reliance on the Fed, and overall earnings, revenue, and PEG multiples that are unsightly. The only thing that is in the equity markets favor is that the bigger bubble is centered in bonds, as rates have been artificially suppressed by FOMC activities. And you will regularly hear market pundits quote this as the bullish case for equity markets. The \u201cthere is no other alternative to stocks argument\u201d. The \u201ctwo different investment classes are expensive, but one is more expensive so buy up the less expensive\u201d investment thesis could prove to be a painful one. Perhaps though, one of the most concerning aspects of this intensely speculative environment is that the market has entirely disconnected from the traditional aspects of finance. I am regularly witnessing market participants conflate \u201coperations returning to normal in a post-pandemic world\u201d to \u201cthis company will return to the same level of profitability as in 2019, during the pre-pandemic world\u201d. This is a clutching for straws argument. For example, Live Nation\u2019s common stock has risen over 33% from its pre-pandemic levels, despite taking on $3.2 billion in additional debt during the pandemic, burning insane amounts of cash monthly, and setting themselves up for their 2022 interest expense to be in line with 2019 annual profits, effectively wiping out profitability on a back-tested model. There are so many cases of this throughout the market, where financial sense has failed to prevail. \n\n4.  Highly concerning levels of zombie companies are hiding in the Russel 2000 index. A zombie company is a clich\u00e9 coined phrase, but it refers to companies that have such deteriorated balance sheets, and often similarly inadequate business models, that they are incredibly unlikely to ever see profitability. In prior research I performed in the second quarter of 2020, I evidenced about 30% of the Russel 2000 was comprised of zombie companies. The real reason for this is excessively low interest rates have allowed for incredibly lessened WACC (cost of capital) to where these companies continue to take on more corporate bonds and notes, while never servicing any of the debt principal. This is a cancer on the overall economy, as the free market fails to efficiently allocate capital, largely because the market is flooded with liquidity. If you are looking for a \u201cBlack Swan event\u201d that could bring this market to its knees, the Russel 2000 isn\u2019t a bad place to have a look around.\n\n5.  Fiscal spending that seriously places concern on the dollar\u2019s ability to maintain reserve currency status. The dollar\u2019s reserve status is the kingpin of US financial prosperity. Approximately 70 percent of the world\u2019s global debt is repaid in dollars, so demand has historically been there. However, the irresponsible fiscal actions of the United States have caused many to question the dollar\u2019s future status. Look no further than the SDR\u2019s and other financial instruments that are being used oversees to circumvent trading with the dollar, including between Russia and China regarding petrol.\n\n6.  Democratic party is proposing changes of taxation that could seriously impact corporate profitability, investor sentiment, and overall transactional actions. Proposed changes include raising the corporate tax rate to 26% to 27%, a large increase in capital gains tax rates, the implementation of an unrealized gain tax on the ultra-wealthy investors, who often have high exposures to equity holdings, and other costly propositions. \n\n7.  An interesting reason I recommend hedging your portfolio now is the relative price of the Volatility Index (VIX) versus the growing level of risks or headwinds facing equity markets. With the VIX trading at approximately $16 or so, near the long-term historical average, portfolio insurance in the form of options become more attractive, given the lowered price level of premiums. When volatility is tamped down or acting tamed, portfolio insurance cost typically lessens. Now is not a bad time to lock in portfolio insurance to hedge long positions, if one is not willing to risk triggering a taxable event through selling or exit the market entirely, risking not capturing further upside gains.\n\nTo hedge a reasonable amount of risk, I am looking to the SPY $350 strike put option expiring on January 20, 2023, trading at $13.03 to hedge approximately 14 to 15 months of long SPY or equity market exposure. A reasonable position would be 2% to 5% of total portfolio value in this long put position.",

        "selftext": "I'm sure you've all seen the headlines over the past week or so about rising bond yields, and I'm honestly surprised that the majority of investors I've talked to don't know how this affects their stock allocations. They read about the rising bond yields and how that hurts growth stocks, but the articles never dive into exactly why this happens. I felt compelled to write this post because I found out my mother put the majority of her 401K into QQQ, ARKK, and ARKG back in July. The recent downwards move in these names has her spooked, and on the phone she mentioned she has no idea why these ETFs (ARKK and ARKG in particular) are going down more than the rest of the market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo preface this post, this is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor. But I have been investing my own money for the better part of the past two decades and have seen long term success. I've learned a lot from my friends who work in the industry over the years so hopefully I can shed some light on how institutions, the ones driving the market, operate. I commonly rotate my investments based on what I've learned and macroeconomic variables in order to achieve a more optimal strategic positioning in the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, onto rising bond yields. This site lets you see the yields for notes of various maturities: [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield). All of the bond yields have risen this past week, but the one of particular concern is the yield on the 2 YR treasury note. It hasn't been this high since March 2020, and analysts are projecting it will rise even higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis move was fueled by fears of more persistent inflation, the upcoming taper that will begin after the November Fed meeting, and the prospect of rate hikes coming sooner than originally anticipated.  The Fed isn't alone either. Central Banks all around the world have signaled plans to tighten monetary policy: the BoE for example [https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691](https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691), Brazil (except no one really cares about Brazil) [https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike](https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike), and countries in the Eurozone [https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH](https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFed officials at the most recent meeting moved up their expectations for a rate hike in 2022 and increased the number of rate hikes expected in 2023 ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/)). If inflation continues to persist, which is likely due to strong demand-pull and supply-side constraints like the disruptions we're seeing in Southeast Asia due to Covid, then we'll see these rate hike expectations move forward even more. A higher federal funds rate results in higher bond yields.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe market digested this information from last week and it is now being priced into the market. So why do growth stocks get hammered more than the rest of the market when bond yields rise? Even today, for October 1st, the NASDAQ rose 0.65% while the S&amp;P 500 rose a whopping 1.23%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason is because of how companies are fundamentally valued. After all, the market isn't a casino, even though it can seem like it at times. Shout out to GME and AMC. So what does a company's stock price really represent? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFundamentally, a company's stock price represents the present value of its future cash flows. This valuation method is commonly used in the industry and is known as a discounted cash flow (read [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) if you want to expand on this even more but I'll summarize). Basically, how do you calculate the **present** value of **future** cash flows? You take those future cash flows and you *discount* them by the risk free rate, often represented by bond yields. The reason we do this discounting is because that future cash flow is worth less BECAUSE it happens in the future. That money, if available in the present, could have generated the risk free rate each year. \n\nLet's look at an example to see how discounting works. Let us assume stock A is expected to produce cash flow of $100 in 2022, $200 in 2023, and $500 in 2024 and the risk free rate is 1%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.01 + $200/(1.01)\\^2 + $500/(1.01)\\^3 = $780\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut what happens if the risk free rate increases to 2%?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen we get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.02 + $200/(1.02)\\^2 + $500/(1.02)\\^3 = $761\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe key takeaway from this is that rising bond yields mean future cash flows will be worth less at present. The reason growth stocks get so hammered on moves in bond yields is because the majority of their cash flow comes in the future, and that's why they can be valued so richly when bond yields are at record lows (like through all of 2020 and the beginning of 2021). Take Nikola, for example, it currently has no free cash flow but it's valued because it promises future free cash flow. Quantumscape, TuSimple, and so many more names fall into this category.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrowth stocks have fallen out of favor for this reason and is why ARKK, ARKG, and all of the other ARK ETFs have already dropped over 20% from their all time highs. The concentration of growth stocks in the NASDAQ is also the reason for its underperformance this past week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReddit forums always scream, \"don't fight the FED,\" and they're right. For times like these, it's best to rotate out of growth and into value names. The Fed TELLS you what they're going to do and this past Fed meeting was the most hawkish Fed meeting I've listened to in a long time. I'm not claiming that markets will crash, far from it, I'm simply claiming that growth stocks are not where you want to be. \n\nThis is going to hit a capitulation point when bond yields rise even more. This Twitter post shows the underperformance of ARKK's investments: [https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2](https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2). The only reason ARK is even alive is because of Tesla, and rising bond yields will eventually catch up to Tesla too, which is currently valued at 400x PE. You might be thinking now is a good time to pick up these names at a discount, but that would be ill-advised. If you're planning to hold for the next decade and through a potential 50-90% drawdown, then go ahead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a reason Michael Burry has been shorting ARKK ([https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html)) and one of the largest positions in his fund is a Tesla short ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html)) specifically because he foresees an unfavorable environment for growth stocks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've been wondering why SPACs have been dying, this is why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've been wondering why your growth stocks have been dying, this is why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've been debating whether or not to sell your ARK ETFs, this is why. Cathie Wood is simply a marketing genius who got lucky off moonshot plays in Bitcoin and Tesla, and then leveraged that success to convince the public to drive in-flows into her ARK ETFs over the past years. Those inflows helped propel a bunch of growth names higher, but ARK will eventually be a victim of its own success as outflows force selling into already declining stock prices. This reddit post is from February of 2021 when ARKK died because of, you guessed it, rising bond yields: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors\\_beware\\_arkk\\_is\\_a\\_liquidity\\_disaster/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors_beware_arkk_is_a_liquidity_disaster/). Looking at the 2 YR yield, this time might be significantly worse. This is why I told my mother to move everything over to $VTI and a selection of value names: $ADNT, $GM, $F, $KRE, $HEES, $HRI, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ONLY stock in ARKK with a reasonable PE multiple is COIN. Every other name has a multiple in either the high-flying hundreds, or the stock is simply a money burning piece of shit experiencing slowing growth. GL investors - stay safe out there. If you've been holding ARKK, it's okay to take a loss. When investing, and over the long run, losses are bound to happen. My biggest losses all came from holding onto the hope that my stock would recover, even though I knew deep down it wouldn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn case you were living under a rock this week: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-yield-surge-challenges-investor-confidence-in-big-tech-companies-11632907865](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-yield-surge-challenges-investor-confidence-in-big-tech-companies-11632907865)",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, sort of a cross post. This got deleted on wsb so maybe this is a better place for this stuff. Here's my take on IBM, and why I think it needs way more love and attention. I'll try and post my positions in the comments as it doesn't wanna let me do it here...\n\nHey, so I've been riding the wave after GME trying to find a few places to store cash that could help diversify my portfolio and help to keep my gains from riding that rocket. One of those is IBM. Theres an insane amount of reasons I've decided to go with this company, and at first it was as a nest egg option to help grow my account at a consistent rate (dividends are @ 4.56% right now). It also has HUGE upside potential, it is in basically the same industry as Microsoft but only has a market cap of 117 billion vs Microsofts HUGE 2.3T. Doing the math there is goddamn simple and if you were in the market for mad gains why would you not look at this as a huge growth investment.\n\nNow there has been a huge crash on IBM, take it from me this is a sale. Big Blue missed their quarterly revenue by .06 billion, but they met their expected eps. Some short seller went on tv a couple days ago before their report and basically bashed them saying they were a prime short selling target [Jim Chanos, betting against IBM, accuses firm of 'financial engineering' (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/short-seller-jim-chanos-reveals-bet-against-ibm-ahead-of-earnings-this-week.html) .\n\nThe reason this crash is so enticing is because of a spinoff company named Kyndryl. IBM will be splitting off its managed infrastructure services portion and making it into a tradable company. sometime in November. WHICH BY THE WAY IS ALSO FREE MONEY, for every 5 shares of IBM you get 1 share of Kyndryl. Besides the free Kyndryl stock, IBM is now free to pave the way with a lighter and more streamlined company, and their focus is basically the same mark et as microsoft.

        "selftext": "I've wanted to learn to trade, and invest in stocks since I was a teenager. Without a mentor it took me a while to make the leap. I began to trade in 2018, and got by until I learned about options. \n\nThere should not be a need to say that I blew up my entire account. $4,000 was a lot of money to me back then. Those losses hurt so bad that I barely traded until the COVID recovery rally in 2020. \n\nI had a nice thick 20K bonus from work, and put the entire amount in my Webull account. I began to calmly trade shares here and there for a few weeks before the pandemic. I was happy making about $500 a month in gains. I had an amateurish goal of 2% porfolio gains a week. And then I felt like I was catching traction -- that perhaps I was getting good at this -- so I traded larger positions, and eventually back to options. \n\nTo be fair I took a lot of time to research and understand options, stocks, and the market. Although, there was still so much I did not know, and this would later cost me a lot of losses. \n\nDuring the bull run I quickly resorted to exclusively trading calls. I grew my 20K to 26K by 2020 year end, and then to 88K by September 2021. \n\nHere are my top 5 winners:\n28K GME\n15K CRSR\n8K SKLZ\n4K PLTR\n4K ZS \n\nTrading became an obsession. I no longer cherished $500 month gains, I wanted much more. I spent $12,000 in vacations, I promised to help my mother buy a house, and I became a bigger consumer. I thought this type of growth would last. \n\nI was caught with my pants down when the Evergrande news broke out. I was holding $8,000 in STLD and another $7,000 in WMT calls, which both expired worthless. I lack good risk management, and did not pay any attention to the macroeconomics, the fed, or world news. \n\nThat stung. I don't see losses that big, and it was unpleasant to be set back while on my journey to reaching 6 digit numbers. No one in my family has ever had that kind of money. I grew up poor after all. I needed this money back quickly, and so I gambled into the bearish momentum, and got my account back to $72,0000 (excluding the $12,000 I've already taken out and spent). It's this easy? I thought. \n\nIn September life had bogged me down, and I was feeling a little depressed. I had a lot of responsibilities, stress, and not much time for myself. This was also the busiest time of the year at work. \n\nI was obsessed with making big gains, and this was the beginning to my empire crumbling. I stuck to trying to scalp weekly QQQ puts, and one day it wasn't working out. I mentally checked out, and kept averaging down on my puts until I had $30,000 in puts with a 20% loss. These puts had 6 days or so to expiring, including a weekend. \n\nOne fine Monday morning, before market open, and 2 days before my puts expire, I planned out my exit on this position. Luckily, during the weekend there was bearish sentiment in the market and I had an opportunity to profit. I guessed the movement nearly perfectly, but I did not close out my position for big gains. \n\nI was busy at work, and my window for profit was short lived. I could have prioritized this huge risky position I had, but instead I didn't. I should have had my eyes glued to that sell button and sold when I saw $20,000 in gains. But instead I assisted some people at work, and 10 minutes later I'm back to 20% losses. A few hours later I'm at 40%, and it only goes down hill from there. \n\nI beat myself up a lot over this loss. I should have known better I thought. I felt like I betrayed my family, myself, and my 1 year old son -- whom I want a better upbringing for than the one I had. But the losses didn't stop there, I continued to gamble until my account reach $25,000 (excluding the $12,000 spent. \n\nSo during 2021 my account has only gone from $26,000 to $37,000. Not bad right? But I am forever disappointed. The hopes and dreams of not being poor, of a better future for my family, and having financial freedom seem so far away again. It's actually quite depressing. All of my remaining money is invested in VOO, and I will still need to pay taxes on the money I took out. I can't take out the money invested, because it's the only safety net for my family. \n\nNow I am trading with measly amounts. The confidence is gone. The hopes and dreams diminished. But I still need to achieve success, and I need to get back up this hill. Does anyone have any advice, or kind words that'd make me feel better? Asking for a friend.",

Since then I've tried investing in other stocks, being based in England I don't do any options trading thankfully, but I've not managed to turn any profit on my own. \n\nLet's be brutally honest, I don't know what I'm doing. Thankfully the money I've been investing with has been profit from GME, so I've not been putting any of \"my\" money in.

Pride in the company? Faith it will be the Amazon of gaming? \n\nI honestly feel like the ship has sailed when it comes to ridiculous price spikes. I do believe that everything that happened gave good visibility and good PR to the company, I have however some doubts on the long term results. \n\nWould appreciate your thoughts on this.

Just like a grandma that fell, it's not getting up either. It seems to be struggling a lot and it hasn't been able to get going again.

        "selftext": "I know it's controversial amongst the traditionalists, the animals, and the international espionage community, however in light of recent events, it's time to start shilling about the Memes. Namely GME.\n\nSince it's January burst GME almost on schedule moons every 3 months as do a wide variety of memes with them. Laugh now but everybody remembers CLOV, CLNE, WISH, AMC, even BB bumped. TSLA speaks for itself. Unfortunately we can't talk about certain topics however money was to be made on various other trading avenues and at this point, it's time to acknowledge the lucrative business of hype based on speculation and mathematical mechanics. \n\nFirst of all, I justify this based purely on the power of volume, and I tell you now, social fads thrive on volume, just look at Pokemon cards. \n\nWith that said and hence the floor being set by God's Second Son, Lord DFV, exercising at 156$ per share, with GME reaching sub 180$ per share, I think it's highly worth considering investing back in big daddy. \n\nGME has consistently in pattern reached sup-300$ and +240$ multiple times, excuse my liquor, but approximately on more than 10 occasions has this phenomenon occurred where the stock, which we like, goes under 200$, and skyrockets for 25% or more. \n\nTimes are desperate gentlemen and everyone loves video games for Christmas. Let's go ahead, jump on the home team, devolve, and hop aboard the Polar Rocket for the win. \n\nTLDR; watching price overnight, if it dips below 175$ will buy portion of shares with a double down set aside for anything close to 155$",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to a new day, frrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, December 2nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise 100 points as travel stocks get boost following omicron sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose in early trading Thursday despite the arrival of the latest Covid variant on U.S. shores and as the White House tightened travel restrictions.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 120 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration\u2019s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.\n*****\n&gt; Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; Dow component Boeing\u2019s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe remain cautious on S&amp;P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity &amp; quantitative strategy.\n*****\n&gt; Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&amp;P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAnother risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell\u2019s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word \u2018transitory\u2019 indicate that the Fed\u2019s focus is now inflation rather than employment.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&amp;P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,\u201d TD Securities said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday\u2019s whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,\u201d said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. \u201cThe next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a print of 240,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones. The prior reading showed 199,000 first-time filers, which was the lowest since November 1969. The November jobs report will be released on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Thursday\u2019s reading follows a better-than-expected ADP report on Wednesday. Private payrolls increased by 534,000 in November, ahead of the expected 506,000.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/lcmXJqv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/s3ioTNr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/p6nFjhw.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($DG $KR $EXPR $SIG $TD $VERU $GMS $DLTH $CM $LE $SCWX $EH $MEI)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/C4kn8oK.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XAPdoyp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/P3xLOTx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/G1tGjkp.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8154yxP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/830rtCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5SsP6hb.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Vwv5b34.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/21JATCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* AAPL\n* DWAC\n* BA\n* ABUS\n* AMC\n* ADA.X\n* CFVI\n* CMMB\n* AGC\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-snowflake-boeing-apple-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Snowflake** \u2014 The cloud data company\u2019s shares jumped more than 13% after the company reported quarterly results that beat revenue estimates.

But, they are simply trying to gain the spotlight again after a full year of getting crushed by the market and especially GME and AMC. They were on the ropes all year with DKNG, but only now decided to show their face after a massive pullback. Every state hasn\u2019t even legalized Mobile Sports Betting.

        "selftext": "A New Metric to analyze and predict the future price of stocks is here, whether we like it or not. I am talking about quantified social media sentiments. The more I learn about the correlation of sentiments vs price, the more I see traditional stock signals as insufficient for determining the stock movement, and how insight into social sentiment is critical.\n\n**The core principle underlying technical analysis is that the market price reflects all available information that could impact a market**. But is this true now? I would argue that nowadays, the price of a particular stock also reflects the social media sentiments. For e.g., AMC and GME stocks broke all fundamentals and technicals that the analysts believed to be true and depicted the price what the market sentiments provided.\n\nOver the last year, we had significant growth in terms of retail investors both in stocks and crypto -- now adding up to over 30% of the investor market. Most of them, like myself, joined the market with very limited knowledge on analysis tools. Most of them look for trends on social media to make gains and cut losses. Why? Because it saves time. Following someone else\u2019s footsteps seems a comfortable signal that moves the price of the stock. So then why do the analysis tools still exclude these signals?\n\nAs a curious follower of the market trends, I would say that it is time to come up with a new playbook for stock market analysis. A playbook that breaks down the analysis into three main areas:\n\n1\\] Technical Analysis \n\n2\\] Fundamental Analysis \n\n3\\] Social Signals \n\nand then brings it together to provide insights on the stocks. \n\nCurrently, I have not seen many platforms offer all these services. But some platforms like public, daizy, swaggstocks and alphatrend have started to work around the community aspect of investing. Will the future of fintech products evolve to include social media sentiments as one of the analysis tools is something that we will have to wait and see. But for now, based on what I am reading, it sure seems like we are headed to a future where social media sentiments would be more of a need than a nice-to-know feature.",

        "selftext": "Chinese company traded on an exchange like the Nasdaq would cease. Stock listed on established exchanges are part of a system of regulation and institutional operations that can offer certain investor protections.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. If it cease to trade in nasdaq it doesnt mean we cant trade. There are many brokers who offer OTC markets. ( over-the-counter )\n2. Well, we all know hw much regulation would actually help a retail investor. What help did they do when Robinhood ceased GME trading ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Case study :**\n\nLast summer, Chinese coffee chain operator Luckin Coffee was delisted from the Nasdaq after the company revealed the fabrication of 2.2 billion yuan ($340 million) in sales. The stock hit a 52-week low of 95 cents a share. But shares rose even after going \u201cover-the-counter\u201d and closed at $8.64 each on Monday. (0.95 to 8.64)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy did this happens ? It is due to low liquidity the stocks move violently which is great for retailers who love AMC and GME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Case of AliBABA :**\n\nAlibaba Group (BABA) stock plummeted on news that the Chinese Communist Party (\"CCP\") intended to ban foreign VIEs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Cunt bloomberg reports suggested that Beijing was planning on banning foreign listings entirely  would result in BABA and 247 other companies worth a collective $2.1 trillion being delisted.\n2. Many fud have voiced the opinion that Alibaba is at risk of being delisted.\n\nThe claim was made in publications like Bloomberg as well as smaller outlets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Important :**\n\n**Recently, China's own securities regular chimed in on the matter, saying that a ban on foreign VIEs was not being considered.**\n\nChina's securities watchdog CSRC says reports on China's possible bans on overseas listing through VIE are NOT TRUE. &lt;&lt; official tweet&gt;&gt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://twitter.com/Sino\\_Market/status/1466004472866369539?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1466004472866369539%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1\\_&amp;ref\\_url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fembed%2F17846](https://twitter.com/Sino_Market/status/1466004472866369539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1466004472866369539%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fembed%2F17846)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Going by these reports, it appears that China won't be banning foreign VIEs, and that BABA won't be delisted. For the short term, at least, the stock is staying on the NYSE.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PART 2  : However, the possibility of delisting is important for knowledge gain.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat would happen when a Foreign Stock is Delisted?\n\nIf you hold a foreign stock and it gets delisted from a U.S. exchange, you still own the stock. A stock's listing status has nothing to do with ownership rights: your holdings are still valid. However, you lose the ability to trade the stock on U.S. exchanges, and its NYSE or NASDAQ ticker disappears. In this scenario, you may still be able to trade the stock OTC. Most brokerages allow OTC trading, though not all stocks are supported. As part of this article, OTC stocks inside a brokerage account:\n\n**Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY).** \n\n**( VWAGY a full $125 billion )**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn BABA's case, the stock would likely be tradeable, since it has a large market cap and already has an OTC ticker **(OTCPK:BABAF)**.\n\nIf BABA were delisted your broker would roll you over to the OTC shares, allowing you to trade them that way. The above is pretty much what happens to investors still holding a stock when it is delisted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOption 2 for BABA'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Converting BABA shares to 9988 shares.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'9988' is the ticker symbol for Alibaba on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Each 9988 share is worth 1/8th of a BABA ADR. This means that you can have your broker convert each BABA share you own to eight 9988 shares. Then, you will have regular exchange-traded shares that trade during Hong Kong business hours Monday to Friday. In order to get them, you may have to call your broker.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\"DONT PANIC AND SELL in this FUD\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cathie Wood\u2019s money managing firm Ark Invest on Thursday for the first time bought shares in the U.S. listed Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng Inc on the dip . Ark Invest picked up 277,263 shares \u2014 estimated to be worth $13.39 million .**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I hope this helped in giving new perspective about Delisting Stonks and nothing there to Panic**",

        "selftext": "So as of November 15, AMC had 17% of its float shorted. Just yesterday, more than 3.8% was shorted. These shorts would help explain the sharp dip in $AMC this week. So I was wondering, for all you seasoned apes out there who actually know what you're talking about, is this a good time to short squeeze? I feel like with the new Spiderman movie coming out and AMC offering NFTs with pre-orders, AMC should be going up in value but it's not. If I'm way off here, I apologize, still kinda new.

        "selftext": "# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, December 6th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures jump 200 points as investors rotate out of tech and into bets on the recovery](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; Dow Jones Industrial average futures jumped and Nasdaq-100 futures lagged as investors looked past the emerging threat from the omicron Covid-19 variant, rotating out of high-priced technology shares and into names linked to the recovering economy.\n*****\n&gt; Here\u2019s what was influencing the markets to start the week:\n&gt; * Shares linked to the economic reopening gained in Monday premarket trading like energy, industrials and airlines.\n&gt; * Investors continued to sell tech stocks with relatively high valuations. Those shares dragged the market down to a losing week on Wall Street last week.\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield rebounded after falling last week amid the omicron threat.\n&gt; * There\u2019s a major shift underway at the Federal Reserve to bring about a faster end to its pandemic easing policies.\n&gt; * Bitcoin lost $10,000 since Friday, including a sudden drop overnight from Friday to Saturday. The move showed decreasing risk appetite and is hitting related tech stocks.\n&gt; * Dow futures gained 223 points, or 0.8%, while Nasdaq-100 futures shed 0.2% in early Monday trading. S&amp;P 500 futures were higher by 0.3%.\n*****\n&gt; High-priced tech shares were lower in premarket trading, continuing a de-risking theme in markets. Nvidia was off by nearly 3% in premarket trading. Tesla fell about 2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSuper-cap tech has been well bid on the expectation of \u2018forever\u2019 low rates and support,\u201d said Tom Essaye, author of the Sevens Report, \u201cbut with the prospect of rates rising and this new Fed paradigm, we are seeing investors rotate out of tech and into sectors with better exposure to higher growth.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He added that it was the Fed that pulled the market back late last week, and not fears about the omicron variant.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTech pulled the entire market lower. Essentially, we are seeing a sort of Taper Tantrum 2.0 as markets react to a more hawkish Fed and rotate into sectors with more positive exposure to rising rates,\u201d Essaye said.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.92% with shares of Tesla as the biggest drag. Cathie Wood\u2019s flagship Ark Innovation Fund fell more than 5% Friday, and all of the fund\u2019s holdings are now in a bear market apart from two stocks. Teladoc Health, Zoom Video, Roku, Palantir and Twilio are some of the names that have registered steep losses.\n*****\n&gt; Ark Innovation was down another 2% in premarket trading Monday.\n*****\n&gt; Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell unnerved markets by signaling the Fed\u2019s focus was inflation, even with the new variant emerging.\n*****\n&gt; Comments by Fed officials suggest that the Fed is likely to decide to double the pace of its taper to $30 billion a month at its meeting next week, CNBC\u2019s Steve Liesman reported on Monday. Initial discussions could also begin as soon as the December meeting about when to raise interest rates and by how much next year.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks linked to the reopening of the economy gained on Monday, boosting sentiment on Dow futures. Boeing and Chevron shares were in the green.\n*****\n&gt; Delta Airlines shares gained about 2% in premarket trading. Carnival and Wynn Resorts shares were about about 1%. Cruise lines and travel booking stocks were higher too.\n*****\n&gt; Bitcoin traded around $57,000 on Friday morning, but by Saturday had plunged to around $43,000. By Monday the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency had clawed back some of its losses, last trading at around $47,377.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Coinbase lost more than 4% in premarket trading, while Square declined by about 2%.\n*****\n&gt; Slower-than-expected job growth also contributed to Friday\u2019s selling. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 210,000 last month, the Labor Department said Friday, which was below the 573,000 number economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cA softer payrolls print pulled the rug beneath risk sentiment,\u201d TD Securities wrote Friday in a note to clients. As investors fled to safety the yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 1.335%, the lowest since Sept. 21.\n*****\n&gt; Friday\u2019s selling wrapped up a volatile week for the major averages as investors evaluated new information about the omicron variant.\n*****\n&gt; All three major averages finished the week in the red, with the Dow registering a fourth straight negative week for the first time since September 2020. The S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite were both down for a second consecutive week.\n*****\n&gt; Small cap names were hit especially hard, with the Russell 2000 falling 3.86% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDespite our forecast for a flat year for the S&amp;P 500...we are still bullish on pockets of the market, including small caps,\u201d Bank of America said Friday in a note to clients. \u201cSmall caps are more domestic, more exposed to the services spending recovery, bigger beneficiaries of capex/reshoring and are inexpensive vs. large caps,\u201d the firm added.\n*****\n&gt; However, Bank of America said the potential upside for small caps hinges on Covid cases staying under control.\n*****\n&gt; The omicron variant has now been discovered in at least 15 U.S. states, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told ABC News on Sunday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe know we have several dozen cases and we\u2019re following them closely. And we are every day hearing about more and more probable cases so that number is likely to rise,\u201d she said on \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](hhttps://i.imgur.com/hk2QMMD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/w6utI7X.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/UmSQYNH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/28oKFM3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/UbdFVET.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($CHPT $GME $LULU $CHWY $COST $AZO $RH $SAIC $LOVE $AVGO $DLHC $PATH $COUP $MDB $ASO $DBI $THO $ORCL $PLAY $CBP $SFIX $HRL $S $CONN $SUMO $SOL $UNFI $KFY $GTLB $CIEN $ALCO $PD $TOL $HQY $CASY $CNM $VRA $GEF $JW.A $ALOT $PLAB $AOUT)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/ARPnz4g.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/v0Sno0F.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yS9qzWO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sz567v5.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/s9GIfxy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zBWalJo.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Cz7EeMl.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/b9WecCH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YNP20Vh.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/an62JBq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* CFVI\n* AMC\n* BTT.X\n* ASTS\n* NIO\n* HITI\n* ACET\n* SRNE\n* TACO\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/06/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-kohls-factset-alibaba-and-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Kohl\u2019s (KSS)** \u2013 The retailer\u2019s stock rallied 2.8% in the premarket following news that activist investor Engine Capital is urging Kohl\u2019s to consider either a sale of the company or a separation of its e-commerce business.

Talk about shorts/hedgies owning a stock ! With this having such a small float of only 20mil , it would so easy for the AMC and GME guys to absolutely destroy them ! It was done in CTRM which is in the same sector just much much much larger float and when eyes were set on them they had a similarly sized fleet asGLBS . Especially because it is only trading at 25% of its Net Asset Value alone yet the company is now super profitable !! Just absolutely wild ! Anyway need this to go viral so we can set up an attack and make us all rich off these criminal hedges and shorts ! And I don't understand why when I bring this ticker up I get a 15 day ban .... this is a HUGE scam on the exchange and us apes should rip them a new a-hole !

The more I learn about the correlation of sentiments vs price, the more I see traditional stock signals as insufficient for determining the stock movement, and how insight into social sentiment is critical.\n\n**The core principle underlying technical analysis is that the market price reflects all available information that could impact a market**. But is this true now? I would argue that nowadays, the price of a particular stock also reflects the social media sentiments. For e.g., AMC and GME stocks broke all fundamentals and technicals that the analysts believed to be true and depicted the price what the market sentiments provided.\n\nOver the last year, we had significant growth in terms of retail investors both in stocks and crypto -- now adding up to over 30% of the investor market. Most of them, like myself, joined the market with very limited knowledge on analysis tools. Most of them look for trends on social media to make gains and cut losses. Why? Because it saves time. Following someone else\u2019s footsteps seems a comfortable signal that moves the price of the stock. So then why do the analysis tools still exclude these signals?\n\nAs a curious follower of the market trends, I would say that it is time to come up with a new playbook for stock market analysis. A playbook that breaks down the analysis into three main areas:\n\n1\\] Technical Analysis \n\n2\\] Fundamental Analysis \n\n3\\] Social Signals \n\nand then brings it together to provide insights on the stocks. \n\nCurrently, I have not seen many platforms offer all these services. But some platforms like public, daizy, swaggstocks and alphatrend have started to work around the community aspect of investing. Will the future of fintech products evolve to include social media sentiments as one of the analysis tools is something that we will have to wait and see. But for now, based on what I am reading, it sure seems like we are headed to a future where social media sentiments would be more of a need than a nice-to-know feature.",

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, December 2nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise 100 points as travel stocks get boost following omicron sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose in early trading Thursday despite the arrival of the latest Covid variant on U.S. shores and as the White House tightened travel restrictions.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 120 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration\u2019s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.\n*****\n&gt; Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; Dow component Boeing\u2019s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe remain cautious on S&amp;P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity &amp; quantitative strategy.\n*****\n&gt; Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&amp;P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAnother risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell\u2019s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word \u2018transitory\u2019 indicate that the Fed\u2019s focus is now inflation rather than employment.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&amp;P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,\u201d TD Securities said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday\u2019s whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,\u201d said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. \u201cThe next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a print of 240,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones. The prior reading showed 199,000 first-time filers, which was the lowest since November 1969. The November jobs report will be released on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Thursday\u2019s reading follows a better-than-expected ADP report on Wednesday. Private payrolls increased by 534,000 in November, ahead of the expected 506,000.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/lcmXJqv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/s3ioTNr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/p6nFjhw.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($DG $KR $EXPR $SIG $TD $VERU $GMS $DLTH $CM $LE $SCWX $EH $MEI)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/C4kn8oK.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XAPdoyp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/P3xLOTx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/G1tGjkp.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8154yxP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/830rtCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5SsP6hb.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Vwv5b34.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/21JATCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* AAPL\n* DWAC\n* BA\n* ABUS\n* AMC\n* ADA.X\n* CFVI\n* CMMB\n* AGC\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-snowflake-boeing-apple-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Snowflake** \u2014 The cloud data company\u2019s shares jumped more than 13% after the company reported quarterly results that beat revenue estimates.

        "selftext": "# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, December 6th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# Dow futures jump 200 points as investors rotate out of tech and into bets on the recovery](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; Dow Jones Industrial average futures jumped and Nasdaq-100 futures lagged as investors looked past the emerging threat from the omicron Covid-19 variant, rotating out of high-priced technology shares and into names linked to the recovering economy.\n*****\n&gt; Here\u2019s what was influencing the markets to start the week:\n&gt; * Shares linked to the economic reopening gained in Monday premarket trading like energy, industrials and airlines.\n&gt; * Investors continued to sell tech stocks with relatively high valuations. Those shares dragged the market down to a losing week on Wall Street last week.\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield rebounded after falling last week amid the omicron threat.\n&gt; * There\u2019s a major shift underway at the Federal Reserve to bring about a faster end to its pandemic easing policies.\n&gt; * Bitcoin lost $10,000 since Friday, including a sudden drop overnight from Friday to Saturday. The move showed decreasing risk appetite and is hitting related tech stocks.\n&gt; * Dow futures gained 223 points, or 0.8%, while Nasdaq-100 futures shed 0.2% in early Monday trading. S&amp;P 500 futures were higher by 0.3%.\n*****\n&gt; High-priced tech shares were lower in premarket trading, continuing a de-risking theme in markets. Nvidia was off by nearly 3% in premarket trading. Tesla fell about 2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSuper-cap tech has been well bid on the expectation of \u2018forever\u2019 low rates and support,\u201d said Tom Essaye, author of the Sevens Report, \u201cbut with the prospect of rates rising and this new Fed paradigm, we are seeing investors rotate out of tech and into sectors with better exposure to higher growth.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He added that it was the Fed that pulled the market back late last week, and not fears about the omicron variant.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTech pulled the entire market lower. Essentially, we are seeing a sort of Taper Tantrum 2.0 as markets react to a more hawkish Fed and rotate into sectors with more positive exposure to rising rates,\u201d Essaye said.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.92% with shares of Tesla as the biggest drag. Cathie Wood\u2019s flagship Ark Innovation Fund fell more than 5% Friday, and all of the fund\u2019s holdings are now in a bear market apart from two stocks. Teladoc Health, Zoom Video, Roku, Palantir and Twilio are some of the names that have registered steep losses.\n*****\n&gt; Ark Innovation was down another 2% in premarket trading Monday.\n*****\n&gt; Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell unnerved markets by signaling the Fed\u2019s focus was inflation, even with the new variant emerging.\n*****\n&gt; Comments by Fed officials suggest that the Fed is likely to decide to double the pace of its taper to $30 billion a month at its meeting next week, CNBC\u2019s Steve Liesman reported on Monday. Initial discussions could also begin as soon as the December meeting about when to raise interest rates and by how much next year.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks linked to the reopening of the economy gained on Monday, boosting sentiment on Dow futures. Boeing and Chevron shares were in the green.\n*****\n&gt; Delta Airlines shares gained about 2% in premarket trading. Carnival and Wynn Resorts shares were about about 1%. Cruise lines and travel booking stocks were higher too.\n*****\n&gt; Bitcoin traded around $57,000 on Friday morning, but by Saturday had plunged to around $43,000. By Monday the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency had clawed back some of its losses, last trading at around $47,377.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Coinbase lost more than 4% in premarket trading, while Square declined by about 2%.\n*****\n&gt; Slower-than-expected job growth also contributed to Friday\u2019s selling. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 210,000 last month, the Labor Department said Friday, which was below the 573,000 number economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cA softer payrolls print pulled the rug beneath risk sentiment,\u201d TD Securities wrote Friday in a note to clients. As investors fled to safety the yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 1.335%, the lowest since Sept. 21.\n*****\n&gt; Friday\u2019s selling wrapped up a volatile week for the major averages as investors evaluated new information about the omicron variant.\n*****\n&gt; All three major averages finished the week in the red, with the Dow registering a fourth straight negative week for the first time since September 2020. The S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite were both down for a second consecutive week.\n*****\n&gt; Small cap names were hit especially hard, with the Russell 2000 falling 3.86% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDespite our forecast for a flat year for the S&amp;P 500...we are still bullish on pockets of the market, including small caps,\u201d Bank of America said Friday in a note to clients. \u201cSmall caps are more domestic, more exposed to the services spending recovery, bigger beneficiaries of capex/reshoring and are inexpensive vs. large caps,\u201d the firm added.\n*****\n&gt; However, Bank of America said the potential upside for small caps hinges on Covid cases staying under control.\n*****\n&gt; The omicron variant has now been discovered in at least 15 U.S. states, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told ABC News on Sunday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe know we have several dozen cases and we\u2019re following them closely.

What is this guy on? This account was from early COVID with money I had lying around figured I\u2019d give stocks a go and somewhere along the way I messed with it less and less until I stopped completely. Would it be best to just flat out sell it all and work my way back up? Or go stock by stock and try to predict the outlook for each? Any and all unofficial advice would be appreciated. First thing I\u2019d like to do is condense my stock picks as I\u2019m spread across the world with this many. Not quite sure if the majority of the market is down this past month or if it is just the general stocks I have majority of money in atm. Thanks for reading this far, lmk.",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to a new day, frrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, December 2nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise 100 points as travel stocks get boost following omicron sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose in early trading Thursday despite the arrival of the latest Covid variant on U.S. shores and as the White House tightened travel restrictions.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 120 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration\u2019s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.\n*****\n&gt; Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; Dow component Boeing\u2019s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe remain cautious on S&amp;P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity &amp; quantitative strategy.\n*****\n&gt; Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&amp;P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAnother risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell\u2019s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word \u2018transitory\u2019 indicate that the Fed\u2019s focus is now inflation rather than employment.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&amp;P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,\u201d TD Securities said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday\u2019s whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,\u201d said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. \u201cThe next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a print of 240,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones. The prior reading showed 199,000 first-time filers, which was the lowest since November 1969. The November jobs report will be released on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Thursday\u2019s reading follows a better-than-expected ADP report on Wednesday. Private payrolls increased by 534,000 in November, ahead of the expected 506,000.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/lcmXJqv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/s3ioTNr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/p6nFjhw.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($DG $KR $EXPR $SIG $TD $VERU $GMS $DLTH $CM $LE $SCWX $EH $MEI)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/C4kn8oK.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XAPdoyp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/P3xLOTx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/G1tGjkp.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8154yxP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/830rtCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5SsP6hb.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Vwv5b34.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/21JATCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* AAPL\n* DWAC\n* BA\n* ABUS\n* AMC\n* ADA.X\n* CFVI\n* CMMB\n* AGC\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-snowflake-boeing-apple-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Snowflake** \u2014 The cloud data company\u2019s shares jumped more than 13% after the company reported quarterly results that beat revenue estimates.

        "selftext": " $AMC are we guys still about the message ? Are we all here to make money and beat down sh!t-head hedges ? Then we need us apes to come to the most corrupt stock on the exchange !Globus Maritime or (glbs)just blew earnings away yesterday and went over 3x estimates yet they are still setting an all time low today ??  Talk about shorts/hedgies owning a stock ! With this having such a small float of only 20mil , it would so easy for the AMC and GME guys to absolutely destroy them ! It was done in CTRM which is in the same sector just much much much larger float and when eyes were set on them they had a similarly sized fleet asGLBS . Especially because it is only trading at 25% of its Net Asset Value alone yet the company is now super profitable !! Just absolutely wild ! Anyway need this to go viral so we can set up an attack and make us all rich off these criminal hedges and shorts ! And I don't understand why when I bring this ticker up I get a 15 day ban .... this is a HUGE scam on the exchange and us apes should rip them a new a-hole ! Millions and millions flushed into shorts hands from retail . \n\nHere is a link for the Q3 results and Q4 is going to be better : [Q3 Results as of yesterday ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/globus-maritime-limited-reports-financial-210500259.html)\n\n\nADMIN :\nAs per the rules it said no company that doesn't report thats under the specific market cap and they do report .",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to a new day, frrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, December 2nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise 100 points as travel stocks get boost following omicron sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose in early trading Thursday despite the arrival of the latest Covid variant on U.S. shores and as the White House tightened travel restrictions.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 120 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration\u2019s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.\n*****\n&gt; Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; Dow component Boeing\u2019s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe remain cautious on S&amp;P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity &amp; quantitative strategy.\n*****\n&gt; Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&amp;P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAnother risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell\u2019s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word \u2018transitory\u2019 indicate that the Fed\u2019s focus is now inflation rather than employment.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&amp;P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,\u201d TD Securities said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday\u2019s whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,\u201d said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. \u201cThe next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a print of 240,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones. The prior reading showed 199,000 first-time filers, which was the lowest since November 1969. The November jobs report will be released on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Thursday\u2019s reading follows a better-than-expected ADP report on Wednesday. Private payrolls increased by 534,000 in November, ahead of the expected 506,000.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/lcmXJqv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/s3ioTNr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/p6nFjhw.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($DG $KR $EXPR $SIG $TD $VERU $GMS $DLTH $CM $LE $SCWX $EH $MEI)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/C4kn8oK.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XAPdoyp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/P3xLOTx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/G1tGjkp.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8154yxP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/830rtCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5SsP6hb.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Vwv5b34.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/21JATCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* AAPL\n* DWAC\n* BA\n* ABUS\n* AMC\n* ADA.X\n* CFVI\n* CMMB\n* AGC\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-snowflake-boeing-apple-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Snowflake** \u2014 The cloud data company\u2019s shares jumped more than 13% after the company reported quarterly results that beat revenue estimates.
