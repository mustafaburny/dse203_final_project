        "selftext": "Hello Traders and Investors! An exciting week ahead of us, here is my weekly newsletter which I share every Monday to help prepare you for the week! Feel free to DM me and happy trades!\n\n**Week of 4/19/21**\n\nThe S&amp;P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday  \n4/16/21.\n\nApple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversial  \ntracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls \u201cApp Tracking Transparency,\u201d for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, \u201cbiggest competitor.\u201d Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, \u201cTechnology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we\u2019re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.\u201d\n\nApple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.\n\nEmerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.\n\nReports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the \u201cdouble-Irish,\u201d loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 &amp; 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it\u2019s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.\n\nThe September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.\n\nJP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world\u2019s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe\u2019s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.\n\nA relatively low amount of major economic numbers will be released this week. Reporting starts with Jobless Claims at 8:30AM on Thursday, April 22nd. Instead expect a busy week for earnings reports, with many major companies reporting earnings throughout the week.\n\nSome of the larger players releasing earnings include Coca-Cola, on Monday, Johnson and Johnson on Tuesday, Intel on Thursday, and American Express on Friday. Also reporting earnings this week are several of the major travel companies impacted by last year's COVID shutdowns. This includes United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and Royal Caribbean.\n\n**Some of the companies with earnings this week:**\n\n**Monday, April 19th:**  \nCoca-Cola Co.  \nIBM Corp.  \nUnited Airlines\n\n**Tuesday, April 20th:**  \nJohnson and Johnson  \nProcter and Gamble  \nNetflix  \nPhillip Morris  \nLockheed Martin\n\n**Wednesday, April 21st:**  \nProgressive  \nFifth Third  \nVerizon  \nChipotle  \nEquifax  \nNasdaq  \nDiscover  \nHaliburton  \nBaker Hughes  \n**Thursday, April 22nd:**  \nIntel  \nBlackstone  \nSnap  \nBiogen  \nSouthwest Airlines  \nCredit Suisse  \nVeriSign  \nOld Dominion  \nTractor Supply  \nQuest Diagnostics  \nBoston Beer Company  \nAmerican Airlines\n\n**Friday, April 23rd:**  \nHoneywell  \nAmerican Express  \nRoyal Caribbean\n\n**Numbers this week:**\n\n**Thursday, April 22nd:**\n\n* Continuing Jobless Claims (April 10th).\n* Initial Jobless Claims (April 17th).\n* Existing Home Sales (SAAR) (March).\n* Leading economic indicators (March).\n\n**Friday, April 23rd:**\n\n* Market Manufacturing PMI (April).\n* Market Services PMI (April).\n* New Home Sales (SAAR) (March).",

        "selftext": "Morningstar Analyst, Abhinav Davuluri, raised his Fair Value price of $AMD to $101 recently on April 14th \\[[https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/amd/quote](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/amd/quote)\\], from the $77 that he had set back in Jan 27th, when the stock was at $88, made a run for $94 two weeks later, before plunging down the depth of hades shortly thereafter...  I hate that the guy was right, but he was right...  So, maybe he's right about his new target, as well.  Also, AMD has tons of price targets in the $100+ range, and all the rumors and news points to a gangbusters Q1 earnings ($WDC, $MU, $IBM, and $TSM, all major players in the PC and data center space has had huge revenue beats), it's crazy that the stock is still under $80 just a week before earnings!   \n\n\nPersonally, from my own attempts at TA \\[[https://i.imgur.com/rpDaio0.png](https://i.imgur.com/rpDaio0.png)\\], I believe $AMD is at the bottom of it's current price channel, and the stock is going to start recovering towards Q1 earnings; my hope is that AMD will experience a Parabolic jump like it did on July of last year, the situations are similar, where it spent long periods of trading sideways, while the rest of the tech sector was booming, AMD being flat then didn't make any sense, nor does it now.  Full disclosure, I have a ton of 5/7 Call options riding on a Monster Q1 earnings beat and guidance.",

        "selftext": "As I do each week, here's a look at the markets and this week's earnings through the lens of expected moves. The expected move is not a prediction of exactly how a stock will react, but an actionable signal of how options traders are pricing the moves with ramifications for your own trade set-ups (risk, strike selection, etc) As always let me know in the comments if there are any obvious/interesting stocks I missed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Markets**\n\n**Last Week \u2013** The **SPY** closed Friday at new highs, up about **1.6%** on the week. Once again, that move was beyond what options were pricing (1.1%). The outsized move higher was not enough to affect implied volatility. The **VIX** was down slightly on the week, closing near 16.\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are pricing a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$413** as a *bearish consensus* and **$421** as a *bullish consensus.*\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week (April 19th):**\n\n* SPY 1%\n* QQQ 1.5%\n* IWM 1.9%\n\n[Chart](https://tools.optionsai.com/expected-move/SPY?symbol=SPY&amp;symbols=QQQ&amp;symbols=IWM) via Options AI's expected move calculator.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8jyvlyi3zt61.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbdcd87796391482151ad43e672320d921f1d90f\n\nAlthough the current levels of implied volatility are the lowest in more than a year, they are not historically low. The VIX was 12 before the Covid sell-of in early 2020. It has spent the last few months compressing from the 30\u2019s to where it is now and as the past several weeks have shown, it is able to move in one direction (higher) beyond where options are pricing.\n\nEarnings season heats up even more this week. Low levels of market volatility affect options pricing in individual stocks, and there is always the possibility of idiosyncratic moves (on earnings misses or beats) that will be difficult for options to isolate ahead of time. Translation: Options need to price the fact that stocks aren't moving around much day to day, then they need to price the possibility of a big move on earnings, that can be difficult to get right if anything unexpected happens. On the flipside, if the stock barely moves on earnings the market probably won't help move it much in the days after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In the News**\n\nThis big news of last week was the direct listing of **Coinbase (COIN)** shares. The stock closed the week near $340. Options in Coinbase have not been listed yet but that could happen by the end of this week.\n\nBitcoin itself saw some volatility over the weekend with a bit of a Flash Crash from 65k to 55k. **BTC** options are pricing about a **7%** move for the upcoming week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings**\n\nThe lower levels of implied volatility in the broader market coincide with earnings season. This week sees reports from **IBM, Netflix, Snap, Intel, Chipotle** and more.\n\nHere's how options are pricing potential moves, and how that compares to actual stock moves on prior earnings events. (links below go to the stock\u2019s expected move page via Options AI free earnings calendar):\n\n[**KO**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/KO) / Expected Move: **2.4%** / Recent moves: 0%, +1%, +2%\n\n[**IBM**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/IBM) / Expected Move: **4.3%** / Recent moves: -10%, -6%, 0%\n\n[**UAL**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/UAL) / Expected Move: **4.5%** / Recent moves: -6%, -4%, -4%\n\n[**NFLX**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/NFLX) / Expected Move: **6.1%** / Recent moves: +17%, -7%, -7%\n\n[**JNJ**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/JNJ) / Expected Move: **2%** / Recent moves: +3%, -2%, +1%\n\n[**CMG**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/CMG) / Expected Move: **4.3%** / Recent moves: -2%, -5%, -5%\n\n[**LVS** ](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/LVS)/ Expected Move: **5%** / Recent moves: 0%, +8%, -4%\n\n[**SNAP**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/SNAP) / Expected Move: **12.4%** / Recent moves: +9%, +28%, -6%\n\n[**INTC**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/INTC) / Expected Move: **5%** / Recent moves: -9%, -11%, -16%\n\n[**LUV**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/LUV) / Expected Move: **4%** / Recent moves: +1%, +5%, -2%\n\n[**AXP**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/AXP) / Expected Move: **3.3%** / Recent moves: -4%, -4%, -1%",

        "selftext": "\"In Amazon\u2019s 1997 letter to shareholders, our first, I talked about our hope to create an \u201cenduring franchise,\u201d one that would reinvent what it means to serve customers by unlocking the internet\u2019s power. I noted that Amazon had grown from having 158 employees to 614, and that we had surpassed 1.5 million customer accounts. We had just gone public at a split-adjusted stock price of $1.50 per share. I wrote that it was Day 1.\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way since then, and we are working harder than ever to serve and delight customers. Last year, we hired 500,000 employees and now directly employ 1.3 million people around the world. We have more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. More than 1.9 million small and medium-sized businesses sell in our store, and they make up close to 60% of our retail sales. Customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa. Amazon Web Services serves millions of customers and ended 2020 with a $50 billion annualized run rate. In 1997, we hadn\u2019t invented Prime, Marketplace, Alexa, or AWS. They weren\u2019t even ideas then, and none was preordained. We took great risk with each one and put sweat and ingenuity into each one.\n\nAlong the way, we\u2019ve created $1.6 trillion of wealth for shareowners. Who are they? Your Chair is one, and my Amazon shares have made me wealthy. But more than 7/8ths of the shares, representing $1.4 trillion of wealth creation, are owned by others. Who are they? They\u2019re pension funds, universities, and 401(k)s, and they\u2019re Mary and Larry, who sent me this note out of the blue just as I was sitting down to write this shareholder letter:\n\nI am approached with similar stories all the time. I know people who\u2019ve used their Amazon money for college, for emergencies, for houses, for vacations, to start their own business, for charity \u2013 and the list goes on. I\u2019m proud of the wealth we\u2019ve created for shareowners. It\u2019s significant, and it improves their lives. But I also know something else: it\u2019s not the largest part of the value we\u2019ve created.\n\n### Create More Than You Consume\n\nIf you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn\u2019t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn\u2019t long for this world. It\u2019s on the way out.\n\nRemember that stock prices are not about the past. They are a prediction of\u00a0future\u00a0cash flows discounted back to the present. The stock market anticipates. I\u2019m going to switch gears for a moment and talk about the past. How much value did we create for shareowners in 2020? This is a relatively easy question to answer because accounting systems are set up to answer it. Our net income in 2020 was $21.3 billion. If, instead of being a publicly traded company with thousands of owners, Amazon were a sole proprietorship with a single owner, that\u2019s how much the owner would have earned in 2020.\n\nHow about employees? This is also a reasonably easy value creation question to answer because we can look at compensation expense. What is an expense for a company is income for employees. In 2020, employees earned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of $91 billion.\n\nHow about third-party sellers? We have an internal team (the Selling Partner Services team) that works to answer that question. They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were between $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I\u2019ll go with $25 billion.\n\nFor customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers.\n\nWe\u2019ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of that for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time.\n\nCustomers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are finished in less than 15 minutes. Compare that to the typical shopping trip to a physical store \u2013 driving, parking, searching store aisles, waiting in the checkout line, finding your car, and driving home. Research suggests the typical physical store trip takes about an hour. If you assume that a typical Amazon purchase takes 15 minutes and that it saves you a couple of trips to a physical store a week, that\u2019s more than 75 hours a year saved. That\u2019s important. We\u2019re all busy in the early 21st\u00a0century.\n\nSo that we can get a dollar figure, let\u2019s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventy-five hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each Prime member of about $630. We have 200 million Prime members, for a total in 2020 of $126 billion of value creation.\n\nAWS is challenging to estimate because each customer\u2019s workload is so different, but we\u2019ll do it anyway, acknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud versus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS\u2019s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, that 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost reduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the increased speed of software development \u2013 something that can significantly improve the customer\u2019s competitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value except to say that it\u2019s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings. To be conservative here (and remembering we\u2019re really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I\u2019ll say it\u2019s the same and call AWS customer value creation $38 billion in 2020.\n\nAdding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion.\n\nSummarizing:  \nShareholders \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0$21B  \nEmployees \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$91B  \n3P Sellers\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $25B  \nCustomers\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$164B  \nTotal\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$301B\n\nIf each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the \u201cbottom lines\u201d from those income statements. These numbers are part of the reason why people work for us, why sellers sell through us, and why customers buy from us. We create value for them. And this value creation is not a zero-sum game. It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw the box big around all of society, and you\u2019ll find that invention is the root of all real value creation. And value created is best thought of as a metric for innovation.\n\nOf course, our relationship with these constituencies and the value we create isn\u2019t exclusively dollars and cents. Money doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Our relationship with shareholders, for example, is relatively simple. They invest and hold shares for a duration of their choosing. We provide direction to shareowners infrequently on matters such as annual meetings and the right process to vote their shares. And even then they can ignore those directions and just skip voting.\n\nOur relationship with employees is a very different example. We have processes they follow and standards they meet. We require training and various certifications. Employees have to show up at appointed times. Our interactions with employees are many, and they\u2019re fine-grained. It\u2019s not just about the pay and the benefits. It\u2019s about all the other detailed aspects of the relationship too.\n\nDoes your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn\u2019t. I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it\u2019s clear to me that we need a better\u00a0vision\u00a0for how we create value for employees \u2013 a vision for their success.\n\nIf you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That\u2019s not accurate. They\u2019re sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment center employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work.\n\nEmployees are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to stretch, get water, use the rest room, or talk to a manager, all without impacting their performance. These informal work breaks are in addition to the 30-minute lunch and 30-minute break built into their normal schedule.\n\nWe don\u2019t set unreasonable performance goals. We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data. Performance is evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things can impact performance in any given week, day, or hour. If employees are on track to miss a performance target over a period of time, their manager talks with them and provides coaching.\n\nCoaching is also extended to employees who are excelling and in line for increased responsibilities. In fact, 82% of coaching is positive, provided to employees who are meeting or exceeding expectations. We terminate the employment of less than 2.6% of employees due to their inability to perform their jobs (and that number was even lower in 2020 because of operational impacts of COVID-19).\n\n### Earth\u2019s Best Employer and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work\n\nThe fact is, the large team of thousands of people who lead operations at Amazon have always cared deeply for our hourly employees, and we\u2019re proud of the work environment we\u2019ve created. We\u2019re also proud of the fact that Amazon is a company that does more than just create jobs for computer scientists and people with advanced degrees. We create jobs for people who never got that advantage.\n\nDespite what we\u2019ve accomplished, it\u2019s clear to me that we need a better vision for our employees\u2019 success. We have always wanted to be Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company. We won\u2019t change that. It\u2019s what got us here. But I am committing us to an addition. We are going to be Earth\u2019s Best Employer and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work.\n\nIn my upcoming role as Executive Chair, I\u2019m going to focus on new initiatives. I\u2019m an inventor. It\u2019s what I enjoy the most and what I do best. It\u2019s where I create the most value. I\u2019m excited to work alongside the large team of passionate people we have in Ops and help invent in this arena of Earth\u2019s Best Employer and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work. On the details, we at Amazon are always flexible, but on matters of vision we are stubborn and relentless. We have never failed when we set our minds to something, and we\u2019re not going to fail at this either.\n\nWe dive deep into safety issues. For example, about 40% of work-related injuries at Amazon are related to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), things like sprains or strains that can be caused by repetitive motions. MSDs are common in the type of work that we do and are more likely to occur during an employee\u2019s first six months. We need to invent solutions to reduce MSDs for new employees, many of whom might be working in a physical role for the first time.\n\nOne such program is WorkingWell \u2013 which we launched to 859,000 employees at 350 sites across North America and Europe in 2020 \u2013 where we coach small groups of employees on body mechanics, proactive wellness, and safety. In addition to reducing workplace injuries, these concepts have a positive impact on regular day-to-day activities outside work.\n\nWe\u2019re developing new automated staffing schedules that use sophisticated algorithms to rotate employees among jobs that use different muscle-tendon groups to decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from MSD risks. This new technology is central to a job rotation program that we\u2019re rolling out throughout 2021.\n\nOur increased attention to early MSD prevention is already achieving results. From 2019 to 2020, overall MSDs decreased by 32%, and MSDs resulting in time away from work decreased by more than half.\n\nWe employ 6,200 safety professionals at Amazon. They use the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. In 2021, we\u2019ll invest more than $300 million into safety projects, including an initial $66 million to create technology that will help prevent collisions of forklifts and other types of industrial vehicles.\n\nWhen we lead, others follow. Two and a half years ago, when we set a $15 minimum wage for our hourly employees, we did so because we wanted to lead on wages \u2013 not just run with the pack \u2013 and because we believed it was the right thing to do. A recent paper by economists at the University of California-Berkeley and Brandeis University analyzed the impact of our decision to raise our minimum starting pay to $15 per hour. Their assessment reflects what we\u2019ve heard from employees, their families, and the communities they live in.\n\nOur increase in starting wage boosted local economies across the country by benefiting not only our own employees but also other workers in the same community. The study showed that our pay raise resulted in a 4.7% increase in the average hourly wage among other employers in the same labor market.\n\nAnd we\u2019re not done leading. If we want to be Earth\u2019s Best Employer, we shouldn\u2019t settle for 94% of employees saying they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work. We have to aim for 100%. And we\u2019ll do that by continuing to lead on wages, on benefits, on upskilling opportunities, and in other ways that we will figure out over time.\n\nIf any shareowners are concerned that Earth\u2019s Best Employer and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work might dilute our focus on Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company, let me set your mind at ease. Think of it this way. If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. In fact, I\u2019m confident they will reinforce each other.\n\n### The Climate Pledge\n\nIn an earlier draft of this letter, I started this section with arguments and examples designed to demonstrate that human-induced climate change is real. But, bluntly, I think we can stop saying that now. You don\u2019t have to say that photosynthesis is real, or make the case that gravity is real, or that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level. These things are simply true, as is the reality of climate change.\n\nNot long ago, most people believed that it would be good to address climate change, but they also thought it would cost a lot and would threaten jobs, competitiveness, and economic growth. We now know better. Smart action on climate change will not only stop bad things from happening, it will also make our economy more efficient, help drive technological change, and reduce risks. Combined, these can lead to more and better jobs, healthier and happier children, more productive workers, and a more prosperous future. This doesn\u2019t mean it will be easy. It won\u2019t be. The coming decade will be decisive. The economy in 2030 will need to be vastly different from what it is today, and Amazon plans to be at the heart of the change. We launched The Climate Pledge together with Global Optimism in September 2019 because we wanted to help drive this positive revolution. We need to be part of a growing team of corporations that understand the imperatives and the opportunities of the 21st\u00a0century.\n\nNow, less than two years later, 53 companies representing almost every sector of the economy have signed The Climate Pledge. Signatories such as Best Buy, IBM, Infosys, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Siemens, and Verizon have committed to achieve net-zero carbon in their worldwide businesses by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge also requires them to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis; implement decarbonization strategies through real business changes and innovations; and neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets. Credible, quality offsets are precious, and we should reserve them to compensate for economic activities where low-carbon alternatives don\u2019t exist.\n\nThe Climate Pledge signatories are making meaningful, tangible, and ambitious commitments. Uber has a goal of operating as a zero-emission platform in Canada, Europe, and the U.S. by 2030, and Henkel plans to source 100% of the electricity it uses for production from renewable sources. Amazon is making progress toward our own goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of our initial 2030 target. Amazon is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world. We have 62 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 125 solar rooftops on fulfillment and sort centers around the globe. These projects have the capacity to generate over 6.9 gigawatts and deliver more than 20 million megawatt-hours of energy annually.\n\nTransportation is a major component of Amazon\u2019s business operations and the toughest part of our plan to meet net-zero carbon by 2040. To help rapidly accelerate the market for electric vehicle technology, and to help all companies transition to greener technologies, we invested more than $1 billion in Rivian \u2013 and ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from the company. We\u2019ve also partnered with Mahindra in India and Mercedes-Benz in Europe. These custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian are already operational, and they first hit the road in Los Angeles this past February. Ten thousand new vehicles will be on the road as early as next year, and all 100,000 vehicles will be on the road by 2030 \u2013 saving millions of metric tons of carbon. A big reason we want companies to join The Climate Pledge is to signal to the marketplace that businesses should start inventing and developing new technologies that signatories need to make good on the Pledge. Our purchase of 100,000 Rivian electric vans is a perfect example.\n\nTo further accelerate investment in new technologies needed to build a zero-carbon economy, we introduced the Climate Pledge Fund last June. The investment program started with $2 billion to invest in visionary companies that aim to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Amazon has already announced investments in CarbonCure Technologies, Pachama, Redwood Materials, Rivian, Turntide Technologies, ZeroAvia, and Infinium \u2013 and these are just some of the innovative companies we hope will build the zero-carbon economy of the future.\n\nI have also personally allocated $10 billion to provide grants to help catalyze the systemic change we will need in the coming decade. We\u2019ll be supporting leading scientists, activists, NGOs, environmental justice organizations, and others working to fight climate change and protect the natural world. Late last year, I made my first round of grants to 16 organizations working on innovative and needle-moving solutions. It\u2019s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals, and I\u2019m excited to be part of this journey and optimistic that humanity can come together to solve this challenge.\n\n### Differentiation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical\n\nThis is my last annual shareholder letter as the CEO of Amazon, and I have one last thing of utmost importance I feel compelled to teach. I hope all Amazonians take it to heart.\n\nHere is a passage from Richard Dawkins\u2019 (extraordinary) book The Blind Watchmaker. It\u2019s about a basic fact of biology.\n\n\u201cStaving off death is a thing that you have to work at. Left to itself \u2013 and that is what it is when it dies \u2013 the body tends to revert to a state of equilibrium with its environment. If you measure some quantity such as the temperature, the acidity, the water content or the electrical potential in a living body, you will typically find that it is markedly different from the corresponding measure in the surroundings. Our bodies, for instance, are usually hotter than our surroundings, and in cold climates they have to work hard to maintain the differential. When we die the work stops, the temperature differential starts to disappear, and we end up the same temperature as our surroundings. Not all animals work so hard to avoid coming into equilibrium with their surrounding temperature, but all animals do some comparable work. For instance, in a dry country, animals and plants work to maintain the fluid content of their cells, work against a natural tendency for water to flow from them into the dry outside world. If they fail they die. More generally, if living things didn\u2019t work actively to prevent it, they would eventually merge into their surroundings, and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die.\u201d\n\nWhile the passage is not intended as a metaphor, it\u2019s nevertheless a fantastic one, and very relevant to Amazon. I would argue that it\u2019s relevant to all companies and all institutions and to each of our individual lives too. In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or things that make you special?\n\nI know a happily married couple who have a running joke in their relationship. Not infrequently, the husband looks at the wife with faux distress and says to her, \u201cCan\u2019t you just be normal?\u201d They both smile and laugh, and of course the deep truth is that her distinctiveness is something he loves about her. But, at the same time, it\u2019s also true that things would often be easier \u2013 take less energy \u2013 if we were a little more normal.\n\nThis phenomenon happens at all scale levels. Democracies are not normal. Tyranny is the historical norm. If we stopped doing all of the continuous hard work that is needed to maintain our distinctiveness in that regard, we would quickly come into equilibrium with tyranny.\n\nWe all know that distinctiveness \u2013 originality \u2013 is valuable. We are all taught to \u201cbe yourself.\u201d What I\u2019m really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical \u2013 in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don\u2019t let it happen.\n\nYou have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it\u2019s worth it. The fairy tale version of \u201cbe yourself\u201d is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don\u2019t expect it to be easy or free. You\u2019ll have to put energy into it continuously.\n\nThe world will always try to make Amazon more typical \u2013 to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nAs always, I attach our 1997 shareholder letter. It concluded with this: \u201cWe at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.\u201d That hasn\u2019t changed a bit. I want to especially thank Andy Jassy for agreeing to take on the CEO role. It\u2019s a hard job with a lot of responsibility. Andy is brilliant and has the highest of high standards. I guarantee you that Andy won\u2019t let the universe make us typical. He will muster the energy needed to keep alive in us what makes us special. That won\u2019t be easy, but it is critical. I also predict it will be satisfying and oftentimes fun. Thank you, Andy.\n\nTo all of you: be kind, be original, create more than you consume, and never, never, never let the universe smooth you into your surroundings. It remains Day 1.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTo our shareowners:\n\nJeffrey P. Bezos  \nFounder and Chief Executive Officer  \nAmazon.com, Inc.",

        "selftext": " **TL;DR**: Cognyte (CGNT) will very likely be acquired by Nano-Dimensions (NNDM), in a form of merger called a Reverse Triangular Merger, for a number of reasons including: highly synergistic offerings, favorable tax treatment and government funding given enjoyed by both Israeli companies, posturing and hiring of new executives in the defense space with head of M&amp;A being recent president at Verint systems division which was spun-off to become CGNT as of February 2021. The combined entity would be profitable due to CGNT\u2019s expanding margins and revenues along with NNDM\u2019s large cash position and cash burn that is manageable on the combined balance sheet. Additionally the combined entity would be an industry leader with more offerings and capabilities globally than their competitors of Palantir or Fire Eye. The acquisition will occur quickly and likely be funded significantly from NNDM stock and the rest cash. Given the mismatch of market caps and estimated BV multiple of 7x-10x CGNT shareholders will be winners in the merger transaction, achieving a very favorable stock-to-stock exchange rate + cash consideration. Conservative estimated total value per share realized from CGNT shareholders of 40% relative to current share price with 16% low end premium if deal terms inked in the past few months are realized mark to market.\n\n**CGNT Overview** (Lazy screenshots from Investor Presentation below): CGNT was recently spun off from Verint as a standalone entity, completed Feb. 1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4l30synr5u61.png?width=323&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc6b1b1653719c30ab22b28844486a205d97f820\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/avt7i84pr5u61.png?width=404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cad57c67be666c5420514d71375bbe8ec413441\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pnaac5wpr5u61.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9c5d4feb7f92a2e810c26c40bf7774a8b5bf8b1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8a249lwqr5u61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b54cf77281d97da5d9e507c62a3f0d3ecc09af11\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4tljzeprr5u61.png?width=326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98857ec355ef88a99a50aae8889915f6915483ca\n\n**Why CGNT as Acquisition Target**\n\n\u00b7 NNDM has been highly vocal that they are planning an Acquisition for some time\n\n\u00b7 From the 20-F SEC filings from both companies they state that there are tax and royalties penalties from merging/acquiring a non-Israeli company along with manufacturing products outside of Israel, which CGNT does have manufacturing plant in Israel. Acquisition target would likely need to be an Israeli Company\n\n\u00b7 Both companies receive funding from the IIA which is a material part of project funding, with ramifications from merging/acquiring non-Israeli company.\n\n\u00b7 CGNT is the cyber threat and security spin off of Verint with the spin off occurring Feb 1, 2021. They are profitable with their growth strategy being expanding enterprise customer base, growing deeper with existing customers, adding verticals. This fits well with NNDM as they can aid expansion of verticals for both enterprise and government via production of and protection of enterprise/5G/security operations devices (CGNT provides IP data theft identification and prevention which is critical for NNDM to serve large enterprise customers)\n\n\u00b7 From the AME Academy NNDM demos different device capabilities of their systems including 5g, implantable/tattooable sensors which would be synergistic for CGNT security operations\n\n\u00b7 CGNT business model of software as a service meshes perfectly with NNDM\u2019s plan to transition business model to software side from purely a manufacturer\n\n\u00b7 CGNT is profitable, the spin-off only makes sense if it was done for the purpose of a sale, 4 of 7 CGNT board members are current Verint board members/executives\n\n\u00b7 Hanan Gino appointed Chief Product Officer and Head of Strategic M&amp;A: He was most recently in charge of the division of Verint that becam\n\n**Why a Reverse Triangular Merger**\n\n\u00b7 The licensing agreement between Verint and CGNT only allow critical IP to be used if they are using for existing business activities and are not acquired by a 3rd party. The agreement does allow to be used by affiliates via sublicensing.\n\n\u00b7 A reverse triangular merger allows the acquisition to take place while keeping critical licensing contracts intact for CGNT\n\n\u00b7 The target (CGNT) must own substantially all of its assets and perform substantially the same business activities in order to qualify.\n\n\u00b7 The benefit of this type of transaction allows the acquisition to take place tax free if certain conditions are met, 80% of consideration is stock of acquirer and not more than 20% cash (might act differently due to different Israeli regulations)\n\n\u00b7 This kind of transaction can be performed quickly with minimal regulatory and shareholder actionse CGNT\n\n\u00b7 CGNT wording within their 20-F filling allows them to pass a merger/acquisition with 25% shareholder approval, classified as Emerging Growth Company and aren\u2019t required to disclose proxy statements. They will easily be able to pass the merger without going through public shareholder announcement.\n\n**What will NNDM need to Pay**\n\n\u00b7 Current CGNT market cap of $1.6ish billion\n\n\u00b7 Recent filing from CGNT lists Book Value of the company as $301.5M\n\n\u00b7 Using some conservative multiples of 7x-10x book value using competitors like FireEye, Palantir and IBM we get a Price of $2.7B to acquire CGNT (8.7x Book Value, $40 per share)\n\n\u00b7 Value at Current NNDM Share Price: At 80% of the consideration being stock to be tax free the exchange rate of CGNT to NNDM shares would need to be around 4 shares of NNDM for every 1 share of CGNT in addition to $8 per share in cash. This isn\u2019t possible currently given that would exceed NNDM current shares outstanding so the cash consideration would need to be more or the agreed value of NNDM shares be higher (trading between 12-16 when CGNT was spun-off)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i29q5aetr5u61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0d0d4f63f00ec617da03ca8ca9602afac22473a\n\nHighlighted prices are around CGNT spin off\n\n\u00b7 If the agreed value is at the recent direct offering at 12.8 per share of NNDM then the consideration paid would be 2.5 shares of NNDM for every share of CGNT and an $8 per share cash consideration. (This exact case likely would not occur unless SP rises or considerably more cash is paid above the tax consequence of breaching 20% cash \u2013 Virent still controls board and needs to ensure significant value is provided to former shareholders and justify spin-off)\n\n\u00b7 NNDM has the ability and spare cash to repurchase shares in order to drive price up in order to get NNDM market price up the pre-determined exchange rate value\n\n\u00b7 SEC Filing on Feb 15. 2021 amends the company\u2019s articles to allow the board to call upon shares from shareholders giving further latitude for forcing acquisition if need be\n\n**Other Notes and Consideration**\n\nOptions Activity\n\n\u00b7 Both CGNT and NNDM have extremely high options activity for May expirations\n\n\u00b7 NNDM Put/Call Open interest ratio of 0.53 indicates strong bearish sentiment\n\n\u00b7 CGNT Put/Call Open interest ratio of 0.06 and Put/Call volume of 0.01 indicates extremes in bearish sentiment but the extremeness of the value implies the opposite, being a major turning point\n\nCGNT is required to pay Verint a one time cash dividend of $35m, being an impact per share of $0.51, theoretically this should already be priced in but the merger announcement would likely be after this payment is complete.\n\nCGNT has affiliations with a blank cheque company according to the SEC website indicating that the merger has already been planned as a blank cheque company is required for a Reverse Triangular Merger.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n\n\u00b7 NNDM stock is driven further down or doesn\u2019t recover and the deal goes through anyway at unfavorable terms\n\n\u00b7 The combination of the two entities are viewed negatively and value is lost\n\n\u00b7 I completely misinterpreted the SEC fillings and Israeli tax laws\n\n\u00b7 The deal does not go through and the standalone CGNT entity is worth far less than expected\n\n\u00b7 CGNT was left with unknown liabilities passed off from Verint\n\n\u00b7 CGNT financials are misstated and fraudulent\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile I think that NNDM will acquire CGNT if I am wrong about that I still believe that CGNT is an acquisition target for another company based on my findings.\n\nIf a merger doesn\u2019t happen CGNT is still a strong play in their sector and has strong growth and profitability in the same industry as Palantir which saw ridiculous amounts of interest. I think the risks associated with this play are managed well, my view of probability of high returns in a short amount of time make for excellent risk adjusted return potential.\n\nThis literally cannot go tits up\n\nThis is not financial advise, do your own DD nerds",

        "selftext": "I have not seen a single post on DMYI merging with IONQ the first pure quantum company on the market, which makes this a great opportunity\n\nSome of you may have heard about quantum computing before, for those of you who have not, here's the short story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuantum computing is a truly insane technology. They can be used to do computations like a regular computer can but instead of using bits that are 0 and 1 they use qubits that can be 0 and 1 at the SAME time.\n\n# What effects does this have:\n\nLet's say you have a problem  8 possible solutions, this can be represented with 3 bits (2\\^3  = 8 -&gt; 8 different combinations)\n\n001\n\n010\n\n100\n\n...\n\nThose are all possible solutions to the problem, with a regular computer you would have to check each solution and perform the necessary calculations, so it would take 8 calculations.\n\nWith a quantum computer this problem can be represented with 3 QUBITS, and since qubits can be both 0 and 1 at  the same time you only need 1 calculation !!!! Every possible combination can be made with just one calculation!!!!!!\n\nNow what if a problem is represented with 32 bits? 2\\^32 =\\~ 4 billion, It would take 4 billion calculations to find a solution to this problem, now with a quantum computer you would need a computer with 32 qubits and it needs to make just ONE calculation! It can blow any regular computer out of the water.\n\nQubits give exponential growth where bits give linear growth in calculations.\n\nAll machine learning, path finding, ... will move to quantum computers because it is vastly better.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 19th, 2021.\n\n# **Concerns over inflationary pressure on earnings will test stocks in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/investors-look-for-hints-of-inflation-in-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Earnings will be the major focus for investors in the week ahead, as they home in on whether rising costs are squeezing margins and signaling a build in inflationary pressures.\n*****\n&gt; From Coca-Cola and IBM to Johnson &amp; Johnson and Netflix, investors will hear from a broad swath of corporate America.\n*****\n&gt; So far, with one week in, companies are beating earnings estimates by a wide margin of more than 84%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; This three-month period is the first to be compared to year earlier profits that were affected by the pandemic. Profit growth for the S&amp;P 500 is a stunning 30.2% for the quarter so far, based on actual reports and estimates.\n*****\n&gt; That makes it the best three-month period since the third quarter of 2010, according to FactSet.\n*****\n&gt; # Signs of margin pressures?\n&gt; Major banks, like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America reported better than expected profits in the past week.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at a record high of 4,185, a gain of 1.4%. The Dow, higher for a fourth week, gained 1.2 to end the week at a record 34,200. Nasdaq gained 1.1% for the week, finishing at 14,052.\n*****\n&gt; Utilities was the best performing major S&amp;P sector, gaining 3.7%, followed by materials, up 3.2% and health care, up 2.9%. Technology was up 1%. Financials were up 0.7%, while industrials were up 0.6%.\n*****\n&gt; Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC, said she is watching the coming week\u2019s earnings for signs of margin pressures from higher commodity prices, supply chain issues and other cost factors.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThose big forces that are threatening margins right now don\u2019t really apply to financials. They apply more to industrial companies, the material companies and consumer companies,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think [sectors] like the industrials will give you color on margins,\u201d Calvasina added. \u201cMargins really are the big question mark going forward. I\u2019m definitely watching and listening to see what companies are going to say about taxes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; President Joe Biden has proposed raising corporate taxes to 28% from 21% to help pay for his infrastructure plan.\n*****\n&gt; While the fate of the tax hike is still not clear, the increase in other costs is apparent. Fuel costs have risen sharply with a 30% rise in oil prices since the beginning of the year. Lumber prices in the futures market are at an all-time high and copper futures are up about 17% year-to-date.\n*****\n&gt; Calvasina said companies face a headwind and a tailwind.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cCompanies are saying we found new ways to cut costs. When revenues come back, margins are going to explode to the upside,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the Covid-related costs will come down. Those are some of the positives.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But not every company will see those benefits. \u201cWe could start to see wage pressures come back. Rising commodity costs \u2014 increases in PPI and increases in CPI \u2014 those are negatives for margins,\u201d Calvasina said, referring to the producer price and consumer price indexes.\n*****\n&gt; # Searching for hints of inflation\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said he is also watching the margin comments carefully for impact on individual stocks, but also for what they broadly say about inflation seeping into the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat\u2019s going to be the most interesting thing about earnings are profit margins. Some companies are going to get squeezed because they\u2019re going to see price increases and others aren\u2019t because they can pass it on,\u201d said Boockvar.\n*****\n&gt; He said he will pay close attention to whether the semiconductor shortage is showing up in tech companies\u2019 earnings. Automakers have already taken a hit and have scaled back production due to the lack of chips.\n*****\n&gt; The CPI for March showed a pick-up in headline inflation to 2.6% year-over-year. A 9.1% jump in gasoline prices contributed to the gain.\n*****\n&gt; Some of the gains in inflation this spring are expected to be temporary because of the comparison to very low levels last year when the economy was shutdown.\n*****\n&gt; Other than earnings, the week should be fairly quiet. Federal Reserve speakers have taken a hiatus and are in a blackout period ahead of the late April meeting.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s really going to be attention shifting to earnings and the inflation story,\u201d said Boockvar.\n*****\n&gt; # Economic rebound\n&gt; In the past week, economic reports underscored how strong the economic momentum could be in the second quarter. Retail sales for March were up nearly 10%, and jobless claims were the lowest of the recovery.\n*****\n&gt; There is little data in the week ahead, aside from PMI manufacturing and services data Friday. But the markets will keep a close eye on unemployment figures after Thursday\u2019s report of 576,000 new claims \u2014 the lowest level since the early days of the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe large claims decline suggests that job separation rates may finally be normalizing, a good sign for April payrolls,\u201d note Barclays economists. A surprise 916,000 jobs were added in March, and economists have said they now expect a string of reports showing payrolls are up by 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, says it may be too early to read too much into the claims data, and the coming week\u2019s report will be important.\n*****\n&gt; He said the drop in claims was driven by sharp drops in a number of states, including more than half in California and even larger percentage declines in Kentucky and Virginia.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cUnfortunately, I have no confidence that these moves won\u2019t be at least partially reversed next week,\u201d he wrote. \u201cContinuing claims in the special pandemic programs continue to seesaw up and down every week, with the latest reading, for the period ended March 27, being a down week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Watching bonds\n&gt; Stock investors will also be watching the bond market, where yields declined in the past week and then reversed. The 10-year Treasury was at 1.59% Friday, after tumbling sharply on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year is the most widely watched bond security, as it impacts mortgage rates and other loans.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe 10-year will now trade in the 1.50% to 1.75% trading range,\u201d said Boockvar.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019ll break below that if inflation is transitory and it will break above if it\u2019s proven to be otherwise,\u201d he added. \u201cI think we priced in the last inflation stats and then we\u2019ll take into account what the real world is saying, from companies.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/c7J5krZ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lhy7AaR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/UW7ZbbU.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/uom4C2h.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/l0cX2LH.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jpa2DZe.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PgmZlAV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3Rugxjf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gmHwRAL.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/po0gflq.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j0oHK6M.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jJcd0lq.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qX9lwYh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Jvf27dw.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Four Reasons The Future Looks Bright For The Bulls\n\n&gt; \u201cI look to the future because that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life.\u201d George Burns\n\n&gt; The bull market continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 10% in 2021. With stocks up more than 80% from the March 2020 lows, the reality is a well-deserved break or consolidation could happen at any time. Looking to the future, as George Burns said above, we would be a buyer of any material weakness, as we believe this bull market is alive and well as we\u2019ll discuss more in this blog.\n\n&gt; Here are four bullish stats we\u2019ve found recently that indeed suggest this bull market could still have plenty of life left.\n\n&gt; First, the S&amp;P 500 Index was up just under 6% in the first quarter, an area we\u2019d call the sweet spot. Looking back since 1950, when the S&amp;P 500 was up between 5-10% in the first quarter, the rest of the year (so the final three quarters) gained another 12.4% on average and was higher 86.7% of the time. Compare this to when the S&amp;P 500 was up &gt;10% in the first quarter and the returns drop to 6.5% the rest of the year. Lastly, if the first quarter was negative, then the rest of the year was up only 3%. Sweet spot indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Second, the December Low Indicator has bulls smiling. This was created by Lucien Hooper, a Forbes columnist in the 1970s, and it simply says that if the S&amp;P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter then future weakness could be in the cards. But if this critical level holds, then higher prices could be around the corner.\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, stocks held above the December lows in 2021 and this could mean continued higher prices, as the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 18% on average previous years when this level held and incredibly was higher 33 out of 35 years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Third, the S&amp;P 500 was up nearly 54% in the 12 months ending March 2021, one of the largest yearly gains ever. Looking at previous times that had significant 12-month returns shows the potential for weak returns 1, 3, and 6 months later. This makes sense, as stocks could need some time to catch their breath. The good news? One year later the S&amp;P 500 was higher more than 90% of the time, with only the year after the 1987 crash in the red. \u201cIt might seem counterintuitive to most investors, but big rallies like we\u2019ve seen tend to mark the start of bull markets, not the end, so we wouldn\u2019t bet on this bull market ending anytime soon,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, overall market breadth is extremely strong. Again, this could suggest near-term there could be an exhaustion point, but this isn\u2019t what you see at the end of bull markets, in fact, it tends to usually happen at the start of new bull markets. Currently, more than 95% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 200-day moving average, a level only seen two other times, in December 2003 and September 2009. Looking back at 2004 and 2010, 2004 saw consolidation a good part of the year, while 2010 had a well-deserved 16% correction after the huge gains off the March 2009 lows. But the key point is after extreme market breadth like we are seeing now, overall higher prices and the bull market lasted for many more years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking to the future, as George Burns said, we believe it could be a bright one for equity investors, particularly when we consider the return potential for stocks compared to cash and high-quality bonds.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Boom Goes the Retail Sales\n\n&gt; After a lousy report for the month of February when freak weather across the south temporarily shut down several areas of the south, Retail Sales bounced back with a vengeance in March as vaccine rollouts accelerated and stimulus checks were spent.\n\n&gt; The moves higher in Retail Sales over the last few months have been incredible. As shown below, while it took 40 months to make a new high following their pre-Financial Crisis peak, COVID only caused a five-month drought without a new high. From the low in April 2020, Retail Sales have bounced 50%!\n\n&gt; Even more impressive, though, is not only are total Retail Sales above their pre-COVID peak, but they are more than 17% above that peak just 14 months ago. The second chart shows the 14-month rate of change in Retail Sales since 1992. While the post-COVID decline was the steepest on record, the 14-month gain is the highest on record. Ironically, had it not been for COVID and the stimulus it resulted in, there is no way Retail Sales levels would be where they are now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Retail-Sales-14-months.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth a Market Cap Story\n\n&gt; Last week, we repeatedly noted how there has been rotation back into growth-oriented sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. For example, mega-cap names like Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) have been some of the top performers in the second quarter whereas they were some of the worst performers in Q1. As a result of the strong performance of these names which all have heavy weights in the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), the ETF has undergone some notable price action over the past couple of weeks. At the start of April, IVW finally broke back above its 50-DMA after repeatedly failing to do so throughout March. Last week, that rally continued as the ETF also broke out above its February highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IVW.png)**\n\n&gt; That sort of strong technical picture is not true for all growth stocks though. Instead, it is more of a market cap story. The Russell 2,000 Growth ETF (IWO) has been stuck in a downtrend over the past few months with another failed attempt to change that last week. Whereas IVW is extremely overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA) as of Friday's close, IWO is trading below its 50-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO.png)**\n\n&gt; In the chart below we show small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth through the ratio of IWO to IVW. Throughout the fall and winter, small-cap growth had been outpacing its large-cap peers as the ratio shot higher. But in mid-February, the ratio peaked and in the past month, it has more sharply pulled back as a rotation into large-cap growth has taken place. In fact, the ratio has fallen over 10% in the past month! As shown in the second chart below, there have not been many times since the two ETFs began trading in 2000 in which the ratio has fallen as sharply in such a span of time. The most recent instance was one year ago during and in the immediate aftermath of the bear market. Before that, it was almost a decade since the next most recent occurrence.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW.png)**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-1M-Chg.png)**\n\n&gt; With just five prior occurrences, there is not a particularly large sample size for these types of moves, but returns have tended to be strong following past times that the ratio of IWO to IVW has fallen by at least 10 percentage points in a single month. For both ETFs, returns have been stronger than their relative norms over the following weeks and months. Small-cap growth has perhaps performed slightly better on average although that is due to smaller declines following the late 2000 instance. In other words, big outperformance of large-cap growth in the past has been generally good for growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-Perf.png)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sell in May??? Post-Election-Year \u201cWorst Months\u201d Mixed\n\n&gt; Our Seasonal Switching Strategy, which is based upon the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d in conjunction with our MACD Technical Buy and Sell Signal signals, has a solid long-term track record of outperformance with potentially less risk compared to a buy and hold approach. Since 1950, DJIA\u2019s average annual gain has been 8.5%. Over the same time period, DJIA has lost an average 0.7% during the \u201cWorst Six Months,\u201d May through October, and gained an average 8.8% during the \u201cBest Six Months,\u201d November through April.\n\n&gt; In post-election years, the historically worst performing year of the four-year cycle (page 130, STA 2021), the \u201cWorst Months\u201d have not been all that bad with more positive periods than negative, but average gains over the six or four month (NASDAQ\u2019s Worst Months are July-October) period are still paltry. It is also worth noting that the one election year with a double-digit \u201cWorst Months\u201d S&amp;P 500 gain, 1980, was followed by a tough \u201cWorst Months\u201d in 1981 (shaded in light grey in table).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/AIN_0521_20210415_Worst_Months_by_Election_Cycle_table.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/po0gflq.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/S1pKqwL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IAo7GlZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/SnFSpnl.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.19.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/j8avW5c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.19.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LL4z8Pi.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  4.20.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7FM5dh1.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.20.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qMSF98e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.21.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jzM0cgh.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.21.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FztoCal.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.22.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3jn4RTu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bivztrJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.23.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nh8sgYV.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.23.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Netflix, Inc. $546.54\n**Netflix, Inc.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, April 20, 2021**\n\nStocks fell Tuesday, with all three major indexes dipping for the second straight session. Cyclical, travel and leisure stocks pulled back sharply while mega-cap tech stocks slid even as the 10-year Treasury yield edged lower.  \n\nDespite recent dips, the indexes remain near all-time highs, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) up roughly 10% year-to-date, so it\u2019s not necessarily surprising the market beginning to pull back.  Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial wrote in a note today, \"Many of our favorite sentiment gauges are becoming extremely bullish, which could be a near-term contrarian warning. The American Association of Individual Investors Sentiment Survey recently showed bulls outnumber bears by the most since January 2018.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, better-than-expected economic data in consumer spending and unemployment and strong performances by mega-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) have driven the market higher. On the other hand, growth stocks and more speculative plays have pulled back sharply, extending a terrible run of performance in 2021. After hitting all-time highs near the middle of February, many growth stocks are down 30-50% from those levels. While it\u2019s hard to pinpoint the exact factors why, we think (1) elevated Treasury yields compared to 12 months ago, (2) inflationary fears, (3) profit-taking after an incredible run in 2020, and (4) investor rotation to safer assets are all impacting growth stocks to the downside. \n\nLooking ahead, market participants will continue to monitor earnings season to gauge if corporate profits are growing in tandem with the recovering economy. Roughly 9% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 81% beating expectation. At the time of writing, Netflix (NFLX) just reported a sharp miss in new paying subscribers added (+3.98 million vs. +6.29 million expected), causing the stock to plummet 10% in after-hours. This is likely to have negative implications for market performance tomorrow.\n\nWhite House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said he believes the U.S. will likely resume use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine as soon as Friday with a warning or restriction attached. The doctor said, \u201cMy estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form. I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just going to go back and say, \u2018Okay, everything\u2019s fine. Go right back.\u2019 I think it\u2019ll likely say, \u2018Okay, we\u2019re going to use it, but be careful under these certain circumstances.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Chat startup Discord Inc. has halted talks to sell itself to potential suitors including Microsoft (MSFT), according to people familiar with the matter, as it resumes interest in a potential initial public offering down the line.\n* Senior executives with Alphabet's Google and Apple will testify on Wednesday about antitrust concerns related to their app stores along with executives of three companies which rely on those online stores, the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel said on Monday.\n* The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning Saturday advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive's treadmill if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March during a treadmill accident. This could affect the company's product-safety profile, a material category for the household and personal-goods sector, according to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. The stock pulled back sharply\n* The U.K. government said it would probe Nvidia Corp.'s $40 billion deal to buy British chip-designer Arm from SoftBank Group Corp., over possible national security issues, adding new regulatory scrutiny to the proposed deal.\n* **\\*\\*Please note current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday movement\\*\\***\n* Allegiant Travel (ALGT) from $250 to $285 at Buy. Stock currently around $231\n* Coupa Software (COUP target raised by Piper Sandler from $300 to $315 at Overweight. Stock currently around \n* IBM with a host of target raises. Consensus price target around $150 at Buy. Stock currently around $138\n* UnitedHealth Group target raised by Truist Securities from $420 to $450 at Buy. Stock currently around $397\n* Square (SQ) target raised by Barclays from $330 to $340 at Overweight. Stock currently around $243\n* Raytheon Technologies (RTX) target raised by Credit Suisse from $81 to $90 at Outperform. Stock currently around $77\n* Paypal (PYPL) target raised by Rosenblatt Securities from $320 to $350 at Buy. \n* Morgan Stanley (MS) target raised by Piper Sandler from $82 to $87 at Neutral. Stock currently around $77\n* Lam Research (LRCX) target raised by Cowen from $585 to $700 at Outperform. Stock currently around $612\n\nThe four most dangerous words in investing are: this time is different.\u201d - John Templeton",

        "selftext": "Hello Traders and Investors! What a week right?! So many stories and earnings! Here is my weekly recap which I share every Friday to help to wrap your head around these markets! Feel free to DM me any of your questions and happy trades! \n\nThe S&amp;P 500 opened at $4138.78 today, lower than its previous Friday\u2019s close of $4185.67 and its 52 week high of 4,191.31. Recovery from COVID has seen significant gains in the market as prices pull back from last week\u2019s all-time-highs. \n\nReports released Thursday that President Biden could propose a capital gains tax increase to 39.6% on individuals earning $1 million dollars or more, nearly double the current nominal rate of 20%. Additionally, a 3.8% investment tax currently exists to fund Obamacare. This potentially pushes the tax rate 43.4% which conflicts with long standing tax practices that have historically seen investment income lower than labor taxes. Such an increase seeks to address long standing notions of wealthy individuals paying lower tax rates than middle and low-income workers, a sentiment that President Biden campaigned on and championed. \n\nMembers of the GOP suggest the increase will halt economic growth, leading those affected to hoard assets in order to avoid the tax. It is unclear if these claims will hold water, as historically there has been a low correlation between increases to the capital gains tax and the market. In 2013 the S&amp;P experienced stellar growth of 30% despite an increase to capital gains tax of over 86%. \n\nJobless claims dropped more than 7% from last week according to the Labor Department. This coincides with robust gains in the market as a whole as the country recovers from last year\u2019s COVID pandemic. Current job loss from pre-COVID era still hovers around 8 million. Increase in national vaccine rollouts, averaging 3 million per day, should expedite this recovery. Approximately 40% of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine.  \nSeveral major travel companies reported earnings this week. This includes American Airlines, United Airlines, Royal Caribbean. The International Air Transport Association has commented on the situation, citing potential losses in the sector of $48 Billion for the 2021 fiscal year. These numbers are over a 25% increase from previously released estimates of $38 Billion. Although significant, losses are down significantly from last year, where the industry suffered a $126.4 Billion loss in the wake of COVID shutdowns. \n\nAmerican Airlines posted dismal earnings of -$5.54 per share Thursday. A spokesperson for American Airlines said the company is spending around $30 Million per day in operations costs, despite reducing annual operating costs by $1.3 Billion. The company continues to consolidate and revealed it expects to reduce its workforce by 1,600 in the coming months. In addition, American Airlines reportedly reached a deal with Boeing to delay delivery of twenty-three 737 jets for up to 3 years. American Airlines posted revenue of 4.01 Billion, just under half of it\u2019s posted revenue only a year ago. Airports are functioning at around 60% of their capacity. \n\n\"We continued to excel in growing customer relationships in our market focus areas of mobility, fiber and HBO Max,\" said AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey in reference to a favorable Q1 Earnings report for the communications giant. Q1 Earnings reports reveal an excellent quarter for the company, who continues to grow in cell-service subscribers. AT&amp;T also posted favorable results for its HBO Max service, which it received in its 2018, $85 Billion acquisition of Time Warner. \n\nA Tesla vehicle was involved in a fatal crash that killed two people over the weekend. The car was suspected to have been functioning on Autopilot by investigators as it was found with no occupant in the driver\u2019s seat. Tesla has revealed that they have no data that suggests the vehicle was on Autopilot during the crash at this time Tesla did not rule out the possibility that further investigation may reveal the vehicle was in-fact on autopilot, but declined to make any additional comments at this time. \n\nDiscord, a popular chat application developed for gamers, has ended months-long acquisition talks with tech giant Microsoft. Market Valuation of Discord has skyrocketed to $10 Billion from last year\u2019s June valuation of $3.5 Billion. This comes at a time where many social media platforms are looking to develop and integrate chat functions in a way to capture user engagement and capitalize on the increase in remote work. Discord now intends to stay independent and pursue an IPO. \n\nThe decision by Discord comes as Salesforce looks to acquire Slack in Q2 \u201821 for $27 Billion. Slack operates a chatroom not unlike Discord, but targeted at businesses as opposed to consumers. The acquisition is currently pending a U.S. Justice Department probe that will determine whether or not it will continue. Microsoft's attempted acquisition of Discord on the heels of Slack\u2019s pending acquisition is likely a response to increased competition for Microsoft from Salesforce in the B2B and B2C technology markets. \n\nNetflix reached 208 million subscribers in Q1, just missing its projection of 210 million. The tech giant blames this miss on societal normalization as COVID regulations ease and more people return to work. Quarantine mandates saw a massive increase of 16 million new subscribers in the early months, and just over 10 million between April and June of 2020. In contrast, January through April of 2021 saw only 4 million new subscribers.  Regardless, the streaming giant reported an earnings per share of $3.75, versus $1.57 the year prior, which beat Wall Street predictions. Netflix\u2019s 2020 subscriber boom showed massive financial gains in revenue, operating income, and operating margin. Q2 forecasts project a slight correction to this growth due to job growth and general societal rebound.\n\n**Some of the companies who reported earnings this week:**\n\n**Monday, April 19th:**\n\nCoca-Cola Co.: $0.55\n\nIBM Corp.: $1.77\n\nUnited Airlines: -$7.50\n\n**Tuesday, April 20th:**\n\nJohnson and Johnson: $2.32\n\nProcter and Gamble: $1.63\n\nNetflix: $3.75\n\nPhillip Morris: $1.57\n\nLockheed Martin: $6.56\n\n**Wednesday, April 21st:**\n\nProgressive: $1.72\n\nVerizon: $1.27\n\nChipotle: $5.36\n\nEquifax: $1.97\n\nNasdaq: $1.73\n\nDiscover: $5.04\n\nHalliburton: $0.19\n\nBaker Hughes: $0.12\n\n**Thursday, April 22nd:**\n\nIntel $1.39\n\nSnap $0.00\n\nBiogen $5.34\n\nSouthwest Airlines -$1.72\n\nVeriSign $1.33\n\nQuest Diagnostics $3.76\n\nBoston Beer Company $5.26\n\nAmerican Airlines -$4.32",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 19th, 2021.\n\n# **Concerns over inflationary pressure on earnings will test stocks in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/investors-look-for-hints-of-inflation-in-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Earnings will be the major focus for investors in the week ahead, as they home in on whether rising costs are squeezing margins and signaling a build in inflationary pressures.\n*****\n&gt; From Coca-Cola and IBM to Johnson &amp; Johnson and Netflix, investors will hear from a broad swath of corporate America.\n*****\n&gt; So far, with one week in, companies are beating earnings estimates by a wide margin of more than 84%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; This three-month period is the first to be compared to year earlier profits that were affected by the pandemic. Profit growth for the S&amp;P 500 is a stunning 30.2% for the quarter so far, based on actual reports and estimates.\n*****\n&gt; That makes it the best three-month period since the third quarter of 2010, according to FactSet.\n*****\n&gt; # Signs of margin pressures?\n&gt; Major banks, like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America reported better than expected profits in the past week.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at a record high of 4,185, a gain of 1.4%. The Dow, higher for a fourth week, gained 1.2 to end the week at a record 34,200. Nasdaq gained 1.1% for the week, finishing at 14,052.\n*****\n&gt; Utilities was the best performing major S&amp;P sector, gaining 3.7%, followed by materials, up 3.2% and health care, up 2.9%. Technology was up 1%. Financials were up 0.7%, while industrials were up 0.6%.\n*****\n&gt; Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC, said she is watching the coming week\u2019s earnings for signs of margin pressures from higher commodity prices, supply chain issues and other cost factors.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThose big forces that are threatening margins right now don\u2019t really apply to financials. They apply more to industrial companies, the material companies and consumer companies,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think [sectors] like the industrials will give you color on margins,\u201d Calvasina added. \u201cMargins really are the big question mark going forward. I\u2019m definitely watching and listening to see what companies are going to say about taxes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; President Joe Biden has proposed raising corporate taxes to 28% from 21% to help pay for his infrastructure plan.\n*****\n&gt; While the fate of the tax hike is still not clear, the increase in other costs is apparent. Fuel costs have risen sharply with a 30% rise in oil prices since the beginning of the year. Lumber prices in the futures market are at an all-time high and copper futures are up about 17% year-to-date.\n*****\n&gt; Calvasina said companies face a headwind and a tailwind.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cCompanies are saying we found new ways to cut costs. When revenues come back, margins are going to explode to the upside,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the Covid-related costs will come down. Those are some of the positives.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But not every company will see those benefits. \u201cWe could start to see wage pressures come back. Rising commodity costs \u2014 increases in PPI and increases in CPI \u2014 those are negatives for margins,\u201d Calvasina said, referring to the producer price and consumer price indexes.\n*****\n&gt; # Searching for hints of inflation\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said he is also watching the margin comments carefully for impact on individual stocks, but also for what they broadly say about inflation seeping into the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat\u2019s going to be the most interesting thing about earnings are profit margins. Some companies are going to get squeezed because they\u2019re going to see price increases and others aren\u2019t because they can pass it on,\u201d said Boockvar.\n*****\n&gt; He said he will pay close attention to whether the semiconductor shortage is showing up in tech companies\u2019 earnings. Automakers have already taken a hit and have scaled back production due to the lack of chips.\n*****\n&gt; The CPI for March showed a pick-up in headline inflation to 2.6% year-over-year. A 9.1% jump in gasoline prices contributed to the gain.\n*****\n&gt; Some of the gains in inflation this spring are expected to be temporary because of the comparison to very low levels last year when the economy was shutdown.\n*****\n&gt; Other than earnings, the week should be fairly quiet. Federal Reserve speakers have taken a hiatus and are in a blackout period ahead of the late April meeting.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s really going to be attention shifting to earnings and the inflation story,\u201d said Boockvar.\n*****\n&gt; # Economic rebound\n&gt; In the past week, economic reports underscored how strong the economic momentum could be in the second quarter. Retail sales for March were up nearly 10%, and jobless claims were the lowest of the recovery.\n*****\n&gt; There is little data in the week ahead, aside from PMI manufacturing and services data Friday. But the markets will keep a close eye on unemployment figures after Thursday\u2019s report of 576,000 new claims \u2014 the lowest level since the early days of the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe large claims decline suggests that job separation rates may finally be normalizing, a good sign for April payrolls,\u201d note Barclays economists. A surprise 916,000 jobs were added in March, and economists have said they now expect a string of reports showing payrolls are up by 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, says it may be too early to read too much into the claims data, and the coming week\u2019s report will be important.\n*****\n&gt; He said the drop in claims was driven by sharp drops in a number of states, including more than half in California and even larger percentage declines in Kentucky and Virginia.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cUnfortunately, I have no confidence that these moves won\u2019t be at least partially reversed next week,\u201d he wrote. \u201cContinuing claims in the special pandemic programs continue to seesaw up and down every week, with the latest reading, for the period ended March 27, being a down week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Watching bonds\n&gt; Stock investors will also be watching the bond market, where yields declined in the past week and then reversed. The 10-year Treasury was at 1.59% Friday, after tumbling sharply on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year is the most widely watched bond security, as it impacts mortgage rates and other loans.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe 10-year will now trade in the 1.50% to 1.75% trading range,\u201d said Boockvar.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019ll break below that if inflation is transitory and it will break above if it\u2019s proven to be otherwise,\u201d he added. \u201cI think we priced in the last inflation stats and then we\u2019ll take into account what the real world is saying, from companies.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/c7J5krZ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lhy7AaR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/UW7ZbbU.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/uom4C2h.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/l0cX2LH.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jpa2DZe.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PgmZlAV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3Rugxjf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gmHwRAL.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/po0gflq.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j0oHK6M.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jJcd0lq.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qX9lwYh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Jvf27dw.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Four Reasons The Future Looks Bright For The Bulls\n\n&gt; \u201cI look to the future because that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life.\u201d George Burns\n\n&gt; The bull market continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 10% in 2021. With stocks up more than 80% from the March 2020 lows, the reality is a well-deserved break or consolidation could happen at any time. Looking to the future, as George Burns said above, we would be a buyer of any material weakness, as we believe this bull market is alive and well as we\u2019ll discuss more in this blog.\n\n&gt; Here are four bullish stats we\u2019ve found recently that indeed suggest this bull market could still have plenty of life left.\n\n&gt; First, the S&amp;P 500 Index was up just under 6% in the first quarter, an area we\u2019d call the sweet spot. Looking back since 1950, when the S&amp;P 500 was up between 5-10% in the first quarter, the rest of the year (so the final three quarters) gained another 12.4% on average and was higher 86.7% of the time. Compare this to when the S&amp;P 500 was up &gt;10% in the first quarter and the returns drop to 6.5% the rest of the year. Lastly, if the first quarter was negative, then the rest of the year was up only 3%. Sweet spot indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Second, the December Low Indicator has bulls smiling. This was created by Lucien Hooper, a Forbes columnist in the 1970s, and it simply says that if the S&amp;P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter then future weakness could be in the cards. But if this critical level holds, then higher prices could be around the corner.\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, stocks held above the December lows in 2021 and this could mean continued higher prices, as the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 18% on average previous years when this level held and incredibly was higher 33 out of 35 years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Third, the S&amp;P 500 was up nearly 54% in the 12 months ending March 2021, one of the largest yearly gains ever. Looking at previous times that had significant 12-month returns shows the potential for weak returns 1, 3, and 6 months later. This makes sense, as stocks could need some time to catch their breath. The good news? One year later the S&amp;P 500 was higher more than 90% of the time, with only the year after the 1987 crash in the red. \u201cIt might seem counterintuitive to most investors, but big rallies like we\u2019ve seen tend to mark the start of bull markets, not the end, so we wouldn\u2019t bet on this bull market ending anytime soon,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, overall market breadth is extremely strong. Again, this could suggest near-term there could be an exhaustion point, but this isn\u2019t what you see at the end of bull markets, in fact, it tends to usually happen at the start of new bull markets. Currently, more than 95% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 200-day moving average, a level only seen two other times, in December 2003 and September 2009. Looking back at 2004 and 2010, 2004 saw consolidation a good part of the year, while 2010 had a well-deserved 16% correction after the huge gains off the March 2009 lows. But the key point is after extreme market breadth like we are seeing now, overall higher prices and the bull market lasted for many more years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking to the future, as George Burns said, we believe it could be a bright one for equity investors, particularly when we consider the return potential for stocks compared to cash and high-quality bonds.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Boom Goes the Retail Sales\n\n&gt; After a lousy report for the month of February when freak weather across the south temporarily shut down several areas of the south, Retail Sales bounced back with a vengeance in March as vaccine rollouts accelerated and stimulus checks were spent.\n\n&gt; The moves higher in Retail Sales over the last few months have been incredible. As shown below, while it took 40 months to make a new high following their pre-Financial Crisis peak, COVID only caused a five-month drought without a new high. From the low in April 2020, Retail Sales have bounced 50%!\n\n&gt; Even more impressive, though, is not only are total Retail Sales above their pre-COVID peak, but they are more than 17% above that peak just 14 months ago. The second chart shows the 14-month rate of change in Retail Sales since 1992. While the post-COVID decline was the steepest on record, the 14-month gain is the highest on record. Ironically, had it not been for COVID and the stimulus it resulted in, there is no way Retail Sales levels would be where they are now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Retail-Sales-14-months.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth a Market Cap Story\n\n&gt; Last week, we repeatedly noted how there has been rotation back into growth-oriented sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. For example, mega-cap names like Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) have been some of the top performers in the second quarter whereas they were some of the worst performers in Q1. As a result of the strong performance of these names which all have heavy weights in the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), the ETF has undergone some notable price action over the past couple of weeks. At the start of April, IVW finally broke back above its 50-DMA after repeatedly failing to do so throughout March. Last week, that rally continued as the ETF also broke out above its February highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IVW.png)**\n\n&gt; That sort of strong technical picture is not true for all growth stocks though. Instead, it is more of a market cap story. The Russell 2,000 Growth ETF (IWO) has been stuck in a downtrend over the past few months with another failed attempt to change that last week. Whereas IVW is extremely overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA) as of Friday's close, IWO is trading below its 50-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO.png)**\n\n&gt; In the chart below we show small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth through the ratio of IWO to IVW. Throughout the fall and winter, small-cap growth had been outpacing its large-cap peers as the ratio shot higher. But in mid-February, the ratio peaked and in the past month, it has more sharply pulled back as a rotation into large-cap growth has taken place. In fact, the ratio has fallen over 10% in the past month! As shown in the second chart below, there have not been many times since the two ETFs began trading in 2000 in which the ratio has fallen as sharply in such a span of time. The most recent instance was one year ago during and in the immediate aftermath of the bear market. Before that, it was almost a decade since the next most recent occurrence.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW.png)**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-1M-Chg.png)**\n\n&gt; With just five prior occurrences, there is not a particularly large sample size for these types of moves, but returns have tended to be strong following past times that the ratio of IWO to IVW has fallen by at least 10 percentage points in a single month. For both ETFs, returns have been stronger than their relative norms over the following weeks and months. Small-cap growth has perhaps performed slightly better on average although that is due to smaller declines following the late 2000 instance. In other words, big outperformance of large-cap growth in the past has been generally good for growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-Perf.png)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sell in May??? Post-Election-Year \u201cWorst Months\u201d Mixed\n\n&gt; Our Seasonal Switching Strategy, which is based upon the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d in conjunction with our MACD Technical Buy and Sell Signal signals, has a solid long-term track record of outperformance with potentially less risk compared to a buy and hold approach. Since 1950, DJIA\u2019s average annual gain has been 8.5%. Over the same time period, DJIA has lost an average 0.7% during the \u201cWorst Six Months,\u201d May through October, and gained an average 8.8% during the \u201cBest Six Months,\u201d November through April.\n\n&gt; In post-election years, the historically worst performing year of the four-year cycle (page 130, STA 2021), the \u201cWorst Months\u201d have not been all that bad with more positive periods than negative, but average gains over the six or four month (NASDAQ\u2019s Worst Months are July-October) period are still paltry. It is also worth noting that the one election year with a double-digit \u201cWorst Months\u201d S&amp;P 500 gain, 1980, was followed by a tough \u201cWorst Months\u201d in 1981 (shaded in light grey in table).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/AIN_0521_20210415_Worst_Months_by_Election_Cycle_table.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 16th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyiCIE3-r7A))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.18.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$JNJ** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$FCX** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$HOG** \n&gt; * **$DHI** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$PM** \n&gt; * **$BMRC** \n&gt; * **$MTB** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$NUE** \n&gt; * **$STLD** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$EDU** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$FHN** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$CCI** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$GNTY** \n&gt; * **$CCK**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/po0gflq.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/S1pKqwL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IAo7GlZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/SnFSpnl.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.19.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/j8avW5c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.19.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LL4z8Pi.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  4.20.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7FM5dh1.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.20.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qMSF98e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.21.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jzM0cgh.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.21.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FztoCal.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.22.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3jn4RTu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bivztrJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.23.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nh8sgYV.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.23.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Netflix, Inc. $546.54\n**Netflix, Inc.

        "selftext": "Hello Traders and Investors! An exciting week ahead of us, here is my weekly newsletter which I share every Monday to help prepare you for the week! Feel free to DM me and happy trades! \n\n**Week of 4/12/21**\n\nThe S&amp;P500 opened Monday 4/12/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday   \n4/16/21. Bitcoin is currently trading at 55724.20, down from $60,309.40 last Monday 4/12/21.  \n   \nApple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversial   \ntracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls \u201cApp Tracking Transparency,\u201d for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, \u201cbiggest competitor.\u201d Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, \u201cTechnology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we\u2019re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.\u201d\n\nApple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open. \n\nEmerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.   \n\nReports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the \u201cdouble-Irish,\u201d loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 &amp; 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it\u2019s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits. \n\nThe September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA. \n\nJP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world\u2019s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe\u2019s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open. \n\nA relatively low amount of  major economic numbers will be released this week. Reporting starts with Jobless Claims at 8:30AM on Thursday, April 22nd.

(OTCQB \u2013 RKFL)**\u00a0is poised to transform the global eCommerce industry, in our view. The Company is an early mover as a global provider of one-click online payment options using Bitcoin and dozens of other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, RocketFuel is the\u00a0first cryptocurrency payment service\u00a0to provide a seamless and elegant one-click checkout experience that today's digital and mobile-centric consumers have come to expect from eCommerce marketplaces, such as\u00a0**Amazon (NASDAQ \u2013 AMZN)**.\u00a0\n\nThe RocketFuel platform, based on patent-pending technology, enables merchants and consumers to easily complete payment for goods and services using 43 different cryptocurrencies or direct bank transfer in a completely secure environment. A significant benefit of the Company\u2019s approach is that the entire shopping cart checkout process can be executed via a distributed ledger or blockchain. Thus, merchant websites will no longer required to operate complex, and costly payment and check-out infrastructures. With the one-click checkout used on RocketFuel-partnered sites, consumers will enjoy unrivalled convenience .\n\nAs is typically the case with new technologies and applications with a broad scope, we expect early adopters to dominate usage during 2021 as online merchants shopping cart and payment solutions providers implement the crypto acceptance functionality, with mass market utilization occurring in 2022. With estimates suggesting that the number of (non-Facebook) crypto wallet holders will grow to 250M+ in the next 2-3 years, up from 68M today, substantial adoption lies ahead.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n***The Problem***\n\neCommerce has enjoyed wide, mainstream adoption and in many cases has emerged as the shopping method of choice for consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, for merchants and consumers alike, many of the payment system setups and associated technologies in place today have underlying issues, which in turn have a deleterious effect on merchant/consumer transaction execution.\n\nFor consumers, payment systems and shopping cart utilization can be awkward and clunky, require multiple steps and redirects to 3rd parties, and may not be secure, resulting in a less than stellar customer experience. For merchants, the current eCommerce payment infrastructure is even more problematic. In most cases, merchants are required to use an intermediary, costing billions in excess expenses annually. Roughly 1 in 5 carts leave without completing a transaction because consumers do not trust the merchant\u2019s system. Plus, in most cases, fees are high, payments are delayed, and exorbitant fees due to fraud, fraud prevention, and chargebacks related to the inefficient back-end operations can be excessive, reducing profits.\n\n***The Solution*** \n\nIn contrast, by leveraging modern blockchain technology and its proprietary platform, RocketFuel offers consumers a single-click pay solution, pay with crypto or direct bank transfer option with no redirects or filling out forms as the information is stored at once. The process is seamless-simple, efficient, secure, and convenient. Merchants generate higher shopping cart conversion, pay lower fees, have greater security, transparency, less fraud, and improved cash flow. With a better experience for both sides of the transaction, and improved order and shipping fulfillment, merchants can foster loyalty and generate recurring business.\u00a0\n\n***Today and Tomorrow***\n\nThe Company launched its first product in a live environment in March 2021 and with two travel merchant customers and a tax auditing firm in hand, management intends to continue to develop the check-out technology with several larger U.S. eCommerce merchants, social media and blogsites. With connections to several larger eCommerce merchants, near term sales and marketing efforts will focus on a few \u201cbig fish\u201d rather than many smaller merchants and will scale up initiatives as funding permits. We believe that the Company will also target specific verticals that may be a source of early adopters and crypto wallet holders in verticals such as online gambling, gaming, and with merchants selling high ticket items. In conjunction with this targeted approach, RocketFuel may utilize social media to generate awareness and attract consumer influencers. Given that the phase from early adoption to mass market adoption can take 12-18 months, we believe that the Company could enjoy exponential merchant sign-ups going forward, along with consumer utilization, from 2021-2022, with the greatest recurring platform utilization by consumers beginning in 2023.\u00a0\n\n***Financial Forecasts and Valuation***\n\nIt is difficult to accurately project the deployment and adoption success of a new technology and application such as the unique RocketFuel blockchain and crypto payment service.\u00a0 However, given the underlying growth rates in blockchain ledger utilization for financial and payment transactions, as well as the proliferation of crypto wallet adoption, it is clear that major upside exists. Widespread adoption and growth are further affirmed by the Company\u2019s underlying offering which solves major unmet needs in eCommerce for merchants and consumers alike. As with many young companies, it comes down to efficient execution. The management has a strong, proven track record of developing new technologies, bringing them to market, and generating value for the investors. The CEO has exited 5 other companies.\n\nWe should note that our forecasts largely reflect the typical growth inherent in new technology firms from early mover/early adopter stage to mass market appeal. Plus, the speed with which adoption in the online world occurs tends to be faster than most historical segments, further bolstering our investment thesis and projected growth rates. The variables in our forecasts tend to be the average fee percentage charged to merchants as well as revenue derived via license. It is too early in the maturation cycle to firmly estimate such revenue breakdowns or figures.\n\nTo simplify and streamline our initial forecasts, we have estimated $100M in business transacted at an average fee of 1.8% for Year 1 (Apr 2021-Mar 2022), reduced to 1.5% on $800M in transactions in FY23E and $2.5B in transactions for FY24E. While we believe additional revenue streams could be booked in FY23E, we view such contribution as a bonus at this time. However, we do project $2.5M in licensing revenue and other fees in FY24E. Based on this model, we project revenue of $1.8M in FY22E with a loss of $2.45M, or ($0.09) and revenue of $12M in FY23E with net profit of $650K, or $0.02. We preliminarily project $40M in revenue ($37.5M in transaction fees and $2.5M in licensing fees) for FY24E with net of $7.3M, or $0.22, and a net margin of 18.3%.\n\nGiven the game-changing technology and its resultant impact on the use of cryptocurrencies along with ecommerce efficiency and volume, we believe that RKFL could be afforded premium valuations as adoption occurs. Going forward, we recommend investors value the Company based on milestone events such as merchant signup as we view 2021 as a key infrastructure, proof-of-concept year, with major revenue growth in the cards in 2022 (fiscal 2023). Our 6-12-month target of $6.15 reflects a reasonable 4x our FY24 (CY23) sales estimate of $40M and roughly 28x our $0.22 EPS forecast. This target could prove to be conservative if adoption accelerates later this year or in early 2022.\n\nFinally, we believe that as a critical mass adoption among merchant occurs, the Company could emerge as a takeover candidate by a leading payment services or provider entity. RocketFuel\u2019s leadership has an enviable history of building and selling technology start-ups at key inflection points. While this event may not occur, it may have an occasional impact on valuation and should provide further confidence in management\u2019s capabilities.\n\n**INDUSTRY PRIMER: BLOCKCHAIN**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nAccording to a recent report by Markets and Markets, the blockchain technology market is expected to reach the $39.7B mark in 2025, up from $3B in 2020.\n\nA blockchain, also known as a \u201cdistributed ledger technology,\u201d is a sequential, ever-growing, time-stamped set of records used to secure transactions across multiple devices that are grouped in blocks and maintained by disparate participants. Each block is interdependent, making alterations of records economically difficult if not outright impossible.\n\nTransactions in money, equities, bonds, titles, deeds, contracts, and virtually all other kinds of assets can be implemented and stored securely, privately, and from peer to peer, because trust is established by network consensus, cryptography, collaboration, and sophisticated code---without intermediaries. Given the opportunities associated with such a disruptive technology, many firms in varied industries are actively operating in the space to transact business, agreements and financial transactions more efficiently.\n\nCommercial and central banks across the world are now using blockchain technology for payment processing and issuing of their digital currencies. The technology enables cross-border payments that are less expensive and faster as compared to traditional systems. The remittance cost within the blockchain is 2% to 3% of the total amount as compared to other third parties as blockchain does not require third-party authentication.\u00a0Even governments are introducing CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currency) to replace cash and traditional fiat-currencies. Plus, they are putting social media behemoths such as Facebook and Google under scrutiny for their lack of privacy protection and data security.\n\nOne of the most popular applications of blockchain is cryptocurrency. Trading in cryptocurrency is relatively easy compared to other assets. You can begin trading just\u00a0by signing up for various wallets on the market. Furthermore, there are different types of wallet apps, each with its own advantages, such as\u00a0levels of security, accessibility, and more. The most popular and well-known wallet is Coinbase with 639,885 daily active users (DAUs). If Facebook\u2019s Libra initiative to its 2B users is successful, this figure will be dwarfed in short order.\n\nThe payments segment dominated the market in 2020 and accounted for more than 44.0% share of the global revenue. Blockchain technology improves payment system efficiency, minimizes operating costs, and offers transparency. These benefits provided by blockchain technology are increasing its use in payment solutions, thus, driving the segment growth. At the same time, blockchain reduces the need for middlemen in payment processing, which is also a major factor driving the segment growth.\n\nBitcoin (the largest cryptocurrency) is the most popular application of blockchain, but increasingly this innovative technology\u00a0can be used in various business and commercial purposes. The elimination of the middleman in various transactions and processes promises a much more efficient workflow using blockchain.\u00a0Additionally, increasing concerns about privacy and security make blockchain an ideal technological pipeline for modern processes.\n\nEnter the eCommerce application.\n\n**ROCKETFUEL: THE GAME-CHANGER**\n\nWhen validating a new market or technology, it is instructive to review history as it tends to repeat itself. Most major technology breakthroughs and disruptions had a few things in common:\n\n* A large, inefficient market, usually based on old technologies and processes, generating problems and unnecessary cost for all stakeholders.\n* A new technology allowing new companies to invent new solutions that address these problems.\n\nSome examples include improved internet technology which enabled Amazon to evolve our commerce habits from brick and mortar to digital and mobile technology innovations and evolutions that have led to Uber and Lyft transforming transportation.\u00a0 The payments industry is no different. Its architecture and operations are still based on a 40-year-old physical card with a chip and limited fraud prevention capabilities. In contrast, digital technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies are prompting the replacement of the old architecture with a new efficient, lower cost approach. y changes the way payments are made.\n\nThere is a huge inefficient market (the payment market) causing problems for all stakeholders. There is a technology that has the potential to fix it. Enter RocketFuel Blockchain.\n\nRocketFuel is a new frictionless blockchain based payment solution for eCommerce merchants to accept payments in crypto or cash via bank transfer and receive payment and shipping information in one one-click transaction without the need for payment intermediaries. In anticipation of a major proliferation in crypto utilization for payments and business, large eCommerce and retail merchants now accept crypto as a payment method. In fact, over one-third of all small and medium-sized U.S. companies already accept Bitcoin as a B2B payment source.\n\nThe eCommerce space is estimated to be $3.5T, yet it represents less than 15% of total commerce. PayPal, a significant player in the online payments arena with over 350M users, allowed users to buy and sell crypto and just announced its \u201cCheckout for Crypto\u201d feature. This function, allows users to instantly convert their Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or Bitcoin Cash to US dollars (with no additional transaction fees) that PayPal then uses to complete the transaction. In our view, this is a validation of the RocketFuel approach and will likely capture its share of this function. Still, since it lacks the 1-click convenience and appears to still be clunky and expensive relative to our forecast of the RocketFuel pricing, RocketFuel remains in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nAs mentioned above, existing solutions are costly, impact conversion, not secure, leads to fraud, and will eventually go the way of the milkman. Merchants and consumers alike crave security, convenience, transparency, low cost and trust. \u00a0\n\n***The*** ***RocketFuel*** ***Approach***\n\nThe Company provides check-out and payment systems directly on the check-out page that securely automate and simplify the way online payment and shipping information is received by merchants from their customers. The check-out systems are designed to enhance customers\u2019 data protection, enabling consumers to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies or by direct transfers from their bank accounts without exposing spending credentials such as credit card data. At the same time, the check-out systems are designed to increase the speed, security and ease of use for both customers and merchants and include a merchant portal that provides detailed transactions and metrics about payments received by the merchant.\n\nThey also include a customer portal where shoppers are able to track their payments, configure payment defaults and connect with various cryptocurrency exchanges and banks to facilitate payment to merchants. Merchants are able to integrate a unique pop-up user interface that allows customers to pay directly from their ecommerce checkout page with no need to redirect to another website or web page.\n\nData is key and the merchant portal is updated instantly when a payment transaction is made on the merchant website. The merchant is notified of the transaction and can see the transaction details, including the customer that made the transaction, the transaction amount and the transaction items. This information is added to the merchant dashboard where various metrics are tracked and displayed to the merchant, including information about the various cryptocurrencies that are used for payments to that merchant and the funds received by the merchant from the different currencies.\n\nCustomers of merchants that use the RocketFuel payment solution are able to track their payments in their online portal. They are also able to track payments they made to all the merchants that are integrated with the RocketFuel payment technology within one consolidated user portal. They are able to connect to multiple exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Gemini and others to pay directly from them. They can also pay from any cryptocurrency wallet. Customers are able to connect with multiple bank accounts to pay from as well.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7The \u201csingle-click\u201d RocketFuel check-out solution is based on a streamlined check-out process for eCommerce purchases. The payment user interface is displayed as a stand-alone popup that allows the creation of new accounts as well as payment directly from crypto exchanges, crypto wallets, and bank accounts, with no redirects to browser tabs or pages. This can be integrated as a plugin on the merchant checkout page or as a browser extension. The plugin comes integrated with popular ecommerce platforms including WooCommerce, Shopify, Prestashop and others. The payment interface is designed for both web and mobile checkout experiences. Merchants are able to integrate the RocketFuel payment interface to their checkout page with software development kits (SDKs) that are available via the merchant portal. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are also available to the merchant for deeper integration into backend systems, ERP platforms, and other third-party platforms.\n\nCryptocurrencies are stored in different types of cryptocurrency wallets. These wallets can include mobile wallets, web wallets, desktop wallets, hardware wallets, and exchange wallets. Currently, it can be a difficult, confusing and multi-step process to use these wallets to make cryptocurrency payments. With RocketFuel\u2019s blockchain solution, cryptocurrency holders can use any of the above digital wallets to make payment for products or services to any RocketFuel merchant with 1, 2, or 3 steps.\n\nUsing the \u201csingle-click\u201d RocketFuel check-out technology and check-out button, consumers will no longer be re-directed to a third-party\u00a0 With the RocketFuel solution, eCommerce merchants will need no contact or other information exchange with the consumer in order to receive their payment or shipping details. Instead, they will have immediate visibility of payments from customers via the RocketFuel payment system, which may be integrated into merchants\u2019 fulfillment centers.\n\nLooking ahead, the technology will also be used for different scenarios, including paying for services, paying invoices, and other payment strategies. In addition, under a future version of the payment system, advertisements in which the entire check-out process is embedded will be able to be placed on third party websites and sales may be completely finalized there. Thus, the platform will enable eCommerce strategies that can include advertisements with a fully integrated check-out process. This prospective feature is unlike any other currently in use today and could eventually be a significant driver of revenue, once completed. Such advertisements will provide significant new sales channels to retailers that are simply not possible with legacy check-out solutions.\n\nIn addition to potential competition from PayPal, the primary competitor remains Bitpay, which is already well established as the leading crypto payment technology in the market, having been founded in 2011. Given that RocketFuel offers a better user experience for crypto payments, allows payment from dozens of other cryptocurrencies, and other wallets, and exchanges, RocketFuel\u2019s diversity is a major strength.\u00a0 RocketFuel also offers services that Bitpay currently does not, such as providing merchants immediate visibility of payment transactions, real time metrics of transactions and customers, easy integration to ecommerce checkout as well as deep integration to backend platforms. Furthermore, with an average of 72,000 transactions per month, it will not take significant merchant penetration for RocketFuel to surpass Bitpay, in our view.\n\n***Target Markets*** \n\nThe Company\u2019s initial target market is the travel industry and RockeFuel already has signed up two sizable customers: Sky Tours and Military Fares. It should be noted that worldwide sales of flight tickets sold online in 2019 was $540B and the 2 largest reservations systems generate more than $10B in yearly revenue, making this vertical a hot commodity. Management plans to target travel merchant and web platforms. Given the complexity of the intermediaries and reservation systems, high costs and notoriously delayed payments, the RocketFuel solution can simplify the payment process and customers no longer have to provide sensitive information. We believe other verticals such as online gambling, the procurement of gift cards, and high-ticket items could prove to be lucrative for the Company. As a result, we expect sales and marketing headcount to rise over the next 12-18 months, in conjunction with rapid deployment and implementation of existing and future solutions.\n\n**ROCKETFUEL BLOCKCHAIN LEADERSHIP TEAM**\n\n**Gert Funk, Chairman, Founder, Chief Product Officer**\n\nGert Funk has over 15 years as a payment service provider for international eCommerce merchants. A serial entrepreneur since 1990, he is the founder of RocketFuel Blockchain, Inc.

A serial entrepreneur and Blockchain expert, Rohan has had successful blockchain exits.\n\n**FINANCIAL FORECASTS**\n\n*(Analyst\u2019s Note: These forecasts are our own and we did not receive guidance or projections from RKFL management.)*\n\nOur forecasts largely reflect the typical growth inherent in new technology firms from early mover/early adopter stage to mass market appeal. Plus, the speed with which adoption in the online world occurs tends to be faster than most historical segments, further bolstering our investment thesis and projected growth rates. The variables in our forecasts tend to be in the average fee percentage charged to merchants as well as revenue derived via license. It is too early in the maturation cycle to estimate such revenue breakdowns or figures.\n\nTo simplify and streamline our initial forecasts, we have estimated $100M in business transacted at an average fee of 1.8% for FY22E or Year 1 (Apr 2021-Mar 2022), reduced to 1.5% on $800M in transactions in FY23E and $2.5B in transactions for FY24E. While we believe additional revenue streams could be booked in FY23E, we view such contribution as a bonus at this time. However, we do project $2.5M in licensing revenue and other fees in FY24E. Based on this model, we project revenue of $1.8M in FY22E with a loss of $2.45M, or ($0.09) as management begins meaningful sales and marketing expenses to build awareness and execute merchant signups in key verticals such as the travel industry and online gambling.\u00a0\n\nIn FY23E, we forecast significant revenue growth with top line reaching the $12M mark. Total operating expenses are estimated to reach $8.25M with expanded sales and marketing expenses, along with R&amp;D, reflecting upgrades to the core functionality. Based on this model, net profit is slated to reach $650K, or $0.02, with a slight rise in shares outstanding to reflect a modest fundraise in conjunction with a prospective up-list to NASDAQ. We preliminarily project $40M in revenue ($37.5M in transaction fees and $2.5M in licensing fees) for FY24E with net of $7.3M, or $0.22, and a net margin of 18.3%.\n\nIt should be noted that while there are not material direct COGS, we have allocated some indirect expenses to arrive at a gross margin of around 72-73% for all years. We believe that this is conservative and may have to be adjusted higher, thereby raising profitability and our price target.\n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\nIn our view, the Company\u2019s biggest risks are straightforward: the timing and magnitude of broad adoption of its core technology and applications by both merchants and consumers. Secondary risks include changes in the regulatory environment affecting utilization along with marketing effectiveness. Competitive risks include lower pricing, more effective sales/marketing, greater functionality and features. The aforementioned risks could come from larger competitors, existing firms, or new entrants. Still, these future concerns are consistent with firms of RocketFuel\u2019s size and early mover standing. Moreover, we believe that the Company\u2019s seasoned management team is prepared to overcome these hurdles and generate significant top-line growth, deployment and\u00a0 implementations.\n\nVolatility and liquidity are typical concerns for microcap stocks that trade on the over the counter (OTC) stock market. In addition to a recent funding access announcement regarding Triton Funds, management may seek to raise additional capital next year in conjunction with an up-list to NASDAQ, to fund corporate expansion and potential M&amp;A. An overriding financial benefit as a public company is the favorable access to and the availability of capital to fund product launches, consistent marketing campaigns and other initiatives. Since the proceeds of any future funding would be used in large part to advance major business development and sales, we believe that any dilutive effect from such a funding could be offset by related increases in market value.\n\n**VALUATION AND CONCLUSION**\n\nRKFL is an early mover as a global provider of one-click online payment options using Bitcoin and 40+ other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, RKFL is the\u00a0first cryptocurrency payment service to provide a seamless one-click checkout experience. The market is huge and growing at an enviable rate. According to Markets and Markets, the blockchain technology market is expected to reach the $39.7B mark in 2025, up from $3B in 2020.\n\nCurrent eCommerce methods are outdated, problematic, and costly, while the Company\u2019s platform is designed to improve the merchant and customer experience. Implementation should lead to lower merchant costs, potential recurring business and may foster customer loyalty.\u00a0\n\nManagement has a proven track record of developing new technologies, bringing them to market, and generating value for the investors.\u00a0The CEO has exited 5 other companies. Thus, we envision RKFL emerging as a takeover candidate. At present, our forecasts suggest sales will jump from $1.8M to $40M in 3 years, with meaningful EPS. Stocks tend to generate their greatest gains when the transition from early adoption to mass market appeal begins, which could begin in late 2021.\n\nGiven the game-changing technology and its resultant impact on the use of cryptocurrencies along with ecommerce efficiency and volume, we believe that RKFL could be afforded premium valuations as adoption occurs. Going forward, we recommend investors value the Company based on milestone events such as merchant signup as we view 2021 as a key infrastructure, proof-of-concept year, with major revenue growth in the cards in 2022 (fiscal 2023). Our 6-12-month target of $6.15 reflects a reasonable 4x our FY24 (CY23) sales estimate of $40M and roughly 28x our $0.22 EPS forecast. This target could prove to be conservative if adoption accelerates later this year or in early 2022.\n\nFinally, we believe that as a critical mass adoption among merchant occurs, the Company could emerge as a takeover candidate by a leading payment services or provider entity. RocketFuel\u2019s leadership has an enviable history of building and selling technology start-ups at key inflection points. While this event may not occur, it may have an occasional impact on valuation and should provide further confidence in management\u2019s capabilities.",

Feel free to DM me and happy trades!\n\n**Week of 4/12/21**\n\nThe S&amp;P500 opened Monday 4/12/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday  \n4/16/21. Bitcoin is currently trading at 55724.20, down from $60,309.40 last Monday 4/12/21.\n\nApple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversial  \ntracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls \u201cApp Tracking Transparency,\u201d for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, \u201cbiggest competitor.\u201d Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, \u201cTechnology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we\u2019re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.\u201d\n\nApple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.\n\nEmerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.\n\nReports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the \u201cdouble-Irish,\u201d loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 &amp; 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it\u2019s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.\n\nThe September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.\n\nJP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world\u2019s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe\u2019s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.\n\nA relatively low amount of major economic numbers will be released this week. Reporting starts with Jobless Claims at 8:30AM on Thursday, April 22nd. Instead expect a busy week for earnings reports, with many major companies reporting earnings throughout the week.\n\nSome of the larger players releasing earnings include Coca-Cola, on Monday, Johnson and Johnson on Tuesday, Intel on Thursday, and American Express on Friday. Also reporting earnings this week are several of the major travel companies impacted by last year's COVID shutdowns. This includes United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and Royal Caribbean.\n\n**Some of the companies with earnings this week:**\n\n**Monday, April 12th:**  \nCoca-Cola Co.  \nIBM Corp.  \nUnited Airlines\n\n**Tuesday, April 13th:**  \nJohnson and Johnson  \nProcter and Gamble  \nNetflix  \nPhillip Morris  \nLockheed Martin\n\n**Wednesday, April 14th:**  \nProgressive  \nFifth Third  \nVerizon  \nChipotle  \nEquifax  \nNasdaq  \nDiscover  \nHaliburton  \nBaker Hughes  \n**Thursday, April 15th:**  \nIntel  \nBlackstone  \nSnap  \nBiogen  \nSouthwest Airlines  \nCredit Suisse  \nVeriSign  \nOld Dominion  \nTractor Supply  \nQuest Diagnostics  \nBoston Beer Company  \nAmerican Airlines\n\n**Friday, April 16:**  \nHoneywell  \nAmerican Express  \nRoyal Caribbean\n\n**Numbers this week:**\n\n**Thursday, April 22nd:**\n\n* Continuing Jobless Claims (April 10th).\n* Initial Jobless Claims (April 17th).\n* Existing Home Sales (SAAR) (March).\n* Leading economic indicators (March).\n\n**Friday, April 16:**\n\n* Market Manufacturing PMI (April).\n* Market Services PMI (April).\n* New Home Sales (SAAR) (March).",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, April 20, 2021**\n\nStocks fell Tuesday, with all three major indexes dipping for the second straight session. Cyclical, travel and leisure stocks pulled back sharply while mega-cap tech stocks slid even as the 10-year Treasury yield edged lower.  \n\nDespite recent dips, the indexes remain near all-time highs, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) up roughly 10% year-to-date, so it\u2019s not necessarily surprising the market beginning to pull back.  Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial wrote in a note today, \"Many of our favorite sentiment gauges are becoming extremely bullish, which could be a near-term contrarian warning. The American Association of Individual Investors Sentiment Survey recently showed bulls outnumber bears by the most since January 2018.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, better-than-expected economic data in consumer spending and unemployment and strong performances by mega-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) have driven the market higher. On the other hand, growth stocks and more speculative plays have pulled back sharply, extending a terrible run of performance in 2021. After hitting all-time highs near the middle of February, many growth stocks are down 30-50% from those levels. While it\u2019s hard to pinpoint the exact factors why, we think (1) elevated Treasury yields compared to 12 months ago, (2) inflationary fears, (3) profit-taking after an incredible run in 2020, and (4) investor rotation to safer assets are all impacting growth stocks to the downside. \n\nLooking ahead, market participants will continue to monitor earnings season to gauge if corporate profits are growing in tandem with the recovering economy. Roughly 9% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 81% beating expectation. At the time of writing, Netflix (NFLX) just reported a sharp miss in new paying subscribers added (+3.98 million vs. +6.29 million expected), causing the stock to plummet 10% in after-hours. This is likely to have negative implications for market performance tomorrow.\n\nWhite House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said he believes the U.S. will likely resume use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine as soon as Friday with a warning or restriction attached. The doctor said, \u201cMy estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form. I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just going to go back and say, \u2018Okay, everything\u2019s fine. Go right back.\u2019 I think it\u2019ll likely say, \u2018Okay, we\u2019re going to use it, but be careful under these certain circumstances.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Chat startup Discord Inc. has halted talks to sell itself to potential suitors including Microsoft (MSFT), according to people familiar with the matter, as it resumes interest in a potential initial public offering down the line.\n* Senior executives with Alphabet's Google and Apple will testify on Wednesday about antitrust concerns related to their app stores along with executives of three companies which rely on those online stores, the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel said on Monday.\n* The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning Saturday advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive's treadmill if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March during a treadmill accident. This could affect the company's product-safety profile, a material category for the household and personal-goods sector, according to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. The stock pulled back sharply\n* The U.K. government said it would probe Nvidia Corp.'s $40 billion deal to buy British chip-designer Arm from SoftBank Group Corp., over possible national security issues, adding new regulatory scrutiny to the proposed deal.\n* **\\*\\*Please note current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday movement\\*\\***\n* Allegiant Travel (ALGT) from $250 to $285 at Buy. Stock currently around $231\n* Coupa Software (COUP target raised by Piper Sandler from $300 to $315 at Overweight. Stock currently around \n* IBM with a host of target raises. Consensus price target around $150 at Buy. Stock currently around $138\n* UnitedHealth Group target raised by Truist Securities from $420 to $450 at Buy. Stock currently around $397\n* Square (SQ) target raised by Barclays from $330 to $340 at Overweight. Stock currently around $243\n* Raytheon Technologies (RTX) target raised by Credit Suisse from $81 to $90 at Outperform. Stock currently around $77\n* Paypal (PYPL) target raised by Rosenblatt Securities from $320 to $350 at Buy. \n* Morgan Stanley (MS) target raised by Piper Sandler from $82 to $87 at Neutral. Stock currently around $77\n* Lam Research (LRCX) target raised by Cowen from $585 to $700 at Outperform. Stock currently around $612\n\nThe four most dangerous words in investing are: this time is different.\u201d - John Templeton",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 19th, 2021.\n\n# **Concerns over inflationary pressure on earnings will test stocks in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/investors-look-for-hints-of-inflation-in-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Earnings will be the major focus for investors in the week ahead, as they home in on whether rising costs are squeezing margins and signaling a build in inflationary pressures.\n*****\n&gt; From Coca-Cola and IBM to Johnson &amp; Johnson and Netflix, investors will hear from a broad swath of corporate America.\n*****\n&gt; So far, with one week in, companies are beating earnings estimates by a wide margin of more than 84%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; This three-month period is the first to be compared to year earlier profits that were affected by the pandemic. Profit growth for the S&amp;P 500 is a stunning 30.2% for the quarter so far, based on actual reports and estimates.\n*****\n&gt; That makes it the best three-month period since the third quarter of 2010, according to FactSet.\n*****\n&gt; # Signs of margin pressures?\n&gt; Major banks, like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America reported better than expected profits in the past week.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at a record high of 4,185, a gain of 1.4%. The Dow, higher for a fourth week, gained 1.2 to end the week at a record 34,200. Nasdaq gained 1.1% for the week, finishing at 14,052.\n*****\n&gt; Utilities was the best performing major S&amp;P sector, gaining 3.7%, followed by materials, up 3.2% and health care, up 2.9%. Technology was up 1%. Financials were up 0.7%, while industrials were up 0.6%.\n*****\n&gt; Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC, said she is watching the coming week\u2019s earnings for signs of margin pressures from higher commodity prices, supply chain issues and other cost factors.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThose big forces that are threatening margins right now don\u2019t really apply to financials. They apply more to industrial companies, the material companies and consumer companies,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think [sectors] like the industrials will give you color on margins,\u201d Calvasina added. \u201cMargins really are the big question mark going forward. I\u2019m definitely watching and listening to see what companies are going to say about taxes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; President Joe Biden has proposed raising corporate taxes to 28% from 21% to help pay for his infrastructure plan.\n*****\n&gt; While the fate of the tax hike is still not clear, the increase in other costs is apparent. Fuel costs have risen sharply with a 30% rise in oil prices since the beginning of the year. Lumber prices in the futures market are at an all-time high and copper futures are up about 17% year-to-date.\n*****\n&gt; Calvasina said companies face a headwind and a tailwind.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cCompanies are saying we found new ways to cut costs. When revenues come back, margins are going to explode to the upside,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the Covid-related costs will come down. Those are some of the positives.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But not every company will see those benefits. \u201cWe could start to see wage pressures come back. Rising commodity costs \u2014 increases in PPI and increases in CPI \u2014 those are negatives for margins,\u201d Calvasina said, referring to the producer price and consumer price indexes.\n*****\n&gt; # Searching for hints of inflation\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said he is also watching the margin comments carefully for impact on individual stocks, but also for what they broadly say about inflation seeping into the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat\u2019s going to be the most interesting thing about earnings are profit margins. Some companies are going to get squeezed because they\u2019re going to see price increases and others aren\u2019t because they can pass it on,\u201d said Boockvar.\n*****\n&gt; He said he will pay close attention to whether the semiconductor shortage is showing up in tech companies\u2019 earnings. Automakers have already taken a hit and have scaled back production due to the lack of chips.\n*****\n&gt; The CPI for March showed a pick-up in headline inflation to 2.6% year-over-year. A 9.1% jump in gasoline prices contributed to the gain.\n*****\n&gt; Some of the gains in inflation this spring are expected to be temporary because of the comparison to very low levels last year when the economy was shutdown.\n*****\n&gt; Other than earnings, the week should be fairly quiet. Federal Reserve speakers have taken a hiatus and are in a blackout period ahead of the late April meeting.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s really going to be attention shifting to earnings and the inflation story,\u201d said Boockvar.\n*****\n&gt; # Economic rebound\n&gt; In the past week, economic reports underscored how strong the economic momentum could be in the second quarter. Retail sales for March were up nearly 10%, and jobless claims were the lowest of the recovery.\n*****\n&gt; There is little data in the week ahead, aside from PMI manufacturing and services data Friday. But the markets will keep a close eye on unemployment figures after Thursday\u2019s report of 576,000 new claims \u2014 the lowest level since the early days of the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe large claims decline suggests that job separation rates may finally be normalizing, a good sign for April payrolls,\u201d note Barclays economists. A surprise 916,000 jobs were added in March, and economists have said they now expect a string of reports showing payrolls are up by 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, says it may be too early to read too much into the claims data, and the coming week\u2019s report will be important.\n*****\n&gt; He said the drop in claims was driven by sharp drops in a number of states, including more than half in California and even larger percentage declines in Kentucky and Virginia.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cUnfortunately, I have no confidence that these moves won\u2019t be at least partially reversed next week,\u201d he wrote. \u201cContinuing claims in the special pandemic programs continue to seesaw up and down every week, with the latest reading, for the period ended March 27, being a down week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Watching bonds\n&gt; Stock investors will also be watching the bond market, where yields declined in the past week and then reversed. The 10-year Treasury was at 1.59% Friday, after tumbling sharply on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year is the most widely watched bond security, as it impacts mortgage rates and other loans.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe 10-year will now trade in the 1.50% to 1.75% trading range,\u201d said Boockvar.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019ll break below that if inflation is transitory and it will break above if it\u2019s proven to be otherwise,\u201d he added. \u201cI think we priced in the last inflation stats and then we\u2019ll take into account what the real world is saying, from companies.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/c7J5krZ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lhy7AaR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/UW7ZbbU.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/uom4C2h.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/l0cX2LH.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jpa2DZe.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PgmZlAV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3Rugxjf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gmHwRAL.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/po0gflq.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j0oHK6M.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jJcd0lq.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qX9lwYh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Jvf27dw.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Four Reasons The Future Looks Bright For The Bulls\n\n&gt; \u201cI look to the future because that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life.\u201d George Burns\n\n&gt; The bull market continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 10% in 2021. With stocks up more than 80% from the March 2020 lows, the reality is a well-deserved break or consolidation could happen at any time. Looking to the future, as George Burns said above, we would be a buyer of any material weakness, as we believe this bull market is alive and well as we\u2019ll discuss more in this blog.\n\n&gt; Here are four bullish stats we\u2019ve found recently that indeed suggest this bull market could still have plenty of life left.\n\n&gt; First, the S&amp;P 500 Index was up just under 6% in the first quarter, an area we\u2019d call the sweet spot. Looking back since 1950, when the S&amp;P 500 was up between 5-10% in the first quarter, the rest of the year (so the final three quarters) gained another 12.4% on average and was higher 86.7% of the time. Compare this to when the S&amp;P 500 was up &gt;10% in the first quarter and the returns drop to 6.5% the rest of the year. Lastly, if the first quarter was negative, then the rest of the year was up only 3%. Sweet spot indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Second, the December Low Indicator has bulls smiling. This was created by Lucien Hooper, a Forbes columnist in the 1970s, and it simply says that if the S&amp;P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter then future weakness could be in the cards. But if this critical level holds, then higher prices could be around the corner.\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, stocks held above the December lows in 2021 and this could mean continued higher prices, as the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 18% on average previous years when this level held and incredibly was higher 33 out of 35 years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Third, the S&amp;P 500 was up nearly 54% in the 12 months ending March 2021, one of the largest yearly gains ever. Looking at previous times that had significant 12-month returns shows the potential for weak returns 1, 3, and 6 months later. This makes sense, as stocks could need some time to catch their breath. The good news? One year later the S&amp;P 500 was higher more than 90% of the time, with only the year after the 1987 crash in the red. \u201cIt might seem counterintuitive to most investors, but big rallies like we\u2019ve seen tend to mark the start of bull markets, not the end, so we wouldn\u2019t bet on this bull market ending anytime soon,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, overall market breadth is extremely strong. Again, this could suggest near-term there could be an exhaustion point, but this isn\u2019t what you see at the end of bull markets, in fact, it tends to usually happen at the start of new bull markets. Currently, more than 95% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 200-day moving average, a level only seen two other times, in December 2003 and September 2009. Looking back at 2004 and 2010, 2004 saw consolidation a good part of the year, while 2010 had a well-deserved 16% correction after the huge gains off the March 2009 lows. But the key point is after extreme market breadth like we are seeing now, overall higher prices and the bull market lasted for many more years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking to the future, as George Burns said, we believe it could be a bright one for equity investors, particularly when we consider the return potential for stocks compared to cash and high-quality bonds.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Boom Goes the Retail Sales\n\n&gt; After a lousy report for the month of February when freak weather across the south temporarily shut down several areas of the south, Retail Sales bounced back with a vengeance in March as vaccine rollouts accelerated and stimulus checks were spent.\n\n&gt; The moves higher in Retail Sales over the last few months have been incredible. As shown below, while it took 40 months to make a new high following their pre-Financial Crisis peak, COVID only caused a five-month drought without a new high. From the low in April 2020, Retail Sales have bounced 50%!\n\n&gt; Even more impressive, though, is not only are total Retail Sales above their pre-COVID peak, but they are more than 17% above that peak just 14 months ago. The second chart shows the 14-month rate of change in Retail Sales since 1992. While the post-COVID decline was the steepest on record, the 14-month gain is the highest on record. Ironically, had it not been for COVID and the stimulus it resulted in, there is no way Retail Sales levels would be where they are now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Retail-Sales-14-months.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth a Market Cap Story\n\n&gt; Last week, we repeatedly noted how there has been rotation back into growth-oriented sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. For example, mega-cap names like Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) have been some of the top performers in the second quarter whereas they were some of the worst performers in Q1. As a result of the strong performance of these names which all have heavy weights in the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), the ETF has undergone some notable price action over the past couple of weeks. At the start of April, IVW finally broke back above its 50-DMA after repeatedly failing to do so throughout March. Last week, that rally continued as the ETF also broke out above its February highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IVW.png)**\n\n&gt; That sort of strong technical picture is not true for all growth stocks though. Instead, it is more of a market cap story. The Russell 2,000 Growth ETF (IWO) has been stuck in a downtrend over the past few months with another failed attempt to change that last week. Whereas IVW is extremely overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA) as of Friday's close, IWO is trading below its 50-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO.png)**\n\n&gt; In the chart below we show small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth through the ratio of IWO to IVW. Throughout the fall and winter, small-cap growth had been outpacing its large-cap peers as the ratio shot higher. But in mid-February, the ratio peaked and in the past month, it has more sharply pulled back as a rotation into large-cap growth has taken place. In fact, the ratio has fallen over 10% in the past month! As shown in the second chart below, there have not been many times since the two ETFs began trading in 2000 in which the ratio has fallen as sharply in such a span of time. The most recent instance was one year ago during and in the immediate aftermath of the bear market. Before that, it was almost a decade since the next most recent occurrence.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW.png)**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-1M-Chg.png)**\n\n&gt; With just five prior occurrences, there is not a particularly large sample size for these types of moves, but returns have tended to be strong following past times that the ratio of IWO to IVW has fallen by at least 10 percentage points in a single month. For both ETFs, returns have been stronger than their relative norms over the following weeks and months. Small-cap growth has perhaps performed slightly better on average although that is due to smaller declines following the late 2000 instance. In other words, big outperformance of large-cap growth in the past has been generally good for growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-Perf.png)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sell in May??? Post-Election-Year \u201cWorst Months\u201d Mixed\n\n&gt; Our Seasonal Switching Strategy, which is based upon the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d in conjunction with our MACD Technical Buy and Sell Signal signals, has a solid long-term track record of outperformance with potentially less risk compared to a buy and hold approach. Since 1950, DJIA\u2019s average annual gain has been 8.5%. Over the same time period, DJIA has lost an average 0.7% during the \u201cWorst Six Months,\u201d May through October, and gained an average 8.8% during the \u201cBest Six Months,\u201d November through April.\n\n&gt; In post-election years, the historically worst performing year of the four-year cycle (page 130, STA 2021), the \u201cWorst Months\u201d have not been all that bad with more positive periods than negative, but average gains over the six or four month (NASDAQ\u2019s Worst Months are July-October) period are still paltry. It is also worth noting that the one election year with a double-digit \u201cWorst Months\u201d S&amp;P 500 gain, 1980, was followed by a tough \u201cWorst Months\u201d in 1981 (shaded in light grey in table).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/AIN_0521_20210415_Worst_Months_by_Election_Cycle_table.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 16th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyiCIE3-r7A))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.18.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$JNJ** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$FCX** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$HOG** \n&gt; * **$DHI** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$PM** \n&gt; * **$BMRC** \n&gt; * **$MTB** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$NUE** \n&gt; * **$STLD** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$EDU** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$FHN** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$CCI** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$GNTY** \n&gt; * **$CCK**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/po0gflq.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/S1pKqwL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IAo7GlZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/SnFSpnl.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.19.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/j8avW5c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.19.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LL4z8Pi.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  4.20.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7FM5dh1.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.20.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qMSF98e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.21.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jzM0cgh.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.21.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FztoCal.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.22.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3jn4RTu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bivztrJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.23.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nh8sgYV.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.23.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Netflix, Inc. $546.54\n**Netflix, Inc.

Why they didn\u2019t go with any of their American companies like crowdstrike or ibm or Microsoft or carbon black? \n2. Blackberry holds quantum security in their spark platform. Any car being designed that will be on road for next 10 years need to have quantum cryptography built in TODAY. So oem are forced to use blackberry products because no alternative exist. \n3. NSA certified blackberry spark platform. Only one to be ever certified by nsa, not even American companies are coming close to this certification. \n4.

Here's how I did:\n\n* **Direction:** 65% correct\n* **Daily high:** Median error of 0.26%\n* **Daily low:** Median error of 0.36%\n\nI was always more interested in the highs and lows than the direction, but *damn* is 65% ever a bad score. I've looked into it -- if I'd just predicted whatever the premarket said, I would've been right 74% of the time.\n\nPart of the problem was this:\n\n**When J. Powell talks, there's a 66% chance the market will tank.**\n\nWhen J. Powell talked, my prediction was wrong more often than it was right -- and usually by a lot. On average, my prediction for the daily low was off by 1.37% whenever he spoke.\n\nI wanted to look into that, so I tested out some of the big narratives we heard this month\n\n[Click here to see that research visualized.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)\n\nJ. Powell used to be able to pump the market -- but since 2020, I learned, the market has turned red on 66% of the days that he has either made a speech or a public testimony, with the market closing, on average, down 1.24%.\n\n**The NASDAQ is often a better predictor of a stock's price than the company itself.**\n\nI've seen a lot of posts here lately saying: \"Why is everybody talking about indexes? Isn't this supposed to be a stock forum?\"\n\nOne thing this month affirmed for me is that, if you want to know what AAPL or MSFT are going to do today, you have to look at the market itself first.\n\nAAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN were all extremely correlated with the NASDAQ this month, to the point that, statistically speaking, it can be said that 81% of the variations in Apple's price this month can be explained by changes in the NASDAQ.\n\nI saw a lot of people in the daily discussion asking: \"Why is AAPL tanking? What new is there?\" But -- unless there actually is company news -- that's often the wrong question to ask. \n\n**The market isn't always affected by what CNBC says...**\n\nOne of the biggest stories we heard this month was about the \"bond yield\". The 10-year bond yield went up today, CNBC would report, and so the NASDAQ was sure to tank.\n\nIt never really made sense to a lot of investors -- so I looked into whether that story held up.\n\nI'll let you draw your own conclusions, but here's what I can say for sure:\n\n* There was no statistically significant correlation between the 10-year bond yield and the NASDAQ's price in March\n* If there were one, it would be a positive correlation. When the bond yield went up, it was more likely that the NASDAQ would go up with it than down.\n* There was more of a correlation on days when the bond yield reached a new 12-month high -- but only if the new yield was heavily reported. If it went unmentioned, the NASDAQ went up.\n* The days when the bond yield did significantly go up and the NASDAQ did significantly go down were all days when J. Powell gave a speech\n\n**... but sometimes it is.**\n\nThat doesn't mean everything CNBC said was a lie this year.\n\nAnother huge story this month was the rotation out of tech into value stocks -- and then, at the end of the month, the rotation back.\n\nThis story *totally* holds up. If you plot a tech stock like AAPL's price against JP Morgan's (which I've done for you [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)), you'll see that, 61% of the time, these stocks went in the exact opposite direction.\n\nPeople really were rotating out of tech and into value -- and they really are starting to come back.\n\n**I still think the stock market can be predicted**\n\nWhen I started doing this, I got a lot of hate from people who said that only an idiot would try to predict the market. But after a while, those hate messages stopped -- and, instead, people started sending me hate messages saying that they could predict the market better than I can.\n\nThey probably can. I didn't do as well as I'd like this month, but, when I was right, I knew *why* I was right. And when I was wrong, I knew *why* I was wrong -- and had a pretty good idea of how to do better next time.\n\nEverything is *not* priced-in, I've learned this month. Take Biden's speech last night. The market didn't even budge while he was talking. Sure, we were in afterhours, but even Robinhood users were allowed to invest -- and his plan had been laid out weeks in advance. But the Wall Street traders were off work, so the market didn't budge until the morning -- when it absolutely mooned.\n\nIf you pay close enough attention, you *can* get ahead of Wall Street. I'm increasingly convinced of that, and I believe that my predictions will get better as time goes on.\n\n[You can see today's prediction here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/kHRAC)",

Wikiporfile.com aims to assist businesses and business professionals in order to find valid information in an easy and timely manner, helping them make informed career and hiring decisions. The company\u2019s vision is to become the go to platform for connecting users to business opportunities on a global scale.*\n\n*Share structure: ( according to OTC Markets, via* [*https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/WSFT/security*](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/WSFT/security)*)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4nmhhi610kq61.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=599835133764766749ceb6f074aa80e3c468848d\n\n*Wikisoft was incorporated in Nevada on May 4, 1998, under the name Sensor Technologies, Inc. The company changed its names multiple times, and in March 2018, Bluestar Technologies ultimately became Wikisoft Corp.*\n\n**Management**\n\nMr. Paul Quintal joined the company on August 1, 2020 as Chief Commercial Officer with the main objective to get funding, as he shortly resigned after, in December 2020. He then tool the role as Chairman and Directors, being responsible for corporate governance and investor relations. Mr. Quintal is highly qualified and has extensive experience in search engine technology, as he has worked for companies such as Pentius, Inc., Softbank, Internet.com and Lycos. He was a key member for 2 IPOs, 2 exits via sale and 12 acquisitions &amp; integrations. Specifically, his role at Pentius included leading negotiations for large strategic contracts, managerial guidance, and high-value deal-making.\n\nMr. Carsten Kjems Falk has recently joined Wikisoft Corp, serving as Chief Executive Officer since September 1, 2020, making him responsible for strategy, operations, business development, and all commercial activities. Prior to Wikisoft Corp, Mr. Flak was Chief Executive Officer at Domino\u2019s Pizza DK. Mr. Falk holds a Master\u2019s degree in Mathematics and curriculum studies, and has a proven track record of successfully winning 2 Gazelle Prizes from the leading financial newspaper in Denmark. Also highly relevant, Carsten Falk\u2019s experience could be leveraged at Wikisoft, developing the company into a competitive player in its industry. Mr. Falk has also been awarded twice for the best global online sales by Domino\u2019s International.\n\n**Business Model**\n\nWikisoft\u2019s vision is to become an important player in the business information industry, with Wikiprogile.com. Wikiprofile.com is a portal that provides articles and profiles on companies, business people and corporate influencers. Currently, the website portal is operational in its launched form, however, the company is focused on relaunching the updated format of the website (planned to take place in the Spring 2021). Wikisoft has externalized some of its functions, with developers based in India and IT operations based in Denmark.\n\nWikiprofile.com is built on a modern microservice software stack and is developed in multiple Postgres databases, which represent a main pillar for the platform. The architecture is designed to make the web faster, more secure, easier to scale, and in addition, by using proprietary crawler technology, the databases automatically collect information on newly found entities, seeking to have a complete database. Once relaunched, wikiprofile.com will help users to stay connected and informed, allowing professionals to advance their careers while also allowing business to hire the best professionals and work smarter.\n\nWikisoft is just about to enter into the \u201cgrowth phase\u201d. After going through the restructuring stage (2017-2019 ), the company went on to build a solid foundation and gear for growth by changing the management team, leveraging their business model, implementing growth strategies. The next period could represent the growth stage, and could be characterized by accelerated growth, becoming a global brand, and capitalizing on the growth opportunities.\n\nIn the long run, Wikisoft plans to disturb the industry when it comes to validation of professional profiles and create new standards, changing the wat people trust digital information. The platform aims to provide trusted information about companies and people, allowing both of them to make the right decision. Wikisoft would engage in a global market worth 479 billion USD, with the United States being the leading country, at 152 billion USD, according to Statista. ( Revenue of global staffing industry 2008-2019 ).\n\nWikisoft believes that they could be a major disruption for the industry, as the company looks to leverage their strengths:\n\n\\- Large global business database that can be used for Marketing &amp; Sales\n\n\\- Highly scalable setup geared towards the future growth journey\n\n\\- Limited operational cost geared for growth\n\n\\- Data crawled, verified &amp; updated daily providing a job market directory for businesses and job seekers\n\n\\- Disruptive business model with low entrance barrier to gain market share\n\nAs Wikisoft is working to relaunch the website portal in its updated format, the company aims to create additional value for their users through four different planned product lines:\n\na) Wiki Business People Profile\n\n\\- Free basic profile, visible to recruiters looking for new employee\u2019s\n\n\\- Additional features such as data insights on profile visitors , financial company information and receiving job proposals are all planned to be available at a cost\n\nb) Wiki Business Profile\n\n\\- Free basic profile, allowing companies to highlight their culture, increase their brand awareness, and\n\n\\- Additional features such as review management and data insights available at a cost\n\nc) Wiki Recruit\n\n\\- Planned to include a free basic profile where recruiters can post jobs\n\n\\- Additional features such as premium ranking, ability to send job proposals directly to job candidates; ( planned to be $19.99 per month for the premium ranking, $29.99 per month for the premium ranking and ability to send direct job proposals )\n\nd) Wiki Company Research\n\n\\- Offer solidity, liquidity and credit reports to make research and ensure right decision making when choosing a new job or supplier\n\nWikisoft plans to generate revenues from premium profiles and recruiting on the website platform, but also by charging users for access to certain information and features on the platform.\n\nOperations plan \u2013 timeline, projections:\n\nQ1 2021:\n\n\\- Updated website platform to be launched, including new features and extended profiles of businesses and business professionals;\n\n\\- Mobile version planned to be launched as well, along new investor site on Wikisoft.com\n\n\\- Estimated costs: $40,000\n\nQ2 2021:\n\n\\- commence marketing activities, with the goal of generating users and sign ups; ( main drivers: email, SEM, SEO )\n\n\\- further development if website platform with new features such as reviews, in-mails\n\n\\- having the company\u2019s common stock on the OTC markets OTCQB tier\n\n\\- Estimated costs: $40,000\n\nQ3 2021:\n\n\\- Hiring of marketing managers that will be responsible for optimizing and ensuring KPI driven email, SEM &amp; SEO, and for executing Wikisoft\u2019s marketing strategy\n\n\\- IT development for crawling and fronted development of business logic and products\n\n\\- Estimated costs: $50,000\n\nQ4 2021:\n\n\\- Continue hiring additional developers, hire additional customer care and marketing managers\n\n\\- Develop platform with new features like Jobs and Job Postings\n\n\\- Hire CFO to streamline financial reporting, compliance, investor relations and improve corporate governance\n\n\\- Estimated costs: $70,000\n\nThe industry is evolving with rapid pace, and other companies with significantly bigger financial resources, such as LikedIn, Glassdoor, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter could or are developing solutions that compete with Wikisoft. Larger companies could focus on professional networking and directly compete with Wikisoft.\n\nWikisoft is a potential buyout target, ultimately following the footsteps of other similar companies in the industry. LinkedIn was acquired by Microsoft for $26.2 billion; Hired raised $132 million since founding in 2012 +10,000 top companies using Hired employers can reduce time to hire by about 33%; Glassdoor was acquired by Recruit Holdings for $1.2 billion in May 2018. Recruit provides recruiting solutions to 7k+ employers, including about 40% of the Fortune 500.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/earz1h620kq61.png?width=1707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecbddb859bc3afa1430711612ee19d7540383168\n\nSource: Wikisoft, Management Information, via Information Memorandum\n\nWikisoft will also not have ads on website in order to build brand trust. The company could potentially capture market share through their strong brand recognition and amount of proprietary data. Wikiprofile is rated among the highest in terms of trusted and credible content, while also having a modern IT infrastructure, being e=well organized and integrated for business and consumer applications.\n\n**Risks Factors**\n\n\u201cThe Company has generated very little revenue, which was all from a related party, and has incurred losses of $2,888,765 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $1,954,297 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of $7,583,538 since inception and does not have a sufficient amount of cash required to pay all the costs associated with its operations. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, the Company had working capital deficit of approximately $23,041. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\u201d ( Wikisoft, Annual Report, 03/29/2021, SEC database)\n\n\u201cThe Company seeks to overcome the circumstances that impact its ability to remain a going concern through a combination of the growth of revenues, with interim cash flow deficiencies being addressed through additional equity and debt financing. The Company anticipates raising additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements in the near future to support its business operations.\u201d ( Wikisoft, Annual Report, 03/29/2021, SEC database)\n\nWikisoft Corp has little to no history of revenue generation and currently operates at a loss, thus the company is still dependent on financings for the continuation of operations. Also, evaluating and forecasting Wikisoft\u2019s financial performance cannot be done with great accuracy.\n\nMr. Rasmus Refer is the largest shareholder and has substantial control over the company and its policies. As of 03/29/2021, he owns 87.83% of Wikisoft\u2019s common stock. He is also able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring approval by stockholders.\n\nThe company is extremely likely to conduct offerings of equity in the future, meaning that stockholders would be diluted, as their proportional interest would decrease.\n\nUltimately, the success of the company strictly depends on its ability to develop and commercialize their platform.\n\n**Financials**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5iw9gsb30kq61.png?width=699&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60031b8d95e5bd77e95da6f4a87455fd8fe839f9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwcbz0i40kq61.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0fd15c9d2f143e58167e70f1263d49887b8f637\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wh1yqm850kq61.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3efc2c86bf7e92f4d38ea367fb117315c6dde264\n\nSource: ( Wikisoft, Annual Report, 03/29/2021, SEC database)\n\nEven though there is little to no financial data that could be analyzed, Wikisoft represents a huge opportunity for investors, as the company is poised for growth in the near future. Although it is too early to make accurate price target estimates and projections, if the Wikisoft\u2019s management team is successful in leveraging their growth strategies, Wikisoft could become a billion dollar capped company sometime In the next 3-6 years, possibly resulting in a 600% return on investment. As soon as the updated version of the online portal is launched and additional features are added, the company will initiate their marketing strategies, and around that time (expected to be in the fourth quarter of 2021), investors should start seeing revenues and cash flows from operations increasing. By that time, Wikisoft ( if nr. of shares outstanding remains the same), should be trading around $12-$15 per share. Overall, I am optimistic about Wikisoft\u2019s long term prospects, and assign the company a BUY rating.\n\nDisclaimer: I assume no responsibility or liability for any errors or omissions in the content of the report.

        "selftext": "Paysafe has finally just gone public with a new Board of Directors, much less debt, lots more cash, new M&amp;A plans and a new ticker: PSFE During yesterday's ticker change, there were several reports of people having no access to their accounts and/or suddenly being faced with an abrupt change in margin requirements from 25% to 100%. Many suggest this was intentional manipulation to give institutions cheaper shares. Regardless, this may have created a good buying opportunity for us too. For those interested, here's some comprehensive DD.\n\nPaysafe is a unique combination of fintech, iGaming, sports betting and banking all rolled into one stock. Whether you like him or not, this is essentially why NBC\u2019s Jim Cramer recently said, \u201cThere is something about Paysafe that may be the ultimate stock for this moment.\u201d (video link below) Market analyst Steve Grasso says, \u201cIt\u2019s the most excited I\u2019ve been about a stock in a long time.\u201d Grasso, by the way, has repeated called for it to triple ($45-50). So why is that?\n\nPaysafe offers a scalable electronic payment platform used by Draftkings, Roblox, Spotify, eToro, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, EA, 888, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Microsoft, Xbox, Amelco, William Hill, Ceasar's, Betfair, Pokerstars, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, bet365, Lotto among many others.\n\nPaysafe is ranked No. 2 globally in the digital wallet space with presence in 120 countries and No. 4 globally in integrated merchant processing.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe is the No. 1 global leader in iGaming eCash network (currently 36% of revenue) with 10-15X growth projected. US iGaming continues to be legalized state by state, growing revenue by 234% in just the last year. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is enabled for digital currency (a type that shall not be mentioned in these parts) without having to go through fiat. It recently partnered with Coinbase to expand options in US and it just launched PaysafeCash in US. (Now in 40 currencies and 30 global markets enabling easier cross border payments.)\n\nPerhaps most central to this recent merger is Bill Foley, Fidelity\u2019s Chairman of the Board and now the Chairman of Paysafe, who has a proven track record for generating exponential synergistic inorganic growth. For example, in just the last five years, he grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X) and he says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nOf their expansion plans Foley says, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else.\u201d \u201cI have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody. That\u2019s why I got so excited about Paysafe Group Holdings Limited as its position in iGaming is really second to none.\u201d \u201cWhether it\u2019s a lottery or slot machines or sportsbetting opening in a state, it\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate. We\u2019re focusing on gaming, particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and we\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d\n\nAlong with Bill Foley, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone and two senior Managing Directors from CVC,\n\nBetween the new Board of Directors, Bill Foley\u2019s proven expertise in rapid M&amp;A growth and Paysafe\u2019s massive market share and diverse assets, including the world\u2019s second largest digital wallet, $362 million in free cash flow, 30-35% margins (21% CAGR), a projected $100-110 billion in transactional volume and $1.5 billion revenue, it is inevitable that institutional investors will, by necessity, include PSFE in their portfolios.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s industry leading risk management and international regulatory expertise gives them an edge in spaces where competitors have hesitated like iGaming, sportsbetting, alternative currency trading as well as offering essential banking and ecommerce services to the \"unbanked\" (1.7 billion globally). Paysafe has a global platform with integrated cloud technology (Snowflake) allowing for easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods and expansion into global banking as a service. Paysafe is so diversified that they've identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\nFurther, major investment funds know that fintechs are the future. Fund manager Cathie Wood says, \u201cFintechs are going to, we believe, gut banks.\u201d Similarly, Jackie Reses, board member of the SF Federal Reserve and fmr Head of Square Capital, calls for fintech \u201ctaking over and revolutionizing banking\u201d representing \u201ca wholesale transition\u201d of a $16 trillion market cap.\n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso recently initiated coverage saying, \"We believe PSFE represents a relatively scarce asset within the payments industry given its unique business strategy, geographical footprint, and focus on the iGaming industry. Our forecasts imply revenue growth at the high-end of management's guidance and we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming. PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States.\"\n\nInvestors should be aware that there is are post-merger lockup periods before insiders can sell their shares: PIPE: = 176 days. Private Equity = 86 days (roughly 6 and 3 months respectively accounting for trading days and weekends). Something to be aware of but there are several signals that these parties aren't in any rush to sell. Eli Nagler, a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone, recently said: \u201cToday is a significant milestone for Paysafe and a testament to the excellent work of their world-class management team over several years. We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d Regarding Blackstone and CVC, who now have four senior managing directors on Paysafe\u2019s Board, Foley said, \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026 All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d Also, the PIPE investors are primarily insurance companies known for long term hold strategies and they are closely associated with Bill Foley. As Foley recently said, \u201cHaving a large PIPE basically validates the transaction.\u2026 The companies that I\u2019m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset, besides the fact that it\u2019s a great asset.\u201d\n\nBill Foley says Paysafe may be his \u201cbest investment ever.\u201d He says, \u201cIt\u2019s a fortress. It\u2019s got a moat.\u201d \u201cWe have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\u201d\n\nAs an aside, even though, \u201cRoughly 75% of online gambling operators use Paysafe for processing payments\u201d many in the US haven\u2019t yet heard of it yet. Partially because much of its presence is in back-end processing. Through its several new partnerships (Coinbase, Microsoft Rentmoola), Paysafe is just now rolling out its offerings in the U.S. In Europe, where it is more commonly used, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 20,000 reviews, and Skrill (owned by Paysafe) 4/5 stars \u201cgreat\u201d with over 16,000 reviews, while competitor PayPal is rated \"poor\" only 1/5 stars with over 16,000 reviews. Further, Paysafe was winner of the American Gambling Awards\u2019 \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and owns Openbucks, Neteller and Skrill, 2019 winner \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for best consumer take up and most innovative technology with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d Also, Paysafe won \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award and the gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nTo give a sense of their pace and progress, these are some of Paysafe\u2019s recent announcements that were made before going public and have not been factored into the current valuation:\n\nDec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US\n\nDec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n\nDec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft\n\nJan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood\n\nFeb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership\n\nFeb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n\nFeb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n\nFeb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency\n\nFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n\nMar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n\nMar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n\nMar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet\n\nMar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments\n\nMar 25 -- Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands digital currency offering to US with Coinbase\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFortunately for shareholders, even before Foley\u2019s value creation play book is put into action, Paysafe is currently undervalued compared to sector peers.\n\nSince market analyst Steve Grasso continues to his repeat his calls for a triple ($45-50), I've looked more closely at EV / EBITDA, EV / Revenue and EV / Free cash flow multiples of sector peers, including PayPal, Nuvei, Repay, Shift 4, Adyen, Square, Affirm, Stripe, Chime and a few others, using cross-referenced data from Nasdaq, WSJ, Morningstar, Macrotrends, Yahoo Finance. The conservative average of those three multiples puts Paysafe\u2019s post-merger pro forma share value at around $46.52:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price using the average multiples from the full list of sector peers:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore realistic share prices, after eliminating all outliers with very high multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Unlike Paysafe, nearly half of these publicly traded fintechs still do not report positive cash flow. Also, these multiples reflect a collective 27% pull back from recent highs so interest rate risks have been somewhat factored in.\n\nAlso, Paysafe's CFO noted that their conservative 11% growth projection is tied to the general fintech market at large. They have deliberately excluded both M&amp;A plans that are apparently already underway and US iGaming growth that may potentially grow 10x or more over the next 5 years. Further, the above comps include fintechs with slower or similar growth while still commanding much higher multiples. For example, Shift4 reported only 4% y-o-y growth and GPN's growth projection is on par with Paysafe's.",

        "selftext": "GlobeX Data Ltd. the leader in Swiss hosted secure communications and secure data management, is pleased to report that it has completed all internal testing of its SekurMessenger Swiss hosted messaging security and privacy solution, in preparation for its commercial launch in Latin America in April 2021.\n\nAs previously announced in a separate press release dated January 12 2021, GlobeX is launching SekurMessenger, its Swiss hosted encrypted instant messaging, secure voice recording transfer and secure file transfer application, with Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vi's Telcel mobile operator in Mexico. The secure messaging service has been fully integrated with Telcel's billing and provisioning platform and the commercial launch is expected to start the week of April 12 2021. The launch will start in Mexico and expand to other countries where America Movil operates through its Claro brand, such as Colombia and other Latin American countries as the business grows over the coming years.\n\nGlobeX Data and Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil are looking at offering a secure and private alternative to other non-secure and non-private messaging applications. The market is geared primarily for business and government users, and privacy conscious consumers. According information published on Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vi's website, Telcel is the largest mobile operator in Mexico, with over 75 million mobile subscribers. Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil (NYSE:AMX) is the 7th largest telecom operator in the world with over 277 million mobile subscribers in over 20 countries throughout Latin America and Europe.\n\nRecent data breaches in messaging applications and in particular in the WhatsApp application have created a certain urgency for businesses and data privacy advocates to protect their communications form cyber-attacks and identity theft via mobile and desktop devices.\n\nSekurMessenger eliminates many of the privacy and security risks by not only not requiring a phone number, which would divulge a user's phone device ID, but also by not social engineering a user's phone or computer contact list and infecting the contacts by default as well, eliminating a huge loophole in security and privacy. SekurMessenger issue each user a username and a SM number. The SM number is the contact ID a user would disclose in order for other SM users to be added. As the Introduction Video demonstrates, the service comes with a self-destruct timer and other features as well, including GlobeX's proprietary VirtualVaults and HeliX technologies with all data stored in Swiss hosted encrypted servers.\n\nAdditionally, SekurMessenger now comes with a proprietary feature and technology called Chat by Invites. This feature allows a SekurMessenger user (\"SM user\") invite a non-SM user, or a group of non-SM users, to chat in a fully private and secure way, without the recipient ever having to register to SekurMessenger or download the app. At the end of the chat, the initiator of the conversation can remotely terminate the conversation and all traces of the conversation are deleted from all users, including the recipient. This unique feature is now fully deployed and functional on all iOS and Android devices and web platforms. The target sectors are numerous, including but not limited to real estate, legal, financial, government, energy, mining, manufacturing, trade and medical sectors.\n\nAlain Ghiai, CEO of GlobeX Data said: \"We are very happy to have completed the testing phase of the launch with Telcel and are looking forward to the launch in the next couple of weeks. We have completed our Spanish language platform for SekurMessenger, and this means that we now can deploy other languages in the coming months as the ground work for localization coding has been done. We have received notice from Tecel, and other partners, that there is a growing demand to replace WhatsApp as a business messaging solution. SekurMessenger is here to satisfy that demand, and as we are not connected, and never have been connected, to AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud platforms, commonly referred to as \"Big Tech\", we can offer a truly independent, private and secure means of communications through secure messaging, secure voice record transfer and secure email through our proprietary technology and our secure servers based in Switzerland. We plan to expand to several countries in Central and Latin America in the coming years, as we plan to launch with other partners in the region as well. According to statista.com and other information sites, there are over 580 million people speaking Spanish in Latin America alone, and with security and privacy becoming a global concern, and the new WhatsApp rules to share all users' data with Facebook, we have seen a surge in demand and inquiries for our secure and private communications solutions.\"\n\nGlobeX's Data privacy solutions are all hosted in Switzerland, protecting users' data from any outside data intrusion requests. In Switzerland, the right to privacy is guaranteed in article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution. The Federal Act on Data Protection (\"FADP\") of 19 June 1992 (in force since 1993) has set up a strict protection of privacy by prohibiting virtually any processing of personal data which is not expressly authorized by the data subjects. The protection is subject to the authority of the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.\n\nUnder Swiss federal law, it is a crime to publish information based on leaked \"secret official discussions.\" In 2010 the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland found that IP addresses are personal information and that under Swiss privacy laws they may not be used to track Internet usage without the knowledge of the individuals involved.\n\nDisclaimer: this is not investment advice, please do your own research.",

Wikiporfile.com aims to assist businesses and business professionals in order to find valid information in an easy and timely manner, helping them make informed career and hiring decisions. The company\u2019s vision is to become the go to platform for connecting users to business opportunities on a global scale.*\n\n*Share structure: ( according to OTC Markets, via* [*https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/WSFT/security*](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/WSFT/security)*)*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b326bktrxjq61.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=734827cf4d0aacc834d043a3c8253796c4e07b0c\n\n*Wikisoft was incorporated in Nevada on May 4, 1998, under the name Sensor Technologies, Inc. The company changed its names multiple times, and in March 2018, Bluestar Technologies ultimately became Wikisoft Corp.*\n\n**Management**\n\nMr. Paul Quintal joined the company on August 1, 2020 as Chief Commercial Officer with the main objective to get funding, as he shortly resigned after, in December 2020. He then tool the role as Chairman and Directors, being responsible for corporate governance and investor relations. Mr. Quintal is highly qualified and has extensive experience in search engine technology, as he has worked for companies such as Pentius, Inc., Softbank, Internet.com and Lycos. He was a key member for 2 IPOs, 2 exits via sale and 12 acquisitions &amp; integrations. Specifically, his role at Pentius included leading negotiations for large strategic contracts, managerial guidance, and high-value deal-making.\n\nMr. Carsten Kjems Falk has recently joined Wikisoft Corp, serving as Chief Executive Officer since September 1, 2020, making him responsible for strategy, operations, business development, and all commercial activities. Prior to Wikisoft Corp, Mr. Flak was Chief Executive Officer at Domino\u2019s Pizza DK. Mr. Falk holds a Master\u2019s degree in Mathematics and curriculum studies, and has a proven track record of successfully winning 2 Gazelle Prizes from the leading financial newspaper in Denmark. Also highly relevant, Carsten Falk\u2019s experience could be leveraged at Wikisoft, developing the company into a competitive player in its industry. Mr. Falk has also been awarded twice for the best global online sales by Domino\u2019s International.\n\n**Business Model**\n\nWikisoft\u2019s vision is to become an important player in the business information industry, with Wikiprogile.com. Wikiprofile.com is a portal that provides articles and profiles on companies, business people and corporate influencers. Currently, the website portal is operational in its launched form, however, the company is focused on relaunching the updated format of the website (planned to take place in the Spring 2021). Wikisoft has externalized some of its functions, with developers based in India and IT operations based in Denmark.\n\nWikiprofile.com is built on a modern microservice software stack and is developed in multiple Postgres databases, which represent a main pillar for the platform. The architecture is designed to make the web faster, more secure, easier to scale, and in addition, by using proprietary crawler technology, the databases automatically collect information on newly found entities, seeking to have a complete database. Once relaunched, wikiprofile.com will help users to stay connected and informed, allowing professionals to advance their careers while also allowing business to hire the best professionals and work smarter.\n\nWikisoft is just about to enter into the \u201cgrowth phase\u201d. After going through the restructuring stage (2017-2019 ), the company went on to build a solid foundation and gear for growth by changing the management team, leveraging their business model, implementing growth strategies. The next period could represent the growth stage, and could be characterized by accelerated growth, becoming a global brand, and capitalizing on the growth opportunities.\n\nIn the long run, Wikisoft plans to disturb the industry when it comes to validation of professional profiles and create new standards, changing the wat people trust digital information. The platform aims to provide trusted information about companies and people, allowing both of them to make the right decision. Wikisoft would engage in a global market worth 479 billion USD, with the United States being the leading country, at 152 billion USD, according to Statista. ( Revenue of global staffing industry 2008-2019 ).\n\nWikisoft believes that they could be a major disruption for the industry, as the company looks to leverage their strengths:\n\n\\- Large global business database that can be used for Marketing &amp; Sales\n\n\\- Highly scalable setup geared towards the future growth journey\n\n\\- Limited operational cost geared for growth\n\n\\- Data crawled, verified &amp; updated daily providing a job market directory for businesses and job seekers\n\n\\- Disruptive business model with low entrance barrier to gain market share\n\nAs Wikisoft is working to relaunch the website portal in its updated format, the company aims to create additional value for their users through four different planned product lines:\n\na) Wiki Business People Profile\n\n\\- Free basic profile, visible to recruiters looking for new employee\u2019s\n\n\\- Additional features such as data insights on profile visitors , financial company information and receiving job proposals are all planned to be available at a cost\n\nb) Wiki Business Profile\n\n\\- Free basic profile, allowing companies to highlight their culture, increase their brand awareness, and\n\n\\- Additional features such as review management and data insights available at a cost\n\nc) Wiki Recruit\n\n\\- Planned to include a free basic profile where recruiters can post jobs\n\n\\- Additional features such as premium ranking, ability to send job proposals directly to job candidates; ( planned to be $19.99 per month for the premium ranking, $29.99 per month for the premium ranking and ability to send direct job proposals )\n\nd) Wiki Company Research\n\n\\- Offer solidity, liquidity and credit reports to make research and ensure right decision making when choosing a new job or supplier\n\nWikisoft plans to generate revenues from premium profiles and recruiting on the website platform, but also by charging users for access to certain information and features on the platform.\n\nOperations plan \u2013 timeline, projections:\n\nQ1 2021:\n\n\\- Updated website platform to be launched, including new features and extended profiles of businesses and business professionals;\n\n\\- Mobile version planned to be launched as well, along new investor site on Wikisoft.com\n\n\\- Estimated costs: $40,000\n\nQ2 2021:\n\n\\- commence marketing activities, with the goal of generating users and sign ups; ( main drivers: email, SEM, SEO )\n\n\\- further development if website platform with new features such as reviews, in-mails\n\n\\- having the company\u2019s common stock on the OTC markets OTCQB tier\n\n\\- Estimated costs: $40,000\n\nQ3 2021:\n\n\\- Hiring of marketing managers that will be responsible for optimizing and ensuring KPI driven email, SEM &amp; SEO, and for executing Wikisoft\u2019s marketing strategy\n\n\\- IT development for crawling and fronted development of business logic and products\n\n\\- Estimated costs: $50,000\n\nQ4 2021:\n\n\\- Continue hiring additional developers, hire additional customer care and marketing managers\n\n\\- Develop platform with new features like Jobs and Job Postings\n\n\\- Hire CFO to streamline financial reporting, compliance, investor relations and improve corporate governance\n\n\\- Estimated costs: $70,000\n\nThe industry is evolving with rapid pace, and other companies with significantly bigger financial resources, such as LikedIn, Glassdoor, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter could or are developing solutions that compete with Wikisoft. Larger companies could focus on professional networking and directly compete with Wikisoft.\n\nWikisoft is a potential buyout target, ultimately following the footsteps of other similar companies in the industry. LinkedIn was acquired by Microsoft for $26.2 billion; Hired raised $132 million since founding in 2012 +10,000 top companies using Hired employers can reduce time to hire by about 33%; Glassdoor was acquired by Recruit Holdings for $1.2 billion in May 2018. Recruit provides recruiting solutions to 7k+ employers, including about 40% of the Fortune 500.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5cef80auxjq61.png?width=1707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a6861513c0f456dbbe6cb0de1b4da50f66ca717\n\nSource: Wikisoft, Management Information, via Information Memorandum\n\nWikisoft will also not have ads on website in order to build brand trust. The company could potentially capture market share through their strong brand recognition and amount of proprietary data. Wikiprofile is rated among the highest in terms of trusted and credible content, while also having a modern IT infrastructure, being e=well organized and integrated for business and consumer applications.\n\n**Risks Factors**\n\n\u201cThe Company has generated very little revenue, which was all from a related party, and has incurred losses of $2,888,765 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $1,954,297 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of $7,583,538 since inception and does not have a sufficient amount of cash required to pay all the costs associated with its operations. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, the Company had working capital deficit of approximately $23,041. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\u201d ( Wikisoft, Annual Report, 03/29/2021, SEC database)\n\n\u201cThe Company seeks to overcome the circumstances that impact its ability to remain a going concern through a combination of the growth of revenues, with interim cash flow deficiencies being addressed through additional equity and debt financing. The Company anticipates raising additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements in the near future to support its business operations.\u201d ( Wikisoft, Annual Report, 03/29/2021, SEC database)\n\nWikisoft Corp has little to no history of revenue generation and currently operates at a loss, thus the company is still dependent on financings for the continuation of operations. Also, evaluating and forecasting Wikisoft\u2019s financial performance cannot be done with great accuracy.\n\nMr. Rasmus Refer is the largest shareholder and has substantial control over the company and its policies. As of 03/29/2021, he owns 87.83% of Wikisoft\u2019s common stock. He is also able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring approval by stockholders.\n\nThe company is extremely likely to conduct offerings of equity in the future, meaning that stockholders would be diluted, as their proportional interest would decrease.\n\nUltimately, the success of the company strictly depends on its ability to develop and commercialize their platform.\n\n**Financials**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h2ez2juvxjq61.png?width=699&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bfcbb534e16fb633c5268cdd5d3bef2d2e20c00\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7byzewlwxjq61.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11dbcd21db8c2e9053b4cb27f04076b44e4b2310\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyikcfgxxjq61.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01792e5b157a981bbc80529f9dc6ffaa4dd04c7b\n\nSource: ( Wikisoft, Annual Report, 03/29/2021, SEC database)\n\nEven though there is little to no financial data that could be analyzed, Wikisoft represents a huge opportunity for investors, as the company is poised for growth in the near future. Although it is too early to make accurate price target estimates and projections, if the Wikisoft\u2019s management team is successful in leveraging their growth strategies, Wikisoft could become a billion dollar capped company sometime In the next 3-6 years, possibly resulting in a 600% return on investment. As soon as the updated version of the online portal is launched and additional features are added, the company will initiate their marketing strategies, and around that time (expected to be in the fourth quarter of 2021), investors should start seeing revenues and cash flows from operations increasing. By that time, Wikisoft ( if nr. of shares outstanding remains the same), should be trading around $12-$15 per share. Overall, I am optimistic about Wikisoft\u2019s long term prospects, and assign the company a BUY rating.\n\nDisclaimer: I assume no responsibility or liability for any errors or omissions in the content of the report.

        "selftext": "Take it from someone who started investing this year and made mistakes and loss money. \n\nYou need to decide what your goals are and how high of a risk you wanna take. Do you want to follow stocks and ETFs that you have to actively manage and attempt to beat the market with or do you wanna put your money in weekly or monthly and watch it grow without having to do constant research? Note- while i consider VTI/ the boglehead method pretty low risk and care free one should still keep up with the market to know whats going on.\n\n1. Open webull \n\n2. Deposit any money you are ready to invest into VTI (US total market etf) until you know what your official investmsnt plan is and have adjusted that a few times. Mine has changed a lot. VTI is a relatively \"safe\" yet great returning etf. \n\n3. Go to the \"paper trading\" section of webull and start looking at stocks. Use these different sub reddits like stocks, stockmarket, etfs and boglehead to do research (note- other brokerages use paper trading but its what i used so its why i said webull). \n\n3a. Learn about what TRUE DD is. Not what W S B tells you. Yes some people here and other forums occasionally post solid DD but you need to know what EPS, PE, BVPS, ROE, Debt, etc. All mean and why they are important. Specifically PE is something ive learned to assess. Webull has some pretty great charts where you can look at the different EMAs. Until you know all of these things and know what the company actually does and how they make money/ will in the future the stock stays in your trading account. \n\n4. Find a stock you like. Add it to your paper trading account and watch it for 3-6 months. \n\n5. Assess it again. Did it drop? Why? Did it run up like crazy? Why? Find out why. Learn how to assess these movements.\n\n6. If and only if 3-6  months later you feel like this stock is a winner then move it to your actual trading account and buy in. (For those of you saying well thats 6 months of gains i just missed. No you are getting VTI gains plus if the stocks solid now itll be solid again in 6 months right? The goals a solid return not day trading 200% gains).\n\nPRO TIPS-\n\n-DO NOT FOMO SELL OR BUY STOCKS. I can not emphasize this enough. Ive bought in where things are gaining 5%/ hour and guess what? The stock within a week dropped back down to \"fill the gaps.\" I never believed that was a thing but ive watched it happen way too many times. About 99% of the time a stock i watchlisted shot up if i got it while going up within a  week it temporarily dropped back before rising again. \n\n-Do yourself a favor and avoid Wall s t r e e t b e t s \n\n-Never invest any money you arent willing to lose today. If you need the money soon (within a year in my opinion) and will need that full amount do not invest it. The market especially now is unpredictable. A lot of people lost a lot of money these last 2 months that they will either never get back or will be holding the bag they call it for years. \n\n- Contrary to popular belief... its okay to sell for a loss. This is a hard lesson and one many people will give you a hard time on saying \"BuY hIgH sElL lOw.\" Guess what? Sometimes we pick bad stocks/ etfs. Especially when you are new you will think you found the gold mind of a stock only for it to get bad news like the trial drug didnt get approved or they delayed production or loss a contract bid. Would you rather be down 20% and perhaps watch it keep going down more and hold that stock for years perhaps before it comes back up or would you rather accept the loss (which youll claim on taxes) and then reinvest in a solid company/ etf that will make that loss back faster. Of course this correction we were just in is an expection in someways because some companies will bounce back relatively quick but i forsee that there will be many people that bought in at all time highs who wont see a profit for a very long time. \n\n- In the same respect above you have to have discipline. Stocks dont only go up. You WILL have down days. Youll temporarily be in the red. This will be the pucker moment you decide if you regret buying that position or not. Be disciplined. \n\n-The same goes for being on top. There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking profits if your stock happens to have a huge run up (knowing youll pay capital gains tax though). \n\n- DO NOT USE MARGIN ACCOUNTS \n\n- Avoid option trading for at least a year till you understand what you are doing and can pick good stocks to buy options for. You can lose so much money so fast. \n\n- these subs can be amazing and they can be toxic. Some people give great advice and others dont. Whatever someone tells you dont take it as fact. They may tell you that AMD will double in 6 months buy buy buy. But its your money not theirs you could lose. \n\n- CNBC gets a lot of hate but Squak box, fast money and mad money on Spotify or watching it live has some really good insight to the market. But again they dont always give great advice. \n\n- you have to decide what your plan is and what stocks/ etfs/ risk fits your life style and plan. \n\n- people are scared of dividends for no reason. Unless you are investing millions upon millions of dollars ignoring solid stocks and ETFs which pay dividends to \"avoid unnecessary tax events\" is silly. If you dont believe me look at an ETF like SCHD. calculate the max amount youll ever get in that account. Divide by shares and multiply by dividend rate. Its not that much in end that you pay taxes on.\n\n- as much as we all wanna make 200% every month on every stock thats so unbelievably unrealistic. Look at some of the biggest ETFs like VT, VTI, SCHA, SCHB, VXUS, etc. And see their YOY returns. That your goal.\n\n\nMy advice/ quick tid bit/ plan\n\nI attempted to beat the market. I fomo'd into stocks and got burnt and loss money. I bought stocks at ATh cause every said stocks only go up. Thankfully my losses are minimal since i invested minimally my first year but i learned some hard lessons. I got humbled quick and ive realized i cant beat the market, i don't have the skill or time to do proper DD and watch the stocks 24/7 to assess whats happening and id rather park my money in a few ETFs and let it grow. Im not gonna gain 300% in a year but if i can gain 5-10% in a year it beats the heck outta what a savings account could ever give me.\n\nMy current 5 fund boglehead portfolio spin off... (which i plan to hold for a year before i rebalance... with the exception of increasing SCHD/ VXUS quicker than that and decreasing VTI to compensate). \n\nVTI- 70% \n\nVXUS- 10%\n\nSCHD- 10% \n\nQQQM- 7.5:\n\nQQQJ- 7.5%\n\nGood luck!",

        "selftext": "\n\nBlink Charging is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.\n\nThe main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that Blink is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. Blink has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nBelow I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nAlso I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? \n\nHere is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.\n\nhttps://www.highshortinterest.com/ \n\nhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/CCGID\n\nHowever I do think that there is reason to claim the stock is undervalued regardless of what the squeeze potential may be if that sanario was to play out. What do you guys think I'm not a stock wizard by any means I'm just an Ape like you \ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udda7 all so it would be interesting to get your opinions. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e",

I fomo'd into stocks and got burnt and loss money. I bought stocks at ATh cause every said stocks only go up. Thankfully my losses are minimal since i invested minimally my first year but i learned some hard lessons. I got humbled quick and ive realized i cant beat the market, i don't have the skill or time to do proper DD and watch the stocks 24/7 to assess whats happening and id rather park my money in a few ETFs and let it grow. Im not gonna gain 300% in a year but if i can gain 5-10% in a year it beats the heck outta what a savings account could ever give me.\n\nMy current 5 fund boglehead portfolio spin off... (which i plan to hold for a year before i rebalance... with the exception of increasing SCHD/ VXUS quicker than that and decreasing VTI to compensate). \n\nVTI- 70% \n\nVXUS- 10%\n\nSCHD- 10% \n\nQQQM- 7.5:\n\nQQQJ- 7.5%\n\nGood luck!",

        "selftext": " This latest installment of why $DGX is **still** the safest double up+ opportunity in the market will likely be my last update before earnings this month (baring eventful news). A lot of this will be regurgitation from Parts 1 and 2 because, well, most of what was discussed has been coming to fruition:\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies/)\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 2 - Electric Boogaloo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dtqk/dgx_quest_diagnostics_pt_2_electric_boogaloo/)\n\n**TL;DR again** \\- $DGX is now over 8% higher since DD Pt. 2 earlier this month. The stock and associated calls are still trading at very reasonable amounts, continuing to make $DGX the safest double up+ play in the market. **During their Investor Day earlier in March, they doubled both LT Revenue and EPS CAGR guidance. They also confirmed they will be repurchasing $900 MILLION in shares in the FIRST HALF of this year. This will reduce their float by over 5%.** That is material. Now consider 90% of float is owned by institutions. Then add in all EPS guidance given for Q1 and Q2 does NOT factor in repurchases. Blah blah blah ROCKETS.\n\n**Positions** \\- I've given my positions every single time, yet some smucks demanded a screenshot. Why how much $ I have in these positions matters is beyond me. Either I tickled your balls enough during the DDs to invest or I didn't. Anyway, here's a **consolidated** view (100% options), which is drastically understated ($10k+ both gains and total value) because Ally's platform has become unreliable hot garbage:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kspcic1dqjq61.jpg?width=3480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05521960a236201679bbda237f3fb5997ad5270a\n\nOpen: May 21 $125, $130, $135. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160\n\nAs previously mentioned, I also have another $50k stock and a small amount of options in my other account with TD. I will be moving all of my holdings to TD eventually because Ally has become completely broken over the past year and their customer service is non existent. **Just a PSA to AVOID ALLY.**\n\n**The new stuff:**\n\n* Most important - March Investor Day LT Revenue and Earnings CAGR increase and MASSIVE share repurchase timing: [**https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-updates-strategic-growth-114500393.html**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-updates-strategic-growth-114500393.html)  \n\n   * This improved LT outlook has yet to be reflected in any new \"analyst\" price targets\n* Acquired Mercy's outreach lab services. Like I said, they will be using their piles of $$$ to make acquisitions. Especially as smaller labs run out of runway as the pandemic slows down. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-mercy-broaden-access-140700481.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-mercy-broaden-access-140700481.html)\n* Struck deal with Zora Biosciences' to further efforts to enhance direct to consumer self testing offerings. A key growth focus for them is self testing of all kinds in the future: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zora-biosciences-licenses-ceramide-technology-130400471.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zora-biosciences-licenses-ceramide-technology-130400471.html)  \n\n   * [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/quest-sees-direct-to-consumer-testing-taking-off-post-pandemic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/quest-sees-direct-to-consumer-testing-taking-off-post-pandemic)\n* As previously noted in earlier DDs, analysts were drastically overestimating the Q1 drop off in COVID testing expected. Public data shows daily testing remains absurdly high. In fact, the lowest testing day so far in Q1 is still higher than the highest day from May-Oct 2020. The overall Q1 daily average remains over DOUBLE that period as well. Heck, even Quest's own press release indicates COVID testing remains absurdly high through March (Q1) for them specifically: [https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates](https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates)\n* On top of the $50billion in stimulus, $DGX will also be a primary provider of testing services upon school re-openings: [https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/K-12-NTAP.pdf](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/K-12-NTAP.pdf)\n\n**Some important stuff from the previous DDs because God knows you still didn't click the links above:**\n\n* Based on management's own conservative EPS forecasts (**excl repurchases**), a PE of 10 at mid year results in a share price of $144. This is the absolute floor target. They also announced unprecedented $2b in share repurchases for 2021, meaning they can repurchase over 16m shares at current levels. Their float is 133m shares, **BUT roughly 90% of that is owned by INSTITUIONS, leaving LESS THAN 16m** ***available*** **to public.** Assuming institutions continue to hold the majority of their shares (they will. it's a safe dividend stock), this stock will rocket by end of year.  \n\n   * I have always expected a Q1 diluted EPS &gt; 4. I am currently projecting 4.2, which results in a TTM EPS of 14. Further, I anticipate roughly $3 EPS as the Q2 floor, resulting in a TTM EPS post Q2 of 15.63.\n   * This results in an EPS 20% above the high amount given in guidance, which again, was conservative and didn't account for share repurchases\n\nThe reason this stock constantly runs up into earnings and then ticks lower despite large beats is solely due to their base testing lagging behind typical performance due to COVID. The market is acting as if the COVID faucet will just get shut off in the snap of a finger (soon) and then the base testing will take time to return. Does this sound right to you? **This line of thinking is laughably absurd and na\u00efve.** Reasons:\n\n* After a year of this shit, there is a massive backlog of people/procedures that will be completed after more of the pop is vaccinated. We haven't even seen a DGX Q performance with strong base testing AND COVID $$$ yet. Q1 of 2021 will be the first. Book it.\n* **Political climate / stimulus** \\- I'm sure you all saw the CDC is now \"recommending\" double masking. Hell, I've passed out four times writing this diatribe due to the 6 masks I'm wearing. Why does this matter? For every bit a person feels the previous admin downplayed COVID, the new admin is going 100% the opposite direction. Considering the US is going to continue to pump trillions into the economy, you can bet your ass all testing companies will benefit. There will definitely be huge grants/subsidies for enhanced serology procedures and research....and of course in analyzing COVID further. These testing companies have so much COVID data that will continue to be poured over as the pandemic lessens. You can also bet there will be an increased $ focus on scanning/checking for new viruses in the near future.\n* **$$$$$$$** \\- Do you think DGX is just going to light the enormous $$$ they've made over the past 9 months and will continue to make for 2021 on fire? Because that's what the current stock price/growth reflects. When in reality and in addition to the buybacks, they will be targeting acquisitions and investing heavily in serology capabilities/analysis and self testing expansion.\n\n**Price Expectations by EOY:**\n\n* Worst case - $150. Yea, I'm serious. Baring a market meltdown driven by Biden's tax policy, this baby is a lock.\n* Best case - $200\n\n**Important Dates:**\n\n* Ex-Dividend date this FRIDAY 4/2\n* Q1 Earnings 4/22\n\n**Disclaimer:** I'm a rando on a message board, yada yada yada, not investment advice. Ally SUCKS as a brokerage. Use someone else. Long live GME.",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: I own close to 150k shares.\n\nI read the RethinkX report about the next revolution in food, you can find it here: https://www.rethinkx.com/food-and-agriculture\n\nNewsflash: People like eating meat and demand is growing rapidly\nhttps://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/agricultural-outlook/meat-consumption\n\nNow this creates a tricky situation as global production can only follow demand if we scale production in ways that are rather harmful to the environment and - inherently - inefficient. We basically built the whole animal around the desired product, but we do not need the animal and it takes rather long to reach \"maturity\" and consumes too much resources along the way. Long story short - we need a more efficient method.\n\nEnter lab meat/fish. Here they produce meat with the help of cells and media in bio reactors, the same ones used for the fermentation of yeast. Same product but less of the downsides of traditional meat and fish:\n- Shorter production time\n- More cost efficient in the future (rough estimate says 2030)\n- no animals are harmed (unless you count the minimal itch it takes to get some cells)\n- one cow = tons of meat (all they need is cells from it)\n- can be produced in a factory, does not need land \n- way smaller CO2 footprint\n- better food quality, no friggin hormones everywhere\n- potentially to be consumed by vegetarians and vegans too (vegans questionable I know)\n\nOne of the most promising companies currently is BlueNalu (https://www.bluenalu.com/) aiming for production later this year. Now almost none of the companies are publicly traded at the moment, but I found a good vehicle to get access: Agronomics\nhttps://agronomics.im/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Agronomics-Corporate-Presentation-.pdf\n\nIf you are interested, I recommend reading the book \"Moo's Law\" by one of the founders, Jim Mellon. Overall extremely interesting new sector and also one that hits the nerve of the current society I think (everyone is becoming more environmentally aware).",

        "selftext": "\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.\n\nThe main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that BLNK is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. BLNK has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nBelow I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nAlso I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? \n\nHere is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.\n\nhttps://www.highshortinterest.com/ \n\nhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/CCGID\n\nHowever I do think that there is reason to claim the stock is undervalued regardless of what the squeeze potential may be if that sanario was to play out. What do you guys think I'm not a stock wizard by any means I'm just an Ape like you \ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udda7 all so it would be interesting to get your opinions. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e",

Finally, if Schwab is buying TD then wouldn't it make more sense to use Schwab instead if TD, or is TD better? Also open to other ideas, I really do not want to be switching around.

        "selftext": "Paysafe has finally just gone public with a new Board of Directors, much less debt, lots more cash, new M&amp;A plans and a new ticker: PSFE During yesterday's ticker change, there were several reports of people having no access to their accounts and/or suddenly being faced with an abrupt change in margin requirements from 25% to 100%. Many suggest this was intentional manipulation to give institutions cheaper shares. Regardless, this may have created a good buying opportunity for us too. For those interested, here's some comprehensive DD.\n\nPaysafe is a unique combination of fintech, iGaming, sports betting and banking all rolled into one stock. Whether you like him or not, this is essentially why NBC\u2019s Jim Cramer recently said, \u201cThere is something about Paysafe that may be the ultimate stock for this moment.\u201d (video link below) Market analyst Steve Grasso says, \u201cIt\u2019s the most excited I\u2019ve been about a stock in a long time.\u201d Grasso, by the way, has repeated called for it to triple ($45-50). So why is that?\n\nPaysafe offers a scalable electronic payment platform used by Draftkings, Roblox, Spotify, eToro, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, EA, 888, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Microsoft, Xbox, Amelco, William Hill, Ceasar's, Betfair, Pokerstars, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, bet365, Lotto among many others.\n\nPaysafe is ranked No. 2 globally in the digital wallet space with presence in 120 countries and No. 4 globally in integrated merchant processing.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe is the No. 1 global leader in iGaming eCash network (currently 36% of revenue) with 10-15X growth projected. US iGaming continues to be legalized state by state, growing revenue by 234% in just the last year. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is enabled for digital currency (a type that shall not be mentioned in these parts) without having to go through fiat. It recently partnered with Coinbase to expand options in US and it just launched PaysafeCash in US. (Now in 40 currencies and 30 global markets enabling easier cross border payments.)\n\nPerhaps most central to this recent merger is Bill Foley, Fidelity\u2019s Chairman of the Board and now the Chairman of Paysafe, who has a proven track record for generating exponential synergistic inorganic growth. For example, in just the last five years, he grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X) and he says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nOf their expansion plans Foley says, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else.\u201d \u201cI have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody. That\u2019s why I got so excited about Paysafe Group Holdings Limited as its position in iGaming is really second to none.\u201d \u201cWhether it\u2019s a lottery or slot machines or sportsbetting opening in a state, it\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate. We\u2019re focusing on gaming, particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and we\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d\n\nAlong with Bill Foley, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone and two senior Managing Directors from CVC,\n\nBetween the new Board of Directors, Bill Foley\u2019s proven expertise in rapid M&amp;A growth and Paysafe\u2019s massive market share and diverse assets, including the world\u2019s second largest digital wallet, $362 million in free cash flow, 30-35% margins (21% CAGR), a projected $100-110 billion in transactional volume and $1.5 billion revenue, it is inevitable that institutional investors will, by necessity, include PSFE in their portfolios.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s industry leading risk management and international regulatory expertise gives them an edge in spaces where competitors have hesitated like iGaming, sportsbetting, alternative currency trading as well as offering essential banking and ecommerce services to the \"unbanked\" (1.7 billion globally). Paysafe has a global platform with integrated cloud technology (Snowflake) allowing for easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods and expansion into global banking as a service. Paysafe is so diversified that they've identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\nFurther, major investment funds know that fintechs are the future. Fund manager Cathie Wood says, \u201cFintechs are going to, we believe, gut banks.\u201d Similarly, Jackie Reses, board member of the SF Federal Reserve and fmr Head of Square Capital, calls for fintech \u201ctaking over and revolutionizing banking\u201d representing \u201ca wholesale transition\u201d of a $16 trillion market cap.\n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso recently initiated coverage saying, \"We believe PSFE represents a relatively scarce asset within the payments industry given its unique business strategy, geographical footprint, and focus on the iGaming industry. Our forecasts imply revenue growth at the high-end of management's guidance and we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming. PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States.\"\n\nInvestors should be aware that there is are post-merger lockup periods before insiders can sell their shares: PIPE: = 176 days. Private Equity = 86 days (roughly 6 and 3 months respectively accounting for trading days and weekends). Something to be aware of but there are several signals that these parties aren't in any rush to sell. Eli Nagler, a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone, recently said: \u201cToday is a significant milestone for Paysafe and a testament to the excellent work of their world-class management team over several years. We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d Regarding Blackstone and CVC, who now have four senior managing directors on Paysafe\u2019s Board, Foley said, \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026 All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d Also, the PIPE investors are primarily insurance companies known for long term hold strategies and they are closely associated with Bill Foley. As Foley recently said, \u201cHaving a large PIPE basically validates the transaction.\u2026 The companies that I\u2019m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset, besides the fact that it\u2019s a great asset.\u201d\n\nBill Foley says Paysafe may be his \u201cbest investment ever.\u201d He says, \u201cIt\u2019s a fortress. It\u2019s got a moat.\u201d \u201cWe have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\u201d\n\nAs an aside, even though, \u201cRoughly 75% of online gambling operators use Paysafe for processing payments\u201d many in the US haven\u2019t yet heard of it yet. Partially because much of its presence is in back-end processing. Through its several new partnerships (Coinbase, Microsoft Rentmoola), Paysafe is just now rolling out its offerings in the U.S. In Europe, where it is more commonly used, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 20,000 reviews, and Skrill (owned by Paysafe) 4/5 stars \u201cgreat\u201d with over 16,000 reviews, while competitor PayPal is rated \"poor\" only 1/5 stars with over 16,000 reviews. Further, Paysafe was winner of the American Gambling Awards\u2019 \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and owns Openbucks, Neteller and Skrill, 2019 winner \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for best consumer take up and most innovative technology with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d Also, Paysafe won \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award and the gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nTo give a sense of their pace and progress, these are some of Paysafe\u2019s recent announcements that were made before going public and have not been factored into the current valuation:\n\nDec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US\n\nDec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n\nDec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft\n\nJan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood\n\nFeb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership\n\nFeb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n\nFeb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n\nFeb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency\n\nFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n\nMar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n\nMar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n\nMar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet\n\nMar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments\n\nMar 25 -- Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands digital currency offering to US with Coinbase\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFortunately for shareholders, even before Foley\u2019s value creation play book is put into action, Paysafe is currently undervalued compared to sector peers.\n\nSince market analyst Steve Grasso continues to his repeat his calls for a triple ($45-50), I've looked more closely at EV / EBITDA, EV / Revenue and EV / Free cash flow multiples of sector peers, including PayPal, Nuvei, Repay, Shift 4, Adyen, Square, Affirm, Stripe, Chime and a few others, using cross-referenced data from Nasdaq, WSJ, Morningstar, Macrotrends, Yahoo Finance. The conservative average of those three multiples puts Paysafe\u2019s post-merger pro forma share value at around $46.52:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price using the average multiples from the full list of sector peers:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore realistic share prices, after eliminating all outliers with very high multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Unlike Paysafe, nearly half of these publicly traded fintechs still do not report positive cash flow. Also, these multiples reflect a collective 27% pull back from recent highs so interest rate risks have been somewhat factored in.\n\nAlso, Paysafe's CFO noted that their conservative 11% growth projection is tied to the general fintech market at large. They have deliberately excluded both M&amp;A plans that are apparently already underway and US iGaming growth that may potentially grow 10x or more over the next 5 years. Further, the above comps include fintechs with slower or similar growth while still commanding much higher multiples. For example, Shift4 reported only 4% y-o-y growth and GPN's growth projection is on par with Paysafe's.",

If you are cock sure about GME hitting $42069 then you don't need to read every goddamn comment on the daily GME thread or read every crayon laden TA post that tells you GME will moon on X date. Why is there such a need to have constant reassurance about GME mooning? Is it a possible FUD strategy? Think about it; you're conditioned to log on to WSB and get an instant dopamine hit because you saw a post about how GME is gonna moon any second now. What happens if this stretches on for months or even years? People might lose interest and, God forbid, exit their positions. GME is shaping up to be a solid long term play regardless of the short squeeze potential. Quit needing constant reassurance, it makes us look unsure and insecure. \n\nTL;DR: Nobody knows when GME will moon. Quit circle jerking and wearing out your dopamine receptors. If you're cock sure about GME mooning then STFU and HODL!\n\nPositions: $CUM 420@69, $ASS 69@420.",

        "selftext": "I got in at $13 after reading of it on wallstreetbets but ended up selling it at around $17 because I thought it\u2019s amazing that something I got from wallstreetbets actually went up, time to take profit. I was a pussy basically. Then I saw it went up to $30s then $100s then $300s and as many I started reading more on it but decided not to chase it. Then saw it come back down to $40 but just thought to myself I dodged a bullet, even though I could have stayed in at $13 purchase and not sell but it could be worse and I could have gotten it and $300. Then I saw it going back up and while all of this was happening I went balls deep reading the DDs on wsb/gme and really understood what was going on but again decided to stay away cause I didn\u2019t want anything close to betting. But clearly it didn\u2019t stay that way and my whole plan changed when I took my mothers to doctors, we were sitting in the waiting area and I had some heart to heart with my mother (she recently lost her brother and got sick right after) She went to use the restroom and I opened wsb and saw DFV post his account update. That happened to be exactly at the time when $GME had gone back up from $40s back to above $100s, but that day it was red. It dipped below $100 and I set the limit for $88 to go all in and guess what $GME low was that day.. around $86.5. I got my shares and right after it started going up.\nAnd it was the last time $GME dipped below $100. I consider myself extremely lucky I got a good buy point even though I was nowhere in the earliest of people who deserve all the returns in this more then anyone cause they believed in the stock from the start but I am so glad I got in this cause at that moment it felt so right. It still feels right. This was about 40 days back and i have deleted my stock account from my phone so I don\u2019t even think of selling it, I want..need this to change my life around, had pretty much the worst time of my life since I lost everything in 2018 and this seemed like the best way to do it. I put whatever I have now In gme and honestly it doesn\u2019t matter if I got in at $88 or $200 when it\u2019s at +$10000. It\u2019s good to be in this journey with you guys. Thanks to you guys I got in this and got this opportunity to see the worth.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone \nI am a new investor, who has been trading on a practice account on trading 212. However, my account suddenly vanished 2 weeks ago without any trace. My email was not found in the system nor any trading 212 email found in my accounts. I report to the platform in worries of being hacked, data leakage. Now not only I feel data violated, also I lost every trading record and have to join a long wait list. I contacted and the support system didn't provide any help at all. They just leave the situation like nothing.\nPlease advice me on the situation. Thank you guys so much \ud83d\udc93",

        "selftext": "This latest installment of why $DGX is **still** the safest double up+ opportunity in the market will likely be my last update before earnings this month (baring eventful news). A lot of this will be regurgitation from Parts 1 and 2 because, well, most of what was discussed has been coming to fruition:\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies/)\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 2 - Electric Boogaloo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dtqk/dgx_quest_diagnostics_pt_2_electric_boogaloo/)\n\n**TL;DR again** \\- $DGX is now over 8% higher since DD Pt. 2 earlier this month. The stock and associated calls are still trading at very reasonable amounts, continuing to make $DGX the safest double up+ play in the market. **During their Investor Day earlier in March, they doubled both LT Revenue and EPS CAGR guidance. They also confirmed they will be repurchasing $900 MILLION in shares in the FIRST HALF of this year. This will reduce their float by over 5%.** That is material. Now consider 90% of float is owned by institutions. Then add in all EPS guidance given for Q1 and Q2 does NOT factor in repurchases. Blah blah blah ROCKETS.\n\n**Positions** \\- I've given my positions every single time, yet some smucks demanded a screenshot. Why how much $ I have in these positions matters is beyond me. Either I tickled your balls enough during the DDs to invest or I didn't. Anyway, here's a **consolidated** view (100% options), which is drastically understated ($10k+ both gains and total value) because Ally's platform has become unreliable hot garbage:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5gb2taxvojq61.jpg?width=3480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb95029912abbf651f90edff2079c88361902d4b\n\nOpen: May 21 $125, $130, $135. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160\n\nAs previously mentioned, I also have another $50k stock and a small amount of options in my other account with TD. I will be moving all of my holdings to TD eventually because Ally has become completely broken over the past year and their customer service is non existent. **Just a PSA to AVOID ALLY.**\n\n**The new stuff:**\n\n* Most important - March Investor Day LT Revenue and Earnings CAGR increase and MASSIVE share repurchase timing: [**https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-updates-strategic-growth-114500393.html**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-updates-strategic-growth-114500393.html)\n   * This improved LT outlook has yet to be reflected in any new \"analyst\" price targets\n* Acquired Mercy's outreach lab services. Like I said, they will be using their piles of $$$ to make acquisitions. Especially as smaller labs run out of runway as the pandemic slows down. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-mercy-broaden-access-140700481.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-mercy-broaden-access-140700481.html)\n* Struck deal with Zora Biosciences' to further efforts to enhance direct to consumer self testing offerings. A key growth focus for them is self testing of all kinds in the future:  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zora-biosciences-licenses-ceramide-technology-130400471.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zora-biosciences-licenses-ceramide-technology-130400471.html)\n   * [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/quest-sees-direct-to-consumer-testing-taking-off-post-pandemic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/quest-sees-direct-to-consumer-testing-taking-off-post-pandemic)\n* As previously noted in earlier DDs, analysts were drastically overestimating the Q1 drop off in COVID testing expected. Public data shows daily testing remains absurdly high. In fact, the lowest testing day so far in Q1 is still higher than the highest day from May-Oct 2020. The overall Q1 daily average remains over DOUBLE that period as well. Heck, even Quest's own press release indicates COVID testing remains absurdly high through March (Q1) for them specifically: [https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates](https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates)\n* On top of the $50billion in stimulus, $DGX will also be a primary provider of testing services upon school re-openings: [https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/K-12-NTAP.pdf](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/K-12-NTAP.pdf)\n\n**Some important stuff from the previous DDs because God knows you still didn't click the links above:**\n\n* Based on management's own conservative EPS forecasts (**excl repurchases**), a PE of 10 at mid year results in a share price of $144. This is the absolute floor target. They also announced unprecedented $2b in share repurchases for 2021, meaning they can repurchase over 16m shares at current levels. Their float is 133m shares, **BUT roughly 90% of that is owned by INSTITUIONS, leaving LESS THAN 16m** ***available*** **to public.** Assuming institutions continue to hold the majority of their shares (they will. it's a safe dividend stock), this stock will rocket by end of year.\n   * I have always expected a Q1 diluted EPS &gt; 4. I am currently projecting 4.2, which results in a TTM EPS of 14. Further, I anticipate roughly $3 EPS as the Q2 floor, resulting in a TTM EPS post Q2 of 15.63.\n   * This results in an EPS 20% above the high amount given in guidance, which again, was conservative and didn't account for share repurchases\n\nThe reason this stock constantly runs up into earnings and then ticks lower despite large beats is solely due to their base testing lagging behind typical performance due to COVID. The market is acting as if the COVID faucet will just get shut off in the snap of a finger (soon) and then the base testing will take time to return. Does this sound right to you? **This line of thinking is laughably absurd and na\u00efve.** Reasons:\n\n* After a year of this shit, there is a massive backlog of people/procedures that will be completed after more of the pop is vaccinated. We haven't even seen a DGX Q performance with strong base testing AND COVID $$$ yet. Q1 of 2021 will be the first. Book it.\n* **Political climate / stimulus** \\- I'm sure you all saw the CDC is now \"recommending\" double masking. Hell, I've passed out four times writing this diatribe due to the 6 masks I'm wearing. Why does this matter? For every bit a person feels the previous admin downplayed COVID, the new admin is going 100% the opposite direction. Considering the US is going to continue to pump trillions into the economy, you can bet your ass all testing companies will benefit. There will definitely be huge grants/subsidies for enhanced serology procedures and research....and of course in analyzing COVID further. These testing companies have so much COVID data that will continue to be poured over as the pandemic lessens. You can also bet there will be an increased $ focus on scanning/checking for new viruses in the near future.\n* **$$$$$$$** \\- Do you think DGX is just going to light the enormous $$$ they've made over the past 9 months and will continue to make for 2021 on fire? Because that's what the current stock price/growth reflects. When in reality and in addition to the buybacks, they will be targeting acquisitions and investing heavily in serology capabilities/analysis and self testing expansion.\n\n**Price Expectations by EOY:**\n\n* Worst case - $150. Yea, I'm serious. Baring a market meltdown driven by Biden's tax policy, this baby is a lock.\n* Best case - $200\n\n**Important Dates:**\n\n* Ex-Dividend date this FRIDAY 4/2\n* Q1 Earnings 4/22\n\n**Disclaimer:** I'm a rando on a message board, yada yada yada, not investment advice. Ally SUCKS as a brokerage. Use someone else. Long live GME.",
