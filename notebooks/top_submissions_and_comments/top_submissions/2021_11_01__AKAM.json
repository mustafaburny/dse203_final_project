        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 3, 2021**\n\nThe market continued its march higher, with all three major indexes remarkably posting fresh intraday highs. The market gapped up in the last few hours of the session after the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monthly monetary policy decision, which came in exactly how market participants wanted. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out in a big way today, finally breaking the $234.5 resistance it was battling with all year. Overall a great day for the markets. \n\nAs was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. \n\nThe Fed said in a statement, \u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nThe best part, and what propelled markets higher the last hour of market, was that the Fed\u2019s decision did not come with an updated timeline regarding the interest rate.\n\nStill, the persistently hotter-than-expected inflationary pressures in the recovering economy have put the Fed in a difficult spot when it comes to waiting on rate hikes, many economists argued. These elevated levels of inflation might push the Fed to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed, some maintained. And in the Fed's latest policy statement Wednesday, the central bank slightly updated its remarks on inflation, saying that \"Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory.\" In September, the Fed had said inflation was \"elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors.\" \n\nIn a later press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said of current inflationary pressures, \u201cThe inflation that we\u2019re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It\u2019s due to bottlenecks and it\u2019s due to shortages and it\u2019s due to very strong demand meeting those. We don\u2019t see troubling increases in wages, and we don\u2019t expect those to emerge.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that there is further ground to cover in regards to maximum employment, one of the fundamental data points the Fed looks at when deciding policy. Powell said, \u201cIt is time to taper we think because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals measured for last December. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s time yet to raise interest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment both in terms of employment and terms of participation.\u201d\n\nOn a personal note, I want to say I commend the Fed for successfully avoiding another taper tantrum, like the one we saw in 2013 when the markets went into meltdown after the Fed announced they would begin to taper QE. In the end the fears were massively overblown. I saw a lot of fear mongering regarding tapering this time around glad that was avoided.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) stock was on the rise today again after Uber announced Tesla cars will be available to buy or lease as part of a green initiative for the ride-hailing company\n* Netflix (NFLX) announced that subscribers with Android phones or tablets can start playing mobile games on its app, an effort by the company to push into gaming.
