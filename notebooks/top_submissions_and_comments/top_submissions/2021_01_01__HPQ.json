        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\n# Low IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays!\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit. If you want to see the full list and filter by ticker, check out the tool in the link at the top.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|Market Cap|Stock Price|IV (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|WORK - Slack Technologies Inc - Class A|20.7B|$42.24|9%|\n|SPY - SSgA Active Trust - SSGA SPDR S&amp;P 500|330B|$373.88|16%|\n|VZ - Verizon Communications Inc|243B|$58.75|18%|\n|PEP - Pepsico Inc.|205B|$148.42|19%|\n|TM - Toyota Motor Corporation - ADR|252B|$154.57|20%|\n|COST - Costco Wholesale Corp|167B|$376.75|20%|\n|WMT - Walmart Inc|408B|$144.15|21%|\n|PG - Procter &amp;
