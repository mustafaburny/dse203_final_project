        "selftext": "Look retards. I've been burned by so many DD's in the past, trying to 4x+ the measly 1k in disposable YOLO funds chasing DraftKings, NIO, AMC, tons of bullshit that I would research for 30 minutes and then pray, hit the yahoo message boards to see what the grandparents were saying, and watch my position piss itself down to $0. Typical high risk behavior that I've spent my entire life engaging in. I had no idea what I was doing and suffered from confirmation bias in my research. Moving on. \n\nTLRY has earnings upcoming on the 10th. I work as an engineer in the commercial cannabis space, and retail and commercial grow ops are booming. Consumers are buying more cannabis, more frequently, and care more about quality with a generalized concern for lung health. Federal and international governments are looking for ways to generate revenue and Tilray is well positioned to be a huge international distributor. Transportation costs are down, storage costs are down, testing costs are down, material costs are down, industry consolidation is happening rapidly and large license and building assets are being acquired rapidly by the leaders (which was their plan all along).\n\nEarnings on the 10th are expected to show a $0.27 loss per share. I think they'll beat these estimates by 30%\n\nShort position as of July is 22 million shares or \\~%20 off the float, expecting a huge short squeeze before earnings\n\nHigher realized margins, APHA confirmed record sales in the last 10 days and I expect TLRY to follow suit. Higher margins + competitors in space beating forecasted earnings \n\nBrendan Kennedy is a Silicon Valley billionaire who I'd let be my step dad.\n\nPosition 8/21 $10c purchase at open tomorrow. Look to ride up rest of week for that 3-4x bagger as the price moves to $11-12 before earnings with potential to jump to $20 if EPS is beat by more than 20%.",

        "selftext": "Listen here you degenerates. Cinemark ($CNK) popped 11% today on news of movie theaters reopening around the country. Apparently AMC is reopening this weekend and [tickets are sold out EVERYWHERE](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/amc-reopen-movie-theaters-sold-out-adam-aron). Bmark companies upgraded from Hold to Buy today with a PT of $18 and says \"We are optimistic that movie-goers will return to the theaters over the next several months and that over merdium term CNK can return to historical performance levels.\" Consensus price target is at $16.25, so upside from here, especially since it hit $20 during the middle of the fucking pandemic in June. Before today, valuation butchered the stock (down 72% from 52-week high)... so now is THE entry point.\n\nLast weekend CNK represented 10% of US theater open and generated 40% of the box office. CNK survey of its consumers reports 50% would feel safe returning to the theater within 1 month and 75% within 3 months.\n\nEven if you assume 60-70% capacity upon wider theater openings, CNK should be at least \\~$20/share, given CNK was $40/share a peak price. No one talked about it here today so thought I'd drop some knowledge. OH and also fuck $AMC - consensus price target on that shits like $3 and it was already at $5 before the run-up today.\n\n$12.5C 9/18",

        "selftext": "AMC is beginning it's reopen on Aug 20th. Since the news was announced 2 days ago, the stock has risen 20%. AMC is doing a \"special promotion / grand reopening\" only charging $0.15 on the first day of re opening.  \n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/13/media/amc-reopening-ticket-prices/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/13/media/amc-reopening-ticket-prices/index.html) \n\nAMC taking the first shot in the dark will pave the way for CNK. They are essentially advertising for CNK. People will quickly get familiar with the idea of going to the movies. Sure, some people will remain in fear about the idea, but AMC is starting off with a 30% capacity. They are also requiring customers to wear mask during the movie unless you are eating/drinking. Here's the thing. You are not suppose to be talking during the movies anyways. Food is ordered before walking into the theater. Other chains like alamo drafthouse have a system where you write your order on a paper slip, and your waiter swoops by to snag it. There's no speaking involved. \n\nWhat I am getting at is... being that there's no talking in theaters, transmission of C-19 is extremely low risk as long as they sanitize properly in between showtimes. Currently, AMC is requiring you to wear a mask.  This could sound annoying and uncomfortable to some people and discourage them, but this is phase 1. I speculate this requirement wont last long for reasons mentioned above. \n\nFinally, Cinemark is down 62%, it's has plenty of room to recover. Now that the first steps of reopening in the industry are finally being made, it makes for a bet with high upside / low downside. Since AMC's announcement, CNK has only gotten a little boost from AMC's news, so we're early to the party. Another plus, calls are cheap. Oh and this is the theater we all know and love, not a damn mattress company. \n\nPosition: LEAPS\n\nEDIT: It took me way too long to write this, the stock i taking off this morning.",

        "selftext": "Sup men. Most industries have more than recovered from their march lows and most of us retards have missed out on those gains. That said, there's a few companies out there that are still near march lows that have potential for a rebound and I think CNK is one of them. \n\nCinemark Theatres is the third largest operator in North America behind AMC and Regal Entertainment Group. Unlike AMC, Cinemark is not overburdened with debt and has stated that even in the event of indefinite theatre closures, they have enough cash runway to last until late 2021.  \n\nAs of a couple days ago, AMC announced they were reopening theatres across the country and Cinemark followed suit a day later with a phased re-opening announcement. As of now, theatres will only be showing \"classics\" but they are slated to begin showing new movies in the coming weeks. Obviously this is very fluid situation and they might get shut down on any news. \n\nInsider ownership, unlike AMC, is also a plus. You can check the details yourself, but basically during this whole pandemic, only 5k shares have been sold and millions worth have been bought up. The CEO, Mark Zoradi, bought 10k shares at 25ish right along the time all of us MSFT 2/28 200c were getting fucked. He then bought more when the price was half of what he paid weeks earlier. \n\nAnyways, yes, there's a bearish argument to the future of theatres. I also believe that direct to consumer media is going to royally fuck them but not to the extent where the average American consumer would be willing to let them go. Add on the covid uncertainty and theatres are in a shit situation short and long term. No doubt about that. \n\nCNK is currently trading just below 13. I'm personally long on this with shares because I'm unsure the furthest leaps being sold (MAR 2021) give CNK enough time for a recovery, especially if shit gets worse this winter. But I do believe they'll eventually make a comeback. Just my two cents.",

        "selftext": "Might take a few quarters to recover. Not sure I'd try to catch this falling knife today...\n\n**Oppenheimer:**\u00a0\"Alteryx delivered 2Q results ahead of lowered expectations, with solid new customer additions and continued traction with G2K accounts (137% retention rate). However, persistent COVID-19/macro headwinds weighed on customer behavior negatively impacting expansion/renewal activity, deal sizes, and sales cycles. With no visibility into the timing of a recovery, management is taking action to improve execution (sales training, resource reallocation), support customer needs (adoption licenses), and maintain profitability (S&amp;M optimization, profit/growth balance). While the shares will come under pressure near-term, our long-term view is unchanged, and we remain positive seeing Alteryx as strongly positioned to capitalize on multiple secular trends (digitization, automation, AI/ML...). Adjusting estimates based on results/guidance and lowering PT to $180 (from $190). Maintain Outperform.\"\n\n**Needham:**\u00a0\"AYX reported mixed 2Q20 results as revenue and EPS were ahead of consensus, but guidance introduced for 3Q and FY20 revenue was well behind. Although FY20 revenue guidance implies a material growth slowdown at the mid-point, we believe the biggest component that is creating a headwind may be a tougher compare created by increased duration in 2H19. Importantly, management introduced ARR guidance of \\~30% growth, which we believe may serve as a better metric for growth since it normalizes for differences in revenue recognition between licenses and terms. Although mgmt acknowledged that AYX is facing longer sales cycles and is now selling shorter duration licenses (which may be a small component of guidance), we continue to believe AYX's organic growth remains well ahead of its implied guidance. Reiterate BUY rating and adjust our PT to $172.\"\n\n**Goldman:**\u00a0\"The combination of ongoing macro pressures from COVID and a financial model with mostly upfront revenue recognition caused a steep deceleration in F2Q revenue to 17%, down from 43% in F1Q, with guidance for a further deceleration to 9% (at midpoint) in F3Q and implied F4Q growth of -8%. Customer buying patterns were irregular in the quarter and didn\u2019t follow an upward linear trend; as a result, we think it will take many quarters for new bookings growth to return to pre-COVID levels. However, we were encouraged to see that ARR still grew 40% in F2Q; management expects ARR to still grow &gt;30% at the end of the year. With strong interest in the quarter in adoption licenses (short-term trials), which were up 60% y/y, we are optimistic that these customers could start to scale up business next year and lead to a recovery in ARR (and revenue growth). Due to the disappointing outlook, our FY20/21 revenue estimates come down by 12%/8%, and our PT goes to $195 from $216. We maintain a Buy rating on AYX shares.\"\n\n**DA Davidson:**\u00a0\"AYX reported a rough 2Q, with 3Q and 2020 guidance coming below consensus (and implied 4Q guidance calling for negative Y/Y growth), leading shares down 19% AMC. This was the result of COVID-19 headwinds, leading to longer sales cycles, smaller deal sizes, and higher spending scrutiny. In addition, AYX saw issues with sales onboarding and enablement. In response to COVID, AYX increased its use of adoption licenses and views COVID as a longer-term tailwind.\"",

Furthermore SPLK recent bounce was partly due to VO ETF inflows.\n\non 8/19 ESTC announced these two core features that will challenge SPLK\n\n&gt;**Elastic Announces A Single, Unified Agent And New Integrations To Bring Speed, Scale, And Simplicity To Users Everywhere**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;..................  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Elastic Observability  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Streamlining the entire data ingest process with simplified one-click ingestions using the beta of Elastic Agent and Ingest Manager Launching an observability overview page in Kibana that showcases all the data in a single datastore to support investigative workflows Adding OpenTelemetry integration in Elastic APM so users can explore without making any changes to their instrumentation Strengthening ties between DevOps and SecOps with more than 50 turnkey detection rules  \n&gt;  \n&gt;..............  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Elastic Security  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Delivering a beta of malware prevention on Windows and macOS and advanced detections and deep visibility for all major operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux Simplifying ingestion and providing deep data visibility for SIEM use cases with a beta of a unified agent to protect hosts on premises and in the cloud Offering a beta of out-of-the-box cloud security posture monitoring to help teams protect the cloud-enabled workforce without disruption Introducing a new integration with IBM Security's security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform, IBM Security Resilient Expanding data integrations across Microsoft Defender ATP, Windows PowerShell, and G Suite to bring deeper visibility to security teams\n\nIn hindsight,actually much easier to be long in this market, like buying calls for ESTC, but I can't help it I'm a proud \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b it feels unnatural to go by the week without a short.

        "selftext": "So I listened to the earnings call last week.. which, for the most part, went how I expected it to. However I learned about their plans to make money from video streams. I think they used the acronym PVOD or something of that sort. Anyhow this announcement didn't cause share prices to go up. No increase until they announced theaters opening back up on the 20th.\n      I'm curious to know people's opinions as to weather they think AMC making money off of streams will be positive for the AMC share value. Long or short term. and weather or not AMC is now looking Bullish.",
