        "selftext": "\\## **My history investing in college and my first month investing in February:**\n\nLearned about miners and blockchain validation with a chemical engineering friend before the rally.\n\n\\- Bought **XRP** at $.15 and $.25, sold at $3.28 (I valued at $4 or $5 dollars MAX in 10 years if blockchain found adoption)\n\n\\- Bought **AMD** after the rally at $11 because it was ridiculous how much cost efficiency they had introduced to the market to poor people like me unlike **NVIDIA** products which always seemed far removed and discouraged me.\n\n\\- I started with **Panasonic** because I had missed out on the window to invest in **Tesla** at 200-300 range. I believed **Panasonic** to be similar to **AMD's** relationship to **bitcoin**; while all eyes looked at the shiny object, I looked at the boring parts that built it.\n\n\\- The market crashed, so I DCA'd aggressively and controlled my emotions through out. I was more concerned with my performance to commitment rather than my returns at the time. I did well.\n\n\\- My investments in March 19 was **SQ** and **Lyft**\n\n\\## **My Strategy now that I have income**\n\n\\- I bought up to 5,000 dollars in stocks ranging from **FANUC** (industrial robotics) to **DENNYS** (logistics/real estate)\n\n\\- I trimmed down to $2,300 but will rapidly rebuild with a different approach:\n\n\\- I'm buying 1 stock in the company before making any further developments with. Following this, I will purchase ETFs in sectors that I **want** to see develop in the next 5-15 years. I will buy 1 stake into these ETFs and combine it with my 1 stock purchase to create the necessary offset.\n\n\\- For example, I bought 1 stock of **Texas Instruments**  for $109 followed by a purchase in **SOXX ETF** for semiconductors, which has the largest ETF allocation to **Texas Instruments.** I will apply similar logic to companies like **Facebook, Paypal,** etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I do this \"1 chip\" start in multiple industries because I want to pick some arbitrary point in time but I have a lot of industries &amp; ecosystems that I would like to reasonably participate in. This will still cost a lot of money to start off with and buys me time to study company numbers and outlooks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## **My current market sentiment**\n\n**-** I consider where you start on a graph as somewhat arbitrary and see the current market stability as somewhat of an exercise in game theory and rowing a boat throat a thick fog. I believe it's optimal to row cautiously forward and to not stay still. With cautious rowing, you'll be able to react appropriately if you are suddenly met by a waterfall or a path with clearer vision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am **\\`*****BEARISH\\`*** on Amazon in the long term. I believe that slowly, but surely, the market will consume Amazon's hold on its markets. I don't believe Amazon will maintain the status quo on cloud computing due to the quality of its competitors. I absolutely LOVE **Google Cloud Platform** and utilize **Firebase real-time database** very often. **Microsoft** has made some extremely important acquisitions recently in **Github and NPM - that's enormous.**\n\n\\-  I have suspicions about **Amazon** will struggle internationally. I don't know if Amazon will penetrate China the way China does, or if it will succeed in locations south of Mexico against things like **Mercado Libre**\n\n\\- I have suspicions that tech platforms will soon integrate in a meaningful way with financials. As in, the virtualization of stores and forwarded payments in places like the **Facebook(Visa) Market Place, Twitter(Square) payment sending, Paypal(honey) &amp; Amazon purchasing, Gaming credits, etc.**\n\n**-** I am \\`**bullish**\\` on Facebook. Facebook is utterly invaluable and scales globally. The reason it's adopted in **Mexico**, for example, is because it's cheaper and faster than other services. They also service millions of developers with **React** and its growing development ecosystem. They provide a standardized marketting platform for small businesses on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and soon to be JIO. I would not be surprised if they soon enter the fintech sector.\n\n\\- I am \\`**bullish\\`** on **Paypal**. They are seemingly repeating their previous success by servicing large online commerce that are upgrading their systems. **Honey/Paypal** will scrape coupons for Amazon and force organizations like Visa to compete with  **real-time financial services**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am **\\`bullish\\`** on cloud software and networking. I think **CDNs** and dedicated **services for Cybersecurity** will maintain. Sure Google provides these services but things like **Cloudflare** and **Fastly** have dedicated solutions to fast image processing, DDoS protection, and more that other platforms may not be able to **allocate their resources to**. **Cloudflare** has an enormous network, and **Fastly** provides a great system for you to enjoy content like **Reddit.** I think it's hard to miss the mark here - the highway of the internet is going to get faster and more assets will be maintained in the server's space - the ecosystem must grow with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am ***\\`EXTREMELY BEARISH***\\*\\*\\`\\*\\* on Beyond Meat. I've been vegetarian for 10 years. IT'S BAD. WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO BE EXCITED ABOUT AND WE'RE NOT USED TO HAVING ATTENTION. VEGETARIANS ARE LYING IF THEY SAY IT'S AMAZING. ***IT'S LITERALLY DOG FOOD***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am \\`**BULLISH\\`** on the long term development of **Mexico**. I think companies like **Kansas City Southern** that services **Mexican-American** relationships will grow well in the long run.\n\n\\- I am **\\`BULLISH\\`**  on Apple and Adobe. Amazing products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## **CURRENT HOLDINGS (ordered by priority &amp; checkup time):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GOOG &amp; AMZN exposure through tech ETFs** ::: priority FB\n\n**NVIDIA, AMD, Intel EXPOSURE through semiconductor ETFS** ::: priority Texas Instruments\n\n**Environmental Services exposure through Sanitation ETFS** ::: priority Waste Management\n\n**Adobe and AutoDesk exposure through cloud software ETFs** :: priority Adobe\n\n**Nintendo exposure through gaming ETFS ::** priority Nintendo\n\n**Cisco exposure through cloud networking and edge computing ETFS** Cicsco, Fastly, Cloudflare, etc\n\n**TELECOM networking ETFS** :: priority TMobile\n\n**Manufacturing technology, industrial sectors, and robotics exposure to**  Fanuc, ABB, Siemens, Sherwin-Williams, VW, GM, Nissan, Toyota, Panasonic,\n\n**Healthcare services ETF** :: priority Cigna\n\n**FB -- LONG**\n\n**PAYPAL --  LONG**\n\n**TEXAS INSTRUMENTS - LONG**\n\n**MSFT     --  LONG**\n\n**APPLE   --  LONG**\n\n**ADOBE -- LONG**\n\n**DISNEY -  LONG**\n\n**BITCOIN - LONG**\n\n**TMOBILE - 2 YEARS**\n\n**VISA -- 2 YEARS**\n\n**JPM - 2 YEARS**\n\n**TWITTER - 2 YEARS**\n\n**SQUARE - 1 YEAR**\n\n**LYFT - 1 YEAR**\n\n**FASTLY - QUARTERLY**\n\n**CLOUDFLARE - QUARTERLY**\n\n**1LIFE MEDICAL - QUARTERLY**\n\n**FIVERR - QUARTERLY**\n\n**DRAFT KING - QUARTERLY YEAR + CHICAGO POLITICS**\n\n**GROUPON - SPARE CHANGE JAR**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**## EXCITED TO ACQUIRE**\n\n**- ADOBE**\n\n\\- **QQQ**\n\n\\- **SHERWIN WILLIAMS**\n\n\\- **TOYOTA**\n\n\\- **KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN**\n\n\\-",

Another night of waking up every 45 minutes to see the price go down slightly, only to wake up 45 minutes later and see it higher than it was before the drop? This of course changes the cadence to waking up every 30 minutes to make sure that you see another red candle. \n\nAnother night of feverishly attempting to drain the stress out of the tip of you penis? It doesn\u2019t matter, you don\u2019t have to be that alert for your WFH job anyway, right? It\u2019s Friday and it\u2019s a slow day. You can squeeze in a nap or two. Plus, once you hit this big trade you\u2019re going to quit your job anyway.\n\nYour manager doesn\u2019t understand. He never will.  You\u2019re about one passive aggressive email asking you to do a task immediately that doesn\u2019t need to be done immediately from just quitting and traveling the world.

Prancing around in his stupid leather jacket, he doesn\u2019t even ride a motorcycle. He probably just made an instagram video of him talking about something that never happened so girls dm him.

However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares.

Last quarter's report [delivered an EPS surprise of 3.7%.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-cisco-csco-2020-05-01)\n* In February, when East Asia was being hit the hardest, Cisco saw [22 times the amount of network traffic per second it normally gets for its Webex service from users in China](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/cisco-webex-sees-record-usage-during-coronavirus-expansion-like-zoom.html)\n* Webex saw incredible growth in March, too, with registered attendees and hosted meeting minutes more than doubling to [324 million](https://blogs.cisco.com/news/easing-the-everyday-challenges-of-sheltering-in-place) and [14 billion](https://blogs.cisco.com/news/connected-and-secure-webex-in-todays-world), respectively. If even a fraction of that growth continued in April...\n* Okta, the enterprise SSO provider, indicates that March's number of unique users of Cisco's VPN software [peaked at 238% when compared to 28 days prior.](https://www.okta.com/businesses-at-work/2020/work-from-home)\n\nAll of this leads me to believe that estimates are quite low, and we'll see a pump before and following the announcement.\n\n$CSCO 45c 5/22",

        "selftext": "Amid the coronavirus bear market and imminent global recession, Cisco Systems (CSCO) remains one of the top U.S. tech companies in terms of cash on its balance sheet. As a result, Cisco stock provides an attractive dividend.     \n\n   \n\nCorporate spending on information technology was expected to plunge due to COVID - BUT IT HASN'T.\n\nThere's a long-term view. Cisco could go shopping once the dust settles and make the kind of big, transformational acquisition that some have been looking for.   \n   \n\n\nIn the January quarter, Cisco's fiscal second quarter, the company paid a cash dividend of $1.5 billion and bought back $870 million of its own shares. Cisco stock had some $27 billion in cash and equivalents. In 2019, Cisco reduced debt by some $5 billion. Heading into the April quarter, Cisco had about $12 billion remaining in a stock repurchase program.     \n    \n\n\nIn its glory days from a 1990 initial public offering through early 2000, Cisco thrived as a major supplier of the hardware to build internet networks, both to telecom firms and large companies outside that sector. Cisco stock soared more than 100,000% in that period, before the dot.com bubble burst.\n     \n     \n\nMore recently, after a breakout in October 2017, Cisco stock gained 70% through mid-July 2019.      \n    \n\n\n\nBut CSCO stock swooned in the latter half of 2019. It plunged like most tech stocks in the coronavirus-driven market correction. The upper echelon tech stocks are providing strong bounce backs to the rest of the market. CSCO should be no different, infact - with upside for more growth than the company has seen in the last 10 years. They're more diverse in cloud computing services, software, and equipment.   \n   \n\n  \n\n\nThe tech industry icon is shifting away from its core business of selling network switches and routers. With acquisitions, Cisco has aimed to increase revenue from software and services.     \n\n     \n   \n\nBefore the coronavirus emergency, management has stated that 30% of all revenue would come from software in fiscal 2020, up from 22% in 2017.      \n     \nTL;DR  \n05/29 50C   \n05/15 44C",

        "selftext": "Hello, as a new investor myself i thought this message might make you think before making rash decisions you may later go on to regret.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago while the markets were down i thought great, what a good time to invest. So i put some of my money onto a trading212 account and without even doing any research I bought contracts on crude oil without even knowing what the contracts meant. I did however, thanks to a reddit post realise my stupidity and got out of that quickly. \n\nI then thought right well i'll do some research and then re-evaluate. Now in my mind at this point doing research was simply browsing reddit, looking at what the general consensus was, seeing others portfolios and going off analysts. However, after doing that my portfolio was around 25 stocks big not even checking if they were overvalued or had a large amount of debt i just went for them because they were good companies imo. People commented say that this was way to many for a low amount of investment money (\u00a35000). So i sold all the ones i could but i had to leave some that were in the red hoping that they recover.\n\nThis is where i really did my research. I wanted to invest long term so i was looking for profitable companies, with a decent dividend and large growth potential and preferably little debt. For me I much prefer comparing number but i found flicking through webpage to webpage was hard to keep up with especially when comparing multiple companies. So i decided to create my own google sheets page, which imported companies data depending on the ticker and i did calculations to get other values (this took some time). This allowed me to get a much clearer picture of what the different companies futures were like. It looks at their margins, ROI, ROE, ROA, EPS (tts), 1 year EPS, D/E, trailing P/E, forward P/E, P/B, P/C, P/FCF, PEG, dividend information, stock information as well as graphs to see which way the market is going (roughly, i know it unpredictable). I also looked and thought about the future of the companies and how it might affect their price e.g. Sony and Microsoft with the new generation consoles.\n\nAfter doing all this i have to say i found myself addicted to analysis, i **LOVE** it, i've managed to narrow down my stocks to 9 so they are easily trackable and i only plan to invest small amounts at a time (around \u00a3500 a week) until a clearer idea can be gathered amount the current market.\n\nI would encourage any of you new investors to do the same, it may take some time but it is worth it in the long run. You will also feel much more confident in your picks once you have done this.\n\nStock Picks:\n\nVUSA - 25%\n\nMA - 10%\n\nJNJ - 10%\n\nMSFT - 10%\n\nCSCO - 10%\n\nABBV - 10%\n\nPEP - 10%\n\nLOW - 10%\n\nRTX - 5%\n\n(There are others that i'm watching that are currently overvalued imo so waiting to see what the month brings)\n\nPlease let me know what you think, if you have any questions or have any advice for me.\n\nThanks!:):)",
