        "selftext": "Let's say I'm trading in a cash account (Roth IRA), not margin.\n\nI want to open a long put debit spread.\n\nAs an example :\n\nBuy May 15 2450 Put at $123.20\n\nSell May 15 2150 Put at $56.60\n\nNet debit is $66.20\n\nWhen I preview the trade, E-Trade tells me that I don't have enough buying power for this, even though my buying power right now is $94,000. \n\nFrom what I understand with this spread, the worst case is that the SPX is above both strikes at expiration. Thus, the most I can lose is the net debit of $66.20 . Given that one contract is 100 options, a buying power of $6620 should be sufficient, and I am well above that.\n\nSince SPX options are European and settled in cash, there is no possibility that the the put option may be assigned early. And as long I hold on to the long put, my short put is always covered.\n\nSo why can't the broker accept this order ?  It seems to be insisting that my short put be covered only by cash, which would indeed cost $2150 x 100 or $215,000, which I indeed don't currently have in cash buying power. Ie. E-trade is ignoring the fact that there is a long put in the order.\n\nI can think of one reason why they do this :  \nIf I subsequently sell the long put, but hold on to the short put, then I would require the cash to be held. Why couldn't E-trade just prevent me from selling the long put alone in this case, if it's actually needed to cover the short put ? Ie. the brokerage should only allow closing the short position, or both positions, but not closing just the long position.\n\nIs there any other brokerage that will deal with this in a more flexible way in a cash account ? I'm not willing to use a taxable account due to being in a high tax bracket, and tax complications. And I don't have the appetite for using margin. The only way I want to use leverage is with options that are always covered.",

        "selftext": "I watched a show in my country about how to identify whether a base or bottom formation is taking place. I am writing a summary of it here so maybe it might be a little helpful to you. If not you can just ignore this. \n\nOk First we need to take into account the lowest closing of the index, in this case am taking S&amp;P 500. The lowest closing was 2237.40 on Mar 23. And to identify whether a base formation is happening or not, the first condition is that the index must close atleast 5% above the lowest closing level for the next 9 trading sessions. So 5% above in this case would be 2349.27 and the index has continued to close above 2349.27 everyday since so base formation is happening for sure. This is for Base Formation. Even if the conditions here are not met, for example if index closes below 5% above the lowest closing, the cycle begins again once it again closes minimum 5% above and continues to do so for 9 consecutive sessions after that. Now we move to Bottom Formation. \n\nNow we have to try to understand whether the low of 2237.40 was the bottom . Now nobody can predict the bottom and we're not trying to do that, we are trying to understand the probability that 2237.40 was the bottom or not and to do that, the condition here is that out of the 9 trading sessions following the lowest closing, one of the closing needs to be atleast 10% above the lowest closing, so 10% above 2237.40 so that would be 2461.14. So the first time we got a closing above that level was on March 25 of 2475.56. But the important thing is every consecutive closing after that should be above 2461.14 and so far S&amp;P 500 has given a closing above it. Another condition is out of the total 9 trading sessions following March 23, atleast 6 of the sessions must close in the positive. So far in the 6 trading sessions that have happened since, 4 has been a positive close and 2 have been negative so its quite important that in the next 3 trading sessions, atleast 2 are positive(this indicates market sentiment). And not only that but the next 3 trading sessions also must have a closing above 2461.14. If either of these conditions are not met then the probability that 2237.40 was THE low diminishes but if the conditions are met the PROBABILITY that 2237.40 was the low increases considerably. That's for Bottom Formation . So next 3 trading sessions are very important. If S&amp;P 500 closes below 2461.14 this week then the probability that March 23 was the bottom goes down so some of you who have FOMO will have another chance to get in at better valuations but if all conditions are met i.e. 2 positive closing and all closings above 2461.14 then 2237.40 was probably the bottom and some of you missed out on it and thats ok because future will always give you more opportunities so don't feel too bad.\n\nAnd finally this is something i watched on tv by a \"market expert\" who said he did a lot of research on 2001 and 2008 pattern before coming up with this theory so obviously please take with a handful of salt.",

But what I want to do is to find a charting software (preferably on web) (or mac), which allows me to see 10+ charts for \"different\" stocks at a time. Yes yes, I know I can just manually create 10 charts in tradingview and then organize them in different tabs. That is what I do now, but I want to see all on one screen...\n\nAnyone have any recommendations on that?",
