        "selftext": "Currently a lot of my portfolio is in semiconductors but mainly in pure play fabs like TSM and capital equipment providers like AMAT. Recently, I was thinking of investing in some fabless companies like AMD and NVIDIA. However I was wondering if these fabless companies face a risk from in house chip designs ie Apple, Amazon, Google, designing their own chips, such as Apple\u2019s M1. \n\nAs I understand it, AMD and NVIDIA\u2019s astronomical market caps are based in large part on the prediction that their chip designs will be widely adopted in data centers.

Wei said the company expects semiconductor supply to\u00a0remain tight into 2022, though it will ramp up production of microcontrollers by close to 60%, which will at least help reduce the chip shortage for its automobile clients, which include the likes of Ford\u00a0 ([**F**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/f)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=F), Tesla\u00a0 ([**TSLA**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/tsla)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=TSLA)\u00a0and others.\n\nRevenue in the current quarter is expected to rise to between $14.6 billion and $14.9 billion, in line with the $14.7 billion average of analyst estimates. TSMC\u2019s 2021 sales outlook is expected to surpass earlier estimates of\u00a020% growth in full-year sales. \n\n That, in turn, is expected to benefit the likes of Apple\u00a0 ([**AAPL**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/aapl)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=AAPL), one of Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s biggest partners, as well as the likes of Nvidia, Applied Materials and AMD, [which could ride the coattails of continued strong semi demand and higher prices](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chipmakers-taiwan-semiconductor-production-micron-nvidia-amd). \n\n \u201cYou know what is tiresome? The temporary decline of semis for no real reason just causes such angst as opposed to buying,\u201d TheStreet\u2019s Jim Cramer [noted in a recent Real Money column](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/jim-cramer-there-s-no-real-reason-why-the-semi-s-have-declined-15707510?puc=tst_sfi). This fabulous group is a ball of confusion until you look where they come from.\u201d \n\n Indeed, main chip and graphics cards makers as well as other semiconductor producers will continue to benefit from demand, particularly in computers and electronics, which Cramer noted make both semi makers and other peripheral computing equipment makers like Texas Instruments\u00a0 ([**TXN**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/txn)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=TXN), Analog Devices\u00a0 ([**ADI**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/adi)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=ADI), Broadcom\u00a0 ([**AVGO**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/avgo)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=AVGO)\u00a0and Marvell Tech\u00a0 ([**MRVL**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/mrvl)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=MRVL)\u00a0strong potential growth candidates.\n\nAnd not just lack of supply: Nvidia, which has been pegged a cryptocurrency play due its graphics cards being the equipment of choice for mining Ethereum, longer-term demand for advanced gaming, graphics and \"gamification\" of real-life applications used by consumers and businesses [make Nvidia an undervalued play](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/jim-cramer-what-q2-s-strongest-stocks-tell-us-about-this-bull-market-15702829), Cramer said.\u00a0\n\n\"Only one stock could possibly be called a perennial and that's the first and most obvious one, Nvidia, the artificial intelligence gaming platform company, two of the multiple ways I could have chosen to describe it.\"\n\nSeparately, Mizuho Securities on Thursday raised its one-year price target on Nvidia to $900 from $710. At last check, shares of Nvidia were up 0.15% at $794.85 in premarket trading.",

Our valuation model shows that profit margins are the second most important driver of company valuations today, behind only equity duration,\" said [David Kostin](https://news.yahoo.com/stock-market-faces-two-big-headwinds-goldman-sachs-183809756.html), Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist, in a new research note to clients.\u00a0\n\nKostin outlined 32 companies spanning the health care, industrial, materials, staples and information technologies sectors that have above average net profit margins and are likely to expand them further in 2021 (see below). The median return on these stocks year-to-date has tallied 14%.\u00a0\n\n[ Some companies have outsized potential to expand profit margins this year, says Goldman Sachs. ](https://preview.redd.it/07xk6nh60ua71.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fab78e909f3124688a84696179acb6a10305bc78)\n\nSome of the top-performing stocks include Old Dominion Freight Line, NortonLifeLock, Applied Materials, Seagate Technologies and Freeport-McMoran. All of these names are seen increasing their earnings in excess of 30% this year, compared to 19% for the S&amp;P 500 (excluding financials and utilities).\u00a0\n\nAnd all of them have outperformed the S&amp;P 500's year-to-date gain of 16%. Other stocks such as Netflix and Newmont Corporation have lagged the S&amp;P 500's year-to-date performance, but could be poised to return to favor among investors amid the prospect for each company's profit margins this year (see above chart).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"S&amp;P 500 margins notched a record high of 11.9% in 1Q 2021, though investors remain focused on the forward margin outlook given rising input costs,\" Kostin explains.\u00a0\n\nStrategists are banking on more than the 32 companies outlined by Goldman to expand profit margins this year. The only question is will companies sustain those gains into 2022 given uncertainties around inflation and taxes.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 is seen rising 11.2% over the next 12 months, according to analysis from FactSet. At the sector level, energy and materials are expected to show the largest gains in valuation (17.1% and 15.9%, respectively).\u00a0\n\n[***Brian Sozzi***](https://www.yahoo.com/author/brian-sozzi/) ***is an editor-at-large and*** [***anchor at Yahoo Finance***](https://finance.yahoo.com/videos/)***.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 6, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) reaching a fresh intraday high, driven higher by continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) opened at a new all-time high but was unable to hold onto the gains throughout the day and finished modestly lower while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell roughly 0.6%. Each of the major indexes had jumped to fresh record closing highs on Friday, propelled by the June jobs report that showed a healthy pace of recovery in the labor market but that did not suggest an overheating economy. \n\nLast week,  the US Department of Labor released the Job June report, which showed a stronger-than-expected acceleration in hiring, with non-farm payrolls rising by 850,000, the sixth straight month of gains. The unemployment rate however, ticked slightly higher to 5.9%. Here are the numbers\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** 850,000 vs. 720,000 expected and an upwardly revised 583,000 in May\n* **Unemployment rate:** 5.9% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.8% in May \n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.3% vs. 0.3% expected and a downwardly revised 0.4% in May\n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 3.6% vs. 3.6% expected and a downwardly revised 1.9% in May\n\nOil prices turned lower after recently climbing to a multi-year high amid a breakdown in discussion between the two largest members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in a gridlock over production cuts. The meeting, whose purpose was to increase output given an increase in demand for energy, yielded no decision. In response, Saudi Arabia raised the August official selling prices of all crude oil it sells to Asia, according to the state\u2019s oil producer Aramco. \n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Damien Courvalin said, \u201cAs negotiations continue, we estimate that most outcomes still implies higher prices in the coming months as the physical market tightens and with higher OPEC production that the group discussed needed by the global oil market next year. Price volatility will likely rise.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are waiting for the release of the Federal Open Market Committee's June meeting minutes (basically notes of what was discussed), which will help reveal central bankers' thoughts around adjusting monetary policy as the economic recovery matures. The June meeting had marked a notable shift in the Fed's outlook, with the central bank signaling as many as two rate hikes by 2023. Subsequent public remarks revealed a number of committee members were also warming to the idea of a sooner-rather-than-later move to taper the Fed's crisis-era asset purchase program. In my opinion, it is extremely unlikely that the Fed will signal any acceleration in the timeline regarding interest rates but will not be surprised if more members discussed tapering quantitative easing in the coming months. \n\nNext week, earnings season for the Q2 kicks off, with big banks scheduled to report first. Earnings are expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-laden consumers that are finally emerging from lockdown  thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" This would mark the fastest pace of earnings growth since Q4 of 2009. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Pentagon officials announced they terminated Microsoft\u2019s massive $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud-computing contract and said they would start fresh with a new project, putting an end to a yearslong initiative that was unpopular in Congress and mired in litigation from Amazon (AMZN). In terminating the contract, officials said they focused largely on technical reasons, saying advances in cloud-computing in recent years have made JEDI obsolete. AMZN stock rocketed up roughly 5% on the news. \n* Grubhub announced it plans to roll out food-delivering robots across US college campuses starting this fall. Seen a lot of reports about the growing influence of automation in deliveries. Recently, Dominos Pizza also announced it was rolling out an automated delivery robot. \n* Lots of news surrounding Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi. Last week, the company went public on Thursday, however, over the weekend the Chinese government, in another crackdown of a large tech company, ordered Didi removed from app stores, citing cybersecurity complaints. Now there are reports coming out that Didi pressed ahead with the IPO despite the CCP suggesting the company delay due to \u201csecurity concerns\u201d. Shares were down roughly 19%. \n* The Chairman of Weibo, which is basically like the Twitter of China, and a state investor are reportedly in talks to take the company private in a deal worth $20 billion and help facilitate the exit of major shareholder Alibaba (BABA). A lot of news coming out of China regarding big technology companies. \n* Ford Motor (F), which has probably been hurt the worst by the recent chip-shortage, said it only has 162,100 trucks and cars in dealer inventories, half what it was three months ago and roughly one-quarter the stock the company usually has. \n* **Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by JP Morgan from $165 to $170 at Overweight. Stock currently around $141\n* Analog Devices (ADI) target raised by KeyCorp from $195 to $200 at Overweight.

Stock currently around around $828 and has been on a monster run\n* Nordson (NDSN) target raised by DA Davidson from $250 to $255 at Buy. Stock currently around $218\n\n\u201cThe green reed which bends in the wind is stronger than the mighty oak which breaks in a storm.\u201d - Confucius",
