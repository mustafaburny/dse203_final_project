        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, March 2, 2021**\n\nStocks retreated on Tuesday, pulling back after rallying yesterday, underscoring how volatile the market is right now. Market participants continue to focus on the Treasury yields, a new coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and additional stimulus from Washington. \n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we\u2019ll have a robust and ultimately complete \\[economic\\] recovery.\u201d Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell\u2019s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. \n\nOver the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.

In a note to clients, S3 Analytics said, \u201cRKT\u2019s stock price and short selling activity is reminiscent of another recent high flying meme stock \u2013 GameStop Inc (GME).
