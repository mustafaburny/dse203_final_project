        "selftext": "I\u2019ve only been dabbling in invest for the past 12mths, and obviously with all the recession talk, China trade deal etc, I think everyone is a little nervous.\n\nBut ultimately I believe the world is becoming more of a cashless society, and it\u2019s so easy with mobile payments etc, I believe it\u2019s inevitable that this whole sector will sky rocket.\n\nI currently have positions in V , PYPL , SQ and taking more of a gamble on PAYS.\n\nI\u2019m looking for thoughts on  taking my positions in the above stocks noted, and investing in the IPAY ETF which would give me coverage on those stocks plus others like M, AXP, GPN, FIS, FISV, DFS and a few more?,\nOr Keep my individual stocks and add to my portfolio like M , GPN etc when or if they ever have a dip?\n\nAnd help would be greatly appreciated, cheers",
