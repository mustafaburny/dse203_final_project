        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been pouring over stocks that are reporting next week (election week I know) and there are a lot of great opportunities, especially given recent market weakness. The one that caught my attention, over other good candidates like SKWKS, GDDY, TMUS and QCOM, was ZYNGA. \n\nIt\u2019s the largest mobile videogame maker in the US. With a TAM of around 2 billion people globally. \n\n\nZynga sales are forecasted to grow 42% in 2020 to $2.23 billion. Which outpaces larger game makers like TTWO, EA and ATVI. They\u2019re also not reliant on big hits like a lot of major console players. \n\nAnalysts also expect net income of $377 million or .35 per share for this year, up 45% from last year. \n\nThe company went public in 2016 at $10 a share and is currently trading at $8.99. It trades at less than 4x sales estimates vs. 6.3x for ATVI, EA, and TTWO and  23x vs 25x for peers despite a more-reliable and generally faster-growing earnings stream.\n\nThis is why I think ZNGA is both a phenomenal growth stock AND one that trades at a value compared to its peers. \n\nPosition to be opened on Election Day: 100x 11/6 10c \n\nObviously super  risky.

        "selftext": "Going to keep this simple. EDIT: this isn\u2019t simple and I should write a short story on this.\n\nI am generally risk averse. I hate losing $100 at the casino, I hate paying extra for guac at chipotles, I will return something or price match an item for a few dollars of savings. I am generally frugal.\n\nBut, I somehow had no issues losing 10k in options...\n\nHow I started\n\nI remember my first trades like they were yesterday. I was trading the first hydrogen run-up in 2014 (FCEL, BLDP, PLUG) and made a few hundred dollars over a couple weeks.\n\nI quickly progressed to penny stocks / biotech binary events and general stock market gambling mid-2014. I was making a few % here and there but the trend was down in total account value. I was the king of buying the peak in run-ups.  I managed to make it out of 2014 close to break-even to slightly down.\n\nWSB Era\n\nMarch 2015 was my first option trade. It was an AXP - American Express - monthly option trade. I saw one of the regular option traders/services post a block of 10,000 calls that had been bought for 1.3 and I followed the trade with 10 call options for a total of $1300.\n\nI woke up the next day to an analyst upgrade on AXP and was up 50% on my position. I was addicted! I day-dreamed for days about my AXP over night success. I think around that time there was some sort of Buffet buyout of Heinz and an option trade that was up a ridiculous amount of %%%. I wanted to hit it BIG.\n\nI came up with the idea that all I needed to reach my goal was a few 100% over night gains/ 1k&gt;2k&gt;4k&gt;8k&gt; etc. I convinced myself that I would have no problems being patient for the exact criteria that I had set and worked on some other trades.\n\nRemember, the first win is always free. \n\nI was trading options pretty regularly from March 2015 until August 2016. During my best week I was up 20k and could feel the milli within reach. I can remember the exact option trade (HTZ) and I was trading weeklies on it.\n\nFor those who have been in the market long enough, you will remember the huge drawdown of August 2015. \n\nI lost half my account value on QCOM calls (100 of them) that I followed at the beginning of July and never materialized. I watched them eventually go to 0. It was another 10,000 block that was probably a hedge or sold.\n\nIn August 2015 there were some issues with China and all of us woke up to stocks gapping down huge.  Unfortunately my idea of buying far dated calls during the following days/weeks after the crash went sideways. I quickly learned that an increase in volatility causes a rise in option prices and I was paying a premium for calls that were going to lose value very quickly (the infamous IV crush).\n\nI kept trading options into the end of 2015 and managed to maintain my account value positive but the trading fees for the year amounted to $30,000+. My broker was loving it.\n\nI tried all the services, all the strategies. I created rules for my option plays:\n1. No earnings\n2. Only follow the big buys at a discount (10,000 blocks or more).\n3. No weekly options\n4. Take profit right away\n5. Take losses quickly\n6. etc.\n\nI had a whole note book of option plays that I was writing down and following. I was paying for option services that all of you know about - remember, they make money on the services and not trading.\n\nI even figured out a loop-hole with my broker: if I didn\u2019t have enough money in my account, I could change my ask price to .01 and then change it to market buy and I would only need to accept a warning \u26a0\ufe0f for the order to go through. I was able to day trade the option and make money, who cares if I didnt have enough? After a few months of this, I got a call from my broker that told me to stop and that I would be suspended if I continued with this.\n\nBy the way, I was always able to satisfy the debit on the account - so it wasn\u2019t an issue of lack of funds.\n\nLost it all. Started taking money from lines of credits, every penny that I earned and losing it quicker and quicker. \n\nI was a full on gambler but I was convinced that 8 trades would offset all the losses. I kept getting drawn in to the idea that I could hit a homerun and make it out a hero.\n\nI eventually hit rock bottom on some weekly expiring FSLR options that I bought hours before expiration and said to myself - what the f are you doing? I resolved to invest for the long term and stop throwing tendies away.\n\nThe feeling was reinforced during the birth of my first born and I thought - what a loser this kid will think of me if he knew how much I was gambling and wasting my life. It was a really powerful moment looking at my kid and reflecting on this idea.\n\nI decided at that point I was going to save every penny I had and invest it on new issues with potential. \n\nFall 2016\n\nTTD, COUP and NTNX IPO \u2018ed I decided I was going to throw every dollar at these and did so for the next few months. I eventually started using margin (up to 215%) and buying these for the next 6 months. They paid out and managed to make it over 100k within the year. \n\nThe first 100k was hard but once I crossed it, I never fell below this magic number.\n\n2017 - I did some day trading but it was mostly obsessing over the above issues. I did gamble on a few options here and there but never more than 1k.\n\n2018 - SFIX was my big winner, I bought a gap up in June 2018 and my combined account value had crossed 400k by August 2018. I was really struggling at crossing the 500k account value and experienced 3 x 30-40% drawdowns over the next 2 years before I finally crossed the 500k barrier and have never looked back.\n\nI still made some mistakes over the next few months - AKAO &amp; GSUM come to mind. Both of these resulted in 20k+ losses. Fortunately my winners were much bigger than my losers.\n\nI thought about giving up and moving to index funds - but i was doing well - just experiencing large drawdowns because of leverage. \n\n2019 big winners were CRON SWAV STNE. \n\n2017 / 2018 / 2019 all had six digit capital gains on my tax returns. \n\nAt the beginning of 2020 I was still day trading on margin (180-220%) and got a call from my broker that they were tightening up my margin as my account was analyzed by the risk department and deemed too risky. Believe it or not this was right before the covid crash. I brought my margin down to 100-110% of account value and even though the drawdown from covid hit hard, I wasn\u2019t wiped out. \n\nI stayed the course and bought FSLY / RH during the big march drawdown and this resulted in some nice gains over the next few months.\n\nI am constantly changing and testing my investment strategy but let me tell you that obsessing over 1 or 2 ideas and throwing every penny at it and holding for a few years is the best strategy. It may not work at some point but right now it does.\n\nI still day trade but I trade with 10k or less on each individual position. It allows me minimize my losses and my winners are 1-7%. I am able to consistently make between 3-700$/ a day on day trades using the above strategy. I still take losses and still dream about hitting it big with an option trade but dont feel the need to put it all on the line every month / week.\n\nI finally crossed into the two , club. I know people are going to ask for proof or ban but I am not earning anything for posting and the details about some of the trades should be proof enough that I kept a detailed journal of it all. I have way more to write but these are the highlights.\n\nEventually I will share how I build a position in a story I love. I still sell buy and sell to early but I am working on improving. \n\nTL:DR - I gambled, lost it all and gambled some more lost more. I made it out alive. I have only sold calls/puts lately. \n\nThe one common denominator in all successful people is how much they obsess over 1 or 2 ideas. Do the same.  All the winners on this sub have gone all in on one idea (FSLY / TSLA ). Stick with new stories or ones that are changing and go all in...wait a second, I didnt learn anything.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 2nd, 2020.\n\n# **Investors are hoping for a clear presidential and Senate election outcome to end the sell-off  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/30/investors-are-hoping-for-a-clear-presidential-and-senate-election-outcome-to-end-the-sell-off.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The best hope for markets in the week ahead is that there is a clear cut winner in Tuesday\u2019s presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; The election looms large as the biggest wild card risk for markets, and there is a real concern that no outcome could lead to a period of uncertainty and turbulence for markets and the economy. On the other hand, some strategists say a clear winner and quick concession by the other candidate could lead to a relief rally. Also a worry is that Senate elections could be unresolved, which means it may not be known which party holds the majority.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf there\u2019s no clear winner, it will be negative for risk assets...The market is really worried about not having clarity after the election. They\u2019re worried about it dragging out four weeks as the results are contested,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. \u201cThe overall landscape is not a political one. It\u2019s that we\u2019re in a pandemic, and we don\u2019t want an uncertain election outcome that leaves the country concerned about leadership.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks closed out October on a sour note, losing about 6% for the week, the worst performance since March, when the pandemic first shut down the economy. Strategists say the coronavirus is again worrying the market, as major European countries go into partial lockdowns, and the U.S. faces record numbers of new cases.\n*****\n&gt; Lyngen said he does not expect the markets to react as much if it\u2019s only the fate of the Senate that is undetermined. But that is still very important, and if it\u2019s not clear which party has a majority for days or even weeks, that would cast doubt on the ability of whichever candidate wins the presidency to pursue their policy agenda.\n*****\n&gt; # Senate key for stimulus\n&gt; The Senate is also key to how much money will be poured into the economy to help battle the impact of the virus. For instance, if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the White House, but Democrats do not reclaim the Senate, he will likely have to compromise on a smaller stimulus package and would not be able to implement tax increases. If President Donald Trump is re-elected and faces a newly Democratic Senate alongside the Democratic House, he will likely face push back on many issues though they may agree on a large stimulus package.\n*****\n&gt; As of Friday, Biden was leading Trump in the polls by 7.8 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of major polls. Democrats also appear likely to take the Senate, but some races are very tight.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America strategists note that the Senate races are close with a few seats that could flip. Seven Republican seats are currently rated as toss-ups with four in battleground states, where they could be lost if there\u2019s a strong Democratic surge. There could also be a clear majority, but still uncertainty in terms of final makeup.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe overall composition of the Senate is unlikely to be determined until sometime in January due to election rules in Georgia which stipulates the race goes to a run off if no candidates garners 50% majority in the general election and currently no candidate is projected\u201d to hit that threshold, the BofA strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; The strategists say the timing of the results is unclear due to early voting but high volumes of mail-in ballots, which cannot be counted in some states until election day.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cA short delay in the election result should have a trivial impact on the economy but a multi-week contested election could drag down H1 GDP growth by 0.5-1.0 pp,\u201d according to BofA strategists. \u201cOnce there is a winner, the focus turns to stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Watch bond yields\n&gt; That could mean bond yields will continue their move higher in the coming week. Yields have been rising on the idea that there will be some kind of stimulus after the election, and it will mean more U.S. debt and higher interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe expect rates to shift higher by 5 to 25 bps after the election outcome is known due to expectations for fiscal stimulus and improved growth prospects,\u201d the BofA strategists wrote. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 0.86% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; However, if the election outcome is not known for awhile, the strategists said a contested outcome could push the 10-year yield materially lower.\n*****\n&gt; If there is a contested election, the strategist expect stocks to trade lower, but it would be a buying opportunity since the market typically recovers from headline-related losses within six months.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe expect a clear outcome to be neutral to positive for the market in the near term, except under a Biden win with a split Congress, which could potentially lead to continued gridlock in fiscal stimulus talks,\u201d the BofA strategists added.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the election, there is also a Fed meeting, expected to end Thursday with no new announcements though it is likely the Fed will emphasize it will keep policy easy for a long time as the economy heals. The October employment report is expected on Friday and is expected to show continued job gains, after September\u2019s 661,000 nonfarm payrolls.\n*****\n&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equities strategist at Credit Suisse, does not expect the market to react much if the election outcome is as expected, with Biden winning and Democrats taking the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe most likely outcome is already discounted by the market. The best assumption is if you don\u2019t have a big surprise, the market should do nothing,\u201d Golub said, adding the most volatile week could be the one just ending. \u201cThis week is the one with the turmoil, and I don\u2019t think the next week is the one where the market\u2019s going to be crazy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said investors may be too worried about the election being unresolved and the real issue disturbing the market this past week is the growing spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s no rule we need to declare a victor,\u201d said Golub. \u201cWe have four or five weeks. The market may not love that near-term indecision, but the system is set up to allow for it, and as long as things don\u2019t go off the rails, and they really shouldn\u2019t, this concern about a contested election is probably overblown as an investor issue.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said there\u2019s a greater chance that the winner of the presidency is known before the Senate. \u201cThe chances are that we\u2019ll at least know directionally where the power sits, but that could take a little longer and the market may be a little uncomfortable with that,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings reports\n&gt; Dozens of companies report earnings in the week ahead, and Golub said corporate profits are a bright spot for the market. The third quarter results so far are showing earnings down about 10%, compared to earlier forecasts of more than 20%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe reality is the economy is robust. 55% of the market cap of the S&amp;P has higher earnings in 2020 than in 2019. More than half the market is acting like there\u2019s no recession, no downturn,\u201d Golub said.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said both Trump and Biden would push for fiscal stimulus, but while the market is clear on where Trump stands it does not know that much about Biden, if he were to win. \u201cIt is going to take some time to get clarity on which of his policy initiatives are going to happen. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to implement these tax increases he\u2019s talking about right away. I think the economy is too frail,\u201d said Golub.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TQBrNag.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LrQZHOj.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/WbqKDDT.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zqi6l3G.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9q0jEby.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xGuEP7D.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2SrRdkk.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tCh05mj.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qOJdagC.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KhE54Ws.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rrDYFK6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QEbWDb7.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zBMyLqA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # November Almanac: Usually a Top Month in Election Years\n\n&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down \u201322.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ\u2019s second worst month on record\u2014only October 1987 was worse.\n\n&gt; November begins the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the \u201cBest Eight Months\u201d for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don\u2019t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950), NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 2000 (since 1979) month. November is best for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 1000 (since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/43b1cac3b88cfc6f79063d86ae9abfef/57e8d7f397fbeeb8-7f/s400x600/a8bff5e250ce7b9735197427f72d665b61fe0614.jpg))**\n\n&gt; November is a mixed bag in presidential election years. DJIA has advanced in 10 of the last 17 election years since 1952 with an average gain of 1.7%. Significant DJIA declines occurred in 2008 (-5.3%) and 2000 (-5.1%). For S&amp;P 500 November ranks best with a similar record to DJIA. NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 are not as strong ranking #7, #3 and #6 respectively. Fewer years of data (12 for NASDAQ and 10 for Russell indices) combined with sizable losses in 2000 and 2008 drag down rankings and average gains when compared to DJIA and S&amp;P 500.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Whatever the Outcome, Day Before Election Day Historically Bullish\n\n&gt; Looking back at the last seventeen presidential elections since 1952, the day before Election Day has a clear bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined just three times and average gains of 0.51% and 0.44% respectively. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly weaker, but still bullish. Election Day (or the day after prior to 1980) leans bullish, but with a greater frequency of losses. Incumbent party victories are shaded in light grey.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d030ea31abcb4bd298b596da0d2b2b4d/3d5b7e5afba3a9a5-14/s500x750/a8b43d243e3c57890dde8a0682726a1da587e5d2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # GDP Bounces Back\n\n&gt; The outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns triggered the largest quarter over-quarter decline in gross domestic product (GDP) since WWII, so perhaps it comes as no surprise that the following quarter tallied the sharpest rebound in that same time period. GDP expanded 33.1% on an annualized basis in the third quarter, ahead of Bloomberg consensus expectations of 32%, fueled by the continued reopening of businesses and reversing much of the economic fallout stemming from COVID-19-related lockdowns.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, consumer spending\u2014the largest contributor to GDP in the US and roughly 70% of economic output\u2014rebounded in a powerful fashion in the third quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.29.20-Blog-Chart.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; However, spending numbers were uneven, with a considerably larger portion spent on goods rather than services\u2014consistent with the continued behavioral and business restriction effects on these industries. Further, the timing of spending was also fairly uneven, as much of the growth in consumer spending came in the early weeks of the third quarter and tapered off in recent weeks where the effects of fiscal stimulus and rising new COVID-19 cases influenced consumer behavior.\n\n&gt; \u201cGDP rebounded stronger than expected in the third quarter, but the big question on everyone\u2019s mind is whether the economy can remain on firm ground in the fourth quarter and into 2021,\u201d stated LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBarring a new round of fiscal stimulus, it\u2019s likely that growth will taper off in the fourth quarter, but we still don\u2019t expect a double-dip recession.\u201d\n\n&gt; Regardless of the state of economic momentum, it is remarkable that GDP is already only about 3.5% away from recovering the entire pandemic losses. The resilience of US consumers has been the top story of the recovery, even with the historic fiscal stimulus.\n\n&gt; The surge in growth in the third quarter may also have political implications. As we noted in our recent Weekly Market Commentary: Are the Polls Wrong Again? the average GDP growth in the second and third quarters of election years can have predictive power for who wins the election, with stronger growth favoring incumbents. However, we also point out that recessions close to elections have favored challengers, sending some conflicting market signals heading into Election Day!\n\n&gt; As the economy moves forward in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll continue to monitor real-time data indicators to gauge the impact of rising COVID-19 cases on consumer and business behavior.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Slight Dip In Consumer Confidence\n\n&gt; Consumer Confidence for the month of October was released earlier today and showed a slight dip relative to September. The headline index dropped from 101.3 down to 100.9 compared to expectations for a reading of 102.0. Given the rising number of cases and the upcoming election, it's not too surprising to see confidence come in a bit, so a decline of this magnitude isn't all that concerning. What is notable, though, is that even though Consumer Confidence remains right near post-COVID highs, it hasn't bounced all that much off its lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC.png))**\n\n&gt; Breaking out this month's report by the sentiment of consumers towards both how they feel now and what they expect in the future, the Present Situation Index rose from 98.9 up to 104.6 while the Expectations component dropped from 102.9 down to 98.4. The drop in the Expectations component of this month's report looks like it's a partial reflection of growing uncertainty regarding COVID and the election as we head into the colder months of November and December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-P-Exp.png))**\n\n&gt; In looking at the spread between Present Conditions and Expectations, it moved back into positive territory this month after dropping deeply into negative territory earlier this year. What's interesting to note about current levels is that in every prior recession since the late 1960s, by the time the spread moved back into positive territory after turning negative, the recession was already well in the rearview mirror.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Sentiment towards jobs also suggests a relatively positive trend. At the current level of 26.5, the Jobs Plentiful index is still far from its 40+ reading before COVID, but it did increase again in October as it has now done in four of the last five months. While it's by no means a strong reading at current levels, it hasn't been getting worse either. Looking at past recessions, it wasn't until well after the recession ended that the Jobs Plentiful index started to rebound.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-Jobs-plentiful.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Industrials Malfunction\n\n&gt; With poorly received earnings reports from 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT) and general weakness overall, Tuesday was just a bad day for the Industrials sector. Just five stocks in the sector were up on the day and the sector overall was down 2.2% compared to the S&amp;P 500 which was down just 0.3%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials-Sector-Perfoamnces.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and the Industrials sector over the last year. Positive readings indicate the S&amp;P 500 outperforming the Industrials sector and negative readings indicate that the Industrials sector outperformed the S&amp;P 500. With the S&amp;P 500 outperforming the Industrials sector by 1.88 percentage points on Tuesday, it was the widest performance gap (in the S&amp;P 500's favor) since 9/21. Even more notable, though, was the fact that there have only been three other days in the last year where the Industrials sector underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a wider margin.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials-Sector-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; For the sector as a whole, it currently finds itself in a precarious position. After breaking its uptrend off the March lows on 9/21, the Industrials sector bounced back and rallied back to its former uptrend line, and while it just recently made a post-COVID high, the rally ran out of steam right at the former uptrend line. In the pullback that has followed, the sector closed yesterday right at a secondary line of support from the June lows. If this level doesn't hold through today's close, the technical picture for the sector will look a lot different than the way it looked just a few weeks ago.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # All or Nothing Days Back on the Rise\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's A/D line for the day (number of advancing stocks minus number of declining stocks) currently stands at about -460, which would be the weakest one-day reading since June. Today's A/D reading also is notable in that it represents the tenth 'all or nothing' day for the S&amp;P 500 since the index's last peak on 9/2. We consider 'all or nothing' days to be those days where the S&amp;P 500's daily A/D reading is either above +400 or below -400. To put the frequency of 'all or nothing' days into perspective, while there have been ten in the last forty trading days, in the forty trading days before that there weren't any.\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the percentage of 'all or nothing' days on a 50-day rolling basis. The current pace of 20% is still well off the extraordinary level of 44% we saw back in late April/early May, but it is still relatively high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102820-AllorNothing-50.png))**\n\n&gt; Including today, there have now been 41 'all or nothing' days so far in 2020. If the current pace for the entire year keeps up that will put us on pace for fifty days this year. If the current pace keeps up and we do reach 50 'all or nothing' days this year, it will be the third-highest annual total behind 2011 (70) and 2008 (52), but even if there isn't another 'all or nothing' day this year, 2020 would still rank fifth behind the years from 2008 through 2011.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102820-AllorNothing-All.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Earnings and Economics Diverge\n\n&gt; This earnings season, we have frequently mentioned how beat rates have continued to rise relentlessly. From our Earnings Explorer database, our 3-month rolling EPS beat rate currently stands at a record high of 78.19%. That is nearly 20 percentage points higher than the historical average of 59.37%. The sales beat rate is not at a record, but it too is elevated at 69.09% versus the historical average of 56.45%. That means that of the companies that have reported earnings over the past three months, a massive proportion are exceeding consensus sales and EPS estimates.\n\n&gt; While earnings beat rates have continued to grind higher, economic data is another story. The Citi Economic Surprise Index basically tracks macroeconomic data and how it comes in relative to forecasts. Higher readings indicate the data is trending stronger than expected and vice versa for negative readings. With the unprecedented shock to macroeconomic data in 2020, this index for the United States plummeted, but that was followed by a sharp rebound to record highs. Although the index for the US remains higher than anything prior to the pandemic, it has been heading lower since the summer. In other words, economic data is still coming in better than expected but is not massively exceeding expectations to the degree it was back in the spring and early summer.\n\n&gt; The two charts below compare EPS and revenue beat rates to the Citi Economic Surprise Index. Comparing the two series to the Citi Economic Surprise Index shows that while EPS beat rate has been somewhat connected (correlation: +0.325)) there is very little in the way of correlation between the Surprise Index and the revenue beat rate (+0.084). Given that EPS figures are typically easier to massage than revenues, that was a bit of a surprise. What is notable about the recent decline in the Citi Economic Surprise Index is that in prior periods where it became elevated and then pulled back as it did in (2003, 2009, and 2018), the EPS beat rate typically didn't peak and start to trend lower for another few months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102820-Citi-vs-Earn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/qOJdagC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/9KQPNXR.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pj7pysD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/h2HgKHB.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/DRjtGSM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.3.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aoPSp6k.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BKnNZhJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/97DJGA7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4k28zp5.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/lb9tHJr.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/i7l5LTf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8prHmLC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/jlZMuyc.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Xs5XIA3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/WX3Qbv9.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/kI5jFhr.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/u6ZNU50.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.6.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aP1LaQn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.6.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/k3lJ7Qz.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # PayPal $186.13\n**PayPal (PYPL)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:15 PM ET on Monday, November 2, 2020.

        "selftext": "I made several post in regards to NIO, SNAP, PINS, &amp; ETSY\n\nI'm taking a noted look at QCOM, SQ, TWLO, &amp; NFLX for next big blowups.\n\nFeel free to look at my profile for the Discord [JewBanks Journal](https://discord.gg/uAUtTW) or support me in general!\n\n***It has helped many of you and I'm very proud and excited when I hear you're gain stories.  Feels good making a positive difference in someone else life!***\n\nBut I think it important to disclose my situation and why I'm so careful with my DD picks. For most in sub-reddit this is nothing more than a long text wall waste of time, but for you guys that use my research to assist in your gains I think it reassuring you knew somewhat who your taking advice from.\n\nI been paper trading for months while trying to scrap some savings when I was unemployed from Jan to May.\n\nAfter getting a job finally &amp; saving up enough to payoff the past debt I racked up from the lock-down I started real trading in late August from my initial 2k made it to 8k until September slapped reality into me and ass fucked me back to $132 (welcome to REAL trading) and been carefully trading since and looking for what I did wrong. (Utilizing all my cash with no hedge for overnight holdings). Look at my post history when I started.\n\nAlso trading hard when you have a job and can't focus on the markets, you know how many opportunities I missed since mid-September since I couldn't execute a trade.\n\nPoint is I don't have a large account, hundreds of percent wins for you is literally hundreds of tendies for me. I getting there but I like to think just cause I have small dick doesn't mean I don't have a big brain or experience.\n\nAnyway if you missed what I been posting before look up my post history also the answer to the common questions:\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI like to remind everyone that got specific inquiries about a specific ticker or needs live updates to go to [JewBanks Journal](https://discord.gg/uAUtTW) \n\n1. **I simply cannot respond in a timely manner through Reddit, some you witness that today \ud83d\ude09**\n2. **I want to assure you my DDs will still be posted in both WSB and the discord going forward.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How are you so good and keenly accurate on your picks?**\n\n\\-Because I been looking up charts and scanning for similar patterns within a trend, reversal, and squeeze-to-breakout with the TA tools I use over and over again until muscle memory kicked in.\n\n\\-Also paper traded literally for months when I had nothing else to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What do you use for research?**\n\n \n\n1. Longer time frame consolidation and Band squeezes tend have more powerful breakouts, Same conditions on 5 or 15 min might move 2 or 3%. On 30 min or hourly 9 to 12%, 4 hours usually plus 15% move over session period from initial move.\n2. All consolidation shows you is that the bears/bulls are becoming exhausted and cannot force the other to move. One about to get knocked out and other will be the winner. BB assist in this to show when implied volatility in the stock is decreasing and when someone going night-night. When there no resistance you get a breakout (volume profile too if you want to see session to session support &amp; resistance aka when the fighters are the strongest. But that far more depth that will confuse a lot of people so I do not show it on the charts)\n3. Band Squeeze does not show directional movement though, RSI/STOCH &amp; their variations do. Anytime the indicators hover near 30 or 70 show their directional bias period, anytime it hits 20 or 80 multiple times shows a \"trend\" , finally if it passes and \"sustain\" below/above the prior numbers shows increasing momentum, this can be backed up with the MACD histogram.\n4. MACD histogram- A sharp cross with the lines with a 40 degree angle shows a strong velocity move just occurred, the more spaced out the lines are in the same direction show the momentum increasing.\n5. Same with the histogram: The bigger the bars in succession the more velocity the move is and for me the best indication of potential transition to a strong momentum is when the lines are in tandem hugging the 0 line whether above or below is irrelevant. This is backed by the Bollinger bands again.\n6. Bollinger Bands- Just show IV, bigger they are the bigger the potential the movement both directions, when used with volume profile or a oscillator it very good at telling you if a movement is in a range (bouncing from top band to low band &amp; vice versa). Trending (opening and closing near the band successive directional movement aka hugging) or breaking out (crosses or outright open outside the band while quickly accelerating away from the band so much so that the band simply goes vertical.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*But you retards will do what you always do so I leave it at that. \\*\n\nAll this combined leads to high prob. of a breakout or breakdown in whatever time-frame chosen, well at least for me anyway.\n\n*You can always learn more at* [*https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=start*](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=start) *It free and plenty of explanation\u2019s that go deeper than I ever could and plenty of examples. No need for paid courses or chat rooms. For more specific resources take a look below:*\n\n*1. TradingView for the best charts*\n\n*2. Stock fetcher for the best TA screener*\n\n*3. Stock rover for the best fundamentals and qualitative screener.*\n\n*4. Use your mainstream brokerage like TD Ameritrade or Etrade for Analysts &amp; Fundamental Research or just subscribe to TipRanks*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What the format of your risk management? What keeps you in the game?**\n\n1. I position size on what I can afford to lose, meaning if I buy $500 in options it because that all willing to lose on that trade, this prevents me from having to worry about stop losses or need to hedge. There nothing wrong with these strategies but I see some flaws.  \n\n   1. *Stops only work in current sessions where stock will move in a flow. Next day sessions risk GAP UP/DOWN that can cause the order to trigger at far worse point if it a market order or not at at all if it completely passes if it stop limit.*\n   2. *Next is hedging, the easiest way is spreads, or more specifically legging into a position to create a spread. That a far more detailed explanation that can be found in the resources below. Finally for whatever reason you cannot use spreads (cash accounts) you can always buy the opposite directional option in contrast to your position at no more than 1/3 the value of your original position. This will protect you from unexpected gaps or \"shock news\" by offsetting your losses til you can adjust your portfolio.*\n\n* This is the only time in my opinion where it perfectly acceptable to use weeklies &amp; FDs, to cheaply hedge &amp; potentially recuperate your losses. I don't hate weeklies, just don't have time to trade them actively nor do most people utilize them correctly, ***THEY ARE FOR SCALPING. NOT DAY TRADING.***\n* ***I don't trade more than the principal balance from start of week to prevent out-sized losses***.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Do you hold through earnings?**\n\nUsually not, I do Lotto plays though (no extrinsic value practically, but  very cheap OTM option that likely to become in the money, so I hope)\n\nIf it successful you get a couple hundred percent, if you let it ride throughout the day usually several thousand\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Do you hold through the weekends?**\n\nAlmost never, unless they're LEAPS and I'm confident in the long term trend.\n\nPlus, it forces you to take profit at EOW.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Can you look at\u2026 When do you think it time to sell\u2026. Will this keep going up?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm picking up the when I'm comfortable with risk/reward ratio and STRONGLY suggest you use your position sizing and risk management rules aka do your own due diligence\n\nThe only reason I do these post is to give people a timely heads up when something big going to happen, THAT IT\n\nI'm not going to go step by step explaining when I enter or exit. I'll post my profit target, position, and time horizon then it done. If I think something truly off I'll update the the DD (if it recent)",

Also a worry is that Senate elections could be unresolved, which means it may not be known which party holds the majority.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf there\u2019s no clear winner, it will be negative for risk assets...The market is really worried about not having clarity after the election. They\u2019re worried about it dragging out four weeks as the results are contested,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. \u201cThe overall landscape is not a political one. It\u2019s that we\u2019re in a pandemic, and we don\u2019t want an uncertain election outcome that leaves the country concerned about leadership.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks closed out October on a sour note, losing about 6% for the week, the worst performance since March, when the pandemic first shut down the economy. Strategists say the coronavirus is again worrying the market, as major European countries go into partial lockdowns, and the U.S. faces record numbers of new cases.\n*****\n&gt; Lyngen said he does not expect the markets to react as much if it\u2019s only the fate of the Senate that is undetermined. But that is still very important, and if it\u2019s not clear which party has a majority for days or even weeks, that would cast doubt on the ability of whichever candidate wins the presidency to pursue their policy agenda.\n*****\n&gt; # Senate key for stimulus\n&gt; The Senate is also key to how much money will be poured into the economy to help battle the impact of the virus. For instance, if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the White House, but Democrats do not reclaim the Senate, he will likely have to compromise on a smaller stimulus package and would not be able to implement tax increases. If President Donald Trump is re-elected and faces a newly Democratic Senate alongside the Democratic House, he will likely face push back on many issues though they may agree on a large stimulus package.\n*****\n&gt; As of Friday, Biden was leading Trump in the polls by 7.8 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of major polls. Democrats also appear likely to take the Senate, but some races are very tight.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America strategists note that the Senate races are close with a few seats that could flip. Seven Republican seats are currently rated as toss-ups with four in battleground states, where they could be lost if there\u2019s a strong Democratic surge. There could also be a clear majority, but still uncertainty in terms of final makeup.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe overall composition of the Senate is unlikely to be determined until sometime in January due to election rules in Georgia which stipulates the race goes to a run off if no candidates garners 50% majority in the general election and currently no candidate is projected\u201d to hit that threshold, the BofA strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; The strategists say the timing of the results is unclear due to early voting but high volumes of mail-in ballots, which cannot be counted in some states until election day.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cA short delay in the election result should have a trivial impact on the economy but a multi-week contested election could drag down H1 GDP growth by 0.5-1.0 pp,\u201d according to BofA strategists. \u201cOnce there is a winner, the focus turns to stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Watch bond yields\n&gt; That could mean bond yields will continue their move higher in the coming week. Yields have been rising on the idea that there will be some kind of stimulus after the election, and it will mean more U.S. debt and higher interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe expect rates to shift higher by 5 to 25 bps after the election outcome is known due to expectations for fiscal stimulus and improved growth prospects,\u201d the BofA strategists wrote. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 0.86% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; However, if the election outcome is not known for awhile, the strategists said a contested outcome could push the 10-year yield materially lower.\n*****\n&gt; If there is a contested election, the strategist expect stocks to trade lower, but it would be a buying opportunity since the market typically recovers from headline-related losses within six months.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe expect a clear outcome to be neutral to positive for the market in the near term, except under a Biden win with a split Congress, which could potentially lead to continued gridlock in fiscal stimulus talks,\u201d the BofA strategists added.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the election, there is also a Fed meeting, expected to end Thursday with no new announcements though it is likely the Fed will emphasize it will keep policy easy for a long time as the economy heals. The October employment report is expected on Friday and is expected to show continued job gains, after September\u2019s 661,000 nonfarm payrolls.\n*****\n&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equities strategist at Credit Suisse, does not expect the market to react much if the election outcome is as expected, with Biden winning and Democrats taking the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe most likely outcome is already discounted by the market. The best assumption is if you don\u2019t have a big surprise, the market should do nothing,\u201d Golub said, adding the most volatile week could be the one just ending. \u201cThis week is the one with the turmoil, and I don\u2019t think the next week is the one where the market\u2019s going to be crazy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said investors may be too worried about the election being unresolved and the real issue disturbing the market this past week is the growing spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s no rule we need to declare a victor,\u201d said Golub. \u201cWe have four or five weeks. The market may not love that near-term indecision, but the system is set up to allow for it, and as long as things don\u2019t go off the rails, and they really shouldn\u2019t, this concern about a contested election is probably overblown as an investor issue.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said there\u2019s a greater chance that the winner of the presidency is known before the Senate. \u201cThe chances are that we\u2019ll at least know directionally where the power sits, but that could take a little longer and the market may be a little uncomfortable with that,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings reports\n&gt; Dozens of companies report earnings in the week ahead, and Golub said corporate profits are a bright spot for the market. The third quarter results so far are showing earnings down about 10%, compared to earlier forecasts of more than 20%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe reality is the economy is robust. 55% of the market cap of the S&amp;P has higher earnings in 2020 than in 2019. More than half the market is acting like there\u2019s no recession, no downturn,\u201d Golub said.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said both Trump and Biden would push for fiscal stimulus, but while the market is clear on where Trump stands it does not know that much about Biden, if he were to win. \u201cIt is going to take some time to get clarity on which of his policy initiatives are going to happen. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to implement these tax increases he\u2019s talking about right away. I think the economy is too frail,\u201d said Golub.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TQBrNag.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LrQZHOj.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/WbqKDDT.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zqi6l3G.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9q0jEby.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xGuEP7D.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2SrRdkk.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tCh05mj.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qOJdagC.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KhE54Ws.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rrDYFK6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QEbWDb7.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zBMyLqA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # November Almanac: Usually a Top Month in Election Years\n\n&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down \u201322.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ\u2019s second worst month on record\u2014only October 1987 was worse.\n\n&gt; November begins the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the \u201cBest Eight Months\u201d for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don\u2019t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950), NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 2000 (since 1979) month. November is best for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 1000 (since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/43b1cac3b88cfc6f79063d86ae9abfef/57e8d7f397fbeeb8-7f/s400x600/a8bff5e250ce7b9735197427f72d665b61fe0614.jpg))**\n\n&gt; November is a mixed bag in presidential election years. DJIA has advanced in 10 of the last 17 election years since 1952 with an average gain of 1.7%. Significant DJIA declines occurred in 2008 (-5.3%) and 2000 (-5.1%). For S&amp;P 500 November ranks best with a similar record to DJIA. NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 are not as strong ranking #7, #3 and #6 respectively. Fewer years of data (12 for NASDAQ and 10 for Russell indices) combined with sizable losses in 2000 and 2008 drag down rankings and average gains when compared to DJIA and S&amp;P 500.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Whatever the Outcome, Day Before Election Day Historically Bullish\n\n&gt; Looking back at the last seventeen presidential elections since 1952, the day before Election Day has a clear bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined just three times and average gains of 0.51% and 0.44% respectively. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly weaker, but still bullish. Election Day (or the day after prior to 1980) leans bullish, but with a greater frequency of losses. Incumbent party victories are shaded in light grey.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d030ea31abcb4bd298b596da0d2b2b4d/3d5b7e5afba3a9a5-14/s500x750/a8b43d243e3c57890dde8a0682726a1da587e5d2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # GDP Bounces Back\n\n&gt; The outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns triggered the largest quarter over-quarter decline in gross domestic product (GDP) since WWII, so perhaps it comes as no surprise that the following quarter tallied the sharpest rebound in that same time period. GDP expanded 33.1% on an annualized basis in the third quarter, ahead of Bloomberg consensus expectations of 32%, fueled by the continued reopening of businesses and reversing much of the economic fallout stemming from COVID-19-related lockdowns.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, consumer spending\u2014the largest contributor to GDP in the US and roughly 70% of economic output\u2014rebounded in a powerful fashion in the third quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.29.20-Blog-Chart.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; However, spending numbers were uneven, with a considerably larger portion spent on goods rather than services\u2014consistent with the continued behavioral and business restriction effects on these industries. Further, the timing of spending was also fairly uneven, as much of the growth in consumer spending came in the early weeks of the third quarter and tapered off in recent weeks where the effects of fiscal stimulus and rising new COVID-19 cases influenced consumer behavior.\n\n&gt; \u201cGDP rebounded stronger than expected in the third quarter, but the big question on everyone\u2019s mind is whether the economy can remain on firm ground in the fourth quarter and into 2021,\u201d stated LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBarring a new round of fiscal stimulus, it\u2019s likely that growth will taper off in the fourth quarter, but we still don\u2019t expect a double-dip recession.\u201d\n\n&gt; Regardless of the state of economic momentum, it is remarkable that GDP is already only about 3.5% away from recovering the entire pandemic losses. The resilience of US consumers has been the top story of the recovery, even with the historic fiscal stimulus.\n\n&gt; The surge in growth in the third quarter may also have political implications. As we noted in our recent Weekly Market Commentary: Are the Polls Wrong Again? the average GDP growth in the second and third quarters of election years can have predictive power for who wins the election, with stronger growth favoring incumbents. However, we also point out that recessions close to elections have favored challengers, sending some conflicting market signals heading into Election Day!\n\n&gt; As the economy moves forward in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll continue to monitor real-time data indicators to gauge the impact of rising COVID-19 cases on consumer and business behavior.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Slight Dip In Consumer Confidence\n\n&gt; Consumer Confidence for the month of October was released earlier today and showed a slight dip relative to September. The headline index dropped from 101.3 down to 100.9 compared to expectations for a reading of 102.0. Given the rising number of cases and the upcoming election, it's not too surprising to see confidence come in a bit, so a decline of this magnitude isn't all that concerning. What is notable, though, is that even though Consumer Confidence remains right near post-COVID highs, it hasn't bounced all that much off its lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC.png))**\n\n&gt; Breaking out this month's report by the sentiment of consumers towards both how they feel now and what they expect in the future, the Present Situation Index rose from 98.9 up to 104.6 while the Expectations component dropped from 102.9 down to 98.4. The drop in the Expectations component of this month's report looks like it's a partial reflection of growing uncertainty regarding COVID and the election as we head into the colder months of November and December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-P-Exp.png))**\n\n&gt; In looking at the spread between Present Conditions and Expectations, it moved back into positive territory this month after dropping deeply into negative territory earlier this year. What's interesting to note about current levels is that in every prior recession since the late 1960s, by the time the spread moved back into positive territory after turning negative, the recession was already well in the rearview mirror.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Sentiment towards jobs also suggests a relatively positive trend. At the current level of 26.5, the Jobs Plentiful index is still far from its 40+ reading before COVID, but it did increase again in October as it has now done in four of the last five months. While it's by no means a strong reading at current levels, it hasn't been getting worse either. Looking at past recessions, it wasn't until well after the recession ended that the Jobs Plentiful index started to rebound.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-Jobs-plentiful.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Industrials Malfunction\n\n&gt; With poorly received earnings reports from 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT) and general weakness overall, Tuesday was just a bad day for the Industrials sector. Just five stocks in the sector were up on the day and the sector overall was down 2.2% compared to the S&amp;P 500 which was down just 0.3%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials-Sector-Perfoamnces.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and the Industrials sector over the last year. Positive readings indicate the S&amp;P 500 outperforming the Industrials sector and negative readings indicate that the Industrials sector outperformed the S&amp;P 500. With the S&amp;P 500 outperforming the Industrials sector by 1.88 percentage points on Tuesday, it was the widest performance gap (in the S&amp;P 500's favor) since 9/21. Even more notable, though, was the fact that there have only been three other days in the last year where the Industrials sector underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a wider margin.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials-Sector-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; For the sector as a whole, it currently finds itself in a precarious position. After breaking its uptrend off the March lows on 9/21, the Industrials sector bounced back and rallied back to its former uptrend line, and while it just recently made a post-COVID high, the rally ran out of steam right at the former uptrend line. In the pullback that has followed, the sector closed yesterday right at a secondary line of support from the June lows. If this level doesn't hold through today's close, the technical picture for the sector will look a lot different than the way it looked just a few weeks ago.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # All or Nothing Days Back on the Rise\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's A/D line for the day (number of advancing stocks minus number of declining stocks) currently stands at about -460, which would be the weakest one-day reading since June. Today's A/D reading also is notable in that it represents the tenth 'all or nothing' day for the S&amp;P 500 since the index's last peak on 9/2. We consider 'all or nothing' days to be those days where the S&amp;P 500's daily A/D reading is either above +400 or below -400. To put the frequency of 'all or nothing' days into perspective, while there have been ten in the last forty trading days, in the forty trading days before that there weren't any.\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the percentage of 'all or nothing' days on a 50-day rolling basis. The current pace of 20% is still well off the extraordinary level of 44% we saw back in late April/early May, but it is still relatively high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102820-AllorNothing-50.png))**\n\n&gt; Including today, there have now been 41 'all or nothing' days so far in 2020. If the current pace for the entire year keeps up that will put us on pace for fifty days this year. If the current pace keeps up and we do reach 50 'all or nothing' days this year, it will be the third-highest annual total behind 2011 (70) and 2008 (52), but even if there isn't another 'all or nothing' day this year, 2020 would still rank fifth behind the years from 2008 through 2011.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102820-AllorNothing-All.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Earnings and Economics Diverge\n\n&gt; This earnings season, we have frequently mentioned how beat rates have continued to rise relentlessly. From our Earnings Explorer database, our 3-month rolling EPS beat rate currently stands at a record high of 78.19%. That is nearly 20 percentage points higher than the historical average of 59.37%. The sales beat rate is not at a record, but it too is elevated at 69.09% versus the historical average of 56.45%. That means that of the companies that have reported earnings over the past three months, a massive proportion are exceeding consensus sales and EPS estimates.\n\n&gt; While earnings beat rates have continued to grind higher, economic data is another story. The Citi Economic Surprise Index basically tracks macroeconomic data and how it comes in relative to forecasts. Higher readings indicate the data is trending stronger than expected and vice versa for negative readings. With the unprecedented shock to macroeconomic data in 2020, this index for the United States plummeted, but that was followed by a sharp rebound to record highs. Although the index for the US remains higher than anything prior to the pandemic, it has been heading lower since the summer. In other words, economic data is still coming in better than expected but is not massively exceeding expectations to the degree it was back in the spring and early summer.\n\n&gt; The two charts below compare EPS and revenue beat rates to the Citi Economic Surprise Index. Comparing the two series to the Citi Economic Surprise Index shows that while EPS beat rate has been somewhat connected (correlation: +0.325)) there is very little in the way of correlation between the Surprise Index and the revenue beat rate (+0.084). Given that EPS figures are typically easier to massage than revenues, that was a bit of a surprise. What is notable about the recent decline in the Citi Economic Surprise Index is that in prior periods where it became elevated and then pulled back as it did in (2003, 2009, and 2018), the EPS beat rate typically didn't peak and start to trend lower for another few months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102820-Citi-vs-Earn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 30th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZW-FyZvJ-g))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.1.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PYPL** \n&gt; * **$SQ** \n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$CLX** \n&gt; * **$ROKU** \n&gt; * **$W** \n&gt; * **$PTON** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$WING** \n&gt; * **$SWKS** \n&gt; * **$CVS** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$NET** \n&gt; * **$SPCE** \n&gt; * **$GM** \n&gt; * **$HZNP** \n&gt; * **$LL** \n&gt; * **$MPC** \n&gt; * **$AZN** \n&gt; * **$WM** \n&gt; * **$TTD** \n&gt; * **$EL** \n&gt; * **$DBX** \n&gt; * **$AYX** \n&gt; * **$ON** \n&gt; * **$ZNGA** \n&gt; * **$CWH** \n&gt; * **$AMCX** \n&gt; * **$MELI** \n&gt; * **$SEDG** \n&gt; * **$REGN** \n&gt; * **$CPE** \n&gt; * **$LDOS** \n&gt; * **$AMRN** \n&gt; * **$UBER** \n&gt; * **$BMY** \n&gt; * **$KPTI** \n&gt; * **$LITE** \n&gt; * **$HUM** \n&gt; * **$WEN** \n&gt; * **$BHC** \n&gt; * **$MCK** \n&gt; * **$CPLP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/qOJdagC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/9KQPNXR.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pj7pysD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/h2HgKHB.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/DRjtGSM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.3.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aoPSp6k.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BKnNZhJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/97DJGA7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4k28zp5.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/lb9tHJr.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/i7l5LTf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8prHmLC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/jlZMuyc.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Xs5XIA3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/WX3Qbv9.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/kI5jFhr.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/u6ZNU50.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.6.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aP1LaQn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.6.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/k3lJ7Qz.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # PayPal $186.13\n**PayPal (PYPL)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:15 PM ET on Monday, November 2, 2020.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 2nd, 2020.\n\n# **Investors are hoping for a clear presidential and Senate election outcome to end the sell-off  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/30/investors-are-hoping-for-a-clear-presidential-and-senate-election-outcome-to-end-the-sell-off.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The best hope for markets in the week ahead is that there is a clear cut winner in Tuesday\u2019s presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; The election looms large as the biggest wild card risk for markets, and there is a real concern that no outcome could lead to a period of uncertainty and turbulence for markets and the economy. On the other hand, some strategists say a clear winner and quick concession by the other candidate could lead to a relief rally. Also a worry is that Senate elections could be unresolved, which means it may not be known which party holds the majority.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf there\u2019s no clear winner, it will be negative for risk assets...The market is really worried about not having clarity after the election. They\u2019re worried about it dragging out four weeks as the results are contested,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. \u201cThe overall landscape is not a political one. It\u2019s that we\u2019re in a pandemic, and we don\u2019t want an uncertain election outcome that leaves the country concerned about leadership.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks closed out October on a sour note, losing about 6% for the week, the worst performance since March, when the pandemic first shut down the economy. Strategists say the coronavirus is again worrying the market, as major European countries go into partial lockdowns, and the U.S. faces record numbers of new cases.\n*****\n&gt; Lyngen said he does not expect the markets to react as much if it\u2019s only the fate of the Senate that is undetermined. But that is still very important, and if it\u2019s not clear which party has a majority for days or even weeks, that would cast doubt on the ability of whichever candidate wins the presidency to pursue their policy agenda.\n*****\n&gt; # Senate key for stimulus\n&gt; The Senate is also key to how much money will be poured into the economy to help battle the impact of the virus. For instance, if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the White House, but Democrats do not reclaim the Senate, he will likely have to compromise on a smaller stimulus package and would not be able to implement tax increases. If President Donald Trump is re-elected and faces a newly Democratic Senate alongside the Democratic House, he will likely face push back on many issues though they may agree on a large stimulus package.\n*****\n&gt; As of Friday, Biden was leading Trump in the polls by 7.8 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of major polls. Democrats also appear likely to take the Senate, but some races are very tight.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America strategists note that the Senate races are close with a few seats that could flip. Seven Republican seats are currently rated as toss-ups with four in battleground states, where they could be lost if there\u2019s a strong Democratic surge. There could also be a clear majority, but still uncertainty in terms of final makeup.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe overall composition of the Senate is unlikely to be determined until sometime in January due to election rules in Georgia which stipulates the race goes to a run off if no candidates garners 50% majority in the general election and currently no candidate is projected\u201d to hit that threshold, the BofA strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; The strategists say the timing of the results is unclear due to early voting but high volumes of mail-in ballots, which cannot be counted in some states until election day.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cA short delay in the election result should have a trivial impact on the economy but a multi-week contested election could drag down H1 GDP growth by 0.5-1.0 pp,\u201d according to BofA strategists. \u201cOnce there is a winner, the focus turns to stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Watch bond yields\n&gt; That could mean bond yields will continue their move higher in the coming week. Yields have been rising on the idea that there will be some kind of stimulus after the election, and it will mean more U.S. debt and higher interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe expect rates to shift higher by 5 to 25 bps after the election outcome is known due to expectations for fiscal stimulus and improved growth prospects,\u201d the BofA strategists wrote. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 0.86% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; However, if the election outcome is not known for awhile, the strategists said a contested outcome could push the 10-year yield materially lower.\n*****\n&gt; If there is a contested election, the strategist expect stocks to trade lower, but it would be a buying opportunity since the market typically recovers from headline-related losses within six months.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe expect a clear outcome to be neutral to positive for the market in the near term, except under a Biden win with a split Congress, which could potentially lead to continued gridlock in fiscal stimulus talks,\u201d the BofA strategists added.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the election, there is also a Fed meeting, expected to end Thursday with no new announcements though it is likely the Fed will emphasize it will keep policy easy for a long time as the economy heals. The October employment report is expected on Friday and is expected to show continued job gains, after September\u2019s 661,000 nonfarm payrolls.\n*****\n&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equities strategist at Credit Suisse, does not expect the market to react much if the election outcome is as expected, with Biden winning and Democrats taking the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe most likely outcome is already discounted by the market. The best assumption is if you don\u2019t have a big surprise, the market should do nothing,\u201d Golub said, adding the most volatile week could be the one just ending. \u201cThis week is the one with the turmoil, and I don\u2019t think the next week is the one where the market\u2019s going to be crazy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said investors may be too worried about the election being unresolved and the real issue disturbing the market this past week is the growing spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s no rule we need to declare a victor,\u201d said Golub. \u201cWe have four or five weeks. The market may not love that near-term indecision, but the system is set up to allow for it, and as long as things don\u2019t go off the rails, and they really shouldn\u2019t, this concern about a contested election is probably overblown as an investor issue.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said there\u2019s a greater chance that the winner of the presidency is known before the Senate. \u201cThe chances are that we\u2019ll at least know directionally where the power sits, but that could take a little longer and the market may be a little uncomfortable with that,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings reports\n&gt; Dozens of companies report earnings in the week ahead, and Golub said corporate profits are a bright spot for the market. The third quarter results so far are showing earnings down about 10%, compared to earlier forecasts of more than 20%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe reality is the economy is robust. 55% of the market cap of the S&amp;P has higher earnings in 2020 than in 2019. More than half the market is acting like there\u2019s no recession, no downturn,\u201d Golub said.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said both Trump and Biden would push for fiscal stimulus, but while the market is clear on where Trump stands it does not know that much about Biden, if he were to win. \u201cIt is going to take some time to get clarity on which of his policy initiatives are going to happen. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to implement these tax increases he\u2019s talking about right away. I think the economy is too frail,\u201d said Golub.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TQBrNag.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/LrQZHOj.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/WbqKDDT.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zqi6l3G.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9q0jEby.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xGuEP7D.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2SrRdkk.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tCh05mj.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qOJdagC.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KhE54Ws.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rrDYFK6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QEbWDb7.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zBMyLqA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # November Almanac: Usually a Top Month in Election Years\n\n&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down \u201322.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ\u2019s second worst month on record\u2014only October 1987 was worse.\n\n&gt; November begins the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the \u201cBest Eight Months\u201d for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don\u2019t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950), NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 2000 (since 1979) month. November is best for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 1000 (since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/43b1cac3b88cfc6f79063d86ae9abfef/57e8d7f397fbeeb8-7f/s400x600/a8bff5e250ce7b9735197427f72d665b61fe0614.jpg))**\n\n&gt; November is a mixed bag in presidential election years. DJIA has advanced in 10 of the last 17 election years since 1952 with an average gain of 1.7%. Significant DJIA declines occurred in 2008 (-5.3%) and 2000 (-5.1%). For S&amp;P 500 November ranks best with a similar record to DJIA. NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 are not as strong ranking #7, #3 and #6 respectively. Fewer years of data (12 for NASDAQ and 10 for Russell indices) combined with sizable losses in 2000 and 2008 drag down rankings and average gains when compared to DJIA and S&amp;P 500.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Whatever the Outcome, Day Before Election Day Historically Bullish\n\n&gt; Looking back at the last seventeen presidential elections since 1952, the day before Election Day has a clear bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined just three times and average gains of 0.51% and 0.44% respectively. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly weaker, but still bullish. Election Day (or the day after prior to 1980) leans bullish, but with a greater frequency of losses. Incumbent party victories are shaded in light grey.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d030ea31abcb4bd298b596da0d2b2b4d/3d5b7e5afba3a9a5-14/s500x750/a8b43d243e3c57890dde8a0682726a1da587e5d2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # GDP Bounces Back\n\n&gt; The outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns triggered the largest quarter over-quarter decline in gross domestic product (GDP) since WWII, so perhaps it comes as no surprise that the following quarter tallied the sharpest rebound in that same time period. GDP expanded 33.1% on an annualized basis in the third quarter, ahead of Bloomberg consensus expectations of 32%, fueled by the continued reopening of businesses and reversing much of the economic fallout stemming from COVID-19-related lockdowns.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, consumer spending\u2014the largest contributor to GDP in the US and roughly 70% of economic output\u2014rebounded in a powerful fashion in the third quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.29.20-Blog-Chart.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; However, spending numbers were uneven, with a considerably larger portion spent on goods rather than services\u2014consistent with the continued behavioral and business restriction effects on these industries. Further, the timing of spending was also fairly uneven, as much of the growth in consumer spending came in the early weeks of the third quarter and tapered off in recent weeks where the effects of fiscal stimulus and rising new COVID-19 cases influenced consumer behavior.\n\n&gt; \u201cGDP rebounded stronger than expected in the third quarter, but the big question on everyone\u2019s mind is whether the economy can remain on firm ground in the fourth quarter and into 2021,\u201d stated LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBarring a new round of fiscal stimulus, it\u2019s likely that growth will taper off in the fourth quarter, but we still don\u2019t expect a double-dip recession.\u201d\n\n&gt; Regardless of the state of economic momentum, it is remarkable that GDP is already only about 3.5% away from recovering the entire pandemic losses. The resilience of US consumers has been the top story of the recovery, even with the historic fiscal stimulus.\n\n&gt; The surge in growth in the third quarter may also have political implications. As we noted in our recent Weekly Market Commentary: Are the Polls Wrong Again? the average GDP growth in the second and third quarters of election years can have predictive power for who wins the election, with stronger growth favoring incumbents. However, we also point out that recessions close to elections have favored challengers, sending some conflicting market signals heading into Election Day!\n\n&gt; As the economy moves forward in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll continue to monitor real-time data indicators to gauge the impact of rising COVID-19 cases on consumer and business behavior.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Slight Dip In Consumer Confidence\n\n&gt; Consumer Confidence for the month of October was released earlier today and showed a slight dip relative to September. The headline index dropped from 101.3 down to 100.9 compared to expectations for a reading of 102.0. Given the rising number of cases and the upcoming election, it's not too surprising to see confidence come in a bit, so a decline of this magnitude isn't all that concerning. What is notable, though, is that even though Consumer Confidence remains right near post-COVID highs, it hasn't bounced all that much off its lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC.png))**\n\n&gt; Breaking out this month's report by the sentiment of consumers towards both how they feel now and what they expect in the future, the Present Situation Index rose from 98.9 up to 104.6 while the Expectations component dropped from 102.9 down to 98.4. The drop in the Expectations component of this month's report looks like it's a partial reflection of growing uncertainty regarding COVID and the election as we head into the colder months of November and December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-P-Exp.png))**\n\n&gt; In looking at the spread between Present Conditions and Expectations, it moved back into positive territory this month after dropping deeply into negative territory earlier this year. What's interesting to note about current levels is that in every prior recession since the late 1960s, by the time the spread moved back into positive territory after turning negative, the recession was already well in the rearview mirror.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Sentiment towards jobs also suggests a relatively positive trend. At the current level of 26.5, the Jobs Plentiful index is still far from its 40+ reading before COVID, but it did increase again in October as it has now done in four of the last five months. While it's by no means a strong reading at current levels, it hasn't been getting worse either. Looking at past recessions, it wasn't until well after the recession ended that the Jobs Plentiful index started to rebound.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-Jobs-plentiful.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Industrials Malfunction\n\n&gt; With poorly received earnings reports from 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT) and general weakness overall, Tuesday was just a bad day for the Industrials sector. Just five stocks in the sector were up on the day and the sector overall was down 2.2% compared to the S&amp;P 500 which was down just 0.3%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials-Sector-Perfoamnces.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and the Industrials sector over the last year. Positive readings indicate the S&amp;P 500 outperforming the Industrials sector and negative readings indicate that the Industrials sector outperformed the S&amp;P 500. With the S&amp;P 500 outperforming the Industrials sector by 1.88 percentage points on Tuesday, it was the widest performance gap (in the S&amp;P 500's favor) since 9/21. Even more notable, though, was the fact that there have only been three other days in the last year where the Industrials sector underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a wider margin.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials-Sector-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; For the sector as a whole, it currently finds itself in a precarious position. After breaking its uptrend off the March lows on 9/21, the Industrials sector bounced back and rallied back to its former uptrend line, and while it just recently made a post-COVID high, the rally ran out of steam right at the former uptrend line. In the pullback that has followed, the sector closed yesterday right at a secondary line of support from the June lows. If this level doesn't hold through today's close, the technical picture for the sector will look a lot different than the way it looked just a few weeks ago.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # All or Nothing Days Back on the Rise\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's A/D line for the day (number of advancing stocks minus number of declining stocks) currently stands at about -460, which would be the weakest one-day reading since June. Today's A/D reading also is notable in that it represents the tenth 'all or nothing' day for the S&amp;P 500 since the index's last peak on 9/2. We consider 'all or nothing' days to be those days where the S&amp;P 500's daily A/D reading is either above +400 or below -400. To put the frequency of 'all or nothing' days into perspective, while there have been ten in the last forty trading days, in the forty trading days before that there weren't any.\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the percentage of 'all or nothing' days on a 50-day rolling basis. The current pace of 20% is still well off the extraordinary level of 44% we saw back in late April/early May, but it is still relatively high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102820-AllorNothing-50.png))**\n\n&gt; Including today, there have now been 41 'all or nothing' days so far in 2020. If the current pace for the entire year keeps up that will put us on pace for fifty days this year. If the current pace keeps up and we do reach 50 'all or nothing' days this year, it will be the third-highest annual total behind 2011 (70) and 2008 (52), but even if there isn't another 'all or nothing' day this year, 2020 would still rank fifth behind the years from 2008 through 2011.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102820-AllorNothing-All.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Earnings and Economics Diverge\n\n&gt; This earnings season, we have frequently mentioned how beat rates have continued to rise relentlessly. From our Earnings Explorer database, our 3-month rolling EPS beat rate currently stands at a record high of 78.19%. That is nearly 20 percentage points higher than the historical average of 59.37%. The sales beat rate is not at a record, but it too is elevated at 69.09% versus the historical average of 56.45%. That means that of the companies that have reported earnings over the past three months, a massive proportion are exceeding consensus sales and EPS estimates.\n\n&gt; While earnings beat rates have continued to grind higher, economic data is another story. The Citi Economic Surprise Index basically tracks macroeconomic data and how it comes in relative to forecasts. Higher readings indicate the data is trending stronger than expected and vice versa for negative readings. With the unprecedented shock to macroeconomic data in 2020, this index for the United States plummeted, but that was followed by a sharp rebound to record highs. Although the index for the US remains higher than anything prior to the pandemic, it has been heading lower since the summer. In other words, economic data is still coming in better than expected but is not massively exceeding expectations to the degree it was back in the spring and early summer.\n\n&gt; The two charts below compare EPS and revenue beat rates to the Citi Economic Surprise Index. Comparing the two series to the Citi Economic Surprise Index shows that while EPS beat rate has been somewhat connected (correlation: +0.325)) there is very little in the way of correlation between the Surprise Index and the revenue beat rate (+0.084). Given that EPS figures are typically easier to massage than revenues, that was a bit of a surprise. What is notable about the recent decline in the Citi Economic Surprise Index is that in prior periods where it became elevated and then pulled back as it did in (2003, 2009, and 2018), the EPS beat rate typically didn't peak and start to trend lower for another few months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102820-Citi-vs-Earn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/qOJdagC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/9KQPNXR.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pj7pysD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/h2HgKHB.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/DRjtGSM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.3.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aoPSp6k.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BKnNZhJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/97DJGA7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4k28zp5.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/lb9tHJr.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/i7l5LTf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8prHmLC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/jlZMuyc.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Xs5XIA3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/WX3Qbv9.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/kI5jFhr.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/u6ZNU50.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.6.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aP1LaQn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.6.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/k3lJ7Qz.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # PayPal $186.13\n**PayPal (PYPL)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:15 PM ET on Monday, November 2, 2020.

        "selftext": "Anyone else think JBLU skew is cheap? Especially with spot soaring as it is today. Nov ATM IV right now is 67 vol (13 strike), and Nov 11 puts are offered at 68 vol -- almost flat skew for the 86%strike put despite the fact that the option gets earnings, stimulus negotiations, and the elections.\n\nAAL, LUV, UAL, DAL, and ALK have all reported the same story so far during earnings season:\n\nThe airline industry is in pain. Airport rental fees and depreciation have remained largely flat YoY, but business is bad -- optimistically, it is maybe 40% of what it should be this time of year.\n\nPayroll costs weigh on the airlines, but Congress hasn't renewed the Payroll Support Program even though there is a standalone bill [(HR 8504)](https://transportation.house.gov/news/press-releases/chair-defazio-statement-on-bill-to-extend-critical-worker-support-program_-) available to extend it and keep airlines from laying off their workers. Pelosi said today that any agreement on a big round-2 relief bill would be retroactive, and that sent a few of the airlines rallying despite abysmal earnings reports this morning and last week. Cash burn has come down (UAL went from $40mm daily burn to $25mm), but is anticipated to stabilize around current levels -- meaning that the bleeding rate will not get better unless this winter's business is better than expected.\n\nPersonally I'm skeptical that a stimulus deal will be struck before the election. Each side appears to believe that it will gain power in the elections, thus improving its post-Nov3 negotiating stance. Moreover, Pelosi has an incentive to keep the market from rallying hard, as that would benefit Trump at the polls.\n\nJBLU [reports on the morning of Oct27](http://blueir.investproductions.com/investor-relations). Stock is trading 12.76 right now, up 7% today in correlation with LUV [(which reported this morning)](http://www.southwestairlinesinvestorrelations.com/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/10-22-2020-114529650) and on hopes that a stimulus deal would breathe life into PSP.\n\nStarting in Dec, LUV is ending its policy of blocking middle seats. They say this is because scientific evidence shows physical distancing to be unnecessary if passengers are wearing facemasks. While that may be true, I see it as an attempt to further reduce cash burn by consolidating passengers into as few flights as possible per route. JBLU has been blocking middle seats in the front of the cabin for a while now, but I have observed that frequency of some of their LatAm routes was cut heavily in the past three months despite the lower number of passengers per plane.\n\nI think there is some hope that Americans escaping winter weather will head to Mexico and the Caribbean in the next few months, but that would depend greatly on (1) discretionary household cash and/or stimulus, (2) the ability of those places to manage the virus, and (3) the pandemic's winter severity spike or lack thereof. It's tough to read through to JBLU from LUV, because although they are similar in ways, JBLU is a far smaller airline (a third of the size in terms of pre-pandemic revenue and number of employees) than LUV, and has slightly greater penetration into Latin America.\n\n(This won't affect the upcoming earnings print BUT...a week ago, JBLU announced direct flights from LAX and a handful of East Coast cities to ski resort towns for the winter. I'm skeptical that this will be enough to buoy the airline in the absence of additional stimulus. People are buying used cars and single-family houses, and even well-off households may not spring for winter vacation if case counts spike in correlation with flu season.)\n\nI bought Nov 11 and 12 puts today. I am deciding whether to sell some other positions and buy more Nov 11 and 12 puts through earnings, perhaps as early as this afternoon or tomorrow AM, and no later than Monday. If I'm feeling cautious, I may set some cash aside to hedge it out with QCOM and AVGO Nov calls...haven't decided yet if i want to go all in. Airline gamma is extremely cheap considering the circumstances. The lull in VIX should be taken as a sign that we will see more dispersion overall, thus muting the major indices. However, that doesn't mean single-name volatility will abate.",

        "selftext": "On Tuesday, Apple is holding a launch event where it will reveal this year\u2019s iPhone lineup.\n\nIn most years, Apple announces its iPhones in September, and they go on sale shortly after that. This year is different. Apple instead released new Apple Watches last month and pushed the iPhone announcement to October. The delay is an outgrowth of the Covid-19 pandemic, which disrupted electronics manufacturing and forced most Apple employees to work from home. \n\nStill, this year\u2019s iPhone launch is significant. It is expected to include the first major exterior redesign since 2017, when Apple released the iPhone X with facial recognition. This year\u2019s models will feature iPad-like edges with flatter sides, compared with the gently curving sides of the current iPhones. \n\nApple is also expected to release four separate iPhones at different screen sizes and prices -- a much wider range of devices than in the past.\n\nFinally, at least some new iPhones will support 5G cellular networks, which promise faster download times (although the networks aren\u2019t fully built out yet in the U.S., which could disappoint some users.)\n\nThe last time Apple made such big changes to the iPhone was 2014, when the iPhone 6 came out with bigger screens and two different sizes. That prompted a major upgrade cycle -- a so-called \u201csuper-cycle\u201d -- with over 231 million iPhones sold in the next four quarters. That remained the annual unit sales record until Apple stopped reporting unit sales in 2018. \n\nSo this year\u2019s changes have investors and analysts predicting a big upgrade cycle that will make Apple an even more valuable company.\n\n\u201cWe expect this fall\u2019s launch to be the most significant iPhone event in years,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty wrote in a note this week. She\u2019s forecasting Apple to ship about 220 million iPhones in its fiscal 2021, which would be up 22% year-over-year according to the Morgan Stanley model.\n\nFour models would be a dramatic expansion of its lineup, with both a new smaller option and a larger high-end option, giving consumers more choices and potentially spurring people to upgrade.\n\nThe phones are expected to be visually different from past years\u2019 models, giving users another reason to upgrade.\n\n\u201cThese 4 new models will accompany the 2nd generation iPhone SE launched in spring 2020 to comprise Apple\u2019s most complete lineup of new iPhones ever,\u201d Huberty wrote. \n\nDifferent kinds of 5G\n\nApple\u2019s tagline for the event is \u201cHi Speed,\u201d a reference to the faster cellular speeds promised by 5G phones.\n\nInvestors and analysts have hoped for years that a 5G iPhone would represent a major upgrade and spur a big wave of sales not only for phone makers like Apple, but also for chip-makers like Qualcomm and carriers like Verizon and T-Mobile, which have bet big on 5G.\n\nThe biggest jump in speeds will come from the variety of 5G sometimes called millimeter wave or ultrawide band. But in the United States, millimeter wave is only available in certain markets and has limitations about how far it can be transmitted. While carriers are expanding quickly, the new iPhones may only be able to reach their full potential in a handful of regions. \n\nApple CFO Luca Maestri said this summer that it expected iPhones to go on sale a \u201cfew weeks later\u201d than the traditional September launch schedule.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that some models will go on sale shortly after the event while others take a longer time to hit store shelves, most likely due to challenges designing and manufacturing ten of millions of devices during a global pandemic. Last year, ten days elapsed between the launch event and the first iPhones that went on sale.\n\n\u201cIt remains somewhat speculative when exactly iPhones will be available for sale after this event as Apple typically announces the first day of sale during the event,\u201d Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong wrote in a note this past week.\n\nTiming matters for investors because Apple\u2019s first fiscal quarter has already started, kicking off on September 27. In past years, some new iPhone models have been on sale for the entire period, but this year that won\u2019t be possible. \n\nThe number of weeks in the quarter that the new iPhones are on sale could affect Apple\u2019s performance in the critical holiday quarter, as people around the world buy iPhones and other products as holiday gifts.\n\niPhone timing can also suggest which models might be in short supply, which investors watch closely to try and predict average selling prices for the quarter, which affects revenue.\n\nApple said earlier this year that Mac computers with chips it designed would start to ship before the end of the year. Current Mac computers use Intel chips. But those computers are likely not going to be discussed on Tuesday, according to a report from Bloomberg. Instead, Apple could save that product for a November launch event, which would be Apple\u2019s third of the fall.\n\nIn past years, Apple has only held one or two fall launch events. But this year\u2019s launches are different \u2014 they\u2019re prerecorded and held virtually due to the pandemic. There is also continuing appetite for Apple launches from customers, media, and fans. Nearly 1.5 million people tuned in to a YouTube livestream last month to watch Apple executives announce new Apple Watches. \n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/11/apple-event-tuesday-the-most-significant-iphone-event-in-years.html)",
