        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 20th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings will decide whether the market continues to hit new highs after another week of records  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/earnings-will-decide-whether-market-continues-to-hit-new-highs.html)**\n*****\n&gt; With the Chinese trade deal out of the way, earnings could be the biggest driver for stocks in the week ahead, as big tech, financial, consumer and industrial companies report.\n*****\n&gt; So far, the early rush of earnings are beating estimates at a pace of about 70%. Just a few dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report in the four-day trading week, including IBM Tuesday and Intel on Thursday. Johnson &amp; Johnson reports Wednesday; Procter &amp; Gamble is Thursday, and American Express releases results Friday. The stock market is closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump travels to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum, where he speaks Tuesday. With the China trade deal signed this past Wednesday, strategists say they are now watching for any signs of a bigger trade row brewing between the U.S. and Europe.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports, including existing home sales Wednesday; leading indicators Thursday, and the Markit PMI data for manufacturing and services on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; But it\u2019s earnings, where investors will take the pulse of corporate America, and decide whether forward guidance is justifying the stock market\u2019s record highs and price earnings ratio of more than 18.5. The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 2% in the past week, its best week since August. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,329 Friday and is now up about 3% since the start of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow and Nasdaq also ended the week at new highs. The Dow ended up 1.9% for the week, at 29,348. The Nasdaq rose 2.3% in the past week, ending at 9,388.\n*****\n&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse, said the fourth quarter could be a turning point for earnings, after a poor performance in 2019. So far, earnings are down about 0.8% this quarter, based on actual releases and estimates, according to Refinitiv. If not for the drag from energy companies, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies would have been 1.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201c2019 was a year of lousy earnings, and the fourth quarter is the end of a lousy year,\u201d said Golub. \u201cI think earnings surprises will be fine, but what the real story here is, it looks like magically the 2020 numbers are going to be much, much stronger than 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said there are two big themes this earnings season. \u201cThe first one is tech-related companies. Many of the mega caps had okay earnings, but their margins were under a lot of pressure and it subtracted earnings growth in 2019. Those trends are supposed to reverse. So what was a negative because of easy comps becomes a positive,\u201d Golub said. \u201cThe same thing with the energy sector which was a disaster in terms of earnings growth in 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market rally can continue in part because investors are not yet on board with the earnings story.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile everybody is looking at the fourth quarter, I think they\u2019re not really reading the right script, and the script they should be reading was this was the last quarter where tech margins and energy sector headwinds are overwhelming the market,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The hearings on Trump\u2019s impeachment are so far ignored by markets and will be underway in the Senate. While the market continues to shrug it off, traders are monitoring the situation for any change in tone.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWill there be new evidence/witnesses at the Senate trial to make it politically significant?,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Alan Ruskin. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that for many voters, the President seems to be the main motivator for voters on both sides of the political spectrum \u2014 for and against. This argument runs along the lines that Trump is running against himself/\u2018the anti-Trump\u2019, and, the election will be heavily impacted by which Democrat candidate least impacts the \u2018anti-Trump\u2019 vote \u2014 a view that some argue tends to support centrists like Biden.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7YCrtpo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9jQCYRG.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXureFC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/3upRv6z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O07l30Z.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BjiCdpH.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/w5fgr9y.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/L81ewyy.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vroSSfA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MMO35Qf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/dCxJl8u.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading Mixed since 1998, But Improving Lately\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 22 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.79% by DJIA to 0.14% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last eight years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef3ff1e52532ea69e189a7cd90e7b27/bf3ce263396269e9-14/s500x750/4fc5ea153df07c1e2ab94f583409f214f2eae3c6.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Closer Look At Election Years\n\n&gt; 2020 is off to a roaring start, picking up right where 2019 left off. Many investors are eyeing the upcoming presidential election as an impending storm for the stock market. In the four-year presidential cycle, pre-election years have tended to be the strongest for stocks, as sitting presidents have taken measures to boost the economy and stock market higher to garner votes. It sure worked out well last year, with the S&amp;P 500 Index\u2019s 31% total return.\n\n&gt; Returns in election years, however, have been quite bifurcated.\n\n&gt; \u201cIf an incumbent president was up for reelection, stocks tended to do extremely well,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOn the other hand, if there was a lame duck president in office, returns were quite muted.\u201d\n\n&gt; Note that a \u201clame duck president\u201d means the sitting president either isn\u2019t running for reelection or has already fulfilled the maximum two terms. It makes sense, as the president could be less motivated to do things to heat up the economy if they know they are leaving office. Possibly, investors may also get cold feet knowing a change is coming. The S&amp;P 500 was down in 2000 and 2008, and the sitting president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d both years.\n\n&gt; In the LPL Chart of the Day, we break down election years by whether the president was running for reelection or a lame duck. The chart shows the S&amp;P 500 up an impressive 11.7% on average if the President was running for reelection, compared to up an average of 2.4% if president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d.\n\n&gt; Given most presidents who have run a second time have tended to win, this could be the market\u2019s way of saying it is comfortable with the status quo over change.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another encouraging historical trend is that the S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t been lower during an election year with an incumbent president up for reelection since 1940. To be clear, stocks have been up during election years when the incumbent president actually lost. In 1980, the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 26%, but Jimmy Carter still lost to Ronald Reagan. In other words, this does support the notion of higher stocks in 2020, but higher stocks can\u2019t always tell you who will win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Q4 Earnings Season is All About 2020\n\n&gt; Fourth quarter earnings season kicked off this week with 24 S&amp;P 500 Index companies slated to report results. Our expectations are for a marginal increase in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis, based on current FactSet consensus estimates (-2% year over year) and the average historical upside of roughly 3 percentage points.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve become accustomed to meager earnings growth. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if fourth quarter results are anywhere near expectations, 2019 will end up as a year with S&amp;P 500 returns of more than 30% and no corporate earnings growth to speak of. That means expanding stock valuations drove the market\u2019s gains last year, a trend we do not expect to continue.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Earnings-blog-011520-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWe expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWith valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Accordingly, the key to this reporting season will be whether the optimistic growth outlook reflected in consensus earnings estimates for this year remains intact after companies issue guidance. Many companies will be commenting on 2020 for the first time. Our estimate of $175 per share in S&amp;P 500 EPS for the entire year represents a 6\u20137% increase from our $165 forecast for 2019. Based on the latest consensus estimates, that growth rate may get pushed up a bit. We still think $175 is attainable if capital investment picks up after stalling last year and wage growth remains stable.\n\n&gt; Trade progress may help. The United States and China will sign the phase-one trade deal later today. While negotiations on the next phase will be tougher and could even stall out, businesses would welcome the additional clarity that de-escalation can provide, something that clearly weighed on corporate profits last year.\n\n*****\n\n# January Off To Stronger Than Usual Start \u2013 But 2nd Half Is Weaker\n\n&gt; Stocks are off to a stronger that usual so far in January 2020 when compared in the chart above to the average performance over the most recent 21-year period. As of today\u2019s close DJIA is up 1.41%, S&amp;P 500 +1.61%, NASDAQ leads the pack +3.11% and the Russell 2000 was in the red until the past two days and is now up 0.44%. This is well above historical average performance in recent Januarys.\n\n&gt; The market was up nicely today until reports hit the newswires at about 1:30 pm ET creating uncertainty that the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed tomorrow between the US and China may be pabulum. The realization that the tariffs on Chinese goods may remain in place until after the election as the review process runs its course drove stocks lower this afternoon. The market gave back most of its early gains with only the Dow and Russell 2000 eking out gains today.\n\n&gt; However, as you can see in the dotted lines so far in 2020 the indices are tracking the last 21-years rather closely. If the pattern continues to pan out this year, look for a little strength over the next two days. Then weakness has been prone to appear just after mid-month after the eleventh trading day with mild average losses from on or around the eleventh trading day to the fourteenth trading day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2f102c5c61bd803b4bc407e8c4812e3/1b34c8a8e7ad3e39-e9/s500x750/829ff7ea82b52109b737d17e4b24cb0a4d28e434.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Jackpot for Stocks\n\n&gt; Solid across the board gains this year have put another January Trifecta Jackpot in our sights for 2020. So far our January Trifecta is two for two. Our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system came in positive up 0.7% on January 8 following up on a positive reading for our Santa Claus Rally (SCR) on January 3. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month\u2019s end.\n\n&gt; We just published an update on The Incredible January Barometer: Only 11 Major Errors in 82 Years that runs through the reasons behind the efficacy of the January. We discuss how the passage of the Twentieth \u201cLame Duck\u201d Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 created the January Barometer. We also compare the January Barometer results along with the full year results, the following eleven months results, and the subsequent twelve months results to all other \u201cMonthly Barometers\u201d using the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite\n\n&gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table below). In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing \u201cLast 11 Mon\u201d years, in the table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 \u201319.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.\n\n&gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain decent. Of the last 10 times since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.\n\n&gt; A positive SCR and FFD are encouraging and further clarity will be gained when the January Barometer (page 16, 2020 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac) reports at month\u2019s end. A positive January Barometer would certainly boost prospects for full-year 2020. The December Low Indicator (2020 STA, page 34) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow\u2019s December Closing Low of 27502.81 on 12/3/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1bcaf64028a60761e27f90b96cd50a5/be57098a98452149-c8/s500x750/8bde32d516bf2811adabb784ab6de926796ad504.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equities Closing In On A Breakout\n\n&gt; Below is a chart of the Bloomberg World Equity Market index, which is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 publicly listed companies around the world (including the US). While the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 15% from its January 2018 high, it's notable that we still haven't seen equities break out on a global scale. As shown, the Bloomberg World Index is now just a hair below its prior all-time highs (22 basis points to be exact).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-BBG-World.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-SP-5-years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Three Months And Counting Since Last 1% Decline\n\n&gt; It has now been over three months since the S&amp;P 500's last decline of 1% or more back on 10/9. While it seems like an eternity, the current streak of 67 trading days is nowhere near any sort of record on either a long or short-term basis. The chart below shows historical streaks without a decline of 1%+ for the S&amp;P 500 dating back to 1928. The record for the longest streak was back in 1963 when the S&amp;P 500 went 174 trading days - a full eight months - without a 1% drop. Even more impressive is the fact that in both the 1950s and 1960s there were numerous streaks of 100 or more days. For a decade that is looked back on as one with a lot of upheaval in the US, the 1960s was a period of relative calm for the equity market.\n\n&gt; More recently, the current streak of 67 trading days doesn't look all that impressive relative to streaks we saw back in 2017 and 2018. Right after the election in 2016 and into March of 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had a 109-day streak without a 1% decline, and then from late 2017 through January 2018, there was another streak of 112 trading days without a 1% drop. Even in October 2018, there was another streak of 74 trading days. In other words, in just the last three years there have been three longer streaks without a 1% decline than the current one. In the S&amp;P 500's history, there have been 26 other streaks that have been as long or longer than the current one, and half of those went on to last at least 100 trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011420-Streaks-Without-a-1-Percent-Decline.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 17th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$TAL** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$TEAM** \n&gt; * **$KMI** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SWKS** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$MBWM** \n&gt; * **$TXN** \n&gt; * **$COF** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$UNP** \n&gt; * **$AMTD** \n&gt; * **$FNB** \n&gt; * **$SBNY** \n&gt; * **$RCI** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$STM** \n&gt; * **$AUB** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$BKR** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$NAVI** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$APH** \n&gt; * **$NTRS** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$TER** \n&gt; * **$ZION**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/cCUTW9b.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/HZqsu6j.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 20th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings will decide whether the market continues to hit new highs after another week of records  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/earnings-will-decide-whether-market-continues-to-hit-new-highs.html)**\n*****\n&gt; With the Chinese trade deal out of the way, earnings could be the biggest driver for stocks in the week ahead, as big tech, financial, consumer and industrial companies report.\n*****\n&gt; So far, the early rush of earnings are beating estimates at a pace of about 70%. Just a few dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report in the four-day trading week, including IBM Tuesday and Intel on Thursday. Johnson &amp; Johnson reports Wednesday; Procter &amp; Gamble is Thursday, and American Express releases results Friday. The stock market is closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump travels to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum, where he speaks Tuesday. With the China trade deal signed this past Wednesday, strategists say they are now watching for any signs of a bigger trade row brewing between the U.S. and Europe.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports, including existing home sales Wednesday; leading indicators Thursday, and the Markit PMI data for manufacturing and services on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; But it\u2019s earnings, where investors will take the pulse of corporate America, and decide whether forward guidance is justifying the stock market\u2019s record highs and price earnings ratio of more than 18.5. The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 2% in the past week, its best week since August. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,329 Friday and is now up about 3% since the start of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow and Nasdaq also ended the week at new highs. The Dow ended up 1.9% for the week, at 29,348. The Nasdaq rose 2.3% in the past week, ending at 9,388.\n*****\n&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse, said the fourth quarter could be a turning point for earnings, after a poor performance in 2019. So far, earnings are down about 0.8% this quarter, based on actual releases and estimates, according to Refinitiv. If not for the drag from energy companies, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies would have been 1.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201c2019 was a year of lousy earnings, and the fourth quarter is the end of a lousy year,\u201d said Golub. \u201cI think earnings surprises will be fine, but what the real story here is, it looks like magically the 2020 numbers are going to be much, much stronger than 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said there are two big themes this earnings season. \u201cThe first one is tech-related companies. Many of the mega caps had okay earnings, but their margins were under a lot of pressure and it subtracted earnings growth in 2019. Those trends are supposed to reverse. So what was a negative because of easy comps becomes a positive,\u201d Golub said. \u201cThe same thing with the energy sector which was a disaster in terms of earnings growth in 2019.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market rally can continue in part because investors are not yet on board with the earnings story.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile everybody is looking at the fourth quarter, I think they\u2019re not really reading the right script, and the script they should be reading was this was the last quarter where tech margins and energy sector headwinds are overwhelming the market,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The hearings on Trump\u2019s impeachment are so far ignored by markets and will be underway in the Senate. While the market continues to shrug it off, traders are monitoring the situation for any change in tone.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWill there be new evidence/witnesses at the Senate trial to make it politically significant?,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Alan Ruskin. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that for many voters, the President seems to be the main motivator for voters on both sides of the political spectrum \u2014 for and against. This argument runs along the lines that Trump is running against himself/\u2018the anti-Trump\u2019, and, the election will be heavily impacted by which Democrat candidate least impacts the \u2018anti-Trump\u2019 vote \u2014 a view that some argue tends to support centrists like Biden.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7YCrtpo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9jQCYRG.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/oXureFC.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/3upRv6z.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/O07l30Z.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BjiCdpH.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/w5fgr9y.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/L81ewyy.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vroSSfA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MMO35Qf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/dCxJl8u.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading Mixed since 1998, But Improving Lately\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 22 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.79% by DJIA to 0.14% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last eight years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef3ff1e52532ea69e189a7cd90e7b27/bf3ce263396269e9-14/s500x750/4fc5ea153df07c1e2ab94f583409f214f2eae3c6.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Closer Look At Election Years\n\n&gt; 2020 is off to a roaring start, picking up right where 2019 left off. Many investors are eyeing the upcoming presidential election as an impending storm for the stock market. In the four-year presidential cycle, pre-election years have tended to be the strongest for stocks, as sitting presidents have taken measures to boost the economy and stock market higher to garner votes. It sure worked out well last year, with the S&amp;P 500 Index\u2019s 31% total return.\n\n&gt; Returns in election years, however, have been quite bifurcated.\n\n&gt; \u201cIf an incumbent president was up for reelection, stocks tended to do extremely well,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOn the other hand, if there was a lame duck president in office, returns were quite muted.\u201d\n\n&gt; Note that a \u201clame duck president\u201d means the sitting president either isn\u2019t running for reelection or has already fulfilled the maximum two terms. It makes sense, as the president could be less motivated to do things to heat up the economy if they know they are leaving office. Possibly, investors may also get cold feet knowing a change is coming. The S&amp;P 500 was down in 2000 and 2008, and the sitting president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d both years.\n\n&gt; In the LPL Chart of the Day, we break down election years by whether the president was running for reelection or a lame duck. The chart shows the S&amp;P 500 up an impressive 11.7% on average if the President was running for reelection, compared to up an average of 2.4% if president was a \u201clame duck president\u201d.\n\n&gt; Given most presidents who have run a second time have tended to win, this could be the market\u2019s way of saying it is comfortable with the status quo over change.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Another encouraging historical trend is that the S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t been lower during an election year with an incumbent president up for reelection since 1940. To be clear, stocks have been up during election years when the incumbent president actually lost. In 1980, the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 26%, but Jimmy Carter still lost to Ronald Reagan. In other words, this does support the notion of higher stocks in 2020, but higher stocks can\u2019t always tell you who will win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Q4 Earnings Season is All About 2020\n\n&gt; Fourth quarter earnings season kicked off this week with 24 S&amp;P 500 Index companies slated to report results. Our expectations are for a marginal increase in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis, based on current FactSet consensus estimates (-2% year over year) and the average historical upside of roughly 3 percentage points.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve become accustomed to meager earnings growth. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if fourth quarter results are anywhere near expectations, 2019 will end up as a year with S&amp;P 500 returns of more than 30% and no corporate earnings growth to speak of. That means expanding stock valuations drove the market\u2019s gains last year, a trend we do not expect to continue.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Earnings-blog-011520-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWe expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWith valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Accordingly, the key to this reporting season will be whether the optimistic growth outlook reflected in consensus earnings estimates for this year remains intact after companies issue guidance. Many companies will be commenting on 2020 for the first time. Our estimate of $175 per share in S&amp;P 500 EPS for the entire year represents a 6\u20137% increase from our $165 forecast for 2019. Based on the latest consensus estimates, that growth rate may get pushed up a bit. We still think $175 is attainable if capital investment picks up after stalling last year and wage growth remains stable.\n\n&gt; Trade progress may help. The United States and China will sign the phase-one trade deal later today. While negotiations on the next phase will be tougher and could even stall out, businesses would welcome the additional clarity that de-escalation can provide, something that clearly weighed on corporate profits last year.\n\n*****\n\n# January Off To Stronger Than Usual Start \u2013 But 2nd Half Is Weaker\n\n&gt; Stocks are off to a stronger that usual so far in January 2020 when compared in the chart above to the average performance over the most recent 21-year period. As of today\u2019s close DJIA is up 1.41%, S&amp;P 500 +1.61%, NASDAQ leads the pack +3.11% and the Russell 2000 was in the red until the past two days and is now up 0.44%. This is well above historical average performance in recent Januarys.\n\n&gt; The market was up nicely today until reports hit the newswires at about 1:30 pm ET creating uncertainty that the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed tomorrow between the US and China may be pabulum. The realization that the tariffs on Chinese goods may remain in place until after the election as the review process runs its course drove stocks lower this afternoon. The market gave back most of its early gains with only the Dow and Russell 2000 eking out gains today.\n\n&gt; However, as you can see in the dotted lines so far in 2020 the indices are tracking the last 21-years rather closely. If the pattern continues to pan out this year, look for a little strength over the next two days. Then weakness has been prone to appear just after mid-month after the eleventh trading day with mild average losses from on or around the eleventh trading day to the fourteenth trading day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2f102c5c61bd803b4bc407e8c4812e3/1b34c8a8e7ad3e39-e9/s500x750/829ff7ea82b52109b737d17e4b24cb0a4d28e434.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# January Trifecta Jackpot for Stocks\n\n&gt; Solid across the board gains this year have put another January Trifecta Jackpot in our sights for 2020. So far our January Trifecta is two for two. Our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system came in positive up 0.7% on January 8 following up on a positive reading for our Santa Claus Rally (SCR) on January 3. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month\u2019s end.\n\n&gt; We just published an update on The Incredible January Barometer: Only 11 Major Errors in 82 Years that runs through the reasons behind the efficacy of the January. We discuss how the passage of the Twentieth \u201cLame Duck\u201d Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 created the January Barometer. We also compare the January Barometer results along with the full year results, the following eleven months results, and the subsequent twelve months results to all other \u201cMonthly Barometers\u201d using the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite\n\n&gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table below). In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing \u201cLast 11 Mon\u201d years, in the table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 \u201319.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.\n\n&gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain decent. Of the last 10 times since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.\n\n&gt; A positive SCR and FFD are encouraging and further clarity will be gained when the January Barometer (page 16, 2020 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac) reports at month\u2019s end. A positive January Barometer would certainly boost prospects for full-year 2020. The December Low Indicator (2020 STA, page 34) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow\u2019s December Closing Low of 27502.81 on 12/3/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1bcaf64028a60761e27f90b96cd50a5/be57098a98452149-c8/s500x750/8bde32d516bf2811adabb784ab6de926796ad504.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equities Closing In On A Breakout\n\n&gt; Below is a chart of the Bloomberg World Equity Market index, which is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 publicly listed companies around the world (including the US). While the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 15% from its January 2018 high, it's notable that we still haven't seen equities break out on a global scale. As shown, the Bloomberg World Index is now just a hair below its prior all-time highs (22 basis points to be exact).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-BBG-World.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-SP-5-years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Three Months And Counting Since Last 1% Decline\n\n&gt; It has now been over three months since the S&amp;P 500's last decline of 1% or more back on 10/9. While it seems like an eternity, the current streak of 67 trading days is nowhere near any sort of record on either a long or short-term basis. The chart below shows historical streaks without a decline of 1%+ for the S&amp;P 500 dating back to 1928. The record for the longest streak was back in 1963 when the S&amp;P 500 went 174 trading days - a full eight months - without a 1% drop. Even more impressive is the fact that in both the 1950s and 1960s there were numerous streaks of 100 or more days. For a decade that is looked back on as one with a lot of upheaval in the US, the 1960s was a period of relative calm for the equity market.\n\n&gt; More recently, the current streak of 67 trading days doesn't look all that impressive relative to streaks we saw back in 2017 and 2018. Right after the election in 2016 and into March of 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had a 109-day streak without a 1% decline, and then from late 2017 through January 2018, there was another streak of 112 trading days without a 1% drop. Even in October 2018, there was another streak of 74 trading days. In other words, in just the last three years there have been three longer streaks without a 1% decline than the current one. In the S&amp;P 500's history, there have been 26 other streaks that have been as long or longer than the current one, and half of those went on to last at least 100 trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011420-Streaks-Without-a-1-Percent-Decline.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 17th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.12.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$TAL** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$TEAM** \n&gt; * **$KMI** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SWKS** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$MBWM** \n&gt; * **$TXN** \n&gt; * **$COF** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$UNP** \n&gt; * **$AMTD** \n&gt; * **$FNB** \n&gt; * **$SBNY** \n&gt; * **$RCI** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$STM** \n&gt; * **$AUB** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$BKR** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$NAVI** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$APH** \n&gt; * **$NTRS** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$TER** \n&gt; * **$ZION**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NE6QICD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/cCUTW9b.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/HZqsu6j.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.
