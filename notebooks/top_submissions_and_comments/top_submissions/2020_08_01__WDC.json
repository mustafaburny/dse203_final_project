I'm not sure if its better to just put everything into a handful of companies, or if its better to have a small stake in many companies.",

        "selftext": "I am not one to typically follow or pay attention to the investing of those that consider themselves \"professionals\", but when it comes to the man, the myth, the legend, Dr. Michael Burry, I do. Recently, his fund, Scion Asset Management, filed it's 13-F Filing and there was some interesting information in it. (Bear in mind, some of these positions could be a few months old, however since I am focusing on the call options in his portfolio many of these positions would most likely be long-term and therefore would still be valid investments). Of note, Burry had 16 call positions which represented 71.19% of his portfolio. I would suspect that these are LEAP options (at least one year options) and not short-term call options, which clearly shows that he believes the economy has seen the worst of the coronavirus and is poised for a recovery. The reason I suspect Burry is invested in LEAP options is due to their tendency to be mispriced and cheaper than holding a higher priced stock like GOOG or BKNG long-term. They would offer far more upside than just holding the stock itself. We also know from history that Michael Burry is not a short-term investor and his \"Big Short\" positions, which were also derivatives, took over one year to profit. With that in mind here are the companies that made up the biggest positions in his call options:\n\nGOOG (36% of his portfolio)\n\nFB (7%)\n\nBKNG (6%)\n\nGS (5%)\n\nWDC (4%)\n\nVarious other companies made up his other positions which primarily consisted of energy, retail, gaming (casino) and financial companies. All these companies are in sectors which are market laggards currently, but would increase dramatically with a market recovery, hence his use of call options. From looking at his portfolio, it is evident Michael Burry is bullish on the market and believes that it is set to recover. He is clearly betting on higher interest rates in the future (financial stocks), higher energy prices (energy stocks), higher consumer spending (retail stocks), increased discretionary spending (casino/gaming/travel stocks), and overall increase in the dominant tech stocks (FB/GOOG). I think this is a solid portfolio and thesis. I am not one to argue with the legend and I will be following his lead into some of the stocks he has bought. Specifically GOOG, WYNN, LVS, JPM, BAC, GS calls.\n\nLINK TO OVERVIEW OF THE 13-F filing:\n\n[https://fintel.io/i13f/scion-asset-management-llc/2020-06-30-0](https://fintel.io/i13f/scion-asset-management-llc/2020-06-30-0)",

        "selftext": "So we've done pretty good in the last week and in yesterday's alerts with multiple alerts panning out really well e.g **$AAPL, $MELI, $SRNE, $NVAX, $SQ, $NKLA, $KNDI, $NFLX. $PDD** etc. I also posted a [detailed spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fT2P9JKxmnyZFFXEOl9QWBsqAqzTwYi-UXSPJ2InECw/edit?usp=sharing) with results from the last week. We had an accuracy of **75%** last week. Some alerts like **$TDOC** also did not pan out yesterday which just shows that the tool is not 100% perfect.\n\nThe tool is still very new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes.\n\nBullish    means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the current     close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means the stock is  expected to stay the same or go low in the next few days.\n\n# Bullish Alerts\n\n**$ILMN** \\- Bullish probability of 88.43%. I know this dropped hard today but the tool is bullish on it. If it starts to go back, it will be a good setup. If it continue going down, don't get in. **Risky setup, careful!**\n\n**$NVAX** \\- Bullish probability of 77.14%. I like that it dropped today. Either get in if it touches the support at $160 and bounces back or get in on a pull back at the moving averages ([https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png](https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png))\n\n**$LULU** \\- Bullish probability of 74.80%. Seems like a good setup, especially with a small pullback ([https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png](https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png))\n\n**$FSLY** \\- Bullish probability of 74.46%. This dropped right at its 50 MA. A good setup as long as the price stays above 50MA ([https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png](https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png)). Exit otherwise.\n\n# Bearish Alerts\n\n**$BAC** \\-  Bearish probability of 86.76%. I like it for a bearish setup if it can below the support of $25.2 ([https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png](https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png)).\n\n**$ZNGA** \\-  Bearish probability of 83.96%. This is at a very strong support level at $9.9. **Do not get in unless it breaks the support** ([https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png](https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png)).\n\n**$GILD** \\-  Bearish probability of 82.68%. Might go up a bit before going down further. Healthcare stocks are risky though so be careful.\n\n**$WDC** \\-  Bearish probability of 82.66%. Only a good setup if price stays below the support level of $37.8 ([https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png](https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png))\n\n \n\n**Note:**  A lot of time has gone into these tools and it takes time to write  these alerts, look at    charts, and post them here. Would love for you  guys to **try out our** [discord](https://discord.gg/X2hHeJ) **channel** where I post alerts from various tools, not just the options one. Please hit me up if you want to link, it's free to join.\n\n**If you don't like these alerts, please don't be a hater, just ignore them. They are not perfect and I know that.**",

AMAT is a great company, but they are already built out. ONTO has that TAM SAM gap to fill in addition to eating market share and the growing industry. I wouldn't be shocked if AMAT or LRCX buys ONTO, frankly. It would make sense.\n\nThey have Advanced node and advanced packaging. As customers move toward 3nm 6th gen dual layer, they need Atlas III. And with pattern control software with machine learning, they provide an end to end solution.

This was before the good ISM numbers came in well above both expectations and last months number.  By the end of the day the DJIA was +373.05 (1.39%), NASDAQ +57.24 (.52%), S&amp;P 500 +21.26 (.64%), the Russell the big winner +29.02 (1.91%), and the DJ Transports +128.75 (1.28%).  Market internals were a sold 2:1 on both NYSE and NASDAQ and NYSE volume was better at 3:1 up.
