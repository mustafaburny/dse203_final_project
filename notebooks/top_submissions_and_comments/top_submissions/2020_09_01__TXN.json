        "selftext": "I won't cover why the market could potentially turn bearish, that's written about elsewhere. See here if you need a starting point:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/imub3c/gay\\_bears\\_the\\_time\\_has\\_come\\_free\\_tendies\\_inside/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/imub3c/gay_bears_the_time_has_come_free_tendies_inside/)\n\nI just read about a new development in the China trade war. The US is considering imposing export restrictions on China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/05/us-considers-blacklisting-chinas-largest-chipmaker-as-tech-tensions-escalate.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/05/us-considers-blacklisting-chinas-largest-chipmaker-as-tech-tensions-escalate.html)\n\nWhat's that? They're a partially government owned company that manufactures semiconductors for companies like Qualcomm ($QCOM), Broadcom ($AVGO), and Texas Instruments ($TXN)\n\nWith tech overbought on a level not seen since the dot-com bubble and the China trade war potentially cutting off one of the key manufacturers of semiconductors to the three major companies that can make 5g chipsets, I'm not very bullish on technology right now.\n\nThe SoC used to implement wireless modems in most of our mobile devices is made by $QCOM and they rely on SMIC to manufacture it.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-smic/qualcomm-turns-to-chinas-smic-for-snapdragon-chip-production-idUSKBN0F825Y20140703](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-smic/qualcomm-turns-to-chinas-smic-for-snapdragon-chip-production-idUSKBN0F825Y20140703)\n\nNot only this but there were major security flaws in Qualcomm chips disclosed recently: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/08/06/hundreds-of-millions-of-android-phones-can-spy-on-users-as-400-snapdragon-security-flaws-confirmed-qualcomm-google-lg-samsung-oneplus/#336b149660b2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/08/06/hundreds-of-millions-of-android-phones-can-spy-on-users-as-400-snapdragon-security-flaws-confirmed-qualcomm-google-lg-samsung-oneplus/#336b149660b2) \n\nAlso, Qualcomm's modems are not only found in Android devices: [https://www.macworld.com/article/3527277/qualcomm-x60-5g-modem-apple-iphone.html](https://www.macworld.com/article/3527277/qualcomm-x60-5g-modem-apple-iphone.html) \n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138264/apple-5g-antenna-qualcomm-x55-modem-mmwave-iphone-2020-rumor](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138264/apple-5g-antenna-qualcomm-x55-modem-mmwave-iphone-2020-rumor)\n\nbut also the iPhone, and they're making the 5g modem for the iPhone too.\n\nSo you can see why the stock has run up so high! The China trade war will slow 5g adoption, and short term this will be bad for tech stocks.\n\nHave a look at my shitty $QCOM TA, and see how this is unprecedented this is. There there is plenty of room for it to fall.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ou7rq8y50gl51.png?width=3070&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb90639560032efd2beff4340e504299fd482e4b\n\nWe could see the biggest tech plunge since the .com bust. Don't believe me? Fine, keep buying calls because stocks only go up.\n\nOverbought Stocks + China Scare = 2018 all over again = buy some fucking puts\n\n**How to play it:**\n\nFor the short term play:\n\nQCOM $100P 9/25\n\nFor the mid-term play (this means you think the bubble will pop, which btw makes you a full on \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b)\n\nQCOM $70P 1/15/2021",

        "selftext": "I tried posting in the megathread, but as usual didn\u2019t get any attention after a few days. I want to share my portfolio and my predicament. To start off, I already have two funded retirement accounts through work, so this account is really my \u201cpersonal investing\u201d pot. Here are my allocations are this moment:\n\nAAPL 27.00%\nTXN 21.51%\nKO 17.71%\nNET 13.48%\nARKF 8.59%\nVNQ 3.62%\nBOXL 2.52%\nVDC 2.47%\nCash 2.41%\n\nOne of my work accounts is pensioned, and the other is more of a typical investing account which is basically all in a Vanguard target retire fund. For my personal portfolio, you\u2019ll see I have a spread of stable growth (AAPL, TXN), speculation (NET, ARKF, BOXL), and long term stability (KO, VNQ, VDC). I know that KO makes up about 10% of VDC though I\u2019m not really concerned about the exposure level - I\u2019ve owned the KO shares for a few years and only got into buying more tickers this year. Im basically torn on two paths right now:\n\nTake more advantage of my age (mid 20s) and move into more speculative/high growth investments, or rush 100 KO/AAPL shares to begin selling covered calls on for passive income. Maybe I need to load some more into my stable pots first before doing either. Or some combination of those, but I feel like I want to move in every direction right now.",
