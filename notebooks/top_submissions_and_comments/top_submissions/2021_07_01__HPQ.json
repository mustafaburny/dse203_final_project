        "selftext": "I've been one of those who dump their money into savings account carefree most of my life (29 yrs old female).\n\nBut I was always aware of that I had been sitting on too much cash and didn't know where to start. In May I finally bought mutual funds from Scotiabank with MER of almost 2% just to get things started. My maxed out TFSA and RRSP are all contributed to those mutual funds. (80% bonds, 20% equity)\nExperienced investors may laugh but I have been very happy with 1.6% of return since May.\n\nBut I am not quite sure if MER 2% can be justifiable? Are mutual funds from major banks better managed and safer than ETFs that have 0.25% of MER? Or is it just a rip off? Or will it provide any cushion in case of market crash? (Wild dream)\nWhat are the differences of actively managed mutual funds and actively managed ETFs? Should I change to ETFs?\n\nI also tried a little bit of trading as well with extra savings (I still have 50K left in savings), bought HPQ and had return of 4% over a couple of weeks. So my willingness to take more risks went up and put more money into my trading account, now I have 12K. Bought VBAL, VFV mainly. But returns will be taxable since it's not out of TFSA or RRSP.\n\nShould I move all my tax free funds to ETFs? Any suggestions or advice please?",

        "selftext": "Ok so I decided to do some research into HPQ today and it seems so undervalued that it just seems to good to be true. First, their trading at a P/E of just 9.76, which would usually mean that their going to decline but in reality their still projected to grow by analysts and their 2022 FWD P/E is just 7.6. Also, their current price to free cash flow is less than 6 which is ridiculously low. Then, not only do they have a good dividend yield of almost 3%, they are also aggressively buying back shares. lastly, HPQ has a P/S of about 0.5 which makes sense because of the low profit margin but that's still extremely low. Lastly, they have a 9% return on equity which is good for such a large company. So, WHAT THE FUCK AM I MISSING. Everything about this is a screaming buy but it just seems to good to be true. Ya'll got any ideas.",

Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\tWe've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Disclaimer:*\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice\\*\\**\n\n*\\*\\*Do your own research\\*\\**",

        "selftext": "Desktop Metal\n\nhttps://youtu.be/scHCL05s7ZU\n\nThe sector:\n\nThe uptake of 3d printing in additive manufacturing has been much slower than had been predicted a decade ago. 3d printing just hasn\u2019t been efficient enough, one of those big inefficiencies is the speed in which 3d printing is done, it is just to slow and thus can\u2019t produce at the volume that is needed to mass produce in sectors like the auto industry. So 3d printing in additive manufacturing has been left for prototyping, customization, and other low volume orders. The innovation will come, and the economic benefits will be enormous. It will drive down costs, a lower average total cost per unit produced. This allows the manufacturer to lower the price and maintain the same margins. When prices are lowered demand increases. This is of course the law of demand, the relationship between price and demand, of course there is elasticity of demand that impacts how much the demand fluctuates based on what is being produced. Increases in wages will drive automation and incentive 3d printing in many industries. There is a clear correlation between wages and automation. The graphic below shows the anticipation or mania for 3d printing and then reality it hits, that most of the time the technology takes awhile to develop, at least takes awhile to develop many different use cases. \n\nhttps://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSmfXhL5PgKLs1K1yoHZvS6TBWWTd0CDSl1vg&amp;usqp=CAU\n\n\nDesktop Metal:\nDM has developed and patented technologies that allow them to print much faster than their competitors, thus allowing them to produce at a volume that Is significantly higher. The method they have developed is called \u201csingle pass jetting\u201d it can reportedly print up to 100 times faster than the traditional laser powder bed fusion printing. The argument is that the amount of parts that can be produced per year with desktop metal will be so much greater than the competition and that this will drive significant cost advantages. It is important to note that their 3d printing hardware, the 3d printers themselves are more costly. Desktop metal would argue it is a higher upfront cost that you would make back through the sheer volume that could be printed each year. You can see below that really only DM can produce at the volume needed for mass production. Like mentioned above the market has matured enough for the transition to 3d printing in mass as of yet. DM as of now is best positioned, however the longer the market takes to mature, the more time that DM competitors have to develop new technology. Also, just to mention Markforged has the best software AI combo. \n\nhttps://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTxrWNKaAKCDfnYdzni3lqol_4PAUNCrZPgGg&amp;usqp=CAU\n\n\nAnother positive for desktop metal is that it offers thousands of possible materials to print with. Ranging from metal alloys to ceramics. Also, with their studio system you can as the raw ingredient use metal rods as opposed to powders. Powders in general can be less efficient as they are literally millions of loose parts. They also offer a SAAS option where someone can custom design parts. SAAS in general offer much better margins that just selling hardware, this would have to hold to really drive future earnings, and help increase margins. Desktop Metal also offers a lower environmental impact than traditional 3d printing more so due to the reduction of waste that it produces. DM also has a lot of blue chip investors and partners like Google and Toyota just to mention a few out many. \n\nMergers and Acquisitions. DM has used this as a strategy. These acquisitions have allowed DM to grow their customer base, access to patented technology, and spread out into printing in medical technology. This is a stated goal of DM. Of course the valuation and overall value derived from these investments has yet to be quantified. In the short term it has provided new revenue streams, new tech, and access to new sectors. \n\n\nFinancials: The company saw a 234% increase in review during the last quarter, but it is undetermined whether that was organic growth or that came from their acquisitions. In 2020 just over 16 million in total revenue down significantly from 26 million in 2019. Management chalked that up to the pandemic. We will have to see if they can ramp that for the rest of the year. It really is an unknown their ability to execute is one the largest risks. Evidenced by them losing out on a Volkswagen contract to HPQ, despite having the better technology.   DM  is projecting to reach almost 1 billion in revenue by 2025, so that execution must get much sharper to make that goal, and most likely a growth in the overall sector. Everyone is always concerned about a capital raise, but DM is not cash strapped and has about 500 million in cash and shouldn\u2019t have to raise capital anytime soon. The valuation at 2.5 billion is ridiculous and bakes in some enormous growth. Financials are mixed, great growth first quarter 2021, 2020 was a down year, and the company has significant cash on hand. Unfortunately, and inflated valuation.\n\nConclusion: I like DM but it is a truly speculative investment. It does have the competitive advantage in possible volume produced per year, and the advantage is significant. However, the demand for 3d printing in additive manufacturing needs to increase for them to take advantage of their technological advantage. Patents provide moats, and they do have patents which protects their advantage. They are very aggressive in acquiring companies they believe provide them an edge, those acquisitions will require patience to determine what value they will return.  DM is worth a look at or around 9 dollars. It lowers the significant downside risk. Please watch the video for a more in depth break down.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/scHCL05s7ZU\n\nDisclaimer: I am long DM\nDisclosure: I own a small position in DM",
