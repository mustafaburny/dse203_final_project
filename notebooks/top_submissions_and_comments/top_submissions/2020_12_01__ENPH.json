        "selftext": "First of all, I am incredibly privileged. When my grandpa passed away in March, I inherited $30,000. I had $10,000 saved up as well from working the prior summer and that $10,000 was already invested in the stock market. In high school I found out about stocks in my economics class and the day I turned 18 I invested every penny I had. \n\nOnce again, I am privileged to be able to invest this money at all.. I have a college fund to pay my tuition, I don\u2019t have to worry about when my next meal is coming, and I have the freedom to spend my money as I choose. \n\nAnyways, in March &amp; April when the market crashed I decided it was time to really dive into the stock market. I spent about 5 hours every day researching companies and I\u2019m here to share what I\u2019ve learned. \n\nIn my opinion, **the** **companies** **you** **invest** **in** **should** **be** **an** **extension** **of** **your** **worldview.** Where do you think the world will be in 10 years+ and what industries will prosper from the change. As I was raised in a liberal family and hold these values, I\u2019m quite concerned with **Climate** **Change**. I\u2019ve taken college classes in this realm since and learned more about the risks we face. I believe that any company whose mission revolves around mitigating the climate crisis will prosper in the coming decades. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ll list the companies I hold and a very brief synopsis of what they do and why I hold their stock. **Please** **do** **your** **own** **research**; this is only meant to introduce young investors to a certain mindset that I hold and the companies that I choose to support. \n\n--------------------------\n\n**Tesla** **(TSLA)** \n\nportfolio weight: **22.86%**\n\ngain/loss **1026%** **gain**\n\nYou guys all know what Tesla is about. They are the premier EV company with goals of cutting battery costs by 56% and producing 20,000,000+ cars in the decade. They also have a growing energy business with solar roofs, panels, battery storage and an autobidder software. Tesla is priced insanely high by traditional metrics. If these metrics are your investing style then it\u2019s not for you. If you\u2019re like me, and you look for companies to hold for decades then I believe Tesla is one of the best investments out there. What other company will benefit from the transition to renewables in response to climate change and changing political conditions?\n\n----------------------------------\n\n**MP** **Materials** **(MP)**\n\nportfolio weight: **12.68%**\n\ngain/loss: **197%**  **gain**\n\nMP is the only active rare earth mineral miner in the U.S. They produce neodymium concentrates which are important components in NDPR magnets; used in EV motors, wind turbines, electronics &amp; much more. \n\nI bought MP during their early pre-merger days and have already seen considerable profits in a few months. I\u2019ve been shaving this position to keep it around 10% because it is a commodity play which can be quite risky. That being said, rare earths are expected to appreciate substantially in price as EV demand increases. Furthermore, MP is moving downstream to refine their rare earths themselves, as they currently ship them to China to be refined, and in the future they plan on manufacturing their own NDPR batteries. This will increase their margins greatly. \n\n----------------------------------\n\n**Planet** **13** **(PLNHF)**\n\nportfolio weight **5.35%**\n\ngain/loss: **147.71** **gain**\n\nThis one is a MJ stock and I\u2019m focusing mostly on my Climate Change investments on this post so I\u2019ll keep it brief. They own a superstore in Vegas and have their own brands. I believe the MJ industry is going to explode soon and PLNHF will benefit. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**Jinko** **Solar** **(JKS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **4.91%**\n\ngain/loss: **268.88%** **gain**\n\nJinko Solar is a leading solar panel manufacturer in China. They\u2019ve seen market consolidation in China and are poised to benefit from increasing demand and incentives around solar energy. Specifically, South East Asia is expected to see dramatic growth in renewables as China/India are responsible for a large portion of global emissions and are also seeing considerable growth in GDP and population. It\u2019s a play on the South East Asian economy and renewable industry. \n\n-------------------------------------\n\n**SolarEdge** **(SEDG)**:\n\nportfolio weight: **4.89%**\n\ngain/loss: **108.5%** **gain**\n\nSolarEdge is the global leader in panel inverters, which turn the sun\u2019s D.C. current into usable electricity for households (A.C. current). The inverter space is a much more consolidated industry with higher margins than panels. They trade at a more expensive multiple and are expected to see dramatic top and bottom line growth in the coming years. Solar panels need inverters to perform; simple as that. With fewer companies focused on this space, I expect the top players to have a large market share and grow along with the solar energy market. SEDG is also expanding into the energy storage and EV charging markets with recent acquisitions. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**Enphase** **Energy** **(ENPH)**\n\nportfolio weight: **4.43%** \n\ngain/loss: **203.08%** **gain**\n\nEnphase is also in the inverter market, with their differentiated microinverters. Micro Inverters are generally used in smaller systems and optimal for residential solar. Everything said above about the inverter market is true for Enphase as well. Enphase\u2019s business goes beyond inverters though. They are targeting a full residential energy ecosystem, with storage and their \u201cEnlighten\u201d software App, which will manage home energy usage and sell excess energy back to the grid. Enphase is very much a play on a future decentralized microgrid, with homes trading energy to each other as prices fluctuate. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**Canadian** **Solar** **(CSIQ)**\n\nportfolio weight: **4.42%**\n\ngain/loss: **118.32%** *gain**\n\nCanadian Solar is another panel manufacturing company. They are also seeing growth in market share as smaller players struggle during the pandemic. CSIQ is a low cost producer with residential, commercial and grid level projects. They are planning on expanding their recurring revenue stream through full and partial ownership of solar projects. You can read more about this on the IR page. CSIQ is a pure solar play with an international footprint and vast management expertise. They will certainly benefit from any movement towards renewables, especially if legislation is passed to set a price on carbon. \n\n--------------------------\n\n**Lemonade** **LMND** \n\nportfolio weight: **3.93%**\n\ngain/loss: **112.52** **gain**\n\nLemonade is not a climate change related investment. It\u2019s highly speculative but I think their management team and business model is really cool so I put some money in (and quickly more than doubled it). I\u2019ll be brief here, but basically they are a home/renter/pet insurance company that takes a flat 25% cut of premiums as revenue and uses the remaining money to pay out claims. They aim to align incentives by donating anything left over beyond the 25% to a charity of customers choosing. Also, their use of AI makes the registration and claims process seamless and \u201cdelights\u201d customers. \n\n----------------------------\n\n**TPI** **Composites** **(TPIC)**\n\nportfolio weight: **3.73%**\n\ngain/loss: **153.99%** **gain**\n\nTPIC manufacturers wind blade composites. They supply the top five wind turbine companies outside of China. I wrote about them on prior posts so I\u2019ll just copy &amp; paste here:\n63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with Workhorse to manufacture vehicle parts for them.\n-----------------------------\n\n**Skyworks** **Solutions** **(SWKS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.83%**\n\ngain/loss: **60.57%** **gain**\n\nSkyworks is a semiconductor focused on connectivity chips for all kinds of devices. They aren\u2019t climate change related which is the point of this post so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Tattooed** **Chef** **(TTCF)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.65%**\n\ngain/loss: **55.90** **gain**\n\nTattooed Chef is a play on the rising plant-based food trend. They make a variety of frozen food items, widely available in Walmart, Costco and Target. They are expanding into Whole Foods, Trader Joe\u2019s and many more stores, where I expect them to be very successful. The plant based market is exploding for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there is more research on the health benefits of a plant based diet, with athletes such as Chris Paul &amp; Todd Gurley endorsing these brands. Also, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the threat of climate change and how avoiding red meat can have a positive impact on the planet. I expect TTCF to benefit off of these trends and continue innovating in the plant-based space. I bought in 3 weeks ago and the price has exploded since then. \n\n-------------------------\n\n**Workhorse** **(WKHS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.60%**\n\ngain/loss: **35.90%** **gain**\n\nWorkhorse is an electric delivery van company. They manufacture last mile electric vehicles and are developing drones to further decrease last mile delivery costs. They are a play on the e-commerce industry and electrification of vehicles. I\u2019m invested in them because last mile delivery is responsible for a large chunk of transportation carbon emissions and in desperate need of electrification. I also believe that Workhorse will get a large chunk of the upcoming USPS contract which will provide a stable revenue stream.\n---------------------\n\n**Aphria** **(APHA)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.45%**\n\ngain/loss: **53%** **gain**\n\nAphria is another MJ play for me. Once again they aren\u2019t a climate change investment so I\u2019ll keep it brief. They just finalized a merger with Tilray, making them the biggest cannabis producer in the world. They are based in Canada and I believe they will be the market leader in Europe, due to their infrastructure advantage through owning CC Pharma.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**Vestas** **Wind** **Systems** **(VWDRY)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.40%**\n\ngain/loss: **197.44%** **gain**\n\nVestas is the global leader in wind turbine manufacturing and installation. They are one of the few pure wind plays in the stock market, making them an attractive choice for anybody looking to get exposure to wind. A big driver if future growth will be their service and maintainace business, which their management team has been focused on in recent quarters. This is a higher margin business with consistent recurring revenues. \n\n----------------------------\n\n**Facebook** **(FB)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.38%**\n\ngain/loss: **20.61%** **gain\n\nI\u2019m selling out of FB very soon but I still hold them for now. FB is an incredible business and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll see growth in the future, but it just isn\u2019t for me (anymore). I consider ethics a lot in my investments, which many of you may consider stupid but idc. \n\n---------------------------\n\n**Hannon** **Armstrong** **(HASI)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.18%**\n\ngain/loss: **57.40%** **gain**\n\nHASI is a REIT, which solely makes climate change related investments. They invest in the land under solar projects, energy efficient buildings and much more. HASI is a great dividend play and I expect their stock price to appreciate as climate change worries are exacerbated in the future. \n\n---------------------------\n\n**Beyond** **Meat** **(BYND)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.10%**\n\ngain/loss: **21.24%** **gain**\n\nI made a post with some DD earlier this year on Beyond so I\u2019ll just link that below:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/if9tmj/beyond_meat_bynd_fundamental_analysis_with_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n---------------------------\n\n**Brookefield** **Renewable** **Partners** **(BEPC)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.06%**\n\ngain/loss: **87.23%** **gain**\n\nBEPC owns and operates a portfolio of renewable energy assets. Earlier this year they completed a merger with Terraform Power, expanding their solar &amp; wind footprint. They are also the primer owner of hydroelectric power plants, which produce a consistent source of electricity. BEPC has a strong management team and owns valuable assets that will greatly appreciate in value as government incentives expand around renewable energy consumption. They also pay a nice dividend. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Disney** **(DIS)**\n\nportfolio weight: **2.03%**\n\ngain/loss: **50.06%** **gain** \n\nI\u2019m invested in Disney mostly for some portfolio diversity. I\u2019m a big fan of their streaming platform and business strategy revolving around that. This one isn\u2019t climate change related so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**First** **Solar** **(FSLR)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.84%**\n\ngain/loss: **70.47%** **gain**\n\nFirst Solar is an American based panel manufacturer and projects operator. They used differentiated technology with Cadmoum Telluride panels, which are supposed to increase output and lifetime at a higher cost. FSLR is just another play on the growing solar industry, and being U.S. based seems to reward them a higher earnings multiple in the market than their peers. They also have a beautiful balance sheet. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Trulieve** **Cannabis** **(TCNFF)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.44%**\n\ngain/loss: **5.33%** **gain**\n\nTrulieve is another Cannabis play. This one based in the U.S. with a large medical market in Florida. Nuff said. (Do your own research) \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**Star** **Peak** **Energy** **Transition** **(STPK)**\n\nportfolio weight **1.43%**\n\ngain/loss: **55.45%** **gain**\n\nStar peak is a brand new holding for me and already shot up like crazy. It\u2019s one of these merger companies (the word is censored on this subreddit). merging with Stem energy storage. Stem is involved in the battery storage industry, with mostly grid level storage systems. They currently have an even larger market share than Tesla and my reason for holding this stock is mostly as a hedge against Tesla\u2019s energy business. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Shopify** **(SHOP)**\n\nportfolio weight: **1.10%**\n\ngain/loss: **18.19%** **gain**\n\nShopify is an eCommerce platform, which allows customers to seamlessly design their own website and process payments. I\u2019ve used Shopify in the past and am a big fan of the business, which is a big part of why I\u2019m invested. They have a steep valuation but I plan on holding for 10+ years. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTotal gain: **181.52%**\n\n(Note: I\u2019ve taken some profits on a few of my stocks so the unrealized gain from my current holdings is less than my \u201ctotal\u201d gain by a few % points.)\n\n--------------------------\n\nYes, I\u2019m young and idealistic and have a lot to learn but I do know a few things. Here\u2019s some of the lessons I\u2019ve learned along my 1 and a half year journey in the market. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n\nBy investing in a company, you are supporting them financially. Buying pressure on companies\u2019 stocks increases the price and allows them to raise capital more efficiently. It might be hard to hear, but **when** **you** **buy** **Exxon** **stock**, **you** **are** **helping** **them** **destroy** **our** **planet**. The same is true vice versa.  \n\n**Don\u2019t** **listen** to** **anybody** **on** **reddit**. Seriously. Nobody here knows any better than you. Do your own research, form your own judgements. If you\u2019re gonna pick individual stocks then following advice on reddit is not the way to go. Reading through investor relations pages is the best way to go. Watch videos and read articles about both sides of the story with different companies. Don\u2019t take these videos as facts though, just absorb what other people think and judge the validity of the information for yourself. It\u2019s important to **become** **an** **independent** **thinker**. This is a slow process but eventually you\u2019ll get the hang of things.\n\n**Invest** **with** **a** **10+** **year** **timeline**. This is especially true if you\u2019re young like myself. Don\u2019t concern yourself with daily or even monthly swings in a stock. Ask yourself if the company will be worth substantially more in a decade. If not, then say, if so then buy and hold. Don\u2019t try to time the market or swing trade. You\u2019re just bringing on unnecessary risk. Buy and hold and buy some more. \n\n**Assess** **your** **own** **risk** **tolerance**. As I\u2019m sure several people will point out, my portfolio is incredibly speculative and risky from a traditional viewpoint. I have a really fucking high risk tolerance, so I invest with a \u201criskier\u201d mindset. If I were to lose all my money tomorrow, I\u2019d be fine. I\u2019m going to have a college degree in a couple years and I\u2019m not worried about being able to find a job. My reason for investing is about having the financial freedom to do whatever I want in life, and not worry about money in the future. If you\u2019re investing for retirement or to pay off student loans, then I recommend taking a more conservative approach and maybe buying some index funds. However, if you\u2019re young and have a stomach for risk like myself, then go crazy.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nIn conclusion, I\u2019ve had an incredible year or so in the market. I don\u2019t expect to have even close to these same returns in the future, but I\u2019ve learned a thing or two and I\u2019m here to share this information. You may disagree with everything I said and all the stocks I own and that\u2019s okay! Don\u2019t copy my portfolio and take everything I say with a grain of salt, however I hope you find some wisdom from this post!",

        "selftext": "The solar industry, as soon as in the past month (not to mention this entire year), has absolutely been going to the moon. CSIQ has now had 3 consecutive days gaining 8%+, two of those days gaining 11%. SPWR finished at 12% today and doubled over the past 2 months. ENPH got the credit it deserved from big-name institutions and finished up 30% in the past week, again doubling in the past two months.\n\nThat's not to say that solar hasn't had a phenomenal year in general either. RUN, ENPH, SPWR, PLUG, etc. are all examples of companies that have seen 3, 4, 5, even 9x growth this year. What's more, many of them (SPWR, CSIQ) still have extremely stomache-able fundamentals. \n\nA large portion of this growth is under Trump, who was obviously not a proponent of green energy. I take this to mean that since solar can show astronomical growth in adversity, it could yield amazing growth under the right conditions. \n\nWhat solar stocks do you all think are holes-in-one? Why? Where do you think the industry is going in 2021? What upsides/downsides are people not talking about? If people invest now are they catching the tail-end of a fluke, or is this just the beginning?\n\nPersonally, I'm invested in CSIQ, ENPH, SPWR, and QCLN. They've all worked like magic in my portfolio. I'd like to hear what you guys are invested in with the green energy space.",

The rest was from my long calls like ENPH which been absolutely fucked the past 3 days, high was 148 on Friday morning and now 128... you guys should buy it is a leader. But back to course, I plan to sell everything jan 1 2021 to net taxes for April. This fucking market is too tight to make money it is just stupid. I expect a double dip recession and crash and maybe a financial crisis Starting mid to late January. Remember this post and screenshot it, I am now ringing the alarm bells!",

        "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

        "selftext": "First Solar (FSLR) will continue to rip into the foreseeable future and is the best short-term option play for solar energy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Macro Backdrop**\n\nThe Federal Reserve's accommodative interest rate policy and massive QE programs have fueled investor appetite for long duration cash flows. Corresponding speculative activity is already seen in several parts of the market. The EV space is probably the best example of this today, and many of its first derivatives have had absurd runs this year. Blink Charging and QuantumScape come to mind. \n\nIt seems that multiple expansion in the EV space has already begun to decelerate, and I expect it to continue while first/second derivative companies that rely similarly on long duration cash flows to thrive. Solar energy is a second derivative of a sort for EVs and itself has an incredibly large TAM. \n\n**Political Backdrop**\n\nIt's no secret that the Biden administration has emphasized renewable energy, and investors have noticed with solar etf TAN up nearly 3x YTD. There are wide ranging beliefs on how exactly the new administration will invest in renewables, but at the moment ignorance is bliss for investors (and autists like me who refuse to buy calls more than a month out). As long as Powell continues serving his QE party juice and the Biden administration focuses on renewables, I think the solar parties on until Biden's inauguration or until he takes a hard policy stance upon which investors might sell the news. \n\n**Undervalued Compared to Peers**\n\n**F****SLR Forward P/E - 30x**\n\nRun Forward P/E - 135.82x\n\nENPH Forward P/E - 99x\n\nSEDG Forward P/E - 72x\n\nSPWR Forward P/E - 71x\n\n**Relatively Low Implied Vol = Cheap Calls = Big Tendies**\n\nATM 1/15 FSLR implied vol is 55% vs. SPWR (96%), ENPH (72%), JKS (110%). If the entire solar sector is going to rally up to Biden's inauguration, cheap FSLR calls would pay bigly.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nI'm not a huge believer in technical analysis, but FSLR just broke out of a near decade-long trading range. Reaching Obama-era levels of speculation at $290/share would be a lot, but given its relative valuation, First Solar has a lot of catching up to do. With extreme macro/political tailwinds, First Solar will outshine its peers in an already hot sector.\n\n**TLDR:** Buy FSLR calls because of political and macro tailwinds and relative valuation.\n\nPositions: FSLR 1/15 120c, FSLR 1/15 130c",

Currently looking at TAN, TSLA, ARKG, ENPH, APHA, NVDA, JMIA, PLTR, \\*insert whatever high-flyer\\*, etc.\" \n\nIt just feels like there is a lot of blind chasing going on right now and this is just a reminder to folks to BE PATIENT.

        "selftext": "*#Clown Market DD:*# Buckle up buckaroos I'm gonna show you how to wine and dine on tendies at Wendys this very Wednesday. Neither Bull, nor Bear, I am full-on Clown and this is my native market. Given the recent Clownish trends, which unequivocally guarantee future results (*cf.* \"New Paradigm\" inflection point of [Figure A](https://transportgeography.org/?page_id=9035), the contents of Airbnb's S-1 disclosure statement (available [here](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-306257/)) and other SEC filings (available [here](https://sec.report/CIK/0001559720)) are completely irrelevant, like seatbelts on a seadoo. \n\n**TLDR;** Imagine an amount of money you are willing to lose and then double it. Buy ABNB at Fidelity on IPO day, shares on Wednesday afternoon, and calls the following week.\n\nNow before you parade down the street blasting your kazoo, let's go over WHY to buy. UBER IPO'd last year at $41. This was a typical case of insider investors realizing their shares of a shitty, unprofitable company were better off in the hands of retail mothershmuckers. UBER has become even less profitable in the interim, so naturally the stock price has risen to $54. Now some of you bigbrains might be furrowing your fiveheads--ABNB has a clear path to profitability and has indeed [turned a profit](https://www.cnet.com/news/airbnb-first-profit-home-rental-travel-startups/) on multiple occasions. My elf ears hear you ask:\n\n&gt;\"Under Clownmarket rules doesn't this mean ABNB will trade flat like a boomer bond?\" \n\n\"Nein!\" is my reply. Fear not, for ABNB posted a [$322m loss](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/12/21134477/airbnb-loss-profit-ipo-safety-tech-marketing) last year. Although it's not as sexy as [TSLA's $862m loss](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272130/net-loss-of-tesla/) in the same year, we can hope ABNB's costs of expanding into China will swell like an ass-eater's lymph nodes. The analysts certainly think so. Cordwell has a price target of [$75 a share](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ABNB/price-target/) following the likely $45-$50 IPO target.\n\nAlthough Airbnb is clearly just Uber for your mattress, some skeptics demand more metrics. Compare Booking.com (BKNG) which IPO'd at $483.99 in 1999 and dropped to $7.88 by 2001. Could this happen to ABNB? Absolutely not. Why? Because I got bedbugs once at a booking.com dive with fake pics, and I didn't even call their customer service to get my eleven dollars back. Contrast that with when I got kicked out of an Airbnb in Bali six years ago, I got on the phone with a **specialist** who **investigated** my **case** and gave me a bunch of store credit for shit I didn't even ask for. Add in the fact that BKNG now trades at $2125 and you've got yourself a real *fuck it why not* scenario.  \n\nAnd finally, *Google Trends* [shows \"airbnb\" is half as hype as \"tesla\"](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=airbnb,tesla) which logically puts ABNB at 50% of TSLA's $558b valuation, =$279b, which would put ABNB's share price at $465.\n\nPut the kazoos away boys, this 10-bagger calls for a fanfaronade of vuvuzelas!",

        "selftext": "[From the article](https://www.reuters.com/article/cryptocurrencies-sp/sp-dow-jones-indices-to-launch-cryptocurrency-indexes-in-2021-idUSL1N2IJ0TG):\n\n&gt; LONDON (Reuters) - S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, a division of financial data provider S&amp;P Global Inc, said on Thursday that it will launch cryptocurrency indices in 2021, making it the latest major finance company to enter the nascent asset class.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P DJI-branded products will use data from New York-based virtual currency company Lukka on more than 550 of the top traded coins, the companies said.  S&amp;P\u2019s clients will be able to work with the index provider to create customized indices and other benchmarking tools on cryptocurrencies, S&amp;P and Lukka said in a joint statement.  S&amp;P and Lukka hope more reliable pricing data will make it easier for investors to access the new asset class, and reduce some of the risks of the very volatile and speculative market, they said.\n\n&gt; \u201cWith digital assets such as cryptocurrencies becoming a rapidly emerging asset class, the time is right for independent, reliable and user-friendly benchmarks,\u201d said Peter Roffman, global head of innovation and strategy at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. The move by one of the world\u2019s most well-known index providers could help cryptocurrencies become more mainstream investments. It comes as bitcoin continues to soar to record highs against the dollar, boosted by increased demand from investors who say the virtual currency is a hedge against inflation and a safe-haven asset.\n\n&gt; Bitcoin was trading at $19,300 in latest trading on Thursday, having soared around 170% this year. Cryptocurrencies have been around for more than a decade, but have started attracting more interest from large financial companies over the last few years.\n\n&gt; Large firms including Fidelity Investments and Japan\u2019s Nomura Holdings Inc have starting safeguarding bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for institutional investors, while major exchanges have started offering bitcoin derivatives. The emergence of more mainstream market infrastructure has made the asset class more accessible for institutional investors, with hedge fund managers such as Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller saying they include bitcoin in their broad investment strategies.",

Emerging markets fund managers have been swapping U.S. listings of widely held stocks like Alibaba Group Holding (BABA), JD.com (JD), NetEase (NTES) for their secondary listings in Hong Kong listings for months, in anticipation of the measure. \n\nThat's right. The absolute *worst* thing that can happen is that your shares get swapped to Hong Kong's stock exchange. The article explained that Interactive Brokers, Fidelity, and Schwab, for example, already offer retail traders like us access to HK's exchange.\n\nGranted that NIO and XPEV are not on the Hong Kong exchange yet. But they have three years to comply with the US rule. That's plenty of time to secure a spot on the Hong Kong exchange. And Hong Kong would *love* to have them. This move could also benefit the companies themselves, as it makes them available to both American *and* Chinese investors:\n\n&gt;A Hong Kong listing means a company\u2019s stock can be traded during the Asian day and is likely to broaden its investor base.

He really wants me to close out some small options positions, but when I try to 'sell to close' or 'buy to close' in his websites' interfaces, they tell me I've chosen wrong options and the trades can't go through. What should I do to turn those positions into cash, regardless of gain or loss? DMs are fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy 75 year old dad had a couple pretty major strokes last week. He can talk, a little, and some things are clear on his mind while others (Like \"No, you really can't walk with your left side paralyzed\") are pretty muddy. He is really fixated on closing out a couple small (&lt; $1k) options positions he has on Schwab &amp; Fidelity.\n\nI'm not a sophisticated investor. (He's not either, from the numbers I can see, but he sure thinks he is. /familydrama&gt; ) I understand equities and what shorting is and the fact that options offer some leveraged access to future equities or commodities.

For what I\u2019m willing to risk at the moment, that would look like a 310p 1/15/21 (a little shorter than what I\u2019d like, but contract is expensive..).\n\nThe bid/ask is 33.80/39.50 (this is the price I try to buy the contract for, is that correct?  Why is it a range?)\n\nSo if I were to buy this contract, it would be an option to sell x100 shares of MSTR at 310 up until 1/15/21, and it would cost $3,665 (the median of the spread?)?\n\nIs that accurate so far?\n\nIf so, let\u2019s say on 1/15/21 that MSTR is at 300.  A difference of $10 x 100 shares for $1000 is far less than the $3,665 I mentioned above though, so a net loss.\n\nIn fact, by my math MSTR would have to drop to 273 to break even. (Is that right, or am I mistaken on the premium?)\n\nLastly..exercise vs. sell: I assume the vast majority of the time I would want to sell the contract rather than exercise.  \n\nSell: what kind of basis would the contract sell for?  Is there a good way to estimate before entering into a contract?\n\nExercise: if you don\u2019t own shares of a put contract, how would you exercise it?  Buy for market, and then sell for contract price?\n\nThank you",

        "selftext": "I just had a rather frustrating call with TDA. I've been tinkering with options for a little under a year now. I started on fidelity selling CC's against a large position I owned. I also opened an account at TDA that was intended for more active options trading when that CC finally hit at Fidelity, since Fidelity's website is kinda wonky for options trading.\n\nWhen I opened the account at TDA, I selected options access, margin, futures, forex, margin, advanced features, etc. After opening the account, I saw that literally none of those were on the account (!). I called them, and they stated that they were approved and would show up the next day. Some did, some didn't. Options *looked* like it was.\n\nI've been daytrading stocks in the account in the interim. Not too bad either - doubled the account. Well, fast forward to this morning. I tried purchasing a 2022 LEAP with the intention of doing PMCCs, and I got an error that \"it would create an illegal position\" error (!!).\n\nSo, I get on the phone with TDA and they tell me that I was never approved for options (!!!). I explain the history. They say they don't see it (!!!!). They also say that during the application, the request for additional account features was never filled out (!!!!!), which is BS because I literally picked through it with a fine tooth comb.\n\nOk, fine. So I re-apply. This time, they only give me L1 options, and some L2. No ability to do spreads.\n\nAnd I'm locked there for another 90 days. After 3 attempts to enable options at my desired level now - at creation, after creation, and now this, I give TF up. I told the rep that I'm probably going to close the account since I have L3 options at fidelity, spreads were part of my strategy, and they gave me some spiel about \"well its for your own safety, we are much more strict than fidelity, we want you to have more experience, we aren't trying to win your business.\" (!!!!!!!)\n\nAt that line, I said \"well done then.\" and hung up.\n\nI'll pull my cash back out and either move back to Fidelity (though I hate their website for options trading, and I don't have a machine where I can run active trader pro). I've also heard a lot of love towards tastyworks, but the commissions see really high. I wanted to avoid RH because of really bad experiences there as an early user. I've also heard some love towards webull.\n\nI get there's an obligation to \"protect me from myself\" but GD this is frustrating when I already have that level of access elsewhere, and was told by their support that I was approved. It's even more frustrating when it feels like support is trying to gaslight you, and then waves you off like you aren't important when you point it out.",

I\u2019ve paid myself a \u2018reasonable salary\u2019 this year. I have my Roth IRA in Fidelity, and I made the maximum contribution in early January. My personal ST gains from stock this year is around $200K (2000% YTD). I just realized that I will exceed the income contribution limit for Roth IRA. I spoke to Fidelity about this issue and they have given me two options: either withdraw the contribution and get penalized plus taxes at ordinary or do a conversion to traditional and then back to Roth IRA plus file Form 8606 every year.\n\nAs of right now, my Roth IRA has a 95% YTD return. Although I understand that this return may not be consistent and be lucky, and that I may have to rebalance as I get older, I still want to be able to aggressive and choose my own positions. Playing around with the compound interest calculator: maximum annual contribution, 15-20% average yield, and a 30 year period, this is a no brainer on after-tax savings. \n\nI specifically want a after-tax option to invest. Is the best way to continue funding traditional Roth and then convert every year or to open a Roth 401K employer side and fund it ($19K contribution limit?)?

I haven't done anything in contributions this year, is now the time to add just as much as I possibly can? Is 41.19% realistic for the future or was this just a fluke or does it somehow have something to do with the pandemic? Thank you for your help",

        "selftext": "Between a recent inheritance, and cash I've been stockpiling in a savings account, I have \\~$325k cash collecting dust. I need your help! lol. I'm 40, no kids, no financial obligations. This money  is growing rapidly based on my income, at the rate of $5-10k/month. I need to put this money to work, and would really appreciate input from you all - especially people who've been in a similar situation where they've come into a large sum unexpectedly and didn't have prior experience with money on that scale. For context, I'm self-employed, and I've been maxing out my retirement contributions annually (in terms of the maximum I can contribute to have a tax advantage). I've even had crazy luck with my retirement account, it's up \\~25% on the year. I earn roughly $200k/yr, and COVID has not, and will not impact business (it's growing). I've put together roughly \\~450k in net worth in the past three years, starting at ground zero, so in relative terms all of this wealth is new. Other than my mortgage I'm debt free - my mortgage is 2.99 % fixed for 30 years, so paying this down doesn't seem like the right move, at least not right now.\n\nSome questions:\n\n* has anyone navigated this type of situation recently?\n* does anyone have experience having their savings/retirement actively managed? Fidelity offers this for a reasonable monthly fee\n* can I trust financial advisors? any 'tells' I can watch out for?\n* are there any mistakes / pitfalls you guys have made that you could help me avoid?\n* should I wait until after the transition of power before making any moves? politics aside, these are dicey times and whatever is going to happen will transpire by the end of next month\n* can anyone recommend effective means of giving? I'd like to take a slice of ROI and get that to people who need it. I read that 1 in 5 kids here is hungry, and that's criminal\n* Whether that's cash or gold bricks, I'm going to make a 'doomsday fund' to keep at home - I'm not a prepper, but banks have failed, once in my lifetime - can someone give some advice on this? Was thinking \\~10k in cash/gold\n\nMy goals:\n\n* would prefer this to be relatively hands off - get some safety nets in place (stop loss etc), stick to relatively boring equities, etc etc. my income is such I don't have to get aggressive here\n* early retirement - I'd love to scale back to a 3 day work ASAP, and I'm not materialistic - there will be no Mercedes in the driveway, no vacations in St. Tropez, it's just not my style\n* real estate - I'd like to expand into rental properties, I'm in the St. Pete FL area and there's no shortage of people looking to rent\n\nANY advice you all could share would truly be appreciated. Criticism/suggestion regarding my current thoughts and plans is also welcomed. I've done really well recently, but it's amateur hour and I'm aware of this. PLEASE share any mistakes major mistakes you've made in similar situations - IMO the best thing I can do is avoid common pitfalls, but I'm looking to do more than drop this into gov't bonds.\n\nThank you!",
