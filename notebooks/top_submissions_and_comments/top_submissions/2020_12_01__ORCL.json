        "selftext": "**The latest jobless numbers came in bad while the stock market keeps pushing forward, is a stock market crash coming soon? Let\u2019s talk about this and the latest stock market news**\n\nHey everyone! So let\u2019s start with the recap off Friday as we saw the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HD8WbDT) leading the way up 0,88%, with the [DOW Industrial](https://ibb.co/sCt0FJj) close behind up 0,83% and the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/dDhWbBG) also gaining a decent amount, up 0,7% with all 3 big indexes closing at all-time highs.\n\nWe saw more than \u00be of the [stocks](https://ibb.co/CB6cSMn) advancing despite below average volume as companies either small, mid or large cap value or growth [stocks](https://ibb.co/qCNqN5G) were gaining except large-cap growth. \n\nThe best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/d6f58Mf) were Energy and Materials up over 2% while Utilities finished 1% down on Friday, as Utilities were the only sector to finish the week losing significant ground, with Consumer Discretionary also dropping just 0,12%. With the rest of the sectors in the green, Energy, Health Care, Technology and Communication being the biggest gainers finishing the week up over 2%.\n\n[Utilities](https://ibb.co/Bz8TnvP) have been hit hard in the last year as residential consumers and small businesses have been able to defer paying power bills, this will continue to hold down the sector for now with the debt still increasing.\n\nThe VIX also dropped more than 2% on [Friday](https://ibb.co/18qjBx7) and finished the [week](https://ibb.co/7KyfPxQ) over 5% down as the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/sKhhfx6) from Friday shows us that there were plenty of gains to be made especially in the Energy Sectors as well as Financials, with the big companies from the Tech and Communication sectors doing worse than the rest of the market.\n\nFor the week though this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/92hRtQL) shows that Apple was one of the biggest gainers alongside Semiconductors and Energy Names while Health Care companies like JNJ and Pfizer also did very good.\n\nThe big indexes all finished higher for the [week](https://ibb.co/b3Gb4HN) with the SP500 up 1,7%, the Nasdaq Composite up 2,1% and the Dow up 1% with renewed hopes for a stimulus package being back on the table.\n\nHere are the most interesting economic [reports](https://ibb.co/j84CkLT) for next week, it will be a light week in terms of economic data but still, the market may be volatile and trends may change depending on some of the results.\n\nSo, on Friday [November JOBS](https://ibb.co/r0JPtCs) came in much lower than anticipated, coming in at 245K vs de 610K in October and 469K estimated while the unemployment [rate](https://ibb.co/M9mNBMT) dropped to 6,7% a bit better than expected and down from 6,9% in the past month. Still there are over 10million people unemployed, this number more than doubling since the start on February. The [net addition](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) of jobs in November was the [smallest](https://ibb.co/dWKmZWH) since May as government jobs were the [worst performing](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) while transportation and warehousing jobs continue to increase, as big companies \u2026 aka Amazon has hired almost 3thousand people per day this year. But the bad news is that [long-term](https://ibb.co/HFZFhyC) unemployment is approaching the peaks from the Great Recession and that is not good news for the economy or the stock market as over 3,9 million people have been out of work for at least 6 months. \n\nSo, this is pretty bad news as mortgages in [forbearance](https://ibb.co/NLcDmYP) just slightly declined this week, by just 39K with more and more plans planned to expire in December, over 1M more exactly, more than 40% of active cases.\n\nThis may finally put some extra pressure on the Congress to agree to a relief package maybe even passing it alongside the government [funding bill](https://ibb.co/1qkTnsD) that is still debated and has over 300 issues that the parties don\u2019t agree on. \n\nThis is becoming more and more obvious as [cases](https://ibb.co/6y9FTjV) in the US continue to rise, coming in over 200k in the last 2 days and the economy will soon feel the pressure from this, I expect the next month or two of economic data to not be so good, this may be the time the market sees a 5-10% correction before moving on higher on more positive things like the availability of the vaccine, the passing of the torch In the Presidency and a possible relief package.\n\nYes, this will continue to add to the [US DEBT](https://ibb.co/QjSPcdB), but even though I don\u2019t have any partisan views, a good structured relief bill would do wonders for the economy as a bridge to when the vaccine will finally be widely available.\n\nYes, I know that the global debt is set to reach $200 trillion but the DEBT-to-GDP [ratio](https://ibb.co/LhWkxKJ) is projected to slowly go back down in the next couple of years.\n\nOther numbers that came in on Friday were [Factory ORDERS](https://ibb.co/xm7JJ2Q) which came in better than expected at +1%. While a new Redfin report indicates an increase in [average home prices](https://ibb.co/pXYNGcz) year over year of 16% with the number of pending home [sales up](https://ibb.co/2nw00m3) almost 30% over last year while new listings of home sales is [up just 9%](https://ibb.co/v3nyLPZ) since 2019 and dropping rather fast in the last months with sales of homes going for all time-high [prices](https://ibb.co/gmvRPd7) at 99,5% of the asking price as the real estate market keeps booming along.\n\nThe other number that came in on Friday and was not so good was the [trade deficit](https://ibb.co/42nsy2W), which widened even more in the last month by almost $2B.\n\nSo next week is again pretty slow in [earnings reports](https://ibb.co/Xkr4f4P) with the most interesting ones on being Chewy, GameStop, Adobe, LuluLemon, Dave&amp;Busters, Costco, Oracle and Broadcom.\n\nI own a small stake in all of them except Oracle and GameStop. I don\u2019t see such a big growth opportunity with Oracle while GameStop I believe will struggle to turn around the business with very though e-commerce competition.\n\nWe will also have a number of new [IPOs](https://ibb.co/0jQWwTf) this week from DoorDash, AirBNB, C3.ai, Hydrofarm and Pubmatic. The first 3 are more interesting for myself but I will only take a first look at AirBNB and at what price that stock goes public to maybe get some action, I think we will a much bigger price than the 44-50$ price range to begin with for public trading. I also expect the same thing to happen with DoorDash which has already raised the IPO [pricing](https://ibb.co/Y8VSCpV) to 90-95$ but I am not very interested to buy that stock, as this type of economy has hugely benefited them and it might see a decrease rather than an increase in the next couple of years.\n\nSo, guys I still believe the stock market has upside in front of it, especially in the next 2 years, but you should tread careful for now, I think a possible correction might be just ahead before we move on higher, as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/9g0bJdj), a wedge formation is continuing to from with more and more tension, I believe there is about a 6,5% possible downside to the market at the moment before eventually getting back on track next year and going toward the 4000 level. And especially with the most recent jobless numbers in the US, I would try to diversify a little more especially with some EAST-ASIA exposure in countries like South Korea, Singapore and China also.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: Copied from [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ChrisBloomstran/status/1340414130658820096) by **Christopher Bloomstran**  \n\n\nLet\u2019s get ready to tumble! Come Monday, $TSLA enters the S&amp;P 500, as the world is aware. This is the one you will tell your grandkids about, or at least the new crop of investors, wondering what the bubble of 2020 was like. Tesla can be your example of the insanity....1/ \n\nFor all of the cost-saving benefits of passive investing, the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s committee that actively chooses the components for its indices will prove why passive investors are the dumb money with this coming Monday\u2019s inclusion of $TSLA into its venerable S&amp;P 500 index. 2/ \n\nThe committee is not known for a price consciousness. It chases what\u2019s hot and eliminates from its august roster what\u2019s not. 3/ \n\nIt\u2019s disregard for fundamentals or value was seen sharply in late 1999 &amp; early 2000 when bubble darlings like Peoplesoft, New Century Energy, Global Crossing, Xilinx, Teradyne, Quintiles Transnational, Citrix and JDS Uniphase made their way into the index. 4/ \n\nPull up the long-term charts to see how these \u201ctimely\u201d additions fared post admittance. The most prominent additions in 1999 were America Online (discussed in my 12/5 thread) and Yahoo, whose mania also reminds me of Tesla... 5/ \n\nYahoo went public in 1996, priced at $13 per share, opened at $24.50 and closed at $33 on its first trading day, a market cap of $850 million. From there the shares zoomed ahead by more than 6x in 2 years reaching $354 in January 1999. 6/ \n\nThe company then bought Geocities for $3.6B and Broadcast for $5.7B and the stock was more than cut in half, trading down to $120. Recovering by late 1999, the wizards at S&amp;P announced they would add Yahoo to the index on 11/30/1999. 7/ \n\nThe stock climbed 67% from $210 on the day of the announcement to $350 on the day of its inclusion on 12/7, one week later. Sound familiar? The rollercoaster didn\u2019t high point for another month. 8/ \n\nYahoo peaked not quite a month later at a share price of $475, a market cap of $127B on January 3, 2000 (the cap didn\u2019t include another 124 million option shares, 38M granted in 1999 alone, which implied an additional \\~$50B in market cap on January 3, 2000). 9/ \n\nIn hindsight, or for anyone with reason, which was lacking in those days, there was no need to count the fully diluted shares. Why? Those options would not be exercised. The stock fell 98.3% over the next 1 \u00be years, from $475 to $8.11 on 9/26/2001, a market cap of $2.2B. Yep. 10/ \n\nAt the peak, Yahoo's $127B market cap compared to $600 million in trailing 12-month revenues, so 211 times revenues. 11/ \n\nBut the Yahoo and tech bulls would get right in your face (or on the Yahoo Finance message board) and tell you, moron, that sales had grown 141%, 248%, 258% and 1,345% in the prior 4 years, which they did. 12/ \n\nHeck, even after the stock dropped from a STOCK PRICE of $475 to $30 (a mere 93.7% in a year for those counting) by the end of 2000, sales still GREW by 88% to $1.1B, to \u201conly\u201d 15 times revenues! From there, however, the company flailed. 13/ \n\nSales actually fell 35%, from $1.1B to $717m from 2000 to 2001, which is what drove the shares down to $8.11 and a $2.2B market cap. To what had been the first and dominant home page, and really the dominant search engine, competition came fast. 14/ \n\nYahoo even eventually outsourced its search function to upstart Google if you can believe that. Yahoo did ultimately grow its revenues another 5x to $5B by 2016, when it was bought by Verizon $VZ in 2016 for $4.5B, excluding a sub's partial investment in Alibaba. 15/ \n\nThe buyout was at a far cry from the day Yahoo came into the S&amp;P 500 as the 30th largest capitalization in the index, with a market cap of roughly $90B and I\u2019d guess at a weight of 0.7%. 16/ \n\nAt its January 3, 2000 peak, Yahoo had climbed to the #15 spot in the index, well ahead of Berkshire Hathaway $BRKA $BRKB (which was not yet in the index despite its mere $83B market cap, $131B in assets and $38B in shareholders equity.) 17/ \n\nHad Berkshire been in the index the day Yahoo peaked it would have held only the 37 spot, behind notorious tech darlings Cisco at $358B, Intel $290B, Time Warner $184B, Lucent $171B Sun Mico $168B, AT&amp;T $160B, WorldCom $148B, Dell $130B, HP $120B, Oracle $120B, EMC $116B,... 18/ \n\nQualcomm $116B, DirecTV $102B, Verizon $93B, AOL $93B, Motorola $90B, and Bellsouth $87B. Many of these are gone today, which leads us back to $TSLA. 19/ \n\nNever has the S&amp;P 500 committee brought in a company so large by market cap as will be the case with Tesla's inclusion. Nor have they ever brought in a company at so high a spot in the cap-weighted index, at #6, one notch ahead of Berkshire Hathaway. Insanity. 20/ \n\nOf course, by sales &amp; profits, plenty of companies have entered the index as larger constituents, but that\u2019s not what counts in the passive index. It\u2019s all about float adjusted market cap. Fundamental valuation matters not. Qualifying for index inclusion required some hijinks.21/ \n\nTesla had cut R&amp;D &amp; SG&amp;A, drew on reserves and leaned on environmental carbon credits to \u201cearn\u201d a GAAP profit for a necessary four quarters. They did so for five. Oddly, revenues only grew 15% in 2019, prior to the pandemic, in part for a reduction in customer tax incentives. 22/ \n\nImpressively, they have grown revenues 15% for the first 9 months of 2020 during the crisis while the incumbents saw sales decline. No doubt the business is growing. But how to value it? 23/ \n\nOn November 16, the S&amp;P index committee announced Tesla would be added on December 21. The market cap was $380B. Here on Saturday December 19, the stock price at $695 yields a market cap of $659B ($BRK, the current #6 is $528B) up $279B or 73% since the announcement. 24/ \n\nThe gain matches the percentage rise seen by Yahoo during the week between its announcement &amp; addition. The $279B gain is LARGER than the $215B market cap of the world\u2019s largest auto manufacturer, Toyota. Tesla\u2019s $659B cap is on 948M shares out at 9/30 (up 5% since YE 2019). 25/ \n\nThe share count excludes another 157M unvested or unexercised option and RSU shares, which would add more than $100B to the market cap on a fully diluted basis. 26/ \n\nLet\u2019s not count those for the same reason they were excluded in the Yahoo calculation. Why? Many may go unexercised. Why? Nobody in their right mind would pay $659B, $760B diluted, for a car co w/ $30B in sales, little or no economic profit and an enormous growth capital need.27/ \n\n25x sales? 2,030x GAAP earnings? 422x earnings assuming Toyota\u2019s best in industry 6% profit margin? Heck, even 85 times Microsoft\u2019s 30% profit margin (a bone for the Tesla is not a car company but also a software/robotaxi crowd). Welcome to the game, index fund investors. 28/ \n\n80% of Tesla\u2019s shares float, not owned by insiders, which means the adjusted market cap weight will be $528B, compelling somewhere between $50 and $75B of direct index purchases, not to mention those needed by index huggers and closet indexers. 29/ \n\nThe stock will come in at \\~1.75% of the $30.5 trillion index, itself significantly overvalued, not unlike when Yahoo peaked in January 2000 and the index peaked at over 30x earnings and 44x cyclically adjusted (CAPE) shortly thereafter. 30/ \n\nWhat prospective return does the Tesla bull expect, or the passive investor with 1.75% of capital in the shares come Monday? At 15% a year, the market cap, assuming no further dilution, grows to $3T over the next decade, \\~10% of the market value of the entire S&amp;P 500 today. 31/ \n\nAt \u201conly\u201d 10% per year, the fully diluted market cap grows to $2 trillion, almost where $AAPL is valued these days. At a 10% shareholder return, to trade at 30x earnings, Tesla will need to be earning $67 billion. 32/ \n\nFor grins let\u2019s assume the company actually earns some blend of auto maker profit (most earn \\~3%, Toyota \\~6%) and a subscription software, robotaxi margin of 30%. Generously call it a 20% blended profit margin, which I\u2019d bet heavily against. 33/ \n\nAt the impossible 20% margin, $67B would sit under $335B in revenues, roughly 11 times today\u2019s run rate. Revenues will need to grow by almost 28% per year, and profits to 20% of revenues, to get to a 30x multiple on earnings. 34/ \n\nTo finance the necessary capital stock to produce $335B in revenues will require about half that much in capital, either debt or equity. 35/ \n\nCar companies require roughly a dollar in capital to produce a dollar in revenues, but remember we are \"assuming\" this is a software company or whatever else hallucinogens conjure up in the minds of bulls. 36/ \n\nThe best course of action for Tesla is to keep selling \u201cat-the-market\u201d blocks, with no prospectus, road show or risk warning, to the dumb money that is willing, or compelled, as is the passive crowd, to pay dangerous prices. The dilution at today\u2019s prices is infinitesimal. 37/ \n\nThrough the end of 2019 Tesla had sold $12.7B in shares and borrowed $16B in debt and preferred stock. Total capital raised of $28B exceeded FY 2019 revenues of $25B and produced a $6B cumulative LOSS. 38/ \n\nSo far in 2020, Tesla has borrowed an additional net $200m and sold $12.3B of new shares (assuming a sale of the most recent $5B \u201cat-the-market\u201d). Bulls revere the cash on the balance sheet, but it didn\u2019t come from profit or free cash. 39/ \n\nTotal capital raised is now $40B before retained losses. What does Tesla earn on capital? Nothing yet. Equity is less than capital raised from stock sales by the amount of cumulative losses. Per share book is of course higher thanks to successful stock sales way above book...40/ \n\nFrom a business case and investment standpoint, the math doesn\u2019t work. Consider that total automobiles sold worldwide peaked two years ago at about 95m passenger and commercial car and truck units. At $20,000 per new vehicle, we can call the global auto market $2T in size. 41/ \n\nOur example has Tesla\u2019s market cap growing over the next decade at \u201conly\u201d 10% per year to a like $2T. Car companies, with the exception of Ferrari, which makes three cars per year, don\u2019t trade for one times sales. They trade for less. 42/ \n\nToyota, which earns a 6% margin and 6% on capital, trades itself at an all-time-high $215B on revenues of $280B in 2019, less in 2020. 43/ \n\nAuto manufacturers trade for less than sales because they make \\~3% net margins and earn that same \\~3% on capital and revenues grow at \\~3%. We can call the industry 3x3x3 (new material here folks). The car business is a bad business, and that\u2019s what Tesla is trying to disrupt? 44/ \n\nThe best case for shareholders: If Tesla grows the aforementioned sales for the next decade by 28% to $335B (it won\u2019t), the stock will trade for no more than 1x sales, because it\u2019s a CAR company. 45/ \n\nIf it earns Toyota\u2019s best in class 6% margin, even allowing for software \u201cupgrades,\u201d it earns $20B and trades for 25x, or a $500B market cap, which is a 33% loss from here people using diluted shares. If sales, margins or the multiple are lower, shareholders lose more. 46/ \n\nThe realistic case: The performance of the stock from here is a giant loss over time and the Tesla cult loses interest in the brand. In fact, they come to hate the brand because of their coming stock losses, customer and employee mistreatment. 47/ \n\nAsk the guys and gals on the S and X lines about their unpaid \u201cbreak\u201d here at quarter end. Rumor has it they can \"volunteer their time\" to help boost production before yearend. Sales grow nowhere near 28% a year. The incumbent auto manufacturers won\u2019t roll over and play dead. 48/ \n\nMy prior tweet elaborated on [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) using his inflated shares as currency to acquire another manufacturer w/ capacity, as he mentioned he\u2019d be up for in a friendly merger of equals. The point of that message was that the incumbents won\u2019t take his dangerous scrip in a deal. 49/ \n\nThat leaves Elon with having to sell new shares perpetually to finance his growth. It makes 100% sense when the shares are insanely overvalued to do so, and despite the ethics of doing so in these recent at-the-market deals. 50/ \n\nBy contrast, Mr. Buffett points out he\u2019d prefer new and current shareholders to have a fair experience in his company\u2019s shares. If the auto makers won\u2019t take them in a deal, and they shouldn\u2019t, then that leaves new shareholders to provide growth capital. Hello passive crowd. 51/ \n\nWe\u2019ll see what happens after Monday, when Tesla assumes the #6 perch in the index. When the argument for passive is low fees, remind me in ten years how much of the loss in Tesla\u2019s shares from here should be considered a \u201cfee,\u201d or a tax on stupidity. 52/ \n\nAt 1.75% of the index, a decline of 80-90% would be heavy, but realistic. Impossible to decline that much? An 88% drop takes you all the way back to\u2026.where Tesla\u2019s shares began the year. 53/ \n\nA 90% decline takes the cap to $66B, 2.2x current run rate revenues &amp; 37x a hypothetical 6% net margin. A mere 80% drop gets to a $132B cap, 4.4x revenues, and to give the bulls on Tesla not being a car company credit, still 37x a 12% hypothetical profit margin. Ridiculous. 54/ \n\nYou can play around all you like w/ assumptions for growth, market share, expansion into new markets, profit &amp; returns on capital, but paying for some fractional ownership of today\u2019s $760B fully diluted market value is highly likely to produce a disastrous investment result. 55/ \n\nBravo, S&amp;P. The decision to add $TSLA at present valuation is almost sure to exact pain on passive investors, compelled to \u201cinvest\u201d 1.75% of capital in one of the most overvalued companies on record. Brilliant. As the other Buffett sings, \u201cCome Monday, it\u2019ll be all right...\u201d 56/ \n\nAs disclosure, I have a small short position in $TSLA. Don\u2019t take this note as investment advice because it\u2019s not. Do your own research. Stocks go up &amp; down, and shorting is extremely dangerous. Upside is capped and downside is unlimited. $TSLA has risen 8.3x just this year. 57/ \n\nIf Tesla repeats the same return over the next year the market cap would be $6.3 trillion. Two years of repeat performance and the cap becomes $52 trillion. Of course, that\u2019s 70% larger than the entire S&amp;P 500, but by then any short seller is long bankrupt. 58/58 END",

Currently, **Chinese government refuses to allow the PCAOB to inspect audits of companies registered in China and Hong Kong**.  This led to the massive scandal and eventual delisting of \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Co\\*fee (*for some reason this name is forbidden on this sub)*. The Kennedy-Von Hollen bill aims to prohibit securities of a  company  from being listed on any of the U.S. securities exchanges if  the company  has failed to comply with the Public Company Accounting  Oversight  Board\u2019s (PCAOB) audits for three years in a row.\n\n**Source**: Government website [https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2020/12/house-passes-kennedy-van-hollen-bill-to-protect-americans-from-fraudulent-foreign-companies](https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2020/12/house-passes-kennedy-van-hollen-bill-to-protect-americans-from-fraudulent-foreign-companies)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MYTH 1: This bill does not apply to companies like $BABA or $NIO, because they are already using American auditors.**\n\n**BUSTED**.

This means PCAOB is able to inspect $NIO\u2019s audits.**\n\n**BUSTED**. An accounting firm being registered with PCAOB **does NOT mean its audits can be inspected**.   (To be honest I am quite surprised the internet trolls can dig this  far  in order to twist facts. They even know the firm is registered.  Wow.)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MYTH 3: Whether Trump signs this bill or not does not matter at all, because he will soon leave the White House.**\n\n**BUSTED**. Trump is still the president. After the bill passes both Senate and House, **if president signs, the bill becomes a legislation and will be enforced**. Unless this bill gets repealed after Biden takes over, it will have a lasting impact. And since this bill has gained **unanimous bipartisan support**, it is highly unlikely that the bill will be repealed.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MYTH 4: Because Trump\u2019s TikTok ban hasn\u2019t been successful so far, the Chinese stock delisting bill will not be enforced either.**\n\n**BUSTED**. These are totally different matters. Trump\u2019s TikTok ban is an **executive order**, **not a law**. Executive orders can be overturned by judges. Whereas, if the Kennedy-Von Hollen bill is signed by Trump, it will become **legislation**.\n\nIf anything this tells you, **China  did NOT prevent TikTok's US operation from being sold to Oracle. It  won't be a surprise if eventually they will NOT prevent these stocks  from being delisted.**\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MYTH 5: This bill is fake, because it is passed by Senate first and House second. Real bills get passed in House first.**\n\n**BUSTED**. God, I am so disappointed in the new generation\u2019s understanding of our own government. **Senate bill, proposed by senators, will be voted in the Senate first**.   And since this bill is proposed by Senator John Kennedy and Senator   Chris Van Hollen, this is a Senate bill. (As an American citizen, **please try to understand how our own government works**)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MYTH   6: $NIO spokeswoman says they have become compliant over the past few   months, which means $NIO will not be subject to this bill.**\n\n**PROBABLY INACCURATE**. They can only \u201c**TRY**\u201d to comply with the regulations, but whether they \u201c**CAN**\u201d is **not really up to them**. **It is NOT the companies themselves that are against the inspection of audits, it is the Chinese government.**\n\n**Source**: the damn SEC chairman Jay Clayton himself [https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-vital-role-audit-quality-and-regulatory-access-audit-and-other](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-vital-role-audit-quality-and-regulatory-access-audit-and-other)\n\n\u201c**China\u2019s state security laws are invoked**   at times to limit U.S. regulators\u2019 ability to oversee the financial   reporting of U.S.-listed, China-based companies. In particular, **Chinese   laws governing the protection of state secrets and national security   have been invoked to limit foreign access to China-based business books   and records and audit work papers**.\u201d\n\nIt is outside companies\u2019 power to comply with US regulations, because the issue concerns Chinese state security law. **You think these companies will disobey Chinese state security laws just to comply with US listing rules?** If the Chinese government says No, there will be no way they can be compliant, no matter how they \u201c**TRY**\u201d.\n\n**Source**: another Chinese EV maker $LI even mentioned such uncertainty in its SEC filing.\n\n\u201cthe   adoption of any rules, legislations or other efforts to increase U.S.   regulatory access to audit information could cause uncertainty, and **we could be delisted if we are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement in time**\u201d\n\nThey may not, but they **COULD**.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MYTH   7: The Chinese will make compromise to avoid delisting, because they   are weaklings and they always make concessions to the US.**\n\n**UNCERTAIN**.   I can\u2019t imagine how people can just go around vouching this as a fact.   Do they work for the Chinese government? Are they the officials   responsible for the negotiations? How can this be a certainty already?\n\nIf you bet that the Chinese will make compromises, **you are basically betting that Chinese will back down from its own state security law**. **It is possible that they will, but it\u2019s far from certainty**.   They have not compromised on an \u201cindependent investigation of   coronavirus origin\u201d in Wuhan. They have not compromised on the National   Security Law enacted in Hong Kong. How on earth can you be so sure that   they will compromise on their own state security law?\n\nThe   negotiation on PCAOB inspection between the US and China has taken 10   years. China has not yet compromised in the past 10 years. But now   suddenly they will just yield? Is this really logical thinking, or **purely your imagination?**\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCan   these Chinese stocks go up? Not impossible. Can they go down? Also   possible. Whether you buy or sell, consider the risks, and **don\u2019t get manipulated by those who are spreading lies for their own benefit.**",

        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\n# Low IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays!\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit.

        "selftext": "Google seems to get a lot less love than the other tech behemoths. They are sadly not the cutthroat capitalists like Apple or Amazon. But they spend a shit ton on R&amp;D projects like self-driving cars and other weird \u201cmoonshots\u201d that are going to start paying off soon. The nerds in [Silicon Valley](https://www.businessinsider.com/most-desired-tech-companies-to-work-for-google-netflix-slack-2020-9) every year say Google is their most desired company to work for. I've decided to put my all my savings into long options.\n\n**Some Google initiatives or statistics that are cool but not why they are undervalued:**\n\n**Android market share worldwide:** 73%\n\n**Search market share:** 87%\n\n**Youtube:** 600 hours of video uploaded every minute, ad revenues through the roof\n\n**Stadia:** One of projects from their \u201cmoonshot factory\u201d that looked like it would fail spectacularly until the disaster of Cyberpunk 2077 on consoles showed Stadia could provide mid-tier PC performance on games minus the $2,000 for a PC. Huge increase in users since Cyberpunk fiasco.\n\n**Why I\u2019m going all in: Google is going to take over the world with AI**\n\nGoogle owns the top two AI outfits in the world, Google Brain and DeepMind. They are far ahead of their competitors in the most important industry of the future.\n\nDeepMind\u2019s AI team solved protein folding this past month. Experts didn\u2019t think this would be possible for decades. Their team will receive the first Nobel Prize where a neural network did a majority of the work. The monetization and scientific breakthrough possibilities for their proprietary protein folding prediction models are endless. ([more info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7wJDJ56c88))\n\nGoogle Brain and Deepmind are working with Waymo. No other self-driving company has technology that is remotely close to Waymo. Google proprietary AI processors allow them to simulate billions of miles on the road and millions of people help train their models with captchas everyday. Their taxis are already in Arizona with no human operators. There have been no injuries to passengers. There isn\u2019t a very small chance the car will kill you like with some [Waymo](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/25/tesla-driver-autopilot-crash) [competitors](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/20/us/self-driving-uber-pedestrian-killed.html). Uber realized the threat that Waymo posed to their business and tried to steal their technology. Waymo destroyed them in court and Uber sold off their self-driving operation this past month. Waymo will be first to market partnered with Lyft and will be significantly cheaper than Uber rides with human drivers. ([more info](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/this-arizona-college-student-has-taken-over-60-driverless-waymo-rides/), [2](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17307156/google-waymo-driverless-cars-deep-learning-neural-net-interview))\n\n**Cons:**\n\n**Google is super woke.** From what I\u2019ve read their internal message boards make woke twitter look like r/The_Donald. Could definitely be bad for business but they did recently fire one of the libs for jeopardizing their AI business. \n\n**Politicians want to fuck them.** There is a lot of anti-big tech sentiment on both sides of the aisle now but this has more to do with their enemies (Oracle, Yelp, etc) trying to litigate rather than innovate. I just don\u2019t see politicians breaking up a business that consistently ranks as one of the most respected brands in the country according to Morning Consult and which provides so many useful free services to constituents. \n\n**Trades made so far**\n\nGOOGL $3,000 1/20/2023\n\nGOOGL $2,900 1/20/2023\n\n**Disclaimer: I\u2019m retarded**",

At this point im not expecting any ipos to be cheap just purely based on the hype were seeing right now. But here is just a DD i did for it. The company has **an interesting business model in which that the company will partner up with another company to create an application that is proven to increase efficiency, reduce cost, track measurements for analysis purposes and so on and will then proceed to sell the same implementation to other companies that may benefit from the applications**. The revenue is mainly based on the subscription models to create steady stream of revenue. The company is lead by Tom Siebel, the pioneer of the customer relationship management software business that sold his company to Oracle for 6 billion in 2006 and C3.AI is his next level creation to revolutionize the world. **C3.AI is listed as one of the top disruptors of 2020 is backed up by Microsoft and spring creek capital with 50 million of stocks and $ 100 million investment respectively. C3.AI announced the partnership with Raytheon Technologies to develop AI solutions for aerospace and defense missions for government customers, including the U.S. Air Force and intelligence community. They also announced partnership with Microsoft and Adobe for a new customer \u2013 relationship management software seeking to comeback Salesforce INC.** The potential **for C3.AI is limitless because of how broad the scope can be. With a successful implementation of an application, C3.AI could easily spin it off to implement such applications to other industries with incredible scalability and tremendous reduction to developing cost**. Before we dive into what the company actually does, here is the overview of the company. \n\n**Financial wise, the company has**\n\n\\- **A whopping 71% yoy growth**\n\n\\- **86% subscription revenue**\n\n\\- **A $271 billion TAM by 2024.** \n\n\\- **Narrowing income loss thanks to the rapid growth**\n\n**The AI technology is a proven technology and is one that is being used daily to help industries moving faster into digital transformation. The currently capability and usage of the AI software is as followed** \n\n\\- **Make 1.1Billion predictions per day**\n\n\\- **Has 4.8million machine learning models in production use**\n\n\\- **Has 622 million sensors generating data for the C3.AI suite**\n\n\\- **Has 770 unique enterprise and extraprise source data integration** \n\n\\- **Has 50 Million businesses and consumers touched daily**\n\n**Notable market successes:**\n\n\\- **Banks are able to enhance securities lending optimization with estimated value of 14 billion in additional daily trades deployed in 52 weeks**\n\n\\- **Healthcare managements are able to enhance production optimization with estimated value of 300% increase in unit production deployed in 4 weeks**\n\n\\- **Oil and gas companies are able to predictive maintenance for offshore oil rigs and is able to recapture $28million per year in avoided shutdowns** \n\nWhat is C3.AI\n\nC3.ai is an enterprise AI software company that provides software as a service, applications that enable the rapid deployment of enterprise AI applications of extraordinary scale and complexity that offer significant social and economic benefit. \n\n**Two primary software solutions:**\n\n**1.** **C3 AI suite: designed to allow customers to apply design, develop, and deploy enterprise AI application to any type (basically a platform that allows you to develop your own applications)**\n\n**2.** **C3 AI Application: include a large and growing family of industry specific and application specific turnkey Ai solutions that can be immediately installed and deployed (a prebuilt application that is ready to go for implementations)**\n\nThe market entry growth strategy of C3.AI is focus on partnering and coordinating with lighthouse customers (the big companies including AWS, Baker Huges, FIS, Google, IBM and Microsoft) to create a proven and scalable applications that work to increase efficiency, cut down on costs and to record measurements on a massive scale for analysis purposes. With the established applications. \n\n**C3.AI is then able to** \n\n**1.** **Expand those same use cases across similar companies**\n\n**2.** **Establish middle market sales organizations, including tele sales, and online sales**\n\n**3.** **Leverage on marketing partners as enterprise and mid-market distribution channels**\n\nReal world user case:\n\nEngie \u2013 largest power producer in the world with\n\n\\- 114.4 GW power production capacity\n\n\\- $67 billion annual revenue in europoors money\n\n\\- 153k employees, operated in 70 counties \n\nWith the partnership with Engie, C3.Ai developed and deployed performance optimization for gas power plants, efficiency optimization of heating and cooling plants, energy analysis and management for enterprise and consumer customers, and anomaly detection of wind turbines. **C3 was able to bring the scalability required to build industrial AI based application with over 1million sensors, 5 million end points and 17mil measurements per day with the end result of bringing estimated 1.5 billion in annual economic benefits**\n\n\\- Wind turbines with in 12 weeks of deployment sees 2-3% increase in performance resulting in 15-22Mil annual economic value\n\n\\- Heating and cooling plants see 2-3% saving in energy consumption costs with $3mil annual economic value\n\n\\- Application in analyze energy for metered facility on the Ohio State university campus and is expected to see 25% energy saving within 10 years within 16 weeks of deployment \n\n\\- Application to analyze and forecast consumption for electricity and gas retail customers in France of 2.6Mil electricity consumers and 8.6mil has consumers with deployment of 6 months \n\n**Revenue model**\n\n\\- **Term subscriptions of the C3.AI Suite**\n\n\\- **Term subscriptions of C3.AI applications**\n\n\\- **Monthly runtime fee of C3 AI Applications and customer-developed application built using the C3.AI suite, usage based upon CPU- hour consumption**\n\n\\- **Professional services fees associated with training and assisting customers**\n\nIn the case of Engie, C3.AI would be making money from subscriptions to C3.AI suite and applications, setting up required trackers for measurements, developing AI applications, a monthly runtime fee if Engie is continuing to develop new applications with C3.AI. With the proven applications and set up, C3.AI then would be able to sell them to other companies that could also benefit from same implementation. **With Biden focusing on green energy infrastructures, one could expect the demand of the applications to increase.**\n\nTheir AI has also been used in sectors like utilities, banking, aerospace &amp; defense, healthcare, retail, telecommunications, smart cities, and transportation. **With already proven and prebuilt applications listed below that could be implemented into broader and more general sector.** \n\n\\- **Anti-money laundering**\n\n\\- **COVID-19 Data lake**\n\n\\- **AI CRM**\n\n\\- **Energy management**\n\n\\- **Fraud detection**\n\n\\- **Inventory optimization**\n\n\\- **Predictive maintenance**\n\n\\- **Production schedule optimization**\n\n\\- **Readiness**\n\n\\- **Sensor health**\n\n\\- **Supply network risk** \n\n**As C3.Ai continues to work with various more different sectors to create more applications, C3.AI will be able to reach into more boarder market. With already established applications in various broad sectors, C3.AI is going to take AI to the next level by focusing on deep penetration into business solutions, aerospace and defense with the partnership with Microsoft, Adobe and Raytheon Technologies to fully dominate the sectors.** \n\n **TLDR:** \n\n**There is none cause im too lazy to type one.**",

        "selftext": "**DoorDash just went public in a crazy overvalued IPO, AirBNB will follow today. Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco &amp; more. Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.\n\nWe saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.\n\nWe saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.\n\nToday we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.\n\nAlongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.\n\nOne good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week.\n\nInvestors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still\u2026 there is to much of a concentration in the bull\u2019s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.\n\nPositive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they\u2019re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.\n\nWhile on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.\n\nSo, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino\u2019s and many others from the food industry.\n\nAnd by the way, don\u2019t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.\n\nOne of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.\n\nWith the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can\u2019t get enough of this stock\u2019s, I don\u2019t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.\n\nToday we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don\u2019t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.\n\nSome other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don\u2019t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.\n\nWhile [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.\n\nAlso, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.\n\nI expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it\u2019s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.\n\nLikewise, [Dave &amp; Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren\u2019t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.\n\nWhile [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium.\n\nAdobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?\n\nSo, guys, don\u2019t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0).\n\nInvestors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.\n\nJust be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP &amp; UP.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": " source: [https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/airbnb-doordash-boost-price-ranges-ahead-of-mega-week-for-ipos-1.1532713](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/airbnb-doordash-boost-price-ranges-ahead-of-mega-week-for-ipos-1.1532713)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDecember is set to be the busiest year-end on record for initial public offerings in the U.S., with DoorDash Inc. and Airbnb Inc. ready to start trading this week in long-awaited listings.\n\nThe two startups, which are\u00a0aiming to\u00a0raise a combined US$6.2 billion at the top-end of their price ranges, will propel the month\u2019s IPO volume to all-time high, surpassing the US$8.3 billion mark set in December of both 2001 and 2003, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. IPOs on U.S. exchanges have already raised a record US$156 billion this year, the data show.\n\nBoth listings got an additional boost as the companies headed into the final stretch of marketing their shares. DoorDash\u00a0upped\u00a0the price range for its stock in a Friday filing, while Airbnb is planning to follow suit and increase its price range ahead of its IPO, people familiar with the matter\u00a0said\u00a0Sunday. The companies are now each expected to raise as much as US$3.1 billion, putting them among the top five biggest U.S. IPOs of 2020.\n\nPrivate companies that sat out the market chaos in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic -- and were awaiting a final outcome in the U.S. election -- are now rushing to go public. Airbnb and DoorDash will quickly be followed by three other mega-listings that could add billions of dollars to the IPO tally.\n\nAlso on deck to go public this month are Affirm Holdings Inc., which lets online shoppers pay for purchases such as Peloton bikes in installments, online video-game company Roblox Corp. and ContextLogic Inc., the parent of discount online retailer Wish. Each is likely to attain a valuation of tens of billions of dollars in its listing.\n\n\u201cThis group of companies that you have coming out now maybe weren\u2019t thought of initially as benefiting, but they\u2019ve been able to show very strong results despite the coronavirus,\u201d said Karen Snow, head of East Coast listings at Nasdaq Inc.\n\nAirbnb is\u00a0aiming to\u00a0be valued at as much as US$42 billion in its IPO, while DoorDash could hit a valuation of about US$35 billion, based on their updated price ranges. For DoorDash, that\u2019s more than double the private valuation it hit in a June fundraising round, after it seized on the pandemic-fueled boom in demand for meals brought to your door. Airbnb had been valued at US$18 billion in April after raising additional debt to shore up its finances. The company, which was initially hit hard by global travel restrictions, has more recently seen a boom in customers seeking longer-term, domestic rentals.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s IPO will also be a lucrative event for many of its employees. The company has offered billions of dollars worth of stock compensation to staff, similar to Uber Technologies Inc. and other large venture-backed companies that have gone public. The IPO will make some of its longtime employees millionaires on paper.\n\n**Time and Cash**\n\nEarlier this year, technology IPOs were dominated by enterprise software companies such as Snowflake Inc., which has soared more than 200 per cent\u00a0since its listing to a US$110 billion public market valuation. This month\u2019s cluster of soon-to-be public entities -- all based in the San Francisco Bay Area -- cater to consumers stuck at home with extra time and cash on their hands.\n\nShould the listings go well, it could signal investors are optimistic about an economic rebound after the dark days of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of support and interest from institutional investors for companies that are impacted by COVID\u00a0because the feeling is that they will recover,\u201d said Neil Kell, Bank of America Corp.\u2019s vice chairman of global equity capital markets.\n\n\u201cThe mindset is not that we\u2019re in December of 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mindset is how is it going to look a year from now.\u201d\n\nOne enterprise software listing is also planned for this week. C3.ai Inc., founded by former Oracle Corp. executive Tom Siebel, is expected to raise as much as US$527 million in its IPO.\n\n**Gauging Demand**\n\nBankers are using new methods to execute these large share sales, incorporating technology under development for years that was well-timed for use during the pandemic, when potential buyers can\u2019t meet the company executives and advisers in person.\n\nAirbnb, DoorDash and Roblox have asked prospective IPO investors to fill in their deal orders via an online portal, indicating their level of interest at any desired price, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are private.\n\nThe new process is aimed at helping issuers and their advisers gauge demand, especially for high-growth companies subject to wide differences in valuation among investors, the people said. The final price and share allocation are still determined by the seller.\n\nRepresentatives for the companies declined to comment.\n\nUnity Software Inc., used the same system in its September IPO. Unity sold its shares for $52 each and ended its first day of trading at US$68.35. The shares closed Friday at US$150.94 apiece.",

In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don\u2019t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.\n\nWhile [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.\n\nAlso, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.\n\nI expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it\u2019s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.\n\nLikewise, [Dave &amp; Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren\u2019t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.\n\nWhile [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium.\n\nAdobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?\n\nSo, guys, don\u2019t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0).\n\nInvestors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.\n\nJust be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP &amp; UP.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "We had the pleasure of having [Uberkikz11](/u/Uberkikz11) in for an [interview](https://anchor.fm/modernguilt/episodes/EP27--NEXT-STOP--GAMESTOP-MOON-BASE-ensdq6) and he dropped some good insight that I'll share here on everything Gamestop. Uberkiks11 has done DD so deep that he's basically an oracle at this point so strap in and get ready. I'll try and throw some key points down that I haven't seen covered in a lot of the other Gamestop DD. \n\n## the GME situation.\n\nIt should be no secret by now that people have been shifting away from Brick and Motor retailers and convenience shopping has largely shifted to online. We've all been fudded to death with blockbuster analogies and the rise of online gaming and steam. So why would anyone ever step foot in a Gamestop? \n\nWhile true that people are shifting away from standard brick and motor they are also seeking human interaction and experiential retail experiences. Part of the Sherm overhaul is specifically focusing on making these stores hubs to get expert knowledge from, and talk shit about peoples favorite games. \n\nYou know who loves to hang out in stores and endlessly talk about fantasy worlds with clerks and then spend money? Gamers, the lonely and Otakus all of which were packing out a local EB games (NZ Gamestop) and it was packed not only with people buying games but verbally shitposting at the clerks about the finer points of the Halo nerf gun and its accuracy compared to the game, which frankly as bullish as all the people walking out of there with EB game bags. \n\nOver this side of the world our internet can be a little shithouse some times as well. To the point that if you are trying to download a game that is unironically 90GBs it can take 2 days and blow your entire internet cap. This demographic is a lot larger then you think as most people don't have the patience or time to wait for the latest game hot the market. So no people are not going to be only downloading through online stores quite just yet. Also gamers love to show their collection. Its a mark of pride to show the your evolution and lineage from the first disk of Crash Bandicoot to your modern day COD collection. \n\nAnother addition I haven't seen mentioned in any recent DD is that the new PS5 only has 667GBs of storage. That is absolutely not hard to pack out with a few modern games and the ability to have more storage is disabled, to be [enabled on a future update](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551165/sony-ps5-playstation-5-no-m2-ssd-expansion-launch).\n\n## okay but what about the massive amount of losses?\n\nPart of these losses was writing off GOODWILL which is comprised of intangible assets which essentially means THEY DIDN'T LOSE ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH ACTUAL DOLLARS. They were writing off the fact they pissed their customers off and drove the brand name into the mud. So it is entirely likely they can return to profitability and soon after and its worth remembering that even a hateful emotional attachment is top of mind when stuck at 57.4 GB. Don't be fooled by the sly bear saying the company is going bankrupt they have more then enough cash to see them through until Sherms strategy plays itself out or they eventually kick him out for failing at his job. \n\n## But what about the revenue miss and the stores closing how can that possibly be bullish? or how I learned to stop worrying and love Sherman.\n\nPrior to shutting the stores GME was everywhere and had infested malls to the point of absurd inefficiency. There was a point where within the small mall there were multiple gamestops that were essentially competing with each other. As it is physical stores are ridiculously expensive to run. A good action to take in when you have too many stores and there is a shift online would be to close down unneeded stores and focus more on online shopping. And guess what? Thats exactly what the Sherm omniclose strat is all about. That's why when people say that closing 1000 stores is bullish, that while yes it will drop revenue, it will also allow Gamestop to focus more intently on profitable stores and Ecommerce. \n\nThen there is the shift towards a greater product line like console accessories, gaming headsets and focused advertising. This is part of building an experiential service that will be a league against companies like amazon that can't customize for hardcore gamers who lets face it are fanatics when it comes to their genre of choice. Despite Sherms shitty corporate speak they are actually somewhat following Cohens letter just on Boomer time. \n\n## Beyond the Cohen rainbow\n\nWe should all be aware of Cohen at this point. But there are actually more big dogs then Cohen and Burry betting that GME is going to turn around. What I've seen missing is Daniel Foss the billionaire and Senvest who \"employs a contrarian, value-based investment strategy \" or specialize in underdogs due for a comeback. Why would they do that? because they also see the big opportunity of a Gamestop turn around with sensible fiscal management and a turn towards being a multi product eCommerce store. So you're not alone in your holdings and its backed by some very big players in the game. \n\n## Where this leaves us?\n\nSo even ignoring the Ryan Cohen X factor, the short squeeze, and the other X factors this stock is a total value play. There is some much more detailed posts out there, notably the [infinity war](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/) post that dives into the numbers also worth a look at is [Uberkikz11](/u/Uberkikz11) profile and associated accounts you can find on his profile. The additional X factors that could take this from a strong value play to an actual lottery ticket is Cohen and the infamous short squeeze but thats a story for another day. \n\nThe Tl:dr is People still buy physical games, PS5 has limited space so yes physical disks aren't going away this console cycle. GME is shifting into bigger product categories, and they are backed by serious money. If you want to listen to Uberkiks11 go further into depth into the history of GME and the intricacies of this play you can listen and frankly do a much better job then this rough summary you can hear him in [full here](https://anchor.fm/modernguilt/episodes/EP27--NEXT-STOP--GAMESTOP-MOON-BASE-ensdq6)\n\nPositions: 2122 shares in GME $13.87 cost basis and more when I can.",

        "selftext": "**The latest jobless numbers came in bad while the stock market keeps pushing forward, is a stock market crash coming soon? Let\u2019s talk about this and the latest stock market news**\n\nHey everyone! So let\u2019s start with the recap off Friday as we saw the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HD8WbDT) leading the way up 0,88%, with the [DOW Industrial](https://ibb.co/sCt0FJj) close behind up 0,83% and the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/dDhWbBG) also gaining a decent amount, up 0,7% with all 3 big indexes closing at all-time highs.\n\nWe saw more than \u00be of the [stocks](https://ibb.co/CB6cSMn) advancing despite below average volume as companies either small, mid or large cap value or growth [stocks](https://ibb.co/qCNqN5G) were gaining except large-cap growth.\n\nThe best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/d6f58Mf) were Energy and Materials up over 2% while Utilities finished 1% down on Friday, as Utilities were the only sector to finish the week losing significant ground, with Consumer Discretionary also dropping just 0,12%. With the rest of the sectors in the green, Energy, Health Care, Technology and Communication being the biggest gainers finishing the week up over 2%.\n\n[Utilities](https://ibb.co/Bz8TnvP) have been hit hard in the last year as residential consumers and small businesses have been able to defer paying power bills, this will continue to hold down the sector for now with the debt still increasing.\n\nThe VIX also dropped more than 2% on [Friday](https://ibb.co/18qjBx7) and finished the [week](https://ibb.co/7KyfPxQ) over 5% down as the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/sKhhfx6) from Friday shows us that there were plenty of gains to be made especially in the Energy Sectors as well as Financials, with the big companies from the Tech and Communication sectors doing worse than the rest of the market.\n\nFor the week though this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/92hRtQL) shows that Apple was one of the biggest gainers alongside Semiconductors and Energy Names while Health Care companies like JNJ and Pfizer also did very good.\n\nThe big indexes all finished higher for the [week](https://ibb.co/b3Gb4HN) with the SP500 up 1,7%, the Nasdaq Composite up 2,1% and the Dow up 1% with renewed hopes for a stimulus package being back on the table.\n\nHere are the most interesting economic [reports](https://ibb.co/j84CkLT) for next week, it will be a light week in terms of economic data but still, the market may be volatile and trends may change depending on some of the results.\n\nSo, on Friday [November JOBS](https://ibb.co/r0JPtCs) came in much lower than anticipated, coming in at 245K vs de 610K in October and 469K estimated while the unemployment [rate](https://ibb.co/M9mNBMT) dropped to 6,7% a bit better than expected and down from 6,9% in the past month. Still there are over 10million people unemployed, this number more than doubling since the start on February. The [net addition](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) of jobs in November was the [smallest](https://ibb.co/dWKmZWH) since May as government jobs were the [worst performing](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) while transportation and warehousing jobs continue to increase, as big companies \u2026 aka Amazon has hired almost 3thousand people per day this year. But the bad news is that [long-term](https://ibb.co/HFZFhyC) unemployment is approaching the peaks from the Great Recession and that is not good news for the economy or the stock market as over 3,9 million people have been out of work for at least 6 months.\n\nSo, this is pretty bad news as mortgages in [forbearance](https://ibb.co/NLcDmYP) just slightly declined this week, by just 39K with more and more plans planned to expire in December, over 1M more exactly, more than 40% of active cases.\n\nThis may finally put some extra pressure on the Congress to agree to a relief package maybe even passing it alongside the government [funding bill](https://ibb.co/1qkTnsD) that is still debated and has over 300 issues that the parties don\u2019t agree on.\n\nThis is becoming more and more obvious as [cases](https://ibb.co/6y9FTjV) in the US continue to rise, coming in over 200k in the last 2 days and the economy will soon feel the pressure from this, I expect the next month or two of economic data to not be so good, this may be the time the market sees a 5-10% correction before moving on higher on more positive things like the availability of the vaccine, the passing of the torch In the Presidency and a possible relief package.\n\nYes, this will continue to add to the [US DEBT](https://ibb.co/QjSPcdB), but even though I don\u2019t have any partisan views, a good structured relief bill would do wonders for the economy as a bridge to when the vaccine will finally be widely available.\n\nYes, I know that the global debt is set to reach $200 trillion but the DEBT-to-GDP [ratio](https://ibb.co/LhWkxKJ) is projected to slowly go back down in the next couple of years.\n\nOther numbers that came in on Friday were [Factory ORDERS](https://ibb.co/xm7JJ2Q) which came in better than expected at +1%. While a new Redfin report indicates an increase in [average home prices](https://ibb.co/pXYNGcz) year over year of 16% with the number of pending home [sales up](https://ibb.co/2nw00m3) almost 30% over last year while new listings of home sales is [up just 9%](https://ibb.co/v3nyLPZ) since 2019 and dropping rather fast in the last months with sales of homes going for all time-high [prices](https://ibb.co/gmvRPd7) at 99,5% of the asking price as the real estate market keeps booming along.\n\nThe other number that came in on Friday and was not so good was the [trade deficit](https://ibb.co/42nsy2W), which widened even more in the last month by almost $2B.\n\nSo next week is again pretty slow in [earnings reports](https://ibb.co/Xkr4f4P) with the most interesting ones on being Chewy, GameStop, Adobe, LuluLemon, Dave&amp;Busters, Costco, Oracle and Broadcom.\n\nI own a small stake in all of them except Oracle and GameStop. I don\u2019t see such a big growth opportunity with Oracle while GameStop I believe will struggle to turn around the business with very though e-commerce competition.\n\nWe will also have a number of new [IPOs](https://ibb.co/0jQWwTf) this week from DoorDash, AirBNB, C3.ai, Hydrofarm and Pubmatic. The first 3 are more interesting for myself but I will only take a first look at AirBNB and at what price that stock goes public to maybe get some action, I think we will a much bigger price than the 44-50$ price range to begin with for public trading. I also expect the same thing to happen with DoorDash which has already raised the IPO [pricing](https://ibb.co/Y8VSCpV) to 90-95$ but I am not very interested to buy that stock, as this type of economy has hugely benefited them and it might see a decrease rather than an increase in the next couple of years.\n\nSo, guys I still believe the stock market has upside in front of it, especially in the next 2 years, but you should tread careful for now, I think a possible correction might be just ahead before we move on higher, as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/9g0bJdj), a wedge formation is continuing to from with more and more tension, I believe there is about a 6,5% possible downside to the market at the moment before eventually getting back on track next year and going toward the 4000 level. And especially with the most recent jobless numbers in the US, I would try to diversify a little more especially with some EAST-ASIA exposure in countries like South Korea, Singapore and China also.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "Yes, you see it. The ticker is **$AI**. Probably the most bullish ticker ever. This means that boomers will have to spell 2 letters less to purchase this stock. \n\nI managed to get in at $100. Holding long-term.\n\nA few key facts:\n\n1.Microsoft invested $50 Mil. in $AI.\n\n2. It's founded by Thomas Siebel - a fokin genius billionaire who founded Siebel Systems and revolutionized the customer relationship applications (bought by Oracle for 2 billion back in 2006). And let's not forget he has a MS in Computer Science and doctorate in Engineering. He fokin knows what he's doing.\n\n3.Government contracts, including the US Air Force.\n\n4.Commercial contracts like Dutch Shell.\n\n5.C3.ai concentrates on neuronal networks and machine learning. And the best thing is BOOMERS WON'T HAVE TO CODE in order to use their services. Yes, their software is scalable and simple for our  rich and retarded boomer generation. Which means money will keep flowing for the next 20+ years at least.\n\n6.Last but not least, this company is NOT palantir. It's CREATING it's own AI models, not just connecting dots like pltr.\n\nLet me say it again. The ticket is **$AI**. I've been waiting for a ticker like this FOR YEARS.\n\nGood luck to you all and have fun in the casino!",

        "selftext": "**The latest jobless numbers came in bad while the stock market keeps pushing forward, is a stock market crash coming soon? Let\u2019s talk about this and the latest stock market news**\n\nHey everyone! So let\u2019s start with the recap off Friday as we saw the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HD8WbDT) leading the way up 0,88%, with the [DOW Industrial](https://ibb.co/sCt0FJj) close behind up 0,83% and the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/dDhWbBG) also gaining a decent amount, up 0,7% with all 3 big indexes closing at all-time highs.\n\nWe saw more than \u00be of the [stocks](https://ibb.co/CB6cSMn) advancing despite below average volume as companies either small, mid or large cap value or growth [stocks](https://ibb.co/qCNqN5G) were gaining except large-cap growth.\n\nThe best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/d6f58Mf) were Energy and Materials up over 2% while Utilities finished 1% down on Friday, as Utilities were the only sector to finish the week losing significant ground, with Consumer Discretionary also dropping just 0,12%. With the rest of the sectors in the green, Energy, Health Care, Technology and Communication being the biggest gainers finishing the week up over 2%.\n\n[Utilities](https://ibb.co/Bz8TnvP) have been hit hard in the last year as residential consumers and small businesses have been able to defer paying power bills, this will continue to hold down the sector for now with the debt still increasing.\n\nThe VIX also dropped more than 2% on [Friday](https://ibb.co/18qjBx7) and finished the [week](https://ibb.co/7KyfPxQ) over 5% down as the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/sKhhfx6) from Friday shows us that there were plenty of gains to be made especially in the Energy Sectors as well as Financials, with the big companies from the Tech and Communication sectors doing worse than the rest of the market.\n\nFor the week though this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/92hRtQL) shows that Apple was one of the biggest gainers alongside Semiconductors and Energy Names while Health Care companies like JNJ and Pfizer also did very good.\n\nThe big indexes all finished higher for the [week](https://ibb.co/b3Gb4HN) with the SP500 up 1,7%, the Nasdaq Composite up 2,1% and the Dow up 1% with renewed hopes for a stimulus package being back on the table.\n\nHere are the most interesting economic [reports](https://ibb.co/j84CkLT) for next week, it will be a light week in terms of economic data but still, the market may be volatile and trends may change depending on some of the results.\n\nSo, on Friday [November JOBS](https://ibb.co/r0JPtCs) came in much lower than anticipated, coming in at 245K vs de 610K in October and 469K estimated while the unemployment [rate](https://ibb.co/M9mNBMT) dropped to 6,7% a bit better than expected and down from 6,9% in the past month. Still there are over 10million people unemployed, this number more than doubling since the start on February. The [net addition](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) of jobs in November was the [smallest](https://ibb.co/dWKmZWH) since May as government jobs were the [worst performing](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) while transportation and warehousing jobs continue to increase, as big companies \u2026 aka Amazon has hired almost 3thousand people per day this year. But the bad news is that [long-term](https://ibb.co/HFZFhyC) unemployment is approaching the peaks from the Great Recession and that is not good news for the economy or the stock market as over 3,9 million people have been out of work for at least 6 months.\n\nSo, this is pretty bad news as mortgages in [forbearance](https://ibb.co/NLcDmYP) just slightly declined this week, by just 39K with more and more plans planned to expire in December, over 1M more exactly, more than 40% of active cases.\n\nThis may finally put some extra pressure on the Congress to agree to a relief package maybe even passing it alongside the government [funding bill](https://ibb.co/1qkTnsD) that is still debated and has over 300 issues that the parties don\u2019t agree on.\n\nThis is becoming more and more obvious as [cases](https://ibb.co/6y9FTjV) in the US continue to rise, coming in over 200k in the last 2 days and the economy will soon feel the pressure from this, I expect the next month or two of economic data to not be so good, this may be the time the market sees a 5-10% correction before moving on higher on more positive things like the availability of the vaccine, the passing of the torch In the Presidency and a possible relief package.\n\nYes, this will continue to add to the [US DEBT](https://ibb.co/QjSPcdB), but even though I don\u2019t have any partisan views, a good structured relief bill would do wonders for the economy as a bridge to when the vaccine will finally be widely available.\n\nYes, I know that the global debt is set to reach $200 trillion but the DEBT-to-GDP [ratio](https://ibb.co/LhWkxKJ) is projected to slowly go back down in the next couple of years.\n\nOther numbers that came in on Friday were [Factory ORDERS](https://ibb.co/xm7JJ2Q) which came in better than expected at +1%. While a new Redfin report indicates an increase in [average home prices](https://ibb.co/pXYNGcz) year over year of 16% with the number of pending home [sales up](https://ibb.co/2nw00m3) almost 30% over last year while new listings of home sales is [up just 9%](https://ibb.co/v3nyLPZ) since 2019 and dropping rather fast in the last months with sales of homes going for all time-high [prices](https://ibb.co/gmvRPd7) at 99,5% of the asking price as the real estate market keeps booming along.\n\nThe other number that came in on Friday and was not so good was the [trade deficit](https://ibb.co/42nsy2W), which widened even more in the last month by almost $2B.\n\nSo next week is again pretty slow in [earnings reports](https://ibb.co/Xkr4f4P) with the most interesting ones on being Chewy, GameStop, Adobe, LuluLemon, Dave&amp;Busters, Costco, Oracle and Broadcom.\n\nI own a small stake in all of them except Oracle and GameStop. I don\u2019t see such a big growth opportunity with Oracle while GameStop I believe will struggle to turn around the business with very though e-commerce competition.\n\nWe will also have a number of new [IPOs](https://ibb.co/0jQWwTf) this week from DoorDash, AirBNB, C3.ai, Hydrofarm and Pubmatic. The first 3 are more interesting for myself but I will only take a first look at AirBNB and at what price that stock goes public to maybe get some action, I think we will a much bigger price than the 44-50$ price range to begin with for public trading. I also expect the same thing to happen with DoorDash which has already raised the IPO [pricing](https://ibb.co/Y8VSCpV) to 90-95$ but I am not very interested to buy that stock, as this type of economy has hugely benefited them and it might see a decrease rather than an increase in the next couple of years.\n\nSo, guys I still believe the stock market has upside in front of it, especially in the next 2 years, but you should tread careful for now, I think a possible correction might be just ahead before we move on higher, as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/9g0bJdj), a wedge formation is continuing to from with more and more tension, I believe there is about a 6,5% possible downside to the market at the moment before eventually getting back on track next year and going toward the 4000 level. And especially with the most recent jobless numbers in the US, I would try to diversify a little more especially with some EAST-ASIA exposure in countries like South Korea, Singapore and China also.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "&gt; TikTok's parent company ByteDance last week was given a new deadline of Dec. 4 to complete a proposed sale of the social video app to business software giant Oracle and retailer Walmart. The Trump administration delayed the cutoff date for seven days after giving ByteDance a 15-day extension that was due to expire on Nov. 27, per a court filing cited by Reuters.\n\nWith the popularity of tiktok and its format that seems very much here to stay, this is a bigg play for WMT. It opens up a new world of possibilities with e-commerce beyond just tapping into revenue on one of the most used social media services.\n\nThis deal doesn\u2019t HAVE to get done. But will most likely get done considering what\u2019s on the line for everyone involved. They\u2019ve already extended the date once and are unlikely to get any more time.\n\nWMT has been extremely aggressive about expanding their business and entering new markets. This is just the first result of a years long effort to compete with the likes of amazon and other large caps with diversified revenue streams.\n\nI imagine that once this deal is settled, and before the end of the year, they will also release numbers on Walmart+ which is rumored to have collected an impressive amount of subscribers thus far.\n\nBest part is there\u2019s limited downside. COVID picks up again? Good for Walmart. Economy turns to shit and creates a bunch of poors? Good for Walmart.  Stimulus check passes? Great for Walmart. People hate jeff bezos? Good for Walmart. Super gay dance moves become more popular? Great for fucking Walmart!! Don\u2019t be late \n\n12/4 152.5c x3\n12/11 160c x5\n6/18/21 155c x10",

        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is near the lows and almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\nIf you guys find this list useful (it's my first time posting this here), I can make this a weekly/weekend thing.

        "selftext": "Hello  \n\nI write to remind you of an old friend of the sub, Mr. Satya Nutella.   \n\nMSFT has been sideways ever since they tried to acquire a clock company, but MSFT is still MSFT, and azure is still azure. ER will be late Jan/early Feb, and IV is low rn.  \n\nPost-ER ATM Jan MSFT calls have IV around 30%, w/ break even around $220. IV on LEAPS is also low.  I'm thinking there might be IV expansion heading into earnings, if the whole market goes up MSFT could just ride the wave, or third MSFT just bounces around alot btw 205-215 and if it randomly rises then cool. AFAIK opportunities for downside are basically a market crash/tech dip or random unexpected bad news for MSFT, which is just true for everything. For comparison on IV pre earnings in the current market, I'm looking at something like Oracle, a huge boring company that has ER tonight and IV on ATM options of 110%. Maybe there's some unique reason Oracle has high IV, but I don't know it.   \n\n**TL;DR**: Positions: 5 MSFT 215c 2/19/2021; 8 MSFT 210c 1/21/2022; 8 MSFT -235c 12/11/2020; 2 BA 295c 1/21/22; 2 BA -300c 12/11/2020",

        "selftext": "**The latest jobless numbers came in bad while the stock market keeps pushing forward, is a stock market crash coming soon? Let\u2019s talk about this and the latest stock market news**\n\nHey everyone! So let\u2019s start with the recap off Friday as we saw the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HD8WbDT) leading the way up 0,88%, with the [DOW Industrial](https://ibb.co/sCt0FJj) close behind up 0,83% and the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/dDhWbBG) also gaining a decent amount, up 0,7% with all 3 big indexes closing at all-time highs.\n\nWe saw more than \u00be of the [stocks](https://ibb.co/CB6cSMn) advancing despite below average volume as companies either small, mid or large cap value or growth [stocks](https://ibb.co/qCNqN5G) were gaining except large-cap growth. \n\nThe best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/d6f58Mf) were Energy and Materials up over 2% while Utilities finished 1% down on Friday, as Utilities were the only sector to finish the week losing significant ground, with Consumer Discretionary also dropping just 0,12%. With the rest of the sectors in the green, Energy, Health Care, Technology and Communication being the biggest gainers finishing the week up over 2%.\n\n[Utilities](https://ibb.co/Bz8TnvP) have been hit hard in the last year as residential consumers and small businesses have been able to defer paying power bills, this will continue to hold down the sector for now with the debt still increasing.\n\nThe VIX also dropped more than 2% on [Friday](https://ibb.co/18qjBx7) and finished the [week](https://ibb.co/7KyfPxQ) over 5% down as the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/sKhhfx6) from Friday shows us that there were plenty of gains to be made especially in the Energy Sectors as well as Financials, with the big companies from the Tech and Communication sectors doing worse than the rest of the market.\n\nFor the week though this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/92hRtQL) shows that Apple was one of the biggest gainers alongside Semiconductors and Energy Names while Health Care companies like JNJ and Pfizer also did very good.\n\nThe big indexes all finished higher for the [week](https://ibb.co/b3Gb4HN) with the SP500 up 1,7%, the Nasdaq Composite up 2,1% and the Dow up 1% with renewed hopes for a stimulus package being back on the table.\n\nHere are the most interesting economic [reports](https://ibb.co/j84CkLT) for next week, it will be a light week in terms of economic data but still, the market may be volatile and trends may change depending on some of the results.\n\nSo, on Friday [November JOBS](https://ibb.co/r0JPtCs) came in much lower than anticipated, coming in at 245K vs de 610K in October and 469K estimated while the unemployment [rate](https://ibb.co/M9mNBMT) dropped to 6,7% a bit better than expected and down from 6,9% in the past month. Still there are over 10million people unemployed, this number more than doubling since the start on February. The [net addition](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) of jobs in November was the [smallest](https://ibb.co/dWKmZWH) since May as government jobs were the [worst performing](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) while transportation and warehousing jobs continue to increase, as big companies \u2026 aka Amazon has hired almost 3thousand people per day this year. But the bad news is that [long-term](https://ibb.co/HFZFhyC) unemployment is approaching the peaks from the Great Recession and that is not good news for the economy or the stock market as over 3,9 million people have been out of work for at least 6 months. \n\nSo, this is pretty bad news as mortgages in [forbearance](https://ibb.co/NLcDmYP) just slightly declined this week, by just 39K with more and more plans planned to expire in December, over 1M more exactly, more than 40% of active cases.\n\nThis may finally put some extra pressure on the Congress to agree to a relief package maybe even passing it alongside the government [funding bill](https://ibb.co/1qkTnsD) that is still debated and has over 300 issues that the parties don\u2019t agree on. \n\nThis is becoming more and more obvious as [cases](https://ibb.co/6y9FTjV) in the US continue to rise, coming in over 200k in the last 2 days and the economy will soon feel the pressure from this, I expect the next month or two of economic data to not be so good, this may be the time the market sees a 5-10% correction before moving on higher on more positive things like the availability of the vaccine, the passing of the torch In the Presidency and a possible relief package.\n\nYes, this will continue to add to the [US DEBT](https://ibb.co/QjSPcdB), but even though I don\u2019t have any partisan views, a good structured relief bill would do wonders for the economy as a bridge to when the vaccine will finally be widely available.\n\nYes, I know that the global debt is set to reach $200 trillion but the DEBT-to-GDP [ratio](https://ibb.co/LhWkxKJ) is projected to slowly go back down in the next couple of years.\n\nOther numbers that came in on Friday were [Factory ORDERS](https://ibb.co/xm7JJ2Q) which came in better than expected at +1%. While a new Redfin report indicates an increase in [average home prices](https://ibb.co/pXYNGcz) year over year of 16% with the number of pending home [sales up](https://ibb.co/2nw00m3) almost 30% over last year while new listings of home sales is [up just 9%](https://ibb.co/v3nyLPZ) since 2019 and dropping rather fast in the last months with sales of homes going for all time-high [prices](https://ibb.co/gmvRPd7) at 99,5% of the asking price as the real estate market keeps booming along.\n\nThe other number that came in on Friday and was not so good was the [trade deficit](https://ibb.co/42nsy2W), which widened even more in the last month by almost $2B.\n\nSo next week is again pretty slow in [earnings reports](https://ibb.co/Xkr4f4P) with the most interesting ones on being Chewy, GameStop, Adobe, LuluLemon, Dave&amp;Busters, Costco, Oracle and Broadcom.\n\nI own a small stake in all of them except Oracle and GameStop. I don\u2019t see such a big growth opportunity with Oracle while GameStop I believe will struggle to turn around the business with very though e-commerce competition.\n\nWe will also have a number of new [IPOs](https://ibb.co/0jQWwTf) this week from DoorDash, AirBNB, C3.ai, Hydrofarm and Pubmatic. The first 3 are more interesting for myself but I will only take a first look at AirBNB and at what price that stock goes public to maybe get some action, I think we will a much bigger price than the 44-50$ price range to begin with for public trading. I also expect the same thing to happen with DoorDash which has already raised the IPO [pricing](https://ibb.co/Y8VSCpV) to 90-95$ but I am not very interested to buy that stock, as this type of economy has hugely benefited them and it might see a decrease rather than an increase in the next couple of years.\n\nSo, guys I still believe the stock market has upside in front of it, especially in the next 2 years, but you should tread careful for now, I think a possible correction might be just ahead before we move on higher, as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/9g0bJdj), a wedge formation is continuing to from with more and more tension, I believe there is about a 6,5% possible downside to the market at the moment before eventually getting back on track next year and going toward the 4000 level. And especially with the most recent jobless numbers in the US, I would try to diversify a little more especially with some EAST-ASIA exposure in countries like South Korea, Singapore and China also.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.\n\nWe saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.\n\nWe saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.\n\nToday we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.\n\nAlongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.\n\nOne good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week.\n\nInvestors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still\u2026 there is to much of a concentration in the bull\u2019s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.\n\nPositive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they\u2019re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.\n\nWhile on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.\n\nSo, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino\u2019s and many others from the food industry.\n\nAnd by the way, don\u2019t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.\n\nOne of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.\n\nWith the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can\u2019t get enough of this stock\u2019s, I don\u2019t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.\n\nToday we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don\u2019t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.\n\nSome other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don\u2019t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.\n\nWhile [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.\n\nAlso, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.\n\nI expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it\u2019s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.\n\nLikewise, [Dave &amp; Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren\u2019t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.\n\nWhile [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium.\n\nAdobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?\n\nSo, guys, don\u2019t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0).\n\nInvestors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.\n\nJust be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP &amp; UP.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Ticker: PCPL (Neuberger Principal Holdings)\n\nPrice as of Previous Close: $11.05\n\nMerger target: E2OPEN\n\nSector: Tech (B2B SaaS)\n\nStatus: Definitive Agreement\n\nTLDR: #1 leading supply chain SaaS provider with low valuation. Hidden gem work-from-home economy play. if you like the APXT merger you should like PCPL even more. \n\nInfo about E2Open:\nBusiness-to-business SaaS provider, focused on software for supply chains for telecom, electronics systems, computers, components etc. The company was a joint project by LG, IBM, Seagate, Hitacha, Solectron, Toshiba and Nortel. It is based in Texas and was founded 20 years ago. E2Open is the world\u2019s largest supply chain operating network.\n\nPrior to being acquired by a venture capital company in 2015, E2Open was listed on Nasdaq. Its historical trading data can be found under the ticker EOPN (https://www.investing.com/equities/e2open-inc-historical-data)\n\nIt IPO\u2019ed in 2012 at $15, peaked at $27+ in 2014, and declined to $8.5 by the time of its acquisition in 2015.\n\nIndustry Insight/Hype Potential:\nAlthough SaaS isn\u2019t quite as hot as EV these days, there are still plenty of investor interest in tech companies that deliver on revenue and growth. For example, another SaaS provider AvePoint (APXT/AVPT) is trading above $16. Here\u2019s a comparison between AvePoint and E2Open:\n\nAvePoint is a cloud based SaaS provider founded in 2001 with ~1300 employees, ~$150m annual revenue. It will have a pro-forma EV of ~$2b \n\nE2Open is a cloud based SaaS provider founded in 2000 with ~2400 employees and ~$300m annual revenue. It will have a pro-forma EV of ~$2.5b\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t compare E2Open with AvePoint\u2026 AvePoint has clients like MSFT!\u201d:\nHere are some of E2Open\u2019s clients:\nBoeing, Bose, Dell, General Electric, Kelloggs, L\u2019Oreal, Lenovo, P&amp;G, Seagate, Vodafone, AMD, Canon, Oracle, NVidia, HP etc etc\n\nE2Open has a 4.7 rating based on 500+ reviews (source: https://www.featuredcustomers.com/vendor/e2open/testimonials.) Here is what Vodafone\u2019s Group Supply Chain Management Director and CEO Detlef Shultz had to say about E2Open\u2019s Supply Chain Management Softwares:\n\n\u201cE2Open understands the direction we\u2019re taking as a company, and continues to help us refine and move toward that vision. By automating key business processes as part of a comprehensive supply chain strategy, we have been able to eliminate redundancies and more quickly meet transactional goals.\u201d\n\nHere is an overview of E2Open vs. some of its direct competitors in terms of company size and revenue:\nhttps://www.owler.com/company/e2open#competitors\n\nOutlook: E2Open has been aggressively snapping up acquisitions to further cement its role as a leader in supply chain management. Among its most recent acquisitions are: Averetek (2019), Amber Road (2019), INTTRA (2018), Cloud Logistics (2018), BIrch Worldwide (2018), Zyme Solutions (2017) and Steelwedge Software (2017). The money raised in the PCPL merger would pay down existing debt, improve balance sheets, and perhaps fund more strategic acquisitions in the coming years.\n\nLogistics will definitely play a huge role in the post-COVID world, and as the #1 supply chain management SaaS E2Open is poised to benefit the most from this fact.\n\nOf course, there are many other factors other than customer reviews and revenues to consider when it comes to a company\u2019s valuation. To that end, I would recommend that you do your own DD.\n\nResources:\nInvestor Presentation: https://www.ccnbprincipal.com/investor-relations/cc-neuberger-principal-holdings-I/default.aspx\nhttps://www.investing.com/equities/e2open-inc\n\nI haven\u2019t noticed PCPL being mentioned on Reddit or elsewhere, so I\u2019m inclined to believe that word about this SPAC hasn\u2019t gotten out yet. There are only ~800 people watching PCPL on Stocktwits compared to Apxt\u2019s 18000+. I will say that at ~10% over NAV, the risks here are very low (for now). The merger will happen some time in Q1 2021, and I believe that the price of PCPL will shoot up once it is announced.\n\nDisclaimer: this is NOT financial or investment advice. This is just research that I came across and decided to share with you.",

        "selftext": "**Sales Growth**\n\nPalantir's (PLTR) growth increased by 51.87% in the last quarter. As shown within Figure 1, this is a quick and promising recovery from the COVID quarter. This coupled with the downturn of COVID cases and PLTR's active involvement in combatting the virus should continue to enable revenue uptick. It should be particularly noted that PLTR'S September Net Income (\\~900m) has increased dramatically now they have signed a number of significant contracts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DO WALL STREET ANALYSTS RECOMMEND INVESTORS BUY SHARES OF PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES?**\n\n6 Wall Street analysts have issued \"buy,\" \"hold,\" and \"sell\" ratings for Palantir Technologies in the last year. There are currently 5 hold ratings and 1 buy rating for the stock, resulting in a consensus recommendation of \"Hold.\" This is relevant as of 12/2. **I got banned before making this post because the mods are fgts so I'm too lazy to update.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHEN IS PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES' NEXT EARNINGS DATE? SHALL I GET SHARES TO HOLD FOR GLORIOUS TENDIES?**\n\nPalantir Technologies is scheduled to release its next quarterly earnings announcement on Thursday, February 11th 2021. Holding shares until this point would be my advice, especially given their newly executed contracts with substantial SLAs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHEN DID PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES IPO?**\n\n(PLTR) raised $0 in an initial public offering (IPO) on Wednesday, September 30th 2020. The company issued 257,100,000 shares at $0.00 per share. None served as the underwriter for the IPO. This is a NEW stock. It will be volatile, as is a lot of IPOs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO ARE PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES' MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS?**\n\nPalantir Technologies' stock is owned by a variety of retail and institutional investors. Top institutional shareholders include Point72 Asset Management L.P. (1.95%), BlackRock Inc. (1.91%), Soros Fund Management LLC (1.20%), Allen Operations LLC (0.45%), Myriad Asset Management Ltd. (0.31%) and Public Sector Pension Investment Board (0.29%). Company insiders that own Palantir Technologies stock include Alexander C Karp, Alexander D Moore, David A Glazer, Matthew A Long, Shyam Sankar and Stephen Andrew Cohen.\n\n**WHAT IS PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES' STOCK PRICE TODAY?**\n\nOne share of PLTR stock can currently be purchased for approximately $28.87. High band priced at 36.70 by EOY based on current trends. Low band priced at $21.10 by EOY based on current trends. This prediction is indicative of current trends, however would not be a sign for future performance. My personal view is if you own shares, hold them. Similar companies within PLTR's industry Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP), Shopify (SHOP), ServiceNow (NOW), Intuit (INTU), Square (SQ), Snowflake (SNOW), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Autodesk (ADSK), VMware (VMW) on average have shown a steady uptick of growth and will continue to do so given the future viability of the product. Buying is under your own discretion, if you think that big data is going to be a part of the future then consider a buy. If not, don't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: Newly IPO'd company, high likelihood to continue to grow exponentially over time now commercialised, strong contracts but volatile stock. \n\n**Recommendation:** Ban anyone who bad-mouths PLTR",

        "selftext": "**Disney lays out the plans for the future, the FDA advisory panel gives their OK. What\u2019s my price target and should you buy DoorDash and AirBnB? Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good morning! So let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we only saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/1RgJRtS) gaining some ground, up more than half a % while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/vQY7s6C) finished .13% down and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/BcgtnC2) fell just below 30k, losing .23% for the day. All 3 indexes traded way lower in the beginning of the day after the jobless claims came in, but recovered once the FDA Advisory panel meeting started. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/SwcQnHs) finish higher for the day after it opened at over 23 to start us off.\n\nAlmost 60% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/qdWy3jk), but the volume was way below average for most of them, with the Energy sector being the only significant gainer, up 3% for the day while most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/5xskzgj) were flat or even lost ground for the day. On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/Z28KH04), only large-cap value companies from the industrial sector suffered big yesterday, as small cap growth companies outperformed.\n\nYou can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0jvPBX), that big caps, with the exception of Apple and Tesla did struggle yesterday, while most of the companies with big gains were from the oil &amp; gas industry, with Chevron gaining more than 3% for the day, while Exxon, Total and BP also had big gains.\n\nThe numbers that came in [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MPxZS56) on the economic front where mixed. As initial and continuing jobless claims came in [worse](https://ibb.co/NmgdXbJ) than expected, as more than 850K people filed for initial claims up more than 125K since the last week and what the analysts [expected](https://ibb.co/KrGcRk7), as this was the biggest spike in initial claims since march, while the continuing claims also rose for the first time since September. I am wondering, will [this](https://ibb.co/0X6FCH5) finally push the congress to act on a relief bill? I think the economy really needs it as a bridge to better times. Just look at the [EU](https://ibb.co/ncSgyWd), they have finally agreed on $2.2T budget and stimulus package to help the Eurozone get through the difficult times.\n\nBetter numbers came in from the consumer price [index](https://ibb.co/NjLW663), as the index rose by .2%, after it was unchanged in October, but this should be taken with a grain of salt, as most of consumer confidence increase comes from the high-income [consumers](https://ibb.co/DVJ5nK9), while people who have an income under $50K still struggling.\n\nAlso, the Federal [Budget](https://ibb.co/8BFdyZ7) came in better than expected as the deficit shrank more in November compared to October and compared to last year\u2019s month.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/pP78rTs) is a slow day in terms of economic data, but we do get a final read on the Producer price index and the consumer sentiment index.\n\nWe also finally got the [FDA](https://ibb.co/9gLsrh6) panel of outside experts meeting yesterday, which saw the panel vote 17 FOR, 4 against and one abstain. The only small concerns were on the topic of 16 and 17-year old\u2019s as some experts argued that there is insufficient data on that subgroup, but I don\u2019t think that is a case for concern, as the vaccine is likely going to take a while until young people will start to get the shot, as they are one of the least impacted groups. This is great news, as the FDA does usually follow up this committee advice, so we can see the FDA Emergency use authorization very very soon. Vaccine doses are already ready go within 24hours of the authorization so, things will start to move rather fast after that.\n\nSo, we got some earnings numbers yesterday from a lot of companies, let\u2019s talk about them a little.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/C040BWf) posted a beat on the top and bottom line with e-commerce sales rising by more than 80%, while [comparable](https://ibb.co/YQQknbj) sales in stores were more than 17%. With both EPS and revenue beating the estimates, I think this might be the time to get into COSTCO, as they are one of the best retailers in the world, they always trade at a premium, the [stock](https://ibb.co/QnQNJGJ) is just about 5% from the all-time high and is far from overbought territory. I really like them as they have also rewarded shareholders constantly both with great growth and dividends.\n\n[Broadcom](https://ibb.co/St74KMD) also posted a great beat on EPS and an 11% increase in revenues, fueled by a great beat in the semiconductor segment, while also posting a free cash flow of over $3B, way better than expected, as they also increased the quarterly dividend by 11% and have made a lot of [senior](https://ibb.co/hcMS6Vs) leadership changes yesterday, but the [stock](https://ibb.co/TB97nhZ) is down more than 2% in pre-market trading despite a lot of great numbers.\n\nThe company has most of its [revenues](https://ibb.co/bLbzgKL) coming from semiconductor solutions, this is very good as the [global](https://ibb.co/GfZGfnz) semiconductor sales have increased more than 5% in FY2020 and are expected to increase more than 8% for FY 2021, way better than the previous [outlook](https://ibb.co/MSrLh0p) of 6,2%.\n\nThe company also posted all time [highs](https://ibb.co/1vM8WP0) in net revenue, free cash flows, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, while the compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/zRW1jLZ) of the dividend since FY2016 is almost 50%. I think I might be investing even more in this company especially if they have a pullback.\n\nNext let\u2019s go to Lululemon who also [posted](https://ibb.co/qF1NnnN) a beat on EPS and Revenues, while comparable sales were up 19% with better gross and operating margins than expected. This was led by a huge [rise](https://ibb.co/zfKRJX5) in the international markets which will continue to expand as they gain more recognition overseas.\n\nA smaller company that [reported](https://ibb.co/2WMrybz) yesterday was Dave &amp; Buster\u2019s as the losses were smaller than expected as comparable store sales declined by 66% as the restrictions in the restaurant industry keeps hammering away. The stock was trading +4% in after hours as investors may have though of an even worse result.\n\nMoving on, [Adobe](https://ibb.co/Vjwwprm) also released earnings before the market opened yesterday, after a delayed earnings release. They posted a great beat on EPS and the revenues while also giving great guidance for next year, way above the consensus, with more than $15B in revenues and a EPS of over $11. The company also announced a new $15B share buyback [program](https://ibb.co/cKBbMpF) which will increase the value of the stock through the next 4 years while also have a strong [growth](https://ibb.co/G7BySxH) path, and despite all of this the stock [lost](https://ibb.co/Bnkk60T) more than 1,4% for the day.\n\nThe other earnings report that was released yesterday was from [Oracle](https://ibb.co/KsSGZNW), they also posted a great beat on the top and bottom line, but didn\u2019t offer any guidance as that kind of disappointed investors and dipped about 1% in after hours. I don\u2019t really have a great grasp of the company\u2019s growth potential is right now.\n\nWe also got the Disney Investors meeting, in which the company share a lot of new great things. First of all, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/kJRc01G) has gone up another 18% since just 4 weeks ago, and is up to more than 86M subscribers, with the total number for the company\u2019s streaming services surpassing 137M as they plan to expand Disney+ in Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets next year.\n\nThe company also [expects](https://ibb.co/4skfTC8) to have more than 230M subscribers by 2024, a very big increase from the prior estimate, while they are also planning on raising the monthly fee starting in March.\n\nThey plan to [release](https://ibb.co/F0G0C84) a lot of new content directly to Disney+, which is another big hit to the cinema world. With the Marvel and Star Wars series being big blockbusters for the movie industry.\n\nThey presented so much new [content](https://ibb.co/8jpZtWN) for the company, that it took them more than 2 hours to talk about all of this.\n\nBut they also [said](https://ibb.co/DWwJ1tg) that these decisions are temporary, and that they still prefer theatrical releases especially for blockbusters, so, there is still some hope for cinema\u2019s, but maybe not just right now, it will take years to recover from this, and they will probably have to largely reduce the number of screens so that they may become profitable again.\n\nSo, over 100 new content releases per year is a lot for the [company](https://ibb.co/fFD4vhs), this was a very good investors meeting that pleased investors, as the company is [trading](https://ibb.co/Y86n6HD) \\+7,5% in pre-market.\n\nDisney is my second biggest position in my portfolio and I am really happy with what the company presented today. I think this stock may get to 200$ easily when the parks and entertainment business goes back online, as that accounted for 1/3 of the revenues before this year.\n\nIn other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/NL6sXcT), NIO will offer 60M shares, with an additional 9M shares option for underwriters. The stock fell sharply after the news, dropping more than 6% in After-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/85PycWh).\n\nAlso, Qualcomm suffered after the close yesterday, as the shares fell more than 5% after [news](https://ibb.co/5h4syVT) popped that Apple is moving to a develop their first cellular modem which will replace the Qualcomm modem in iPhone. The shares dropped as Qualcomm gets about 11% of its revenue from Apple.\n\nSo, one last thing that I want to talk about is the recent IPOs from DoorDash and AirBnb.\n\nAirBNB also went public yesterday and [started](https://ibb.co/PCNjM3W) trading at $146, way above the $68 IPO price. This means the company has a [market cap](https://ibb.co/QNmGhqy) of over $100B, way higher than its rival Booking at $86B market cap and even [higher](https://ibb.co/cyp2hz1) than some of the biggest hotels in the world, Marriot &amp; Hilton. The [stock](https://ibb.co/C9P3McG) even hit a new high of $165, I believe this happened as brokers started to get hands on the shares and orders started to fill in, but the stock did go back down to finish at $144, that means the stock gained more than 112% just in one day. The stock is down again more than 2% in pre-market guys. \n\nI would avoid these stocks as much as I can as I believe they are well overhyped at the moment. I think we can see a pullback that may offer a better opportunity in AirBnb after the first earnings results. I would buy this company only if it drops to around 80$ as a price target, if not I maintain my sell opinion on the stock, though I personally, am not shorting any stock due to the risk of the high volatility associated with this companies as they have a very small share float.\n\nWhile my opinion on [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/qkqSz1t) is that we might not see a pullback or correction as soon as AirBnb as demand will probably continue to be strong for at least a couple of quarters, before the growth slows down as well as very though future comps. We might see a drop in price then, as I think this stock is also well overvalued. I also maintain my sell opinion on this stock and just like with AirBNB, I am not going to touch this stock, I think a reasonable PT for DoorDash as a sell is about 100$. But I would try to stay away as much as possible, I\u2019d rather go and find better growth opportunities in other companies, and not waste time and money on these 2 stocks. \n\nThank you everyone for reading!

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/SwcQnHs) finish higher for the day after it opened at over 23 to start us off.\n\nAlmost 60% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/qdWy3jk), but the volume was way below average for most of them, with the Energy sector being the only significant gainer, up 3% for the day while most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/5xskzgj) were flat or even lost ground for the day. On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/Z28KH04), only large-cap value companies from the industrial sector suffered big yesterday, as small cap growth companies outperformed.\n\nYou can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0jvPBX), that big caps, with the exception of Apple and Tesla did struggle yesterday, while most of the companies with big gains were from the oil &amp; gas industry, with Chevron gaining more than 3% for the day, while Exxon, Total and BP also had big gains.\n\nThe numbers that came in [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MPxZS56) on the economic front where mixed. As initial and continuing jobless claims came in [worse](https://ibb.co/NmgdXbJ) than expected, as more than 850K people filed for initial claims up more than 125K since the last week and what the analysts [expected](https://ibb.co/KrGcRk7), as this was the biggest spike in initial claims since march, while the continuing claims also rose for the first time since September. I am wondering, will [this](https://ibb.co/0X6FCH5) finally push the congress to act on a relief bill? I think the economy really needs it as a bridge to better times. Just look at the [EU](https://ibb.co/ncSgyWd), they have finally agreed on $2.2T budget and stimulus package to help the Eurozone get through the difficult times.\n\nBetter numbers came in from the consumer price [index](https://ibb.co/NjLW663), as the index rose by .2%, after it was unchanged in October, but this should be taken with a grain of salt, as most of consumer confidence increase comes from the high-income [consumers](https://ibb.co/DVJ5nK9), while people who have an income under $50K still struggling.\n\nAlso, the Federal [Budget](https://ibb.co/8BFdyZ7) came in better than expected as the deficit shrank more in November compared to October and compared to last year\u2019s month.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/pP78rTs) is a slow day in terms of economic data, but we do get a final read on the Producer price index and the consumer sentiment index.\n\nWe also finally got the [FDA](https://ibb.co/9gLsrh6) panel of outside experts meeting yesterday, which saw the panel vote 17 FOR, 4 against and one abstain. The only small concerns were on the topic of 16 and 17-year old\u2019s as some experts argued that there is insufficient data on that subgroup, but I don\u2019t think that is a case for concern, as the vaccine is likely going to take a while until young people will start to get the shot, as they are one of the least impacted groups. This is great news, as the FDA does usually follow up this committee advice, so we can see the FDA Emergency use authorization very very soon. Vaccine doses are already ready go within 24hours of the authorization so, things will start to move rather fast after that.\n\nSo, we got some earnings numbers yesterday from a lot of companies, let\u2019s talk about them a little.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/C040BWf) posted a beat on the top and bottom line with e-commerce sales rising by more than 80%, while [comparable](https://ibb.co/YQQknbj) sales in stores were more than 17%. With both EPS and revenue beating the estimates, I think this might be the time to get into COSTCO, as they are one of the best retailers in the world, they always trade at a premium, the [stock](https://ibb.co/QnQNJGJ) is just about 5% from the all-time high and is far from overbought territory. I really like them as they have also rewarded shareholders constantly both with great growth and dividends.\n\n[Broadcom](https://ibb.co/St74KMD) also posted a great beat on EPS and an 11% increase in revenues, fueled by a great beat in the semiconductor segment, while also posting a free cash flow of over $3B, way better than expected, as they also increased the quarterly dividend by 11% and have made a lot of [senior](https://ibb.co/hcMS6Vs) leadership changes yesterday, but the [stock](https://ibb.co/TB97nhZ) is down more than 2% in pre-market trading despite a lot of great numbers.\n\nThe company has most of its [revenues](https://ibb.co/bLbzgKL) coming from semiconductor solutions, this is very good as the [global](https://ibb.co/GfZGfnz) semiconductor sales have increased more than 5% in FY2020 and are expected to increase more than 8% for FY 2021, way better than the previous [outlook](https://ibb.co/MSrLh0p) of 6,2%.\n\nThe company also posted all time [highs](https://ibb.co/1vM8WP0) in net revenue, free cash flows, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, while the compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/zRW1jLZ) of the dividend since FY2016 is almost 50%. I think I might be investing even more in this company especially if they have a pullback.\n\nNext let\u2019s go to Lululemon who also [posted](https://ibb.co/qF1NnnN) a beat on EPS and Revenues, while comparable sales were up 19% with better gross and operating margins than expected. This was led by a huge [rise](https://ibb.co/zfKRJX5) in the international markets which will continue to expand as they gain more recognition overseas.\n\nA smaller company that [reported](https://ibb.co/2WMrybz) yesterday was Dave &amp; Buster\u2019s as the losses were smaller than expected as comparable store sales declined by 66% as the restrictions in the restaurant industry keeps hammering away. The stock was trading +4% in after hours as investors may have though of an even worse result.\n\nMoving on, [Adobe](https://ibb.co/Vjwwprm) also released earnings before the market opened yesterday, after a delayed earnings release. They posted a great beat on EPS and the revenues while also giving great guidance for next year, way above the consensus, with more than $15B in revenues and a EPS of over $11. The company also announced a new $15B share buyback [program](https://ibb.co/cKBbMpF) which will increase the value of the stock through the next 4 years while also have a strong [growth](https://ibb.co/G7BySxH) path, and despite all of this the stock [lost](https://ibb.co/Bnkk60T) more than 1,4% for the day.\n\nThe other earnings report that was released yesterday was from [Oracle](https://ibb.co/KsSGZNW), they also posted a great beat on the top and bottom line, but didn\u2019t offer any guidance as that kind of disappointed investors and dipped about 1% in after hours. I don\u2019t really have a great grasp of the company\u2019s growth potential is right now.\n\nWe also got the Disney Investors meeting, in which the company share a lot of new great things. First of all, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/kJRc01G) has gone up another 18% since just 4 weeks ago, and is up to more than 86M subscribers, with the total number for the company\u2019s streaming services surpassing 137M as they plan to expand Disney+ in Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets next year.\n\nThe company also [expects](https://ibb.co/4skfTC8) to have more than 230M subscribers by 2024, a very big increase from the prior estimate, while they are also planning on raising the monthly fee starting in March.\n\nThey plan to [release](https://ibb.co/F0G0C84) a lot of new content directly to Disney+, which is another big hit to the cinema world. With the Marvel and Star Wars series being big blockbusters for the movie industry.\n\nThey presented so much new [content](https://ibb.co/8jpZtWN) for the company, that it took them more than 2 hours to talk about all of this.\n\nBut they also [said](https://ibb.co/DWwJ1tg) that these decisions are temporary, and that they still prefer theatrical releases especially for blockbusters, so, there is still some hope for cinema\u2019s, but maybe not just right now, it will take years to recover from this, and they will probably have to largely reduce the number of screens so that they may become profitable again.\n\nSo, over 100 new content releases per year is a lot for the [company](https://ibb.co/fFD4vhs), this was a very good investors meeting that pleased investors, as the company is [trading](https://ibb.co/Y86n6HD) \\+7,5% in pre-market.\n\nDisney is my second biggest position in my portfolio and I am really happy with what the company presented today. I think this stock may get to 200$ easily when the parks and entertainment business goes back online, as that accounted for 1/3 of the revenues before this year.\n\nIn other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/NL6sXcT), NIO will offer 60M shares, with an additional 9M shares option for underwriters. The stock fell sharply after the news, dropping more than 6% in After-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/85PycWh).\n\nAlso, Qualcomm suffered after the close yesterday, as the shares fell more than 5% after [news](https://ibb.co/5h4syVT) popped that Apple is moving to a develop their first cellular modem which will replace the Qualcomm modem in iPhone. The shares dropped as Qualcomm gets about 11% of its revenue from Apple.\n\nSo, one last thing that I want to talk about is the recent IPOs from DoorDash and AirBnb.\n\nAirBNB also went public yesterday and [started](https://ibb.co/PCNjM3W) trading at $146, way above the $68 IPO price. This means the company has a [market cap](https://ibb.co/QNmGhqy) of over $100B, way higher than its rival Booking at $86B market cap and even [higher](https://ibb.co/cyp2hz1) than some of the biggest hotels in the world, Marriot &amp; Hilton. The [stock](https://ibb.co/C9P3McG) even hit a new high of $165, I believe this happened as brokers started to get hands on the shares and orders started to fill in, but the stock did go back down to finish at $144, that means the stock gained more than 112% just in one day. The stock is down again more than 2% in pre-market guys.\n\nI would avoid these stocks as much as I can as I believe they are well overhyped at the moment. I think we can see a pullback that may offer a better opportunity in AirBnb after the first earnings results. I would buy this company only if it drops to around 80$ as a price target, if not I maintain my sell opinion on the stock, though I personally, am not shorting any stock due to the risk of the high volatility associated with this companies as they have a very small share float.\n\nWhile my opinion on [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/qkqSz1t) is that we might not see a pullback or correction as soon as AirBnb as demand will probably continue to be strong for at least a couple of quarters, before the growth slows down as well as very though future comps. We might see a drop in price then, as I think this stock is also well overvalued. I also maintain my sell opinion on this stock and just like with AirBNB, I am not going to touch this stock, I think a reasonable PT for DoorDash as a sell is about 100$. But I would try to stay away as much as possible, I\u2019d rather go and find better growth opportunities in other companies, and not waste time and money on these 2 stocks.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "From what little background I was able to gather from a HBR case study of [C3.AI](https://C3.AI),\n\n1. Siebel has a very successful track record of Oracle and Siebel Systems. Both of them have been leader of relational database systems and CRM, respectively.\n2. The initial idea of C3 started of as a tool to track corporates carbon footprint, which made quite a few conglomorates interested initially. But with no government carbon tax, there was no incentive for anyone to get this tool.\n3. During that time, Siebel has a terrible foot injury, and when he eventually recovers, he sees shit flying around C3.\n4. He pivots the enterprise in the IoT sector, since he knows that utility companies are still interested in his ideas and he is known to look in the right direction at the time of crisis. He gets that reputation from the industry elites.\n5. Pivoting to IoT, gets him further access to funds which he uses to deploy more IoT devices to create smart grids. These devices are able to work together and predict failures andpain points successfullly.\n6. With this success, he announces the name change to [c3.ai](https://c3.ai) and goes on to get government/military contracts.\n\nWith all that said, talking about the product which [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) offers:\n\n1. Its not a single product. It is similar to App store of ML apps. They are providing an ecosystem to leverage machine learning in a number of different sectors.\n2. They have customers limited to one per sector, because those customers are actually PoC for this model. And it shows that it is working.\n\nI would be happy to be proven wrong in my understanding of why this firm isn't an absolute buy. I'm not someone who dabbles in stock market, but this company has piqued my interest. And the last time that happened, was with CrowdStrike Security, which I still avidly follow.",

On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/Z28KH04), only large-cap value companies from the industrial sector suffered big yesterday, as small cap growth companies outperformed.\n\nYou can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0jvPBX), that big caps, with the exception of Apple and Tesla did struggle yesterday, while most of the companies with big gains were from the oil &amp; gas industry, with Chevron gaining more than 3% for the day, while Exxon, Total and BP also had big gains.\n\nThe numbers that came in [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MPxZS56) on the economic front where mixed. As initial and continuing jobless claims came in [worse](https://ibb.co/NmgdXbJ) than expected, as more than 850K people filed for initial claims up more than 125K since the last week and what the analysts [expected](https://ibb.co/KrGcRk7), as this was the biggest spike in initial claims since march, while the continuing claims also rose for the first time since September. I am wondering, will [this](https://ibb.co/0X6FCH5) finally push the congress to act on a relief bill? I think the economy really needs it as a bridge to better times. Just look at the [EU](https://ibb.co/ncSgyWd), they have finally agreed on $2.2T budget and stimulus package to help the Eurozone get through the difficult times.\n\nBetter numbers came in from the consumer price [index](https://ibb.co/NjLW663), as the index rose by .2%, after it was unchanged in October, but this should be taken with a grain of salt, as most of consumer confidence increase comes from the high-income [consumers](https://ibb.co/DVJ5nK9), while people who have an income under $50K still struggling.\n\nAlso, the Federal [Budget](https://ibb.co/8BFdyZ7) came in better than expected as the deficit shrank more in November compared to October and compared to last year\u2019s month.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/pP78rTs) is a slow day in terms of economic data, but we do get a final read on the Producer price index and the consumer sentiment index.\n\nWe also finally got the [FDA](https://ibb.co/9gLsrh6) panel of outside experts meeting yesterday, which saw the panel vote 17 FOR, 4 against and one abstain. The only small concerns were on the topic of 16 and 17-year old\u2019s as some experts argued that there is insufficient data on that subgroup, but I don\u2019t think that is a case for concern, as the vaccine is likely going to take a while until young people will start to get the shot, as they are one of the least impacted groups. This is great news, as the FDA does usually follow up this committee advice, so we can see the FDA Emergency use authorization very very soon. Vaccine doses are already ready go within 24hours of the authorization so, things will start to move rather fast after that.\n\nSo, we got some earnings numbers yesterday from a lot of companies, let\u2019s talk about them a little.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/C040BWf) posted a beat on the top and bottom line with e-commerce sales rising by more than 80%, while [comparable](https://ibb.co/YQQknbj) sales in stores were more than 17%. With both EPS and revenue beating the estimates, I think this might be the time to get into COSTCO, as they are one of the best retailers in the world, they always trade at a premium, the [stock](https://ibb.co/QnQNJGJ) is just about 5% from the all-time high and is far from overbought territory. I really like them as they have also rewarded shareholders constantly both with great growth and dividends.\n\n[Broadcom](https://ibb.co/St74KMD) also posted a great beat on EPS and an 11% increase in revenues, fueled by a great beat in the semiconductor segment, while also posting a free cash flow of over $3B, way better than expected, as they also increased the quarterly dividend by 11% and have made a lot of [senior](https://ibb.co/hcMS6Vs) leadership changes yesterday, but the [stock](https://ibb.co/TB97nhZ) is down more than 2% in pre-market trading despite a lot of great numbers.\n\nThe company has most of its [revenues](https://ibb.co/bLbzgKL) coming from semiconductor solutions, this is very good as the [global](https://ibb.co/GfZGfnz) semiconductor sales have increased more than 5% in FY2020 and are expected to increase more than 8% for FY 2021, way better than the previous [outlook](https://ibb.co/MSrLh0p) of 6,2%.\n\nThe company also posted all time [highs](https://ibb.co/1vM8WP0) in net revenue, free cash flows, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, while the compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/zRW1jLZ) of the dividend since FY2016 is almost 50%. I think I might be investing even more in this company especially if they have a pullback.\n\nNext let\u2019s go to Lululemon who also [posted](https://ibb.co/qF1NnnN) a beat on EPS and Revenues, while comparable sales were up 19% with better gross and operating margins than expected. This was led by a huge [rise](https://ibb.co/zfKRJX5) in the international markets which will continue to expand as they gain more recognition overseas.\n\nA smaller company that [reported](https://ibb.co/2WMrybz) yesterday was Dave &amp; Buster\u2019s as the losses were smaller than expected as comparable store sales declined by 66% as the restrictions in the restaurant industry keeps hammering away. The stock was trading +4% in after hours as investors may have though of an even worse result.\n\nMoving on, [Adobe](https://ibb.co/Vjwwprm) also released earnings before the market opened yesterday, after a delayed earnings release. They posted a great beat on EPS and the revenues while also giving great guidance for next year, way above the consensus, with more than $15B in revenues and a EPS of over $11. The company also announced a new $15B share buyback [program](https://ibb.co/cKBbMpF) which will increase the value of the stock through the next 4 years while also have a strong [growth](https://ibb.co/G7BySxH) path, and despite all of this the stock [lost](https://ibb.co/Bnkk60T) more than 1,4% for the day.\n\nThe other earnings report that was released yesterday was from [Oracle](https://ibb.co/KsSGZNW), they also posted a great beat on the top and bottom line, but didn\u2019t offer any guidance as that kind of disappointed investors and dipped about 1% in after hours. I don\u2019t really have a great grasp of the company\u2019s growth potential is right now.\n\nWe also got the Disney Investors meeting, in which the company share a lot of new great things. First of all, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/kJRc01G) has gone up another 18% since just 4 weeks ago, and is up to more than 86M subscribers, with the total number for the company\u2019s streaming services surpassing 137M as they plan to expand Disney+ in Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets next year.\n\nThe company also [expects](https://ibb.co/4skfTC8) to have more than 230M subscribers by 2024, a very big increase from the prior estimate, while they are also planning on raising the monthly fee starting in March.\n\nThey plan to [release](https://ibb.co/F0G0C84) a lot of new content directly to Disney+, which is another big hit to the cinema world. With the Marvel and Star Wars series being big blockbusters for the movie industry.\n\nThey presented so much new [content](https://ibb.co/8jpZtWN) for the company, that it took them more than 2 hours to talk about all of this.\n\nBut they also [said](https://ibb.co/DWwJ1tg) that these decisions are temporary, and that they still prefer theatrical releases especially for blockbusters, so, there is still some hope for cinema\u2019s, but maybe not just right now, it will take years to recover from this, and they will probably have to largely reduce the number of screens so that they may become profitable again.\n\nSo, over 100 new content releases per year is a lot for the [company](https://ibb.co/fFD4vhs), this was a very good investors meeting that pleased investors, as the company is [trading](https://ibb.co/Y86n6HD) \\+7,5% in pre-market.\n\nDisney is my second biggest position in my portfolio and I am really happy with what the company presented today. I think this stock may get to 200$ easily when the parks and entertainment business goes back online, as that accounted for 1/3 of the revenues before this year.\n\nIn other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/NL6sXcT), NIO will offer 60M shares, with an additional 9M shares option for underwriters. The stock fell sharply after the news, dropping more than 6% in After-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/85PycWh).\n\nAlso, Qualcomm suffered after the close yesterday, as the shares fell more than 5% after [news](https://ibb.co/5h4syVT) popped that Apple is moving to a develop their first cellular modem which will replace the Qualcomm modem in iPhone. The shares dropped as Qualcomm gets about 11% of its revenue from Apple.\n\nSo, one last thing that I want to talk about is the recent IPOs from DoorDash and AirBnb.\n\nAirBNB also went public yesterday and [started](https://ibb.co/PCNjM3W) trading at $146, way above the $68 IPO price. This means the company has a [market cap](https://ibb.co/QNmGhqy) of over $100B, way higher than its rival Booking at $86B market cap and even [higher](https://ibb.co/cyp2hz1) than some of the biggest hotels in the world, Marriot &amp; Hilton. The [stock](https://ibb.co/C9P3McG) even hit a new high of $165, I believe this happened as brokers started to get hands on the shares and orders started to fill in, but the stock did go back down to finish at $144, that means the stock gained more than 112% just in one day. The stock is down again more than 2% in pre-market guys. \n\nI would avoid these stocks as much as I can as I believe they are well overhyped at the moment. I think we can see a pullback that may offer a better opportunity in AirBnb after the first earnings results. I would buy this company only if it drops to around 80$ as a price target, if not I maintain my sell opinion on the stock, though I personally, am not shorting any stock due to the risk of the high volatility associated with this companies as they have a very small share float.\n\nWhile my opinion on [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/qkqSz1t) is that we might not see a pullback or correction as soon as AirBnb as demand will probably continue to be strong for at least a couple of quarters, before the growth slows down as well as very though future comps. We might see a drop in price then, as I think this stock is also well overvalued. I also maintain my sell opinion on this stock and just like with AirBNB, I am not going to touch this stock, I think a reasonable PT for DoorDash as a sell is about 100$. But I would try to stay away as much as possible, I\u2019d rather go and find better growth opportunities in other companies, and not waste time and money on these 2 stocks. \n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 7th, 2020.\n\n# **Any progress on stimulus could give the market a boost in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/stimulus-hope-markets-focus-next-week.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stimulus to help the economy and vaccines to stop the virus are expected to the be the main focus in markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Efforts to move along a fiscal package in Congress picked up momentum in the past week with Congressional leaders sounding conciliatory, and a bi-partisan group of senators pushing their own $900 billion proposal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt probably boils down to how much [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is willing to deal, and I don\u2019t know what the answer is to that,\u201d said Mike Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to happen, next week is the week. The government runs out of money on Friday. Congress has to come up with a funding scheme.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists have said the two events could be tied, but Congress could also push through a spending resolution without including stimulus. Some programs will expire at the end of the month, if Congress does not provide funding, including unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.\n*****\n&gt; The on again, off again stimulus talks have led to skepticism in the market, and sets it up for a move higher if there is anything officially announced. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s fully baked in. I would say the stimulus is a positive catalyst, unless it\u2019s less than $900 billion,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.\n*****\n&gt; While stocks surged in the past week, bond yields also moved higher. Yields move opposite price, and bond yields have been rising on stimulus expectations. More spending means more debt, and that sends rates higher.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year was at 0.97% Friday, and appeared ready to move back to the 1% level for the first time since March.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIs it the case here, stimulus is already factored in, and will people take their money and run?\u201d said Schumacher.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.7% in the past week, ending Friday at 3,699, a record high. The Dow also ended up 1% at a record 30,218, and Nasdaq gained 2.1% to a record 12,464.\n*****\n&gt; # Getting jabbed\n&gt; Vaccine news has been a catalyst for the market\u2019s surge since early November, when Pfizer first revealed the high efficacy of its vaccine. Since then Moderna and Astra-Zeneca both revealed results of their own vaccines.\n*****\n&gt; A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meets Thursday on emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey\u2019re starting to roll it out in the U.K, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be watched here to see how it unfolds,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist Prudential Financial. \u201cThat\u2019s the next issue for the market. The deliveries, the distributions. Are people being jabbed? These are all questions the market is concerned about about because they\u2019re looking forward to it unrolling smoothly in the U.S.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 3 million people will be vaccinated in the initial rollout. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is expected to be approved the following week, and by year-end both vaccines are expected to reach 20 million people in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe vaccine news has started to see a bit of diminishing return in terms of its wow factor,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some volatility around the logistics.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the virus remains in the forefront for the market because of the continuing spread and its economic impact as activities are shut down. California Thursday announced new restrictions with stay at home advisories in some regions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe big question is how long does the Covid surge last?\u201d Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; The virus shutdowns appear to be behind a slowdown in the labor market, and economists say it could slow activity into the first quarter. November job growth of 245,000 was about 200,000 less than expected. That makes Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims more important for markets.\n*****\n&gt; There is also CPI and PPI inflation data Thursday and Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is this push pull in the market regarding inflationary pressures,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cIt\u2019s not expected, which is why if it does print higher, it could ignite the conversation regarding inflation.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PZEBIS8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ypJI3Vy.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/s01kzjN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/7Y1RKiX.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nF9LHWm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/F99YkSI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/00G6LqZ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8OK0Nmw.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tgMnGUY.png))**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PDrxDY8.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5rCf9oe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VsZzlKU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/moiEQsJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Bonds Both in Rally Mode\n\n&gt; When it comes to equity market performance in a given month, it doesn't get much better than November. While the S&amp;P 500's total return of 10.95% in the month was only the second-best monthly performance of the year, it was still enough to rank as the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500 in the last thirty years and just the ninth month since 1980 that it was up 10%+.\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500's annualized total return over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares the current returns to the historical average. For the last year, the S&amp;P 500's total return has been 17.5% which is nearly six full percentage points higher than the historical average. For the last two years, the annualized return has been nearly as strong at 16.8%, and it is actually even stronger relative to the historical average of 10.5%. Moving further out the time horizon, the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns drift lower, and while the five and ten-year annualized returns are greater than average, the S&amp;P 500's annualized gain of 7.3% in the last 20 years is more than 3.5 percentage points below the historical average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-SP-500-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; The last couple of years haven't just been strong for equities. Over the last year, long-term US Treasuries, as measured by the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index, have rallied 15.7%, which is more than six full percentage points greater than the historical average of 9.5%. Over the last two years, returns have been even stronger with an annualized gain of nearly 20%, or more than double the historical average of 9.1%! While the last two years have been strong for US Treasuries, the last five, ten, and twenty years have all seen returns of between one and two percentage points below their historical average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120LT-Treas-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Lately, when you see rallies in the equity market, it tends to be accompanied by a decline in treasuries as yields rise. In November, though, that wasn't the case. Even with the S&amp;P 500 up 10.95%, long-term US Treasuries rallied just over 1%. So how uncommon is it for stocks to rally like they did in November while bonds also rally. Actually, it is not very uncommon at all. The table below shows the nine months since 1980 where the S&amp;P 500's total return in a given month was 10% or more, and of those months, long-term treasuies also rallied in every month but one (October 2011).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-Stocks-Up-10.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Manufacturer Recovery Continues\n\n&gt; This morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a less positive outlook for the US manufacturing sector. The headline number for ISM's Manufacturing index fell from 59.3 last month down to 57.5. A drop was expected, but the actual results were worse than the drop to 58.0 that had been forecasted. That reading indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow in November but at a slower rate than October.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Similar to the various Federal Reserve bank surveys from around the country, breadth in the November report was more negative than in recent months. Of the ten indices excluding the headline number, only three were higher in November: Backlog Orders, Supplier Deliveries, and Export Orders. Additionally, two indices\u2014Customer Inventories and Employment\u2014showed contractionary readings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Table1.png))**\n\n&gt; One theme of the report was that orders remain very healthy. New Orders fell from 67.9 to 65.1, but that is a sixth consecutive month of expansionary readings. Although the index was lower this month, meaning new order growth decelerated, it remains in the top decile of historical readings. As new orders have continued to grow, so too have backlogs. The index for Backlog Orders has continued to press higher, rising to 56.9 from 55.7. That is in the 88th percentile of all months and is now at the highest level since August of 2018. Demand continues to improve with new orders coming in at a historically strong pace, even though it is slower than last month, and order backlogs have once again risen as a result.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Orders.png))**\n\n&gt; As new order growth decelerated, so too did production. The index fell from 63.0 in October to 60.8 last month. That is still consistent with growth (readings above 50) in production but at the slowest rate since June. One factor that potentially had an impact on the slowdown in production is issues with suppliers. The index for Supplier Deliveries rose for the fourth month in a row in November and reached the highest level since May. Higher readings in the Supplier Deliveries index indicates longer lead times and vice versa. In other words, products from suppliers have been taking longer to reach manufacturers, in turn, impacting productivity.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Prod-Supp.png))**\n\n&gt; Although suppliers appear to have some constraints and production has slowed slightly, business inventories rose for the second month in a row even as more and more firms report that customer inventories are too low. The index for Customer Inventories now sits in the bottom 2% of historical readings after dropping another 0.4 points in November. At 36.3, the index is at the lowest level since June of 2010. That low reading can be considered positive for future production.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Inventorie.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Gains In November Steal From Santa\n\n&gt; What a month November was! Here are some of the highlights:\n\n&gt; * Best month for Dow since January 1987 (11.9%) and best November since 1928\n&gt; * Best month ever for the STOXX 600 (16.7%)\n&gt; * Best month ever for the Russell 2000 (18.3%)\n&gt; * Best month for the S&amp;P 500 (10.8%) and Nasdaq (11.8%) since April 2020\n&gt; * Best month for Dow Transports since October 2011 (12.1%)\n&gt; * Best month from PHLX Semiconductor Index since March 2003 (18.4%)\n&gt; * Best month for Industrials (16.0%) and Financials (16.8%) since April 2009\n&gt; * Second best month ever for energy (28.0%)\n\n&gt; A way better than expected earnings season, a likely split Congress, and major breakthroughs on the vaccine front all helped stocks soar last month,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAdd ongoing support from the Federal Reserve as the cherry on top and we are looking at a truly historic month on many levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s all the Dow monthly returns since 1900. Last month was the best return since January 1987. Now before you go out and sell because you see 1987, remember the S&amp;P 500 added another 20% the seven months after the huge gains in early 1987.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It was the best November for the S&amp;P 500 since November 1928.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Small caps soared on the likelihood of taxes staying lower due to a divided Congress and vaccine progress, with the Russell 2000 adding more than 18% for the best month ever, topping the previous record from February 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What happens after a big month? Well, history says a 10% monthly gain is quite bullish. In fact, we had a 10% plus rally back in April 2020 and shared this same chart at that time. Sure enough, returns have been strong this time around as well. \u201cThe bottom line is the huge gains in November could actually be the start of something much stronger,\u201d according to Ryan Detrick. \u201cAlso, this was the second month of 2020 with a 10% gain. The only other year to do that? 1982, which kicked off a historic bull market.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Turning to December, this month is widely known to be quite bullish, as Santa comes to town, people feel good, and stocks tend to do well. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year, with only November better. December had been the best month of the year until the historic 9.2% drop in 2018. As a result, December hasn\u2019t been quite as strong over the past 10 and 20 years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking it down even more, a big rally in November can potentially steal some of December\u2019s thunder. As after a 5% or 10% rally in November, the returns in December are more muted. The flipside to this though is if the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 10% for the year (like 2020), then stocks have benefited from some performance chasing and have tended to do better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What does it all mean? After the historic move in November we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see below average returns in December. We do believe this is a new bull market and lasting economic cycle of growth, but overall sentiment is getting quite stretched and this increases the potential for some near-term weakness.

It is also a key player in the data space going forward with lots of growth potential, esp bc of miss rona. \n\nWhat do you think of Oracle as a company for a wheel? It is trading under a hundred bucks so it is more accessible for me rn as opposed to a msft or crm.\n\nThanks in advance, always appreciate your perspective as usual.",

Third quarter diluted earnings per share benefited by an unrealized gain of $1.1 billion associated with the initial public offering of one of our strategic investments.\u201d\n\n## Revenue from Product: \n\n*Bearish Statements*\n\n\u201cFor the nine months ended October 31, 2020, the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of $276 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $37 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $220 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, and an increase of amortization of purchased intangible assets of $214 million.\u201d\n\n*Bullish Statements*\n\n\u201cAs a result of the financial impacts of COVID-19 we experienced during the nine months ended October 31, 2020 and our current assumptions related to the extent to which the pandemic will affect our business going forward, we expect modest growth in our new incremental business and renewals, total revenues, remaining performance obligation and operating cash flows for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\u201d\n\n\u201cRevenue: Total third quarter revenue was $5.4 billion, an increase of 20 percent year-over-year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services, our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international resources.\u201d\n\n\u201cRevenues in the Americas and Europe also benefited from our acquisition of Tableau in August 2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOur marketing and sales headcount increased by 13 percent since October 31, 2019, primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn August 2020, Salesforce was recognized by the Climate Group and RE100 as Best Policy Influencer for our efforts in calling for a federal price on carbon, supporting new emissions standards in the state of Virginia, and signing the largest ever UN-backed CEO-led climate advocacy effort to urge governments to incorporate climate action in their economic recovery plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also plan to continue to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As part of our business and growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics and integration. We drive innovation organically and, to a lesser extent, through acquisitions, such as our recent acquisition of Vlocity in June 2020 and our pending acquisition of Slack Technologies, Inc. (\u201cSlack\u201d), which was signed in December 2020 and is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.\u201d\n\n\u201cPricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for the period.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarketing and sales expenses make up the majority of our operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses and commissions, for our sales and marketing staff, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead.\u201d\n\n## Cashflow\n\n*Bearish Statements*\n\n\u201cOur operating cash flows were negatively impacted by investments made in our go-to-market efforts, such as the partial minimum commission guarantee provided in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fiscal 2021, changes in billing frequency for new business and investments in our go-to-market efforts resulted in a negative impact to our operating cash flows during the quarter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant global economic uncertainty, adversely impacted the business of our customers and partners, impacted our business and results of operations and could further impact our results of operations and our cash flows in the future.\u201d\n\n## Debt\n\n*Bullish Statements*\n\n\u201cWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements, which is not reflected on the balance sheet, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions.\u201d\n\n## Slack Acquisition News (various reputable tech and news sites).\n\nSlack CEO Stewart Butterfield: \u201cAs software plays a more and more critical role in the performance of every organization, we share a vision of reduced complexity, increased power and flexibility, and ultimately a greater degree of alignment and organizational agility. Personally, I believe this is the most strategic combination in the history of software, and I can\u2019t wait to get going.\u201d\n\n\u201c The company had lost nearly half of its market value since going public in April 2019, and it failed to turn a profit during its last three quarters despite the surge in remote work due to COVID-19\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company did not have an obvious path to becoming profitable and no clear way to overcome increasing pressure from Microsoft Teams, making a potential acquisition more likely with each passing quarter.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the Salesforce perspective, Taylor says that the Slack deal was worth the money because it really allows his company to bring together all the pieces of their platform, one that has expanded over the years from pure CRM to include marketing, customer service, data visualization, workflow and more.\u201d\n\n\u201c...by putting Slack in the middle of business processes, you can begin to eliminate friction that occurs in complex enterprise software like Salesforce. Instead of moving stuff through email, clicking a link, opening a browser, signing in and then finally accessing the tool you want, the approval could be built into a single Slack message.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cWhen you think about automation, it\u2019s event driven, these long-running processes, automations. If you look at what people are doing with the Slack platform, it\u2019s essentially incorporating workflows and bots and all these things. The combination of the Salesforce platform where I think we have the best automation intelligence capabilities with the Slack platform is incredible,\u201d Taylor said.\u201d\n\n# Slack vs Microsoft Teams\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y9fzliygll861.png?width=1360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b1de3f00419e3592ffc6e62de63ab3de0ffcb60\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n1 Year Leap: PT 270\n\n*Processing img 2c3w2rxkll861...*\n\nMidterm: PT 240\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4njycvboll861.png?width=1564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6edb61dd7493cff2198e407b2ead8bc7e62f12a0\n\n**Will play an OHP at least 2-3 weeks before earnings on 3/3/21**\n\n## Option Flow Data\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8snsirkqll861.png?width=1564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f314f639c3f8ac6fd4d54dc448a0f2c0b71fae1\n\n# Major Dark Pool Prints\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d5mbbzbull861.png?width=1298&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=651dfd5f478f7143c05f7c59bd4884fa616ffcce\n\n## Recent CRM News\n\n### 12/16\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Salesforce, (NYSE:CRM), the global leader in CRM, today announced that more than 15 international, federal, state and local agencies, including the State of New Hampshire and the City of Chicago, are using the Salesforce Platform and Work.com for Vaccines to help schedule vaccination appointments and manage their COVID-19 vaccine programs including vaccine inventory management and administration, notifications, outcome monitoring, and more.\n\nB of A Securities Reinstates Buy on Salesforce.com, Announces $275 Price Target\n\n### 12/15\n\nSalesforce Reports Will Help Gavi Manage Critical Info To Equitably Distribute \\~2B COVID-19 Vaccines To 190 Countries By End Of 2021 - Reuters\n\n### 12/9\n\nSlack Technologies Inc (NYSE:WORK) has inked a definitive agreement to be acquired by customer relationship management behemoth Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nThe transaction is likely to receive the required stockholder and regulatory approvals, and another offer is unlikely to emerge, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe Slack Technologies Analyst: Keith Weiss upgraded Slack Technologies from Underweight to Equal Weight and raised the price target from $27 to $44.\n\nThe Slack Technologies Thesis: The cash-and-stock deal implies the company\u2019s shares are worth $44.47 each, representing an equity value of more than $27 billion and enterprise value of around $26 billion, Weiss said in the upgrade note.\n\nManagement expects the deal to close in the quarter ending July 31, 2021.\n\n\u201cGiven the premium on a growth adjusted basis, we see this as a full valuation for Slack, and therefore don't expect anyone to go over the top, especially considering the limited potential buyers given a deal this large,\u201d the analyst said. \n\nEarlier this month, Slack Technologies released strong quarterly results, with revenues, billings and margins ahead of the consensus estimates, he said.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nDayMan",

Third quarter diluted earnings per share benefited by an unrealized gain of $1.1 billion associated with the initial public offering of one of our strategic investments.\u201d\n\n## Revenue from Product: \n\n*Bearish Statements*\n\n\u201cFor the nine months ended October 31, 2020, the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of $276 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $37 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $220 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, and an increase of amortization of purchased intangible assets of $214 million.\u201d\n\n*Bullish Statements*\n\n\u201cAs a result of the financial impacts of COVID-19 we experienced during the nine months ended October 31, 2020 and our current assumptions related to the extent to which the pandemic will affect our business going forward, we expect modest growth in our new incremental business and renewals, total revenues, remaining performance obligation and operating cash flows for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\u201d\n\n\u201cRevenue: Total third quarter revenue was $5.4 billion, an increase of 20 percent year-over-year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services, our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international resources.\u201d\n\n\u201cRevenues in the Americas and Europe also benefited from our acquisition of Tableau in August 2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOur marketing and sales headcount increased by 13 percent since October 31, 2019, primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn August 2020, Salesforce was recognized by the Climate Group and RE100 as Best Policy Influencer for our efforts in calling for a federal price on carbon, supporting new emissions standards in the state of Virginia, and signing the largest ever UN-backed CEO-led climate advocacy effort to urge governments to incorporate climate action in their economic recovery plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also plan to continue to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As part of our business and growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics and integration. We drive innovation organically and, to a lesser extent, through acquisitions, such as our recent acquisition of Vlocity in June 2020 and our pending acquisition of Slack Technologies, Inc. (\u201cSlack\u201d), which was signed in December 2020 and is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.\u201d\n\n\u201cPricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for the period.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarketing and sales expenses make up the majority of our operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses and commissions, for our sales and marketing staff, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead.\u201d\n\n## Cashflow\n\n*Bearish Statements*\n\n\u201cOur operating cash flows were negatively impacted by investments made in our go-to-market efforts, such as the partial minimum commission guarantee provided in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fiscal 2021, changes in billing frequency for new business and investments in our go-to-market efforts resulted in a negative impact to our operating cash flows during the quarter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant global economic uncertainty, adversely impacted the business of our customers and partners, impacted our business and results of operations and could further impact our results of operations and our cash flows in the future.\u201d\n\n## Debt\n\n*Bullish Statements*\n\n\u201cWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements, which is not reflected on the balance sheet, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions.\u201d\n\n## Slack Acquisition News (various reputable tech and news sites).\n\nSlack CEO Stewart Butterfield: \u201cAs software plays a more and more critical role in the performance of every organization, we share a vision of reduced complexity, increased power and flexibility, and ultimately a greater degree of alignment and organizational agility. Personally, I believe this is the most strategic combination in the history of software, and I can\u2019t wait to get going.\u201d\n\n\u201c The company had lost nearly half of its market value since going public in April 2019, and it failed to turn a profit during its last three quarters despite the surge in remote work due to COVID-19\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company did not have an obvious path to becoming profitable and no clear way to overcome increasing pressure from Microsoft Teams, making a potential acquisition more likely with each passing quarter.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the Salesforce perspective, Taylor says that the Slack deal was worth the money because it really allows his company to bring together all the pieces of their platform, one that has expanded over the years from pure CRM to include marketing, customer service, data visualization, workflow and more.\u201d\n\n\u201c...by putting Slack in the middle of business processes, you can begin to eliminate friction that occurs in complex enterprise software like Salesforce. Instead of moving stuff through email, clicking a link, opening a browser, signing in and then finally accessing the tool you want, the approval could be built into a single Slack message.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cWhen you think about automation, it\u2019s event driven, these long-running processes, automations. If you look at what people are doing with the Slack platform, it\u2019s essentially incorporating workflows and bots and all these things. The combination of the Salesforce platform where I think we have the best automation intelligence capabilities with the Slack platform is incredible,\u201d Taylor said.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7nefm274sl861.png?width=1360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43437f370d63682af94a61316165c77aee53ac47\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\n1 Year Leap: PT 270\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c159rmu6sl861.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7a229bfe03809d370a4025fee422fd83526e58f\n\nMidterm: PT 240\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbatq1ucsl861.png?width=1564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47ac61c9d21df921db7a67ef5ad7924eaa1e6218\n\n**Will play an OHP at least 2-3 weeks before earnings on 3/3/21**\n\n## Option Flow Data\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ijclovfsl861.png?width=1564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cda5f43087eb20db664730a8b25ecd0b3557a814\n\n# Major Dark Pool Prints\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5x5jknaksl861.png?width=1298&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3114b39a6bb478c6b8f5c5e3f196fa2e936109e\n\n## Recent CRM News\n\n### 12/16\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Salesforce, (NYSE:CRM), the global leader in CRM, today announced that more than 15 international, federal, state and local agencies, including the State of New Hampshire and the City of Chicago, are using the Salesforce Platform and Work.com for Vaccines to help schedule vaccination appointments and manage their COVID-19 vaccine programs including vaccine inventory management and administration, notifications, outcome monitoring, and more.\n\nB of A Securities Reinstates Buy on Salesforce.com, Announces $275 Price Target\n\n### 12/15\n\nSalesforce Reports Will Help Gavi Manage Critical Info To Equitably Distribute \\~2B COVID-19 Vaccines To 190 Countries By End Of 2021 - Reuters\n\n### 12/9\n\nSlack Technologies Inc (NYSE:WORK) has inked a definitive agreement to be acquired by customer relationship management behemoth Salesforce, Inc.

        "selftext": "**DoorDash just went public in a crazy overvalued IPO, AirBNB will follow today. Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco &amp; more. Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.\n\nWe saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.\n\nWe saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.\n\nToday we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.\n\nAlongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.\n\nOne good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week. \n\nInvestors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still\u2026 there is to much of a concentration in the bull\u2019s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.\n\nPositive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they\u2019re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.\n\nWhile on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.\n\nSo, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino\u2019s and many others from the food industry.\n\nAnd by the way, don\u2019t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.\n\nOne of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.\n\nWith the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can\u2019t get enough of this stock\u2019s, I don\u2019t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.\n\nToday we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don\u2019t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.\n\nSome other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don\u2019t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.\n\nWhile [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.\n\nAlso, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.\n\nI expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it\u2019s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.\n\nLikewise, [Dave &amp; Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren\u2019t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.\n\nWhile [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium. \n\nAdobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?\n\nSo, guys, don\u2019t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0). \n\nInvestors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.\n\nJust be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP &amp; UP.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "**DoorDash just went public in a crazy overvalued IPO, AirBNB will follow today. Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco &amp; more. Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.\n\nWe saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.\n\nWe saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.\n\nToday we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.\n\nAlongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.\n\nOne good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week. \n\nInvestors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still\u2026 there is to much of a concentration in the bull\u2019s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.\n\nPositive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they\u2019re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.\n\nWhile on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.\n\nSo, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino\u2019s and many others from the food industry.\n\nAnd by the way, don\u2019t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.\n\nOne of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.\n\nWith the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can\u2019t get enough of this stock\u2019s, I don\u2019t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.\n\nToday we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don\u2019t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.\n\nSome other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don\u2019t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.\n\nWhile [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.\n\nAlso, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.\n\nI expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it\u2019s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.\n\nLikewise, [Dave &amp; Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren\u2019t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.\n\nWhile [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium. \n\nAdobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?\n\nSo, guys, don\u2019t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0). \n\nInvestors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.\n\nJust be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP &amp; UP.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content!

With the rest of the sectors in the green, Energy, Health Care, Technology and Communication being the biggest gainers finishing the week up over 2%.\n\n[Utilities](https://ibb.co/Bz8TnvP) have been hit hard in the last year as residential consumers and small businesses have been able to defer paying power bills, this will continue to hold down the sector for now with the debt still increasing.\n\nThe VIX also dropped more than 2% on [Friday](https://ibb.co/18qjBx7) and finished the [week](https://ibb.co/7KyfPxQ) over 5% down as the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/sKhhfx6) from Friday shows us that there were plenty of gains to be made especially in the Energy Sectors as well as Financials, with the big companies from the Tech and Communication sectors doing worse than the rest of the market.\n\nFor the week though this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/92hRtQL) shows that Apple was one of the biggest gainers alongside Semiconductors and Energy Names while Health Care companies like JNJ and Pfizer also did very good.\n\nThe big indexes all finished higher for the [week](https://ibb.co/b3Gb4HN) with the SP500 up 1,7%, the Nasdaq Composite up 2,1% and the Dow up 1% with renewed hopes for a stimulus package being back on the table.\n\nHere are the most interesting economic [reports](https://ibb.co/j84CkLT) for next week, it will be a light week in terms of economic data but still, the market may be volatile and trends may change depending on some of the results.\n\nSo, on Friday [November JOBS](https://ibb.co/r0JPtCs) came in much lower than anticipated, coming in at 245K vs de 610K in October and 469K estimated while the unemployment [rate](https://ibb.co/M9mNBMT) dropped to 6,7% a bit better than expected and down from 6,9% in the past month. Still there are over 10million people unemployed, this number more than doubling since the start on February. The [net addition](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) of jobs in November was the [smallest](https://ibb.co/dWKmZWH) since May as government jobs were the [worst performing](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) while transportation and warehousing jobs continue to increase, as big companies \u2026 aka Amazon has hired almost 3thousand people per day this year. But the bad news is that [long-term](https://ibb.co/HFZFhyC) unemployment is approaching the peaks from the Great Recession and that is not good news for the economy or the stock market as over 3,9 million people have been out of work for at least 6 months. \n\nSo, this is pretty bad news as mortgages in [forbearance](https://ibb.co/NLcDmYP) just slightly declined this week, by just 39K with more and more plans planned to expire in December, over 1M more exactly, more than 40% of active cases.\n\nThis may finally put some extra pressure on the Congress to agree to a relief package maybe even passing it alongside the government [funding bill](https://ibb.co/1qkTnsD) that is still debated and has over 300 issues that the parties don\u2019t agree on. \n\nThis is becoming more and more obvious as [cases](https://ibb.co/6y9FTjV) in the US continue to rise, coming in over 200k in the last 2 days and the economy will soon feel the pressure from this, I expect the next month or two of economic data to not be so good, this may be the time the market sees a 5-10% correction before moving on higher on more positive things like the availability of the vaccine, the passing of the torch In the Presidency and a possible relief package.\n\nYes, this will continue to add to the [US DEBT](https://ibb.co/QjSPcdB), but even though I don\u2019t have any partisan views, a good structured relief bill would do wonders for the economy as a bridge to when the vaccine will finally be widely available.\n\nYes, I know that the global debt is set to reach $200 trillion but the DEBT-to-GDP [ratio](https://ibb.co/LhWkxKJ) is projected to slowly go back down in the next couple of years.\n\nOther numbers that came in on Friday were [Factory ORDERS](https://ibb.co/xm7JJ2Q) which came in better than expected at +1%. While a new Redfin report indicates an increase in [average home prices](https://ibb.co/pXYNGcz) year over year of 16% with the number of pending home [sales up](https://ibb.co/2nw00m3) almost 30% over last year while new listings of home sales is [up just 9%](https://ibb.co/v3nyLPZ) since 2019 and dropping rather fast in the last months with sales of homes going for all time-high [prices](https://ibb.co/gmvRPd7) at 99,5% of the asking price as the real estate market keeps booming along.\n\nThe other number that came in on Friday and was not so good was the [trade deficit](https://ibb.co/42nsy2W), which widened even more in the last month by almost $2B.\n\nSo next week is again pretty slow in [earnings reports](https://ibb.co/Xkr4f4P) with the most interesting ones on being Chewy, GameStop, Adobe, LuluLemon, Dave&amp;Busters, Costco, Oracle and Broadcom.\n\nI own a small stake in all of them except Oracle and GameStop. I don\u2019t see such a big growth opportunity with Oracle while GameStop I believe will struggle to turn around the business with very though e-commerce competition.\n\nWe will also have a number of new [IPOs](https://ibb.co/0jQWwTf) this week from DoorDash, AirBNB, C3.ai, Hydrofarm and Pubmatic. The first 3 are more interesting for myself but I will only take a first look at AirBNB and at what price that stock goes public to maybe get some action, I think we will a much bigger price than the 44-50$ price range to begin with for public trading. I also expect the same thing to happen with DoorDash which has already raised the IPO [pricing](https://ibb.co/Y8VSCpV) to 90-95$ but I am not very interested to buy that stock, as this type of economy has hugely benefited them and it might see a decrease rather than an increase in the next couple of years.\n\nSo, guys I still believe the stock market has upside in front of it, especially in the next 2 years, but you should tread careful for now, I think a possible correction might be just ahead before we move on higher, as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/9g0bJdj), a wedge formation is continuing to from with more and more tension, I believe there is about a 6,5% possible downside to the market at the moment before eventually getting back on track next year and going toward the 4000 level. And especially with the most recent jobless numbers in the US, I would try to diversify a little more especially with some EAST-ASIA exposure in countries like South Korea, Singapore and China also.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "TLDR: if you like APXT, you might like PCPL. It currently trades at $11 and has potential to go up to $15+ before merger in Q1 2021 with the biggest logistics supply chain SaaS in the world that services companies like Dell, Oracle, Lenovo etc \n\n\nTicker: PCPL (Neuberger Principal Holdings)\nPrice as of Previous Close: $11.05\nMerger target: E2OPEN\nSector: Tech (B2B SaaS)\nStatus: Definitive Agreement\n\nInfo about E2Open:\nBusiness-to-business SaaS provider, focused on software for supply chains for telecom, electronics systems, computers, components etc. The company was a joint project by LG, IBM, Seagate, Hitacha, Solectron, Toshiba and Nortel. It is based in Texas and was founded 20 years ago. E2Open is the world\u2019s largest supply chain operating network.\n\nPrior to being acquired by a venture capital company in 2015, E2Open was listed on Nasdaq. Its historical trading data can be found under the ticker EOPN (https://www.investing.com/equities/e2open-inc-historical-data)\n\nIt IPO\u2019ed in 2012 at $15, peaked at $27+ in 2014, and declined to $8.5 by the time of its acquisition in 2015.\n\nIndustry Insight/Hype Potential:\nAlthough SaaS isn\u2019t quite as hot as EV these days, there are still plenty of investor interest in tech companies that deliver on revenue and growth. For example, another SaaS provider AvePoint (APXT/AVPT) is trading above $16. Here\u2019s a comparison between AvePoint and E2Open:\n\nAvePoint is a cloud based SaaS provider founded in 2001 with ~1300 employees, ~$150m annual revenue. It will have a pro-forma EV of ~$2b \n\nE2Open is a cloud based SaaS provider founded in 2000 with ~2400 employees and ~$300m annual revenue. It will have a pro-forma EV of ~$2.5b\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t compare E2Open with AvePoint\u2026 AvePoint has clients like MSFT!\u201d:\nHere are some of E2Open\u2019s clients:\nBoeing, Bose, Dell, General Electric, Kelloggs, L\u2019Oreal, Lenovo, P&amp;G, Seagate, Vodafone, AMD, Canon, Oracle, NVidia, HP etc etc\n\nE2Open has a 4.7 rating based on 500+ reviews (source: https://www.featuredcustomers.com/vendor/e2open/testimonials.) Here is what Vodafone\u2019s Group Supply Chain Management Director and CEO Detlef Shultz had to say about E2Open\u2019s Supply Chain Management Softwares:\n\n\u201cE2Open understands the direction we\u2019re taking as a company, and continues to help us refine and move toward that vision. By automating key business processes as part of a comprehensive supply chain strategy, we have been able to eliminate redundancies and more quickly meet transactional goals.\u201d\n\nHere is an overview of E2Open vs. some of its direct competitors in terms of company size and revenue:\nhttps://www.owler.com/company/e2open#competitors\n\nOutlook: E2Open has been aggressively snapping up acquisitions to further cement its role as a leader in supply chain management. Among its most recent acquisitions are: Averetek (2019), Amber Road (2019), INTTRA (2018), Cloud Logistics (2018), BIrch Worldwide (2018), Zyme Solutions (2017) and Steelwedge Software (2017). The money raised in the PCPL merger would pay down existing debt, improve balance sheets, and perhaps fund more strategic acquisitions in the coming years.\n\nLogistics will definitely play a huge role in the post-COVID world, and as the #1 supply chain management SaaS E2Open is poised to benefit the most from this fact.\n\nOf course, there are many other factors other than customer reviews and revenues to consider when it comes to a company\u2019s valuation. To that end, I would recommend that you do your own DD.\n\nResources:\nInvestor Presentation: https://www.ccnbprincipal.com/investor-relations/cc-neuberger-principal-holdings-I/default.aspx\nhttps://www.investing.com/equities/e2open-inc\n\nI haven\u2019t noticed PCPL being mentioned on Reddit or elsewhere, so I\u2019m inclined to believe that word about this SPAC hasn\u2019t gotten out yet. There are only ~800 people watching PCPL on Stocktwits compared to Apxt\u2019s 18000+. I will say that at ~10% over NAV, the risks here are very low (for now). The merger will happen some time in Q1 2021, and I suspect that the price of PCPL will shoot up once it is announced.\n\nDisclaimer: this is NOT financial or investment advice. This is just research that I came across and decided to share with you. At the time of writing this I do not hold any positions in PCPL.",

        "selftext": "ASX: FLT\n\nBullish case: \n\nFlight centres biggest markets are (in order) Australia - America - UK. InAustralia we see no to little community transmissions and a planned rollout of vaccines early March. Without a vaccine there\u2019s been an increase of 200% in bookings in Australia through Flight centre online (and that\u2019s with borders starting to partially open up again) for December and throughout early 2021 with hotel and flights being fully booked out. Australia\u2019s market for flight centre is largely made up of corporate travel, however, that could change momentarily due to lockdown fatigued and people wanting to travel for leisure and go on a holiday (which mind you we already see a huge increase in demand for holidays) and corporate travel likely to come back even in small increments we could see a huge increase in revenue and profits in 2021\u2019s earnings (most likely beating expectations). An increase in profits is and a possible increase in profit margins due to operating cost decreasing and most likely staying at the same level until full operation. This is where it gets tricky though, they are well know for their walk in deals when customers come into the store, but since the recent closing of more than 100+ stores in Australia alone, Flight centre would have to heavily push for online consumption of their products. Which is why some people say Webjet is better placed, but flight centre has a lot of money due to their capital raising, and if they can use the money well and offer online deals, marketing campaigns and still keep open their remaining stores with in store deals. They will have multiple income streams from different infrastructures (unlike webjet). For example, boomers mostly don\u2019t know how to use the internet and would rather face to face because it feels more authentic while the younger generation don\u2019t care which one they use as long as they get discounted cheap prices for fully planned holidays that they themselves after lock down probably can\u2019t be stuffed planning themselves. Also there are quite a few vouchers by state governments incentivesing people to travel (not to sure how many or how much). \n\nThis also comes with Flight centre recently upgrading and improving their online ability to more efficiently help customers by upgrading to a K2 cloud operating system. \n\nhttps://www.google.com.au/amp/s/itbrief.com.au/amp/story/flight-centre-travel-group-updates-cx-and-operations-with-k2-cloud\n\n\nSo my price target in the next 6-12 months is $40, but this would mean People are willing to take the vaccine and corporate and leisure travel actually hit pre COVID level and even all time highs (which is doable but highly speculative)\n\n\n\nNOT FINACIAL ADVICE",

        "selftext": "ASX: FLT\n\nBullish case: \n\nFlight centres biggest markets are (in order) Australia - America - UK. InAustralia we see no to little community transmissions and a planned rollout of vaccines early March. Without a vaccine there\u2019s been an increase of 200% in bookings in Australia through Flight centre online (and that\u2019s with borders starting to partially open up again) for December and throughout early 2021 with hotel and flights being fully booked out. Australia\u2019s market for flight centre is largely made up of corporate travel, however, that could change momentarily due to lockdown fatigued and people wanting to travel for leisure and go on a holiday (which mind you we already see a huge increase in demand for holidays) and corporate travel likely to come back even in small increments we could see a huge increase in revenue and profits in 2021\u2019s earnings (most likely beating expectations). An increase in profits is and a possible increase in profit margins due to operating cost decreasing and most likely staying at the same level until full operation. This is where it gets tricky though, they are well know for their walk in deals when customers come into the store, but since the recent closing of more than 100+ stores in Australia alone, Flight centre would have to heavily push for online consumption of their products. Which is why some people say Webjet is better placed, but flight centre has a lot of money due to their capital raising, and if they can use the money well and offer online deals, marketing campaigns and still keep open their remaining stores with in store deals. They will have multiple income streams from different infrastructures (unlike webjet). For example, boomers mostly don\u2019t know how to use the internet and would rather face to face because it feels more authentic while the younger generation don\u2019t care which one they use as long as they get discounted cheap prices for fully planned holidays that they themselves after lock down probably can\u2019t be stuffed planning themselves. Also there are quite a few vouchers by state governments incentivesing people to travel (not to sure how many or how much). \n\nThis also comes with Flight centre recently upgrading and improving their online ability to more efficiently help customers by upgrading to a K2 cloud operating system. \n\nhttps://www.google.com.au/amp/s/itbrief.com.au/amp/story/flight-centre-travel-group-updates-cx-and-operations-with-k2-cloud\n\n\nSo my price target in the next 6-12 months is $40, but this would mean People are willing to take the vaccine and corporate and leisure travel actually hit pre COVID level and even all time highs (which is doable but highly speculative)\n\n\n\nNOT FINACIAL ADVICE",

        "selftext": "Just wanted to get some thoughts on my current TFSA approach. \n\nI have split up of my TFSA account into \"dividend\" and \"risk\" stocks both contributing about 50% to the balance. The \"dividend\" stocks are: NPI, CM, BEP, BLX, HR, HMMJ. You can probably tell that this is already a fairly aggressive approach, but I think the 4 companies and the ETF and REIT are fairly solid picks. Also fairly heavy on renewable energy. I actively keep theses stocks balanced using dividends and contributions. Essentially, I keep buying CM and HR as their growth trails the other ones.\n\nMy \"risk\" stocks are PHO, FLT, CUB, PNG, GPV and GDNP. I got lucky with GPV as I got in at $1.97. I am not planning to take profits on these stocks unless this pool starts to dwarf my dividends stock, i.e. once the original 1:1 ratio between risk and dividend hits 2:1 I will re-balance and move profits from risk -&gt; dividend.\n\nThis approach has been working very well over the last 2 years and I saw some tremendous overall returns, but I am realistic and old enough to appreciate that this will these high returns cannot be sustained. Having said that, I do think an annual 25% increase should be possible (without contributions). I am already up %12+ this year. Out of principle I do not invest in any O&amp;G, mining or medical companies, mostly because I understand high tech companies much better, but also in parts out of conviction.\n\nI am expecting a correction on the renewable energy stocks at some point, but I believe that long term they alone should help me achieve my goals. \n\nSo, I guess the only questions I have is whether this approach is sane? Also, I am leaning towards weathering though any potential pull backs or even averaging down, especially on the renewables. Or does it make more sense to try and diversify now?",

It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/\"boomer\" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key:**\n\n* Pharma companies are very risky.\n* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.\n* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.\n* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).\n* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.\n* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.\n* Take the \"Calls\" as very discounted, and \"Potentially A Call\" as somewhat discounted.\n* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.\n* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.\n* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***At Close of Thursday***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Batch 1:**\n\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tMA\tMastercard Inc\n* Financial Exchanges &amp; Data\tMKTX\tMarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n* Financial Exchanges &amp; Data\tMSCI\tMsci Inc\n* BMS\tBraemar Shipping Services plc\n* CSRA\tCisadane Sawit Raya PT\n\n*Maybe*:\n\n* CRSR\tCorsair Gaming Inc\n* TWTR\tTwitter Inc\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tFLT\tFleetCor Technologies, Inc.\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tGPN\tGlobal Payments Inc\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tJKHY\tJack Henry &amp; Associates, Inc.\n* Environmental &amp; Facilities Services\tROL\tRollins, Inc.\n* Financial Exchanges &amp; Data\tCME\tCME Group Inc\n* Health Care Equipment\tBDX\tBecton Dickinson and Co\n* Health Care Equipment\tDXCM\tDexCom, Inc.\n* Industrial Conglomerates\tROP\tRoper Technologies Inc\n* Interactive Media &amp; Services\tTWTR\tTwitter Inc\n* Internet Services &amp; Infrastructure\tVRSN\tVerisign, Inc.\n* Managed Health Care\tHUM\tHumana Inc\n* Pharmaceuticals\tPRGO\tPerrigo Company PLC\n* Restaurants\tDPZ\tDomino's Pizza, Inc.\n* Restaurants\tMCD\tMcdonald's Corp\n* Research &amp; Consulting Services\tINFO\tIHS Markit Ltd\n* TYL\tTyler Technologies, Inc.\n* DPZ\tDomino's Pizza, Inc.\n* DXCM\tDexCom, Inc.\n* JKHY\tJack Henry &amp; Associates, Inc.\n* GPN\tGlobal Payments Inc\n* FB\tFacebook, Inc.
