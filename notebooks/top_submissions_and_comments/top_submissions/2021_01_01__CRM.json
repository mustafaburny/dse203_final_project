This \u201cBecky stock\u201d is a post-COVID reopening play with a stellar top-tier management team led by Brent Saunders, who has a decorated history of driving highly accretive growth via M&amp;A.  Hydrafacial\u2019s merger IPO is backed by reputable, long-term investors like Seth Klarman\u2019s Baupost, Fidelity, Principal Global, Redmile Group, Camber Capital, and Woodline Partners. Current price at $11.45 ($1.3B enterprise value) offers pre-merger asymmetric upside of potentially reaching +$20 and a hard floor of $10 per share\n\n**Company Presentation:** [https://2y7msb2elfoj22q7jr2xnc83-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Project-Hydrate-Investor-Presentation\\_vFinal.pdf](https://2y7msb2elfoj22q7jr2xnc83-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Project-Hydrate-Investor-Presentation_vFinal.pdf)\n\n**Deal Webcast:** [http://public.viavid.com/player/index.php?id=142715](http://public.viavid.com/player/index.php?id=142715)\n\n**Company Overview**\n\n* The Hydrafacial Company (Hydrafacial) offers the **one of the** **most popular facial skincare treatments across the world**, with an army of loyal middle and upper-class customers receiving regular treatments on a **monthly basis at +$200 / session**\n* **Skincare is already a fast growing market (\\~14% CAGR in the U.S. alone) with worldwide TAM of +$200B** \n* Consumers have been shifting their **expenditures from goods to experiences** and have shown an **increasing willingness to spend on high end beauty** **and health services**. \n* Growth in the beauty industry is now being driven by an emphasis on **skincare rather than cosmetics.**\n* Hydrafacial is a **patented protected (38 awarded and 18 pending)**, 30-minute, 3 step facial treatment that cleanses, extracts and hydrates \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 0qesxplnhg961...*\n\n* Hydrafacial is known for its strong customer loyalty, high customer satisfaction, and great reputation among estheticians\n   * Hydrafacial is the **ONLY beauty product/service with a higher Net Promoter Score than Botox**\n   * Hydrafacial is a **non-invasive service that can be used in conjunction with other treatments** like Botox \n* Hydrafacial boasts a broad and growing base of estheticians including:\n   * Aesthetics: Advanced Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery, Marina Plastic Surgery, Ideal Image\n   * Spa Services: Bella Sante, Equinox, Four Seasons, Lifetime, OrangeTwist, The Ritz-Carlton\n   * Beauty Retail: Sephora  \n* The company operates a **\u201crazor &amp; razor blade\u201d** model with **highly attractive blended gross margins of +75%:**\n   * The razor: Hydrafacial delivery machine estimated at **$25k-$30k per unit** accounts for roughly **49% of sales**\n   * The razorblade: **10% of the \\~$200 / session fee comes from the use of consumables** (serums, applicator tips, boosters) that Hydrafacial sells to estheticians. This recurring revenue currently represents **51% of sales and will grow bigger as a % of sales as the install base of delivery equipment expands**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cqjlw3wrhg961.png?width=902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c432dc3e74a9d9d66b8325d53e11b6f6d68c7c4\n\n* While the upfront cost of a Hydrafacial delivery machine and training time is fairly high, **the economics garnered by the esthetician are highly compelling**\n   * A standard Hydrafacial $200 treatment yields a **90% gross margin / $180 gross profit to the esthetician**\n   * **Adding a booster**, like a SkinCeutical antioxidant treatment can increase the Hydrafacial treatment to **$325 with minimal increased cost ($3.39) resulting in a 93% gross margin / $301.61 gross profit**\n   * Assuming **60 treatments per month at $200 / session, that\u2019s $144,000 of revenue or $129,600 of gross profit a year** for the esthetician\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/etaarg7whg961.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b5d16744c3bc4d5cd393a2639bcf7d93492df3d\n\n* These compelling economics for estheticians along with customer satisfaction and loyalty have driven **increased adoption across 87 countries** and expanded the **installed base of Hydrafacial machines to over +15,000 delivery systems**\n* Historically, the company enjoyed a healthy **+50% CAGR, reaching $167M in revenue and $41M in EBITDA in 2019 (25% EBITDA margin).** \n* However when the COVID pandemic arrived, sales of delivery machines and consumables took a big hit in Q1 and Q2 of 2020 as many estheticians closed their businesses during the lockdowns.  Sales quickly **recovered in Q3 2020 back to levels comparable in Q3 2019.**\n   * Delivery machine installed base grew significantly despite COVID**, up 18% YoY in Q3 2020 compared to Q3 2019**\n* As world economies are fully reopened in 2021, Hydrafacial expects revenues to rebound to **$181M in 2021E and $250M in 2022E, +47% CAGR from 2020**\n   * While it projects **gross margins will expand back to 76% in 2022E**, the Company plans to reinvest in the business to drive topline growth resulting in a near-term EBITDA margin of 14-16% vs. likely steady state of 25% \n   * 2022E projections are realistic: with 18K installed base, 3K new units ($30K each), and $8.5K consumable revenue per unit, **Hydrafacial will reach $250M revenue** just by **keeping up with its past performance** \n* Given Hydrafacial\u2019s established brand and leading market position, it has **unique value creation levers it can pull**:\n   * Implement **annual price increases on consumables** it sells to estheticians given the low cost relative to cost per treatment ($20 of consumables vs. $200 treatment cost)\n   * Expand US and international delivery machine install base by **using IPO proceeds to aggressively buildout salesforce** \n   * Establish Hydrafacial as **delivery platform of choice by partnering with leading cosmetic companies to develop co-branded serum treatments**\n* While there are very few direct competitors to Hydrafacial, Chinese knockoffs known as HydraPeel (or AquaPeel) exist. However, these competitors have failed to gain any meaningful traction outside of the Greater China market. Likewise, alternative procedures such as microdermabrasion have not mounted a serious challenge. Most importantly, **branding power matters A LOT in the beauty industry (think Hermes or Louis Vuitton) with high price inelasticity, and Hydrafacial is the undisputed leader.**\n\n**Management and M&amp;A - the X Factor**\n\n* **Brent Saunders,** who founded Vesper Health and led the Hydrafacial acquisition, is a **legend in the beauty care and specialty pharma industry**. \n* As former CEO of Allergan (+$60B company), Saunders **led the commercial expansion of dozens of healthcare products, most notably Botox**. \n* Saunders has an **exceptional track record of driving shareholder value through accretive M&amp;A** for the companies that he\u2019s led (Bausch &amp; Lomb, Forest Labs, Actavis, Allergan).  \n   * Each of these companies **traded at significant premium valuations to peer companies**, due to the market\u2019s expectation that Saunders would do more accretive M&amp;A or ultimately sell in a strategic exit \n   * Saunders executed **+80 strategic M&amp;A transactions over his career**\n* It\u2019s likely that **Saunders has grand ambitions to use Hydrafacial as an M&amp;A platform** to bring additional products and services to its customers.\n   * Vesper has set aside a **$75M of the $1.1B purchase price in the form of an earnout for Hydrafacial payable upon the completion of certain identified acquisitions within 12 months of the merger closing**\n   * The Merger Agreement specifies that the earnout will be paid based on **2.5x LTM revenues of the target.** So if Hydrafacial buys a target with $30M of LTM revenue, Hydrafacial shareholders will receive the full $75M earnout.\n      * **$30M would be a HUGE inorganic boost to 2021E revenue of $181M**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhl7j7gxbk961.png?width=915&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8aa50f47f5c8e7ae5e2517b0457744a94bc437d6\n\n* While Hydrafacial is a single product company for the time being, it\u2019s clear that **Saunders wants to create broader ecosystem of beauty products and services to sell to estheticians**\n* **Saunders also has a very close relationship with Jim Cramer** of Mad Money on CNBC. He has been invited to the show on a quarterly basis as the CEO of Allergan, and still talks to Cramer regularly via Twitter. I would not be surprised to see **Cramer hosting Saunders on Mad Money to discuss Hydrafacial** at some point ahead of the merger consummation in Feb/Mar 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22bif7h4ig961.png?width=583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c99cb280b321312ebd3b7351f1580a9db5145fb5\n\n* Saunders has built a loyal investor following in beauty care and specialty pharma as demonstrated by Vesper\u2019s largest shareholder **Seth Klarman of Baupost, who owns 10% of the float.**  The $350M PIPE is being anchored by high quality long-term shareholders including **Fidelity, Redmile Group, Principal Global, Camber Capital and Woodline Partners.** \n\n**Financials and Valuation**\n\n* Management expects **2022E revenue of $250M, a 47.4% CAGR** from depressed 2020E levels that were impacted by COVID\n* **Gross margins are expected to reach 76% in 2022E while EBITDA margins will reach 16%** as the company reinvests in the business for continued topline growth.  \n   * **Longer-term, it\u2019s likely Hydrafacial\u2019s steady state EBITDA margins will return to the 25-27% levels it attained in 2018 and 2019, similar to other beauty companies**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oa9cwgw4ck961.png?width=899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb22e2a5e1185191cfababdd522aa896e2a2a2bb\n\n* Hydrafacial currently trades at **$11.31 or 5.2x 2022E revenue, which is inline with low growth Traditional Beauty companies.**\n* Given Hydrafacial\u2019s strong growth prospects in the coming years, it should trade at a premium to High Growth Medical Aesthetic and Traditional Beauty companies \n   * For example, **InMode projects 2020E to 2022E CAGR of 22.7% and trades at 6x 2022E revenues while Hydrafacial projects 2020E to 2022E CAGR of 47.4%, which could justify trading at 12x 2022E revenue or $22.50 per share.**  The market should start **pricing in M&amp;A upside for Hydrafacial as well.** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/twtxe6la0l961.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94d60be46e7e2158316f4c43efffce30be81a0ae\n\n* **The setup: at $11.45, you\u2019re basically risking $1.45 ($10 hard floor of $VSPR SPAC) to make potentially $8-11** if the market starts to value Hydrafacial\u2019s growth and M&amp;A potential as it progresses towards the **merger closing in late February or early March 2021**\n\n**Risks**\n\n* *Single product company*: While we briefly discussed potential M&amp;A prospects earlier, Hydrafacial is still a one-product company for the time being. The execution of inorganic growth plans to create an ecosystem will depend on management\u2019s ability going forward.\n* *Alternative products*: As Hydrafacial expands its international footprint, it will meet some resistance from the cheaper Chinese serums and alternative procedures like microdermabrasion, especially in the developing world. Continued esthetician and favorable media coverage will be essential to keeping the brand premium in international expansion. \n* *COVID uncertainties*: If the current COVID environment continues well beyond Q3 2021 (e.g., due to vaccination delays), the future growth prospects of the company for 2022 will inevitably be affected.\n* *Merger transaction between Hydrafacial and Vesper may not close:* While most SPAC mergers do close, there\u2019s always a small but real risk that a transaction may fail.\n\nDisclosure: Long 225k warrants and 48k commons",

Mondays are my best days so Ill have way more then, EOD.\n\n\ud83d\udc33\ud83e\uddd0**Overall, whales kept betting on tech to bounce back heavily**, in convincing style (signals that indicated the call blocks were more than just hedging). Image links are call blocks from each. \n\n[FB](https://i.imgur.com/A0R2dz2.jpg) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80: until the bitter end today, people were feverishly pumping call blocks with puts aligning them. If tech bounces back, FB in particular is due for a rip after correcting post-earnings\n\n[SQ](https://i.imgur.com/40VDFnM.jpg) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80: consistent bullish call volume all week.

        "selftext": "Alright listen up folks. I know this industry isn\u2019t sexy like EV or FinTech, but this space is important. Let me tell you why Clover Health ($CLOV) is going to see a great returns within the coming months!\n\n$CLOV merged with $IPOC (Chamath\u2019s SPA). Chamath\u2019s track record speaks for itself. His investments including SPCE, OPEN, and his other current PIPE investment have all done really well and are quality companies. Since the merger with Clover Health, Chamath upped his stake in the Clover Health and now owns roughly 30%. Not long after, a 13D was filed by Clover\u2019s CEO to up his stake in the company and now owns around 37%. The CEO has a proven track record of building successful healthcare businesses on the services side that he\u2019s sold for billions. Another notable mention is Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea. She is on the Board of Directors for Clover and has been a believer in the company for a while now. She recently opted to exercise her shares rather than sell after merging because she\u2019s in it for the long haul.  if there\u2019s one thing we know, it\u2019s that the Clinton family gets their bag. Numerous other executives at Clover and Social Capital have done the same  including Ian Osborne. There\u2019s 70+ institutions holding the stock but other notable \u201csmart money\u201d includes backing from Google and Sequoia Capital. If you don\u2019t know what Sequoia capital is, I encourage you to look up previous companies they\u2019ve invested in. Follow the smart money \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk some numbers. Medicare Advantage spending was $270 billion in 2019, and is expected to expand to $590 billion by 2025. As of now $CLOV is only in 34 counties. That doesn\u2019t sound that impressive at first glance. However, just being in 34 counties generated them 507M in revenue. They already said this year they\u2019ll be in 108 counties which will take their revenue to just shy of a billion. There\u2019s 3,000 counties in the US. Being in 108 counties is just 0.03% penetration of the total addressable market.... They\u2019ve already said they want to be in every corner of the country and the cash generated from this IPO will help them expand to get there. Their market share is growing exponentially (9x faster than its closest competitors) and revenues are growing 50%+. Speaking of total addressable market, 10,000 boomers turn 65 a day. That\u2019s an extremely concrete and measurable customer base that can only expand. We now have president Biden who has sworn to revamp Medicare and possibly lower age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 60. If that happens, that\u2019s fucking millions of extra potential customers a month. \n\nLet\u2019s talk a little more about what Clover does. They\u2019ve proven to build Medicare Advantage plans that balance quality and cost. They\u2019re fixated on how they can deliver the lowest cost possible. Any business obsessed with delivering value and cost savings to consumers is always successful. Always. To me this is reinforced through their very impressive partnerships with retail giants in the counties they operate in including: Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Kroger, Costco. But wait, that\u2019s not all they do. Here\u2019s what makes $CLOV special. Clover is a double edged sword. In addition to their Medicare business, the other side of the business (that can be leveraged in conjunction to their Medicare plans) is called Clover Assistant. This is their proprietary AI focused and data driven software. It allows doctors to leverage historical patient data in order to create more effective treatment plans. This results in lowered costs, fewer visits, and better outcomes for everyone involved. Think of this as Einstein for Salesforce CRM or Watson for IBM. Clover Assistant can be the Einstein for the EHRS (electronic health record systems). This industry is prime for disruption. There are very few tech advancements in the healthcare world from an operations perspective. Keep in mind this side of the business is still in its infancy with only 2000 physicians on it. They plan to ramp exponentially with an upcoming direct contracting model in addition to using proceeds from IPO for further market penetration. \n\nFuture catalysts include:\n\n-$20 price target from Bank of America (doesn\u2019t seem to be on web yet but pic from Bloomberg Terminal shared on Twitter) \n\n-they were invited to speak at the prestigious JPM Health Conference on 1/12. Check out the deep dive presentation. Tons of great growth states there. JP Morgan coverage/price target soon?\n\n-they are presenting at the 4th annual Medicare Advantage Leadership Innovations Conference on 1/27 where they mentioned they will reveal their latest currently announced partnership. Could be great PR. \n\n-Biden has laid out themes of what he will discuss in the coming week each day. He will discuss his healthcare plans on 1/28 where he will surely discuss his Medicare plans including his plans to lower the Medicare eligibility age \n\n-future PR from Chamath, Clover, major news outlets, and price targets. There is very little PR on the web about Clover Health currently as a recent IPO. Once that picks up we are going to the moon!\n\n-technicals: there\u2019s been a lot of speculation that the suits have held this stock down to shake out weak hands and load up before the fireworks begin. The stock has been heavily accumulating in a descending wedge. Looks like the short volume is decreasing and when PR starts to come out, shorts will cover, basically making this a mini squeeze out. Chart looks ready. \n\n-float: a lot of the public float has been eaten up with the executives involved increasing their share. 67% is owned between $CLOV CEO Vivek and Chamath alone. According to Yahoo Finance data, there\u2019s only 11M float left of 145M shares outstanding. That\u2019s not too much left for retail to buy especially once there\u2019s more eyeballs on this stock via PTs and PR. That\u2019s getting close to low float levels. Low float + short squeeze = \ud83d\ude80\n\nThis to me seems like a no brainer especially under this new administration. See you all on the moon \ud83c\udf1a \n\nPosition: YOLO averaged up to $14 with entire life savings",

        "selftext": "No matter what happens with COVID-19 in 2021, cloud spending isn't expected to slow. That makes cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider **salesforce.com** ([NYSE:CRM](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/salesforcecom-inc/crm/)) a solid bet to outperform with Biden in the White House.\n\nIn simple terms, CRM software helps businesses track customer information, log service issues, and manage their marketing campaigns. Although retail is the most logical beneficiary of CRM solutions, it's by no means the end-all. Manufacturing, healthcare, information technology, and service industries all benefit from real-time customer data to better serve their existing clients and make add-on sales.\n\nIn terms of CRM software, [salesforce is the kingpin](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/28/got-1000-3-stocks-to-buy-to-start-2021-with-a-bang/). **Gartner**\u00a0estimated that it controlled 18.3% of the global CRM market at the end of 2019. That's more than double its next-closest competitor. With the addition of **Slack Technologies**, which salesforce has [agreed to acquire for $27.7 billion in cash and stock](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/salesforce-building-the-operating-system-for-the-f/), salesforce will have another way to cross-sell its products on a rapidly growing business-based platform.\n\nConsidering that most [software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/saas-stocks/) are valued at 20 or more times sales, salesforce looks like an absolute bargain at less than 10 times fiscal 2021 sales.\n\nMy Positions: CRM 230C Calls March 19th Expiry",

        "selftext": "Alright listen up folks. I know this industry isn\u2019t sexy like EV or FinTech, but this space is important. Let me tell you why Clover Health ($CLOV) is going to the fucking moon soon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\n$CLOV merged with $IPOC (Chamath\u2019s SPAC). Chamath\u2019s track record speaks for itself. His investments including SPCE, OPEN, and his other current PIPE investment have all done really well and are quality companies. Since the merger with Clover Health, Chamath upped his stake in the Clover Health and now owns roughly 30%. Not long after, a 13D was filed by Clover\u2019s CEO to up his stake in the company and now owns around 37%. The CEO has a proven track record of building successful healthcare businesses on the services side that he\u2019s sold for billions. Another notable mention is Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea. She is on the Board of Directors for Clover and has been a believer in the company for a while now. She recently opted to exercise her shares rather than sell after merging because she\u2019s in it for the long haul. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 if there\u2019s one thing we know, it\u2019s that the Clinton family gets their bag. Numerous other executives at Clover and Social Capital have done the same  including Ian Osborne. There\u2019s 70+ institutions holding the stock but other notable \u201csmart money\u201d includes backing from Google and Sequoia Capital. If you don\u2019t know what Sequoia capital is, I encourage you to look up previous companies they\u2019ve invested in. Follow the smart money \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk some numbers. Medicare Advantage spending was $270 billion in 2019, and is expected to expand to $590 billion by 2025. As of now $CLOV is only in 34 counties. That doesn\u2019t sound that impressive at first glance. However, just being in 34 counties generated them 507M in revenue. They already said this year they\u2019ll be in 108 counties which will take their revenue to just shy of a billion. There\u2019s 3,000 counties in the US. Being in 108 counties is just 0.03% penetration of the total addressable market.... They\u2019ve already said they want to be in every corner of the country and the cash generated from this IPO will help them expand to get there. Their market share is growing exponentially (9x faster than its closest competitors) and revenues are growing 50%+. Speaking of total addressable market, 10,000 boomers turn 65 a day. That\u2019s an extremely concrete and measurable customer base that can only expand. We now have president Biden who has sworn to revamp Medicare and possibly lower age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 60. If that happens, that\u2019s fucking millions of extra potential customers a month. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nLet\u2019s talk a little more about what Clover does. They\u2019ve proven to build Medicare Advantage plans that balance quality and cost. They\u2019re fixated on how they can deliver the lowest cost possible. Any business obsessed with delivering value and cost savings to consumers is always successful. Always. To me this is reinforced through their very impressive partnerships with retail giants in the counties they operate in including: Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Kroger, Costco. But wait, that\u2019s not all they do. Here\u2019s what makes $CLOV special. Clover is a double edged sword. In addition to their Medicare business, the other side of the business (that can be leveraged in conjunction to their Medicare plans) is called Clover Assistant. This is their proprietary AI focused and data driven software. It allows doctors to leverage historical patient data in order to create more effective treatment plans. This results in lowered costs, fewer visits, and better outcomes for everyone involved. Think of this as Einstein for Salesforce CRM or Watson for IBM. Clover Assistant can be the Einstein for the EHRS (electronic health record systems). This industry is prime for disruption. There are very few tech advancements in the healthcare world from an operations perspective. Keep in mind this side of the business is still in its infancy with only 2000 physicians on it. They plan to ramp exponentially with an upcoming direct contracting model in addition to using proceeds from IPO for further market penetration. \n\nFuture catalysts include:\n\n-$20 price target from Bank of America (doesn\u2019t seem to be on web yet but pic from Bloomberg Terminal shared on Twitter) \n\n-they were invited to speak at the prestigious JPM Health Conference on 1/12. Check out the deep dive presentation. Tons of great growth states there. JP Morgan coverage/price target soon?\n\n-they are presenting at the 4th annual Medicare Advantage Leadership Innovations Conference on 1/27 where they mentioned they will reveal their latest currently announced partnership. Could be great PR. \n\n-Biden has laid out themes of what he will discuss in the coming week each day. He will discuss his healthcare plans on 1/28 where he will surely discuss his Medicare plans including his plans to lower the Medicare eligibility age \n\n-future PR from Chamath, Clover, major news outlets, and price targets. There is very little PR on the web about Clover Health currently as a recent IPO. Once that picks up we are going to the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n-technicals: there\u2019s been a lot of speculation that the suits have held this stock down to shake out weak hands and load up before the fireworks begin. The stock has been heavily accumulating in a descending wedge. Looks like the short volume is decreasing and when PR starts to come out, shorts will cover, basically making this a mini squeeze out. Chart looks ready. \n\n-float: a lot of the public float has been eaten up with the executives involved increasing their share. 67% is owned between $CLOV CEO Vivek and Chamath alone. According to Yahoo Finance data, there\u2019s only 11M float left of 145M shares outstanding. That\u2019s not too much left for retail to buy especially once there\u2019s more eyeballs on this stock via PTs and PR. That\u2019s getting close to low float levels. Low float + short squeeze = \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\nThis to me seems like a no brainer especially under this new administration. See you all on the moon \ud83d\ude80\n\nPosition: YOLO averaged up to $14 with entire life savings",

        "selftext": "I got two goals here. One is for you to understand what Salesforce and SAP really do instead of just \"cloud\" and \"software\" and why Salesforce will become like SAP. The second is to tell you what to expect with CRM price and how to make tendies.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst you gotta understand what exactly SAP does and what happened with their stock. SAP is one of the largest software companies which focus on ERP. What the fuck is ERP you might ask? ERP is what other businesses use to track business resources. This ranges from everything such as planning and optimizing manufacturing capacity to dealing with payroll for employees. Basically companies don't want to create their own software for handling these wide range of tasks and pay SAP a shit load of money to do it for them. Where's the problem you might ask? Unless you are involved with one of these companies that use SAP, it's difficult to understand what the experience is like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd\n\nBasically a company pays SAP to use their software for dealing with one of these areas of ERP. This generally works fine since SAP has used their business management software with a lot of companies for the same tasks. The issue is when one of these companies want to [customize the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning#Disadvantages) to meet unique demands for the company. This re-engineering process to fit the ERP system for many tasks ends up costing more for a company and wasting a lot of time and money. Interestingly enough, you can ask almost any business about their experience with SAP and they will all say that they're unhappy even though they use their software. So what you might ask, wouldn't SAP still be generating tons of revenue? Well yes but more of these companies are moving away from this way of doing ERP as it is an inflexible approach. This is becoming replaced by more loosely connected systems utilizing cloud instead of having a one solves all solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20\n\nLet's look at how their financial earnings and stock price have reflected this. In the past two years this stock has traded relatively sideways with some really bad drops. Around May to August their stock price went up 60% do to the hype around cloud companies benefiting from COVID. However it has obviously taken a really bad fall when October earnings were announced. They claimed that there was slower recovery than anticipated for many of its clients. However I suspect that many of these companies have been looking to shift away from SAP as the pandemic has shown the importance of the flexibility of these systems. By looking at their past quarters, you can see that their quarterly revenue has been flat around the 8 billion range and the company is clearly having a difficult time changing their business model. Other cloud companies are replacing their solutions as SAP's clients move away from their software even though SAP is trying to shift to [modern cloud technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP#Corporate_restructuring). Generally though companies have a hard time changing their business approach from the old way of doing things to the new way of doing things. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow the important part. What the fuck does SAP's troubles have to do with Salesforce. As you may have guessed from the ticker Salesforce provides CRM or customer relationship management. [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) is a specific area in ERP dealing with customer services. For example a company may want a software for their call center or to automate a marketing effort. Salesforce provides software to do this along with analytics of this data so that these businesses can make informed decisions.\n\nAs you may have already guessed Salesforce is facing some similar problems that SAP deal with. When a company decides to expand their CRM software to deal with more parts of their business, the inflexibility and costs quickly become apparent. [For example, many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial basis and less than 40 percent of companies have high end-user adoption rates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#Criticism) Again if you are not familiar with software development and companies using these software vendors it is difficult to fully understand these troubles. I would strongly recommend researching the issues of customizing ERP or CRM software for a specific company if you are not convinced. While Salesforce tries to provide an all in one solution for their clients, customization becomes complicated and prices become costly. These customizations become difficult to do and take a lot of time, planning, and money. Companies are becoming more inclined to take a different approach for building these systems. In a lot of these cases it is easier for a business to build their own system in the cloud using products from companies such as Microsoft or Amazon for more customizability. \n\nAnother big issue is the concern over customer data with CRM systems. A company might opt to develop their own CRM systems where they can ensure that customer data is obeying customer privacy laws and allows them to have more control over private data. This can help build a better relationship with the customer. Privacy issues over customer data has obviously become a big issue in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, Salesforce has been trying to get into more areas with [recent acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce). Similar to SAP, I suspect that Salesforce will crush over their own weight as they try to expand their company. One good example of this is their recent acquisition of Slack. Slack does not really fit any of Salesforce ecosystem and is really just an attempt to expand into a different area. Slack has a lot of competition from Microsoft teams and other companies which can do what Slack does but better. \n\nBusiness will start to move away from Salesforce similar to SAP. This is not to say that they be completely independent as Salesforce does make some parts of the businesses easier. However there seems to be a strong resemblance to SAP based on what I know from inside of a corporation using both SAP and Salesforce and the many issues they face when they try and customize their solutions.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo how can we use this information to print tendies? The expectation is that Salesforce will eventually slow their growth down while stock is overhyped due to being a cloud company and start to fall or go sideways like SAP. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5\n\nBasically the idea is to try and play puts, especially around earnings. If Salesforce misses their guidance then it could the stock in a serious reversal especially for a cloud company with a lot of hype. The next earnings will be early March.\n\nYou can also try and play longer term puts but the stock is fairly volatile like SAP and I would only do this if you see the price go up significantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; buy puts in march \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: long on GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

If it breaks resistance look out for 18.97-19.74-20.5 range.\n\nIf current support fails, look GME to fill a gap at 16.55-15.77 range. If it breaks 15.77 support then we f'ed.

        "selftext": "**tl;dr** \n\n**At-NAV new SPAC with world-leading expertise in online gambling. Worth a bet on potential to be next DKNG on the hype train**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n+++++++\n\n*Hi all - have had a lot of great tips from this sub. Hopefully this pays some of you back. I have been watching and researching this since 23 December when it first filed S1, awaiting the units to be listed - they are available today trading as ADERU*\n\n*Positions - 500 units @ 10.42 to start. Will be monitoring and building position below $15, especially if attention starts to build ahead of units and warrants splitting and shares coming available to Robinhood.*\n\n*(My other SPAC positions are OPEN, IPO-E-F, PSTH, FUSE, PIPP, ACTC, CCIV and DMYD, 100 to 1000 shares each mostly around NAV and numerous warrants and options around these.)*\n\n*As ever, this is not investment advice and do your own research*\n\n\n+++++++\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**26 Capital Acquisition Corp or ADER** \n\nis a 240m SPAC with usual terms - 10$ units, 1/2 warrants. Seeking a merger in \"gaming and gaming technology, branded consumer, lodging and entertainment, and Internet commerce sectors\".\n\nI think this is highly worth a play on the online gambling hype if you can get in at near NAV, based entirely on the **management which is unbeatable in its knowledge of the gambling industry** \n\n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**CEO Jason Ader** \n\n\nhas held director level positions at Las Vegas Sands Corp. ($42bn one of biggest casino groups in world), IGT (\u00a33.72bn multinational gambling firm specialised in software and slot machines) and Playtech (\u00a31.4bn multinational gambling software firm)  \n\nBefore starting his own fund in 2013 he was regularly ranked Wall Street's top analyst on the gambling and leisure sector\n\nHis fund, [Spring Owl Capital](https://springowl.com/), is a small activist fund focused on gambling and leisure. They are probably most famous for ousting the CEO of Viacom in 2016 and a [crusade against Yahoo CEO Marissa Meyer in 2015](https://www.alexanderjarvis.com/99-problems-and-the-ceo-is-one-springowl-hunts-for-marissas-head-at-yahoo/). \n\nAder knows the gambling - and online gambling - industry inside out. He drove bWin to a \u00a31.1bn takeover by gambling giant GVC (now Entain) in 2016, and has been driving similar change and demands for improvement at board level at Playtech\n\nThe fund mostly manages money for a select group of wealthy families, which *could* be a positive sign for the SPAC (although I don't know how much skin in the SPAC the fund has, if any)\n\n[Here is a video of Ader from November talking about how he's excited about SPACs](https://calvinayre.com/2020/11/12/business/beckys-affiliated-30-minutes-with-jason-ader-on-igaming-investment-opps-video/). \n*He talks about how he has been advising certain States about legalising sports betting and how to maximise value and liquidity by linking up with European companies in the space (Playtech e.g.??).*\n\nAder is extremely bullish on US legalising online casino and more sports betting options, accelerated by need for revenue because of pandemic\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Rafi Ashkenazi**\n\nOne of the most highly respected names in the online gambling world, including COO and CEO positions at major online gambling firms such as Playtech and Stars Group (a world leader in online poker and casino). At Stars he led the $4.7bn takeover of Sky Betting to create the world's largest publicly listed online betting firm in 2018. Most recently he led the \u00a310bn merger between Flutter (biggest gambling company in world by revenue, market cap \u00a326bn), and Stars Group (Ader also involved). Also has connections into the booming Israel tech space which is interesting\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Joseph Kaminkow**\n\nSpecial Advisor to the Chief Product Officer at Aristocrat, a leading gambling software provider and games publisher, previously Vice President of Game Design at Zynga Inc. This guy is a [former video game / pinball  designer](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeKaminkow) who is credited with revolutionising the slots industry after moving into gambling software from video games in 1999. Regarded as a \"legend\" and \"hall of famer\" in this niche. At Zynga he designed so-called 'social casino games' which don't involve real-money gambling but are otherwise basically gambling apps (revenue from microtransactions etc). 130 patents on gambling/gaming design inventions\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Greg Lyss**\n\nThis is a very interesting but extremely low profile person. He was Bill Ackman a.k.a SPACman's right hand man at Gotham Capital. [Ackman respected him so much that when Ackman set up a personal hedge fund to invest the Ackman family's money, he put Lyss in charge of it](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/inside-these-hedge-funds-quiet-family-affairs-for-the-boss/). To repeat - **Bill Ackman thinks this guy is such a good investor and trustworthy that he put him in charge of investing his family's money**. Don't know anything more about him, but I like this association with Ackman, which suggests to me some integrity around management of this SPAC, especially as the gambling world can be very murky.\n\nThe other member of the team is the CFO of SpringOwl with 20+ years' hedge fund experience and not notable (although clearly competent)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Thesis / potential targets**\n\nBased on the above experience and many public comments by Ader over the past year, I would be very surprised if ADER is not looking to merge with an online gambling technology provider / existing online betting website / social casino app / possibly a supporting technology provider\n\nThey are activist inventors, and specifically say in the IPO prospectus that they could look for businesses that can benefit from turnaround or are not being run well. I speculate that their deep knowledge of the European / global online gambling industry means they have a target in mind that they think would benefit from their expertise and US liberalisation of gambling legislation. \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1) Ader believes the listing of UK-listed gambling companies in US is immediately big in terms of market cap because of the premium on online gambling stocks in US. [He has pitched DraftKings to takeover Playtech](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/playtech-activist-investor-pitches-idea-of-draftkings-making-bid) and [called on Playtech to spin off non-core business](https://uk.style.yahoo.com/u-activist-springowl-calls-playtech-145401181.html). This makes me wonder if he would **spin off some element of Playtech to list in US** to cash in on gambling hype.\n\nThis might be **Finalto.com / TradeTech** which is an online financial platform owned by Playtech. [Playtech has been trying to sell this for 200 - 240m since August so it fits](https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/playtech-plans-to-sell-tradetech-seeking-200-250-million/). This company provides liquidity and trading to brokerages and runs markets.com a trading site. I wouldn't be that excited although apparently the business has been booming during COVID and there could be a decent pop just on fintech hype.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n2) This could be a 'picks and shovel' type data/B2B betting software play a la DMYD, or something like e.g. Israel based CRM software **Optimove** which works with some of biggest online gambling cos and has links to Ashkenazi. This would be interesting but probably not a huge pop\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3) Possibly - given Ader's links to Sands - **an online gambling tie-up with one of the big Vegas casinos** who are desperate to get into the online betting space (see MGM's attempt to buy Entain for $8bn last week). Interestingly, Sands' owner Sheldon Adelson, previously a major opponent of online betting, has just died. Ader predicted a few months ago that Sands would be moving in this direction.\n\n&gt;\u201cThere\u2019s no stopping online gaming,\u201d Ader said [before Adelson's death]. \u201c(Las Vegas Sands\u2019) initiatives to stop online gaming, at this stage, are largely historic. There hasn\u2019t been a lot of spending recently to do that, especially post-pandemic.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cI think the company will see the value created by DraftKings and FanDuel and Penn (National) Gaming and others. They\u2019re not foolish,\u201d Ader added.  [source](https://www.gambling.com/news/us/what-s-next-for-las-vegas-sands-without-sheldon-adelson-2402400)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n4) Ader is very confident that Macau will legalise online gambling in next year or two. Sands is big in Macau, the biggest gambling market in the world. **A SaaS-type product positioned to capitalise on Asian gambling** would be MASSIVE - at present however, China's attitude to gambling and local regulations mean this is unlikely\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n5) I also wonder if they might try to take legitimate one of the offshore bookmakers with big customer databases and brand recognition but which have been grey-area/illegal under US gaming legislation. For example, **Five Dimes** recently announced a settlement with the FBI to attempt to transition into newly legalised US markets. This might have the most hype potential\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Potential upside**\n\nThis is entirely a play on management experience and the meme factor / hype around online gambling in the US. I think if they pick a good target - which given their experience and connections seems likely - and get the right publicity and attention from retail investors looking for the next DKNG this could easily 3x and maybe 5-6x if on DKNG-type hype levels.\n\nThere is currently little spotlight on this and it is a good time to get in at NAV\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Potential Downside**\n\n* Ader has been vocal that he thinks US online betting is overvalued and in a bubble - why is he starting his own SPAC in the space then? Does he just want to cash in while the hype is at all-time high or does he have a legitimate business goal?\n\n* If he just wants to dump a part of Playtech which he does not like onto retail investors, this is a bad deal.\n\n* Other targets could be e.g. hotel industry or other leisure sector which would be zero sexiness to retail. Given Ashkenazi and Kaminkow's background this seems unlikely though\n\n* Usual SPAC caveats apply about potential difficulty finding a target, locking up your money for unspecified period of time, and the fact I may have completely misread the potential and my above thesis might be totally wrong",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI work as a product manager at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends and strategies. I put this post together to outline a major new 'moat' strategy being used by some of the world's best SaaS companies. I've also highlighted some of the best related investment opportunities.\n\nIf you found this post valuable and would like to read more please let me know. I'm thinking about writing like this more often if it's something people get value from. Thanks a lot\n\n# The Lock-Expand-Improve Strategy\n\nIn 2016, Instagram launched their \u2018Stories\u2019 feature. Instagram Stories was an almost direct copy of Snapchat Stories (even copying the name). Whatever your opinion on such a move, it has most definitely paid off. By 2019,\u00a0the daily active user count\u00a0for Instagram stories was twice as high as\u00a0Snapchat\u2019s total DAU count.\n\nBuilding great software is still one of the most important things that software companies should be focused on. But it\u2019s not enough. In a world where your best features can (and will) be copied, companies need to focus on building a strong economic moat around their business.\n\nFirst coined by Warren Buffett, an economic moat is a company\u2019s ability to build and maintain a durable competitive advantage while protecting its long-term profits and market share.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe most important thing \\[is\\] trying to find a business with a wide and long-lasting moat around it \u2026 protecting a terrific economic castle with an honest lord in charge of the castle,\u201d - Buffett\n\nI believe that there are 3 \u2018types\u2019 of moats in particular that when built together by tech companies, will compound upon each other to create a hugely defensible business. This business strategy will be one of the most important strategies of the next 10 years. Companies who can successfully execute on this strategy will dominate their markets and deliver outsized returns to their investors.\n\nI call this moat strategy the **Lock-Expand-Improve** strategy.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019ll first briefly explain some of the traditional moats currently seen in tech companies. Then I\u2019ll go into detail on the lock-expand-improve strategy. Finally, I\u2019ll highlight a few tech companies that I think are best positioned to execute on this strategy and therefore make for great investment opportunities.\n\n## Traditional Business Moats\n\n* **Deep Technology/IP:**\u00a0Sometimes, companies can build a massive economic moat by having deep technology that is at least 10 times better than the competition. Google\u2019s search engine is the classic example of this. Google joined the search wars somewhat late but had a solution that was far better than Yahoo\u2019s.\n* **Economies of Scale:**\u00a0The bigger your are, the lower your costs will be due to having more operating leverage. This means that you can earn more money per customer (at the same price) or provide a cheaper solution than your smaller competitors. Software companies in general are great examples of economies of scale due to the almost zero additional cost of production involved in acquiring another customer.\n* **Network Effects:**\u00a0Your product/service has network effects if its value increases as the number of people using it increases. Social networks and messaging products are classic examples of network effects. Network moats can be incredibly defensible. Why would I download a new messaging app when all of my friends are using WhatsApp?\n* **Brand Loyalty:**\u00a0A strong brand can be a moat. Think Apple, Coca-Cola, Gucci. Instantly recognisable brands that have built huge businesses by cultivating brand loyalty amongst their customers.\n\nThe above moats have built some of the biggest and most enduring tech companies in the world. Google, Amazon and Facebook all have one or more of those moats. But many of these moats can become shallow over time. For example, network effects have been key to Facebook\u2019s success. The more users that use Facebook, the better Facebook becomes for each individual user (to an extent). However, Facebook\u2019s network effects don\u2019t stop users from adopting and using other social networks.\n\nMajor platform shifts/trends can also make some moats a lot more shallow. The emergence of open-source software has made deep tech a far shallower moat in many instances.\n\nToday, for tech companies to build a truly durable competitive advantage they need more than one moat. These moats should also compound upon each other. The whole should be greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nEnter the lock-expand-improve moat strategy.\n\n## Lock-Expand-Improve\n\nBefore explaining the lock-expand-improve strategy, it\u2019s important to note that this strategy is focused on B2B/enterprise software companies. While aspects of this strategy could most likely be useful for companies in other industries/verticals, I\u2019ll only be highlighting investment opportunities in the B2B/enterprise space.\n\nThe most important thing to note about this strategy is that it is a compounding moat strategy. This means two things:\n\n1. Each step of the strategy must be in place for it to be successful.\n2. Each step builds upon the previous step to allow companies to build a stronger competitive advantage over time.\n\nWhile traditional moats allow companies to focus on protecting and improving their castle (business), these moats can get shallower over time. The lock-expand-improve strategy allows companies not only to to protect and improve their castles but also to ***dig a deeper and wider moat over time.***\n\n## Step 1: Lock-In\n\nThe first two steps of this strategy are similar to the popular \u2018land and expand\u2019 strategy.\n\nThe first step, lock-in (or high switching costs), involves making it very difficult for your customers to switch to a competitor. Here are some of the ways that software companies can achieve customer lock-in:\n\n1. **High sunk costs:** High sunk costs are a common feature of major ERP-style businesses such as ServiceNow or Oracle. Implementing these products can cost millions of dollars and take months to years. Once a customer has put that much time and effort into implementing your product, they will be far less likely to switch to a competitor.\n2. **Deep integrations:** If your product allows your customers to integrate with lots of other apps and data sources, it will be far harder for a company to switch to a competing product. They will not only have to replace your product but also replace all of the integrations that have been built up over time.\n3. **Business logic and workflows:** You can build customer lock-in by being the product in which a lot of customer information, logic and workflows are stored. A good example of this is Atlassian\u2019s jira product. While the implementation costs for jira are low, a huge amount of organisational logic and process gets stored in jira over time, making it difficult to replace.\n\n## Step 2: Expand\n\nOnce you have achieved customer lock-in, the next step is to expand into other product areas and use cases. The goal is to solve more problems and sell more relevant products to each individual customer.\n\nThis multi-product strategy is a really powerful way of building a strong moat around your business. Even if the individual products are worse in isolation, the benefits of multi-product may far outweigh the negatives for customers.\n\nFor example, a competitor may have built a sales analytics tool that is far better than Salesforce\u2019s analytics product. But a large customer is not comparing both analytics tools in isolation. A large customer is comparing your analytics tool against the fact that they can also get their CRM, marketing and customer support software all from Salesforce. One contract. One vendor relationship. One login for employees.\n\n## Step 3: Improve with data\n\nOnce a company has locked-in their customers and has expanded into new products, they can then begin collecting huge amounts of data about how their customers use their products.\n\nThis final step of this strategy is the most important - Using customer data to provide tangible benefits to those customers and significantly improve their businesses. There are two main ways that data can be used to benefit customers:\n\n1. ***Focus on using the data from an individual customer to benefit that specific customer -*** Companies can use an individual customer\u2019s data to provide actionable insights to that customer to allow them to improve their businesses. For example,\u00a0People.ai\u00a0uses ML to help companies uncover new revenue opportunities. Customer data can also be used to automate specific, repetitive tasks for customers. For example, UiPath (can\u2019t wait for their IPO) provides RPA solutions to allow customers to automate repetitive tasks.\n2. ***Focus on using the data from all customers to benefit the entire customer ecosystem -*** Google is a great example of a company that uses a data network effect to their advantage. The more search data they collect from all searches, the more accurate they can make searches in the future. We are beginning to see some enterprise software companies move in this direction. For example, ServiceNow provides benchmarking data to customers to allow them to compare themselves against industry standards and improve their business from there.\n\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning have been buzzwords in the software world for quite a while. Up until now, we haven\u2019t seen huge benefits from AI/ML strategies in b2b/enterprise software. I strongly believe that this is beginning to change. We are starting to see the big incumbents build or acquire meaningful data solutions (eg Salesforce acquiring Tableau). Companies that can leverage AI/ML to do meaningful and useful things with their customer\u2019s data will have a huge advantage over their competition.\n\n## The Flywheel\n\nYou can see how the lock-expand-improve strategy has such a compounding effect. By first locking in a customer, you can expand into new products, which allows you to then collect as much data as possible. Once you are collecting this data, you can then begin to use this data to provide big tangible benefits to your customers. These benefits mean your customers will be even less likely to switch to a competitor (lock-in) which will allow you to expand into even more products and collect even more data. The flywheel continues.\n\nThat is what\u2019s so powerful about this strategy - where many traditional moats get shallower over time, the flywheel effect makes this economic moat even deeper and wider over time.\n\n## Investment Opportunities\n\n*(\\*\\*\\*Please note, that this post does not represent investment advice and these are just the companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio)*\n\nWhile there are many b2b/enterprise tech companies that have successfully executed on the first 2 steps of this strategy (lock and expand) and there are a number of companies placing a huge amount of focus on step 3 (improving with data), there are no companies who I feel have fully executed on this strategy in it\u2019s entirety.\n\nFrom an investing perspective, the opportunity lies in identifying companies who are best positioned to (and would benefit most from) successful execute the lock-expand-improve strategy. Below are 3 such companies that I am incredibly bullish on.\n\n## Okta ($OKTA):\n\nOkta is an identity management company that provides identity services such as single sign on and user authentication. They are perfectly positioned to execute on the lock-expand-improve strategy.\n\nOkta has incredibly high lock-in properties. Once a product is managing your SSO, user authentication and provisioning services, it is not easy to replace. The switching costs are high both in terms of the amount of core business logic managed by the platform and the amount of integrations to other software products.\n\nOkta is successfully executing on the expansion aspect of this strategy too. They have moved into products such as API management and now have two major product areas; workforce identity management and customer identity management.\n\nI believe Okta has a huge opportunity to double down on their data initiatives and to truly start to help their customers to improve. They have already started doing so with their \u201cOkta Insights\u201d product which provides analytics and tailored recommendations to Okta customers. These products seem to be mostly focused on user security but imagine the further opportunities here - We are seeing an explosion in the number of SaaS products being used internally by companies. Okta is the single source of truth for companies to understand their SaaS usage, spend etc. Okta has a huge opportunity to leverage this information to help their customers choose the right tools, reduce unnecessary IT spend and much more.\n\nOkta is already the leader in the identity management space. If they continue to focus on their data strategy over the next few years then I firmly believe that the lock-expand-improve flywheel will begin turning and they will fully cement that position.\n\n## Twilio ($TWLO)\n\nTwilio provides communication APIs that allows companies to engage/communicate with customers over multiple channels such as SMS and Whatsapp.\n\nAPI products have very high lock-in characteristics. The more services that Twilio allows you to integrate with, the harder it becomes to switch to a competitor.\n\nTwilio is expanding into new product areas very successfully. They have expanded into new communications use cases such as video messaging and recently launched a programmable call centre product - Twilio Flex.\n\nWhat\u2019s most interesting about Twilio is its data strategy. Up until 2020, they didn\u2019t seem to have much of a data focus. But their recent acquisition of Segment looks set to change all that. Segment allows customers to make data-driven decisions around engineering and marketing., allowing them to improve their businesses over time. The Segment acquisition was a brilliant move. It makes Twilio\u2019s position far more defensible. The flywheel effect could be very powerful here; Twilio already has high lock-in and is expanding aggressively, the Segment acquisition allows them to focus on helping their customers to improve their businesses through data.\n\n## Stripe\n\nOkay, I know - Stripe isn\u2019t public. But I couldn\u2019t help including them here. They look likely to go public in the few years and in my opinion are perfectly positioned to execute on the lock-expand-improve strategy.\n\nStripe\u2019s product has high lock-in properties, they are expanding aggressively into other product areas and have already built a very powerful data product - Stripe Radar which allows companies to detect and fight fraud.\n\nStripe has all of the ingredients for a successful lock-expand-improve execution. Here\u2019s hoping they go public sooner rather than later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you liked this post lease let me know below.

        "selftext": " **TL:DR**\n\n* This is Part 2 of what is now going to be a three part deep dive on Smartsheet (Ticker: SMAR).\n* This second part walks you through the beginning of my four piece framework of trying to figure out if the stock can 10x from here: (1) Leadership (2) Risks (3) Price and (4) Growth.\n* In this second part, we are just going to focus on (1) Leadership. As I was writing, I found that Leadership is a very important part of the Smartsheet story and it needed its own article to do it justice. You can read [Part 1 here](https://onthemarkpicks.com/2021/01/01/deep-dive-2-part-1-of-2-smartsheet-solving-the-productivity-paradox/).\n* Smartsheet is an exciting SaaS company that\u2019s helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people\n* I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These are just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.\n\nHi everyone, thanks for coming back for Part 2. I\u2019m excited to bring you more research and insights on Smartsheet (NYSE: SMAR). Let\u2019s dive in.\n\n**Can we 10X from here?**\n\nFor someone like me that is on the younger side and with a longer investment time horizon, and probably you if you are reading this, an important question to ask yourself is \u201cDo I think this investment could 10x from here?\u201d. In other words, could this investment one day be 10 times what it is worth today? To try to answer this question, I will work through a pre-determined framework that I believe gives us the best path to find out.\n\nThe framework includes:\n\nLeadership \u2013 Desire, Purpose and Ownership\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nPrice Considerations\n\nExplosive Business Growth\n\n**1. Leadership \u2013 Desire, Purpose, Ownership**\n\nFor a company to do something as spectacular as 10x, we are going to need to see really strong and talented leadership. In Chris Mayer\u2019s excellent book \u201c100 Baggers\u201d, he dedicates a part of the book to talk about the importance of what he calls \u201cOwner Operators\u201d. By this he means that the CEO of the company owns a substantial amount of stock in the company themselves. Why is this important? If the CEO has their own personal wealth at stake in the company\u2019s stock (just like we do as shareholders) their interests are more aligned with shareholders and maximizing returns for shareholders than they would be if that CEO had no skin in the game. It\u2019s also better in my opinion if the CEO of the company was also the founder of the company. For these founder-CEO\u2019s that have money invested in their own company, it really is like their baby. Would you rather have your money invested with someone who views the company as their baby or with someone who was just hired to watch this kid (the company)?\n\nIn the case of Smartsheet, we check all the boxes when it comes to leadership. Mark Mader is not only an Owner Operator, he is also a co-founder. I touched on this a little bit in part 1, but Mark co-founded Smartsheet along with Brent Frei in 2005. They both played football (American football) for Dartmouth College, an Ivy League School. They met in the fall of 1988 when Mark was a freshman on the team and Brent, who had graduated the prior year, was serving as a Graduate Assistant for the team.\n\nAfter that season, Brent moved on to begin a career in computer engineering. Mark quit the football team after 1 year. In an interview with Forbes, he said that after his freshman season he thought it was too much to juggle Ivy League academics and being a NCAA Division 1 athlete. Mark started focusing solely on academics until a tragedy struck. One of his best friends from his high school football team got into an accident and was critically injured. His friend would never be able to play football again. This had a profound impact on Mark. He said in the interview that knowing one of his friends would never be able to play again made him realize that if he still has the ability to play football, he needs to go do it. He went to his old coach, told him the story about his friend and asked for his spot on the team back. The coach accepted and Mark went on to finish his career in the fall of 1991 as a 6\u20194\u201d, 245lb offensive lineman.\n\nMark said that this experience with his friend and re-joining the football team taught him not to take anything for granted. He said ever since then he tries to do his best with everything and make the most out of every opportunity. That mindset has served him well as he now sits as a CEO of a $8.5 billion company. But he\u2019s really just getting started. That mindset lives on today. The day that he took Smartsheet public, April 27, 2018, he was asked if he plans on celebrating the achievement, he said \u201cWe have 74,000 customers that don\u2019t want us to party, they want us to work on the product.\u201d How did Mark get to the point where he was CEO of a tech company with 74,000 customers that raised $150 million during their IPO? I\u2019ll share with you a little more history behind the company.\n\nAfter Brent Frei left Dartmouth, he started his career in computer engineering as I mentioned before. His career started with Motorola in 1989, then he went to Microsoft in 1991, and then he founded his first company, Onyx Software in 1994. It didn\u2019t take long before his buddy from college, Mark Mader, would come join him at the start-up. Mark joined in 1995 and eventually worked his way up to an Executive role within the firm.\n\nThe focus of Onyx was Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Brent was the CEO and Mark became the SVP of Global Services. Brent led the company through an IPO in 1999 right before the tech bubble burst. It was really unfortunate timing because a lot of their customers were dotcoms that went out of business. Brent was still able to lead them through stiff competition with Salesforce in the early 2000\u2019s until he hit a plateau in 2004. He decided to step down from the company he had founded 10 years earlier. On his last call with investors, he was quoted as saying \u201cI believe it\u2019s the right time for me to turn over the reins to a new CEO who can take Onyx to new heights over the next decade,\u201d. All the while, Mark was there in the background learning and observing. He saw what went right \u2013 they built a large publicly traded company from scratch. And he saw what went wrong \u2013 their growth stalled as they lost market share to Salesforce.\n\nOnly a year after resigning from Onyx, Brent was on to his next big move and he again recruited his friend Mark to help. They were going to found Smartsheet, a company to help improve the way people work. This time, Mark was a Co-Founder along with Brent and had a much bigger influence on the company. His influence got even larger in 2017, 12 years after the founding, when Brent left to found his 3rd company, TerraClear. Brent left to go back to his roots in Idaho where he grew up on the family farm. His new start-up TerraClear seeks to solve one of the largest unsolved problems in farming today \u2013 clearing rocks from farming land. As crazy as that sounds, apparently it\u2019s a big issue. Hence the name, TerraClear. Brent is still on the Board of Directors of Smartsheet.\n\nGoing back to the IPO date (April 27, 2018), which was only 4 months after Brent had left, Mark was asked by the press what he had learned from being at Onyx when they went public. Mark was very clear in his response and said that one of the main lessons from Onyx was to \u201cnot get too enamored with your product\u201d. With Smartsheet, he wants to make sure they\u2019re always improving the product and the user experience. He also said that investors don\u2019t buy a stock based on what you\u2019ve done in the past, but what you plan to do. \u201cIf you are always looking at the rear view mirror, then you are not running the business\u201d he said. This is exactly how I want the leaders of companies I invest in to be thinking. He is very forward thinking, customer focused, and humble. There is a lot of evidence to corroborate that he has followed through on the statements he made that day.\n\nOne of the first pieces of evidence I found that supports my thesis of Mark being very focused on the product and user experience is the incredible ratings that the product has received from its customers. I use a tool called Net Promoter Score (NPS) which is one of the most reliable and unbiased ways to find out what a customers true experience with a business is and how likely they would be to recommend it to a friend. For Smartsheet, their NPS is extremely high. It\u2019s on a scale of -100 to 100 so anything above 0 is considered to be good. If the rating is above 0, it essentially more people would recommend the product to a friend than they would tell them not to use it. Smartsheet has an NPS of 80, which is honestly one of the highest I have ever seen.\n\nFurther evidence to support Mark and the rest of management\u2019s commitment to product quality and user experience is the exceptional ratings the product has on the Apple App Store. This is just for the mobile version of the product, the app that you can download on your phone just like you would download the mobile version of Outlook. The rating in the App Store is 4.8/5. That\u2019s very impressive as well.\n\nBased on how customers are responding to the product, I think it\u2019s fair to say that Mark was not [B.S.ing](https://b.s.ing/) his way through that interview on IPO day. He and his management team really have been focused on creating a stellar product and the results are showing. When I say that \u201cDesire and Purpose\u201d are important traits of a leader of a company it means that I want to see a leader who has a real desire to do what he/she is doing as the CEO of the company, believes in their product(s) and services, and has a real purpose for why they want to do that. I can tell that Mark is committed to the mission of improving the way people work. Being one of the founders, and having written an E-Book on the \u201cProductivity Paradox\u201d that I mentioned in Part 1, I think this mission is very near and dear to his heart and that he has a desire to see the impact and scale of his company grow well into the future. As shareholders, that\u2019s what we want.\n\nAnother way to see if the leader of the company has \u201cDesire and Purpose\u201d is to see how his/her employees perceive them. Do the employees look up to this person? Do they feel motivated to work hard because they know what they\u2019re doing is meaningful and can make a positive difference in people\u2019s lives? One way I have of gaining insight into this is to look at the company\u2019s Glassdoor ratings and specifically the rating of the CEO. In the case of Smartsheet, the positive story continues. The company has a 4.1/5 rating on Glassdoor and Mark has a 90% approval rate from his employees which is well above average. To me this shows he\u2019s communicating the company\u2019s purpose to the employees very well and is motivating them to actualize that purpose.\n\nThere\u2019s one other piece of evidence I stumbled upon that gives good insight into the culture that Mark and his management team are building at Smartsheet. They were recently (12/17/20) awarded \u201cBest Company Culture\u201d and \u201cBest Companies for Women\u201d by Comparably. Below you can see a screenshot of the headline from a Business Wire article about this. It\u2019s one thing to be awarded for \u201cBest Company Culture\u201d but to also be a \u201cBest Companies for Women\u201d when you\u2019re in a heavily male dominated industry such as computer software, that really says something. It speaks to the culture of diversity and inclusiveness that Mark is building there which goes a long way in the year 2021 when social issues are at the forefront of people\u2019s minds more than ever. The modern enterprise has to build a culture of diversity and inclusiveness if they want to retain the most talented employees and keep them motivated. Smartsheet is doing a good job of this.\n\nSource \u2013 Smartsheet making headlines for their outstanding company culture.\n\nI think we\u2019ve found a lot of evidence to support that this leadership team has a strong desire to fulfil their purpose. It\u2019s evident that they want to help improve the way people work and that they\u2019ve invested heavily into making this happen while keeping employees motivated and focused on the goal. The last piece I look at for leadership is ownership. Does the CEO have a personal financial stake in the company? This is such a key thing to look for because as I mentioned earlier in the article, if leadership themselves owns a substantial amount of shares, then their interests and motivations will align with us, the shareholders. They essentially are a shareholder too, just like us. On top of the desire and purpose that we\u2019ve established is present, there\u2019s also a financial incentive for Mark and the team to lead the company to success, and ultimately, a higher share price.\n\nCurrently, Mark holds 490,267 shares which comes out to a value of $34 million as of this writing (1/14/21). I\u2019d consider that substantial for an individual person. Even more noteworthy is that Brent owns 3.2 million shares which comes out to a value of $218 million. Brent owns that much of the company still and he\u2019s not even involved beyond being on the Board of Directors. I think that\u2019s a testament to how much confidence he has in Mark to lead Smartsheet to new heights. Also, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that he left Smartsheet to help with his family business. He saw his 80 year old Dad picking up rocks on the farm with his bare hands and realized he wanted to help solve this problem in the farming industry. Leaving Smartsheet was not like when he left Onyx because the business was plateauing. As a matter of fact, Smartsheet was rapidly growing at that time and was about to go public. The fact that he still has $218 million worth of shares in the company shows he still believes in the company and what Mark can do with it now and in the future.\n\nThis concludes Part 2 of my Smartsheet deep dive.

FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb)  finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but it\u2019s still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.\n\nWe just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate &amp; Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  \nWe also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursday\u2019s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil &amp; Gas industry.\n\nHere is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.\n\nWe also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.\n\nThe biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn\u2019t safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.\n\nWe also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM)  in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton &amp; Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple &amp; Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney &amp; Salesforce.\n\nWe also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau\u2019s gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.\n\nMeanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).\n\nWhile this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data don\u2019t show up as investors &amp; analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.\n\nWe also really don\u2019t get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens &amp; Bed Bath &amp; Beyond coming on Thursday.\n\nSo, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc)  pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world\u2019s biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock, check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kci2lk/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).\n\nSome other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December, while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.\n\nMeanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.\n\nGuys, personally I can\u2019t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China. You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmzvqv/apple_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell_aapl/)\n\nWe also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA\u2019s CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.\n\nMeanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.\n\nAnd on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Roku\u2019s exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "#1) Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ)\n\nThe Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.\n\nThe top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds. Many of these companies are valued at high multiples due to their growth potential. This is not financial advice; invest at your own risk.",

        "selftext": "Ok, there were many reasons to buy Salesforce before. Including being heavily undervalued, having strong potential earnings due to the pandemic, having strong potential with the acquisition of Slack, etc etc but was hesitant to actually buy because it was kind of in a slow downward trend. Well, today, I am finally convinced that it is a good time to buy, because ---\n\nCathie bought Salesforce today!!!\n\nAnd look at what she also bought - Netflix!!! And guess who's up pre-market 12% today? Netflix!

        "selftext": "**Stocks end 2020 on the high note with Tesla closing over 700$. Is Lemonade overvalued? FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb)  finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but it\u2019s still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.\n\nWe just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate &amp; Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  \nWe also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursday\u2019s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil &amp; Gas industry.\n\nHere is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.\n\nWe also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.\n\nThe biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn\u2019t safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.\n\nWe also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM)  in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton &amp; Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple &amp; Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney &amp; Salesforce.\n\nWe also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau\u2019s gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.\n\nMeanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).\n\nWhile this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data don\u2019t show up as investors &amp; analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.\n\nWe also really don\u2019t get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens &amp; Bed Bath &amp; Beyond coming on Thursday.\n\nSo, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc)  pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world\u2019s biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock, check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kci399/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).\n\nSome other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December, while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.\n\nMeanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.\n\nGuys, personally I can\u2019t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China. You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kmp7x1/apple_aapl_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/)\n\nWe also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA\u2019s CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.\n\nMeanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.\n\nAnd on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Roku\u2019s exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/kmoxky/apple_aapl_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/)\n\nWe also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA\u2019s CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.\n\nMeanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.\n\nAnd on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Roku\u2019s exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": " **TL:DR is at the bottom**\n\nHello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.\n\nMy   name\u2019s Mark and I\u2019m an accountant with a passion for investing. About   two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm   and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and   privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique   perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a   new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to   help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market   today.\n\nI\u2019m a long-term investor. I   am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long  time.  I\u2019m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and  everything  that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led  me to  originally invest and believe in that company have not changed.  If you  want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the  book  \u201c100 Baggers\u201d by Chris Mayer.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI\u2019m   excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month,  Smartsheet.  I\u2019m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock  screeners with  different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth),  scan Twitter,  talk to professionals in different industries, and try to  observe what  products or services are getting popular with my friends  and family. One  of the best investment decisions I\u2019ve made to date came  after I talked  to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf  course. Shout out  to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said, you  never know where your  next good investment idea is going to come from.\n\nIn   the case of Smartsheet, I became aware of the company through a stock   screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B),  strong  revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it\u2019s a  subscription  business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts,  it cued me to  take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet,  the more I  liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and  that really  struck a chord with me. In different roles I\u2019ve had as a  teacher, tutor,  and supervisor, I\u2019ve always found empowering people to  be one of the  most important keys to success. I will touch on this more  later in the  write up.\n\nAnother  positive signal I  got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I  was sitting in  the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was  watching an  interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of  Smartsheet. My  girlfriend overheard the word \u201cSmartsheet\u201d mentioned in  the video and  said \u201cAre they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue  check mark?\u201d. I  had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were  thinking about  the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it.  She said \u201cMy  company just transitioned all of our work onto  Smartsheet. I really love  it. Our marketing department is really  excited about it because it  makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.\u201d Hearing this just  motivated me to learn more about  Smartsheet.\n\n**The Thesis Statement**\n\nFor   every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement   that can serve as a reminder for why I\u2019m buying and holding that stock   for the long term. I\u2019ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long   so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during  times  when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why   you\u2019re holding this position.\n\nThe thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:\n\n*\u201cSmartsheet:   A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the  global  workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work,  managers and  executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally  consolidate their  teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that  tool and is  innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the  most out of  their teams.\u201d*\n\nI  think this  thesis statement really captures the essence of what  Smartsheet does. If  you go to Smartsheet\u2019s website and look at the  \u201cAbout\u201d page, you will  find their \u201cAbout\u201d statement which says  \u201cSmartsheet is the enterprise  platform for dynamic work that aligns  people and technology so your  entire business can move faster, drive  innovation, and achieve more.\u201d  Notice how their statement emphasizes  helping businesses move faster,  drive innovation, and achieve more.\n\nIn   my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM   software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable   independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM   space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise   capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of   customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the   companies that were identified from the study in the order of their   ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader   in the space at 2nd place. Let\u2019s use our common sense for a second. At   the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest   in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with   resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage   work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the   answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies   on the list. Let\u2019s break them down 1 by 1:\n\n* Workfront   was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront,  you\u2019d  have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn\u2019t  be a  pure play investment into the CWM space.\n* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)\n* Wrike is private\n* ServiceNow   \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing   here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also, the company  is  already quite large ($106B market cap)\n* Asana   is public but just IPO\u2019d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don\u2019t have   much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company.   Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment  into  the CWM space, they\u2019re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in   several of Forrester\u2019s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you   can invest in the best?\n* Monday.com is private\n* Microsoft \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.\n* Atlassian   \u2013 This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple  problems  with them as an investment. 1) They\u2019re ranked way beneath  Smartsheet.  2) They\u2019re already too big for me to confidently say they  can 10x  (market cap already $58B).\n\nNow   that we\u2019ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space  and  that they\u2019re arguably the best publicly available pure-play  investment  in this space let\u2019s understand why this is important. Other  than the  obvious reason that we\u2019re in the beginning stages of a remote  work  revolution, why is this important?\n\nWell,   let\u2019s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO,  during  the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th,  2020:\n\n\u201cLeaders  are recognizing  they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work,  work that is  documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where  priorities  are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their  teams  with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle  times  will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and   prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is   ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive   the benefits from doing so.\u201d\n\nKey word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:\n\nAsynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.\n\nSynchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.\n\nAny   communication that doesn\u2019t require a real-time response can be   considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above.   Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real   time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As   part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by   the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and   Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in   2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is   called \u201cThe Power of Done\u201d. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent   noticed through their own experience, and through different research   studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the   early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This   is a quote from their E-Book:\n\n\u201cAccording   to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy,   interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging   and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized  basis,  this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S.   workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.\u201d\n\nThey   mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances  in  work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets,  there  hadn\u2019t at that time been any great applications created for  teamwork  collaboration or task management. The fact that technology  advances  helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also  deterred  productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred  to as the  productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it  and thus they  founded Smartsheet.\n\n**How Smartsheet makes money**\n\nAt   the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand   how they make money. In Chris Mayers\u2019 excellent book, 100 Baggers, that  I  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth  as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This  isn\u2019t  to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just  because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a  growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the  first things I  look at.\n\nBefore I  talk about the  revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little  bit about the  actual product that they sell to earn this revenue.  Co-Founder/CEO Mark  Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate  world was being done  on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However,  he realized that these  spreadsheets were largely static and not  necessarily used to their full  potential. He wanted to help people get  more out of their use of  spreadsheets. As a result, we now have  Smartsheets which is a cloud  based platform that can be accessed by all  employees of the company no  matter where they are with live  information about project statuses,  meeting times and work that is  assigned to each employee just to name a  few uses. Users can choose  their way of viewing this information with  different views such as  calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt  view.\n\nThe  idea is that by  enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous  information  available to all members of a team about the status of a  project, the  tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous  communication  will be needed which allows employees to spend more time  doing what  they\u2019re hired to do \u2013 get work done. Think about how  wasteful it is to  hire a highly talented engineer but then make him  spend half his day  preparing for and doing status update meetings and  hunting people down  to see where they\u2019re at with their assignments.  What if all this  information was available for him, his managers, and  his staff to see  within Smartsheet without having to bother each other  and waste precious  work hours that could be used for coding, designing,  and producing?  That\u2019s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.\n\nFor   Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I  mentioned  earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company.  Whenever you  see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my  opinion that\u2019s a  very good thing. With a subscription business model,  the revenue is  going to be recurring every year and that type of  reliability (combined  with growth of course) is something you want as  an investor.\n\nSmartsheet\u2019s  primary  source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their  cloud-based  Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and  potential  customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform  by either  signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the   Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to   Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses   Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets   their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.\n\nSmartsheet   offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and   Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided.   Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration   and automation to third-party applications.\n\nThe   Connectors part of the business is something I find really  interesting.  Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top  work  productivity and communication software companies in the world to  allow  their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet  user  interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true \u201ccommand  center\u201d  platform while the products of the other companies become  ancillary  pieces. You\u2019ll see this on the link above but some products  that  Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud,  Microsoft  Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype  just to name a  few.\n\nI think that  being able to  sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the  Smartsheet user  experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot  of these  companies that people may perceive as \u201cSmartsheet  competitors\u201d actually  become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can  be sold by Smartsheet  as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral  angle that Smartsheet is  able to come from by selling Connectors to  their perceived \u201ccompetitors\u201d  reminds me a little bit of how Roku  (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off  of selling a Netflix subscription on  their platform. I think just the  fact that all these big companies  like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc.  allow their products to be  integrated into Smartsheet shows that there  is a high value proposition  in the Smartsheet platform and that they  would risk alienating their  customers if they didn\u2019t allow for their  products to be integrated with  Smartsheet.\n\nOn  top of the  Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to  sell,  Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal   plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can   sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired   10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource   allocation and planning. The name \u201c10,000ft\u201d is meant to be analogous to   having a high level view of your company and all resources available   within your company and how to deploy them.\n\nAlso,   in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which  provides  a centralized platform to organize, discover, control,  distribute, and  measure all forms of digital content. Combining  Brandfolder capabilities  with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic  solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration. This  goes back to what I  said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend  had mentioned that  her company\u2019s marketing team was \u201creally excited  about Smartsheet  because it makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.\u201d She told me  that before Smartsheet, her company\u2019s marketing  team had to constantly  hunt down members of the creative team  (photographers, graphic  designers) to receive the latest photos,  videos, and digital designs  they were working on. She said it was a big  pain for them trying to  share this content over email and SharePoint.  Now, all of the content is  inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team  can access it at any time.  They can leave comments on the content,  route to appropriate individuals  for approvals, and have better insight  into the status of all digital  content that is being worked on. The  acquisition of Brandfolder is  really what allows Smartsheet to stand  out in this department.\n\nNobody   really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days   for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out   quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a   light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary   plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet\u2019s   FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief   Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B   for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing   department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All   kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content  that  effects the company\u2019s brand. Sales is running social media  campaigns,  product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts,  and R&amp;D is  teasing new product experiences in app. It can get  really difficult for  the company\u2019s Marketing/Branding team to stay on  top of all this  without a centralized digital content collaboration  platform like  Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I  think  Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.\n\nAs   you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their  core  CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal  upgrades  available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that,  Smartsheet  also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that  empowers  users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that  streamline  business and simplify collaboration. There are so many  instances within  companies where an app needs to be built to streamline  a workflow.  Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT  departments and the  coders that sit within these departments to build  these apps. This  places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes  away time they can be  spending on more complex/mission critical  projects. Mark Mader is aware  of this and thus is heavily pushing  no-code as a solution for companies  now and in the future. He believes  that everyday non-coder employees  know their jobs/workflows best and  thus if you empower them to build  their own apps with a no-code  platform they will produce better and more  relevant apps to help get  work done than an IT department employee who  doesn\u2019t even do the job  that the app is being built for. Also, he  believes this will reduce  strain on IT departments and allow them to  focus on more complex and  mission critical projects.\n\nHere   is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet   customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): \u201cI have been waiting for a solution like   WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we  need,  when and where we need it,\u201d said Hina Patel, Director of Sales   Operations at Cisco. \u201cThe ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along   with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive   app will make it even easier to drive active participation from  everyone  involved in the process, no matter their role.\u201d As you can  see, the  value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform  appears to be  high.\n\nLastly,  Smartsheet also  generates revenue from Professional Services which is  essentially  providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet  customers  that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the  most recent  quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2%  of revenue.  Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:\n\nSubscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue\n\nProfessional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue\n\nThis   is the end of my first article about Smartsheet. My goal is to drop   Part 2 within the next week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth   answer of the question \u2013 \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d\n\n**TL:DR**\n\n* This is Part 1 of my two part deep dive on Smartsheet (Ticker: SMAR).\n* This first part introduces you to (1) me, (2) the company, (3) my thesis on the company, and (4) digs into how they make money.\n* Part  2 (to be released later this week) will go in depth to explore the  question \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d\n* Smartsheet is an exciting SaaS company that\u2019s helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people\n* I   am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These  are  just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.\n\n**Disclosure:**   I have no position in Smartsheet. I do plan to initiate a long  position  when the markets open again in 2021.  I wrote this article  myself, and  it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving  compensation for it. I  have no business relationship with any company  whose stock is mentioned  in this article.",

        "selftext": "**Industry Overview**\n\nFinancial institutions are known for their lackluster online/digital experience. Many processes inside of these companies are done manually with paper and can take weeks to process and receive approval. Financial institutions are one of the most risk-averse sets of customers.\n\nBanks and other financial institutions will always be around. Although these companies may look different from today, this industry will always be around. That\u2019s why Buffett invests in banks. As cloud software and the regulatory burden becomes more expensive and time-consuming, financial institutions are looking to improve their processes to be more efficient and please customers.\n\nSimple processes can drag on for weeks in financial institutions. Cloud software, nCino, and nCino\u2019s competitors are helping solve this problem. nCino aims to change these manual processes and make financial institutions more nimble while still being compliant with all regulations.\n\nAccording to Gartner, banking had the highest global enterprise IT spending of all industries with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. Although nCino only defines its serviceable addressable market at $10bn, the broader IT industry gives nCino a long runway of future potential growth.\n\nnCino has a number of competitors. My initial research shows that nCino competes with Fiserv, Oracle, and other small companies. In order to invest in nCino, a deeper look into the competitive environment will need to be completed.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nnCino was founded in 2012 by a team of bankers. These founders built a software company solving problems for banks. The founders knew the struggles that often occur inside banks and used their knowledge to solve these problems. nCino is a bank operating system platform. It helps provide banks onboard, originate loans, open accounts, and many other processes. The CEO stated in an interview that \u201che wants the software to do everything from operations, ranging from treasury management to mortgages (coming soon), to tracking employees\u2019 efficiency.\u201d nCino already has relationships with over 305 financial institutions that use the nCino bank operating system, which is their main platform, and then nCino has another 920 financial institutions that use the portfolio analytics solution tool that was acquired in the acquisition of Visible Equity.\n\nnCino has already signed some of the largest financial institutions in the world. nCino boasts Bank of America, Barclays, TD Bank, and many regional community banks, credit unions, and challenger banks as customers.\n\nnCino sells its software on a per-seat basis. This gives it room to continue to expand within its existing customer base. nCino also stands to benefit from capturing more financial institutional clients and expanding their average contract value.  \\`\n\nHere is a list of nCino\u2019s offerings: loan origination, portfolio analytics, compliance and risk management, digital customer engagement, customer relationship management (CRM), client onboarding, deposit account opening, business process automation, and enterprise content management.\n\n**Total Addressable Market**\n\nnCino\u2019s S-1 touts that there are more than 28,000 financial institutions worldwide. Gartner also lists banking as the industry with the highest global enterprise IT spending with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. The financial industry is one of the largest industries and if nCino can help power even a sliver of this industry, it will be a good future for this company. Of course, I have to caveat this by saying that starting a t-shirt business and capturing 1% of the apparel industry may seem plausible, but it is impossible. I make this statement because nCino already has a strong base of customers and has done the work to capture this pie. This gives it the possibility to capture more market share, not all of it, but more.\n\nThe bull thesis for nCino is to be the main software operating system for banks. As banks become more reliant on technology, nCino will prove to be a critical piece of infrastructure. nCino will also develop more product offerings that help their customers. This enhances the stickiness of nCino and leads to upsell opportunities.\n\nnCino\u2019s management team lists the total serviceable market for nCino\u2019s bank operating system at more than $10bn. I believe this is within reason and management is likely underestimating (on purpose or not) the addressable market they believe they can capture.\n\n**Competitive Advantages**\n\nAlthough I like to be optimistic about companies when researching them, I do think nCino is quite an attractive company based on my research on the qualitative aspects of the business.\n\n* **Mission-critical product with high switching costs.**\n   * The solutions that nCino provides are for mission-critical processes that banks want to be done right. Financial institutions would rather have a manual time-consuming process than an automatic process that goes wrong. Switching costs come into play once customers are comfortable with nCino\u2019s product. As customers rely more and more on nCino, these customers are unlikely to switch.Switching from nCino (or any company) to a competitor may lead to outages, issues, and lots of problems that financial institutions will not risk having to deal with. Even if financial institutions attempt to build out their own bank operating system, it will be costly, prone to error, and not worth it! That\u2019s like trying to build out Stripe if you\u2019re an e-commerce company (@Shopify). Allocating capital to build out this function will make zero sense for financial institutions. It\u2019s better to stick to what you know and what you\u2019re good at. That\u2019s why nCino will have high switching costs.\n* **Economies of scale.**\n   * The cost of building out a suite of software products and deploying it to a large customer base is much cheaper for a large company than a small company. Just like no startup would try and compete directly with Amazon, Shopify, Salesforce, Stripe, etc, as nCino grows, no company will come close to competing in the same fashion due to their scale benefits.As nCino looks to expand its product offering, the attractiveness of nCino\u2019s products to financial institutions will only grow. Financial institutions, a very risk-averse set of customers, want products that have been vetted by other financial institutions and have offerings that solve critical problems.\n\n**Financials**\n\nLike many SaaS companies, nCino has two primary revenue lines. The first is recurring revenue similar to most SaaS companies. The second revenue source is professional services revenue. Subscription revenue accounts for the majority of revenue and gross profit.\n\n**January 2020:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$138mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$74mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$103mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = \\~60%\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~70%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -20%\n\n**January 2019:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$92mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$45mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$64mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = \\~69%\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~69%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -25%\n\n**January 2018:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$58mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$28mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$38mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = N/A\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~67%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -32%\n\nAlthough nCino is not profitable on a GAAP basis like many of its software peers, the attractiveness of the growth story is compelling. More research into unit economics may provide an even more compelling story.\n\n**What\u2019s Interesting**\n\nThe financial industry is a risk-averse industry and usually, one of the last industries to adapt to change. This is changing with the increasing adoption of technology and software. The innovation occurring in FinTech and in financial institutions is growing. If nCino can be one of the main companies to be the operating system for banks (just like Microsoft/Salesforce is to most companies) then nCino may be an attractive investment opportunity.\n\nSalesforce also owns a large portion of nCino. nCino relies on the \u201cSalesforce Platform.\u201d Also, this may initially seem like a concern, Salesforce also owns 11.6% of nCino. It wouldn\u2019t make much sense for Salesforce to stop nCino from using the Salesforce Platform if they own such a material stake in the company.\n\nSome of the hedge funds that I follow ([Link](https://twitter.com/StratusYoung/status/1327453755583893505)) have positions in nCino which is what initially attracted me to this business. Hedge funds like Dragoneer, Tiger Global, and Durable Capital have a position in nCino. Sure these positions may just be small positions to take advantage of the tech IPO pop, but future quarters will show if this is a long-term position for these funds.\n\n**Future Questions**\n\n* **Competition**\n   * In order to be more confident in nCino, I\u2019d have to know more about the banking industry and the various competitors and similar nCino product offerings. Through my research, I found some competitors, but little to no information on these companies because they are private or are just not in the typical VC crowd.I also am not sure how hard it would be for Salesforce, Microsoft, or another well-funded company to try and launch similar product offerings to nCino. It seems from first glance that nCino has a strong suite of products, but not sure if this is something they\u2019ve built over time or is from the founders\u2019 background in banking. I doubt Salesforce would try and compete directly with nCino but may form some type of ongoing partnership.\n* **Ownership**\n   * I like to see management teams with large ownership stakes in the businesses they run. With nCino, I don\u2019t see a large ownership stake. Although there were a number of founders and thus each founder has a small stake in nCino, the largest positions by far are owned by Insight Partners, Salesforce, and Wellington. I will need to do more research on digging into the ownership structure and see whether or not management is being incentivized alongside public investors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI think nCino is a strong company and in my opinion, it\u2019s one of the more attractive investment opportunities from the companies I\u2019ve outlined in the past. The financial industry is huge and if nCino can continue to innovate, build products, upsell existing customers, and sign contracts with new customers, I think nCino may be a stock that people will be talking about in 3-5 years.\n\nIt\u2019s had very strong growth thus far and likely will continue. Of course, the valuation is a key point with some concerns over the high multiple, but relative to similar high growth/high margin comparable companies, nCino fits into this bucket.",

        "selftext": "In this post I will be looking at major option purchases from 12/23 - 12/31. The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.\n\nThe criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.\n\nThe Columns to pay attention too:\n\n* EXP: Expiration of the contracts\n* Strike: Strike Price where the contract can be bought if it is exercised\n* Option Price: How much premium paid per contract\n* Premium Paid: Total amount spent (option price x quantity)\n\n# Call Flow\n\n*Processing img asn0bkz3de961...*\n\nTo start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.\n\n# Put Flow\n\n*Processing img ncsrdwq6de961...*\n\nSome worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS',  'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.\n\n# Target Flow\n\nThe targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the \"Targeted Flow\" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 040n3avbde961...*\n\nOnce again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.\n\nJust for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium.... CRAZY\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img bke25acede961...*",

This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper.

        "selftext": "I currently have just under $56k in an individual account, which I control.  It\u2019s comprised of Amazon, Apple, Salesforce, Tesla, PayPal, and Facebook.  The vast majority of it is Amazon, where I have 9 shares.  For months I\u2019ve been planning on trimming that position, but since the stock hasn\u2019t been able to hold any relevant gains since June, I\u2019ve been stuck waiting.  Assuming that it increases significantly after Q4 reporting, I plan on trimming 4-5 shares, and using that money to start new positions.  I feel like it is a good time (maybe slightly late to the party) to add small caps to my portfolio.  Since I\u2019m not as literate in small cap stocks as I am large cap stocks, I think that I\u2019m going to go the ETF route.  I have been looking into VTWO and IWM.  Does anyone have any input on these ETF\u2019s?  Any other recommendations?  Thanks!",

        "selftext": "As a close to the new year, I'm looking to reallocate my portfolio as I'm pretty sure that I've conducted the absolute worst model I could have during this bull run. High level, I have around 70 individual stocks that have netted me $37k or 60% gains over the last 3 years....most of which has come in the last 18 months or so.\n\nI'm 29, and looking at my portfolio, I've realized that I've basically nuked the potential gains I could have made over the last several years by essentially creating my own index fund. All in all, I'm sitting on almost $200k in investment funds BUT I'm incredibly risk averse - and for years never bought more than $200-$500 of a single stock, followed by a more recent increase to $1k-$2k at entry.\n\nBecause of this highly risk-averse method of investing, I've invested around $62k in stocks, $32k in actual ETFs (vanguard funds + ARK funds), and have an additional \\~$50k in liquid cash. My total equity value right now is about $200k.\n\nLooking at a few of my picks, I've realized that I basically screwed the pooch trying to be too safe, and would encourage any new investors to not take this approach. Several of my investments (AMZN 4 shares with 87% gain, NIO 94 shares with 257% gain, SQ 22 shares with 310%  gain, CELH 100 shares with 164% gain, BILI 20 shares with 523% gain, PLUG 35 shares with 890% gain, TUP 40 shares with 697% gains, and PINS 30 shares with 105% gains for example) made me mere pennies compared to the value that I could have made by only holding a select amount of tickers and honestly, I may have missed my chance to ride the bull wave to hundreds of thousands (but there is still opportunity for decent gains). As an example, I put $150 into that 890% gain on Plug. $230 on that BILI play. Idiot man. Idiot.\n\nThe reason that I've come to you fine folks, is for some insight into consolidation and which tickers you would recommend taking gains/losses on and putting the dollars to work in a smaller pool of stocks for a much larger piece of the pie. The problem I'm running into, is that so many are solid tickers with good % gains as you'll see...making the decisions really tough. Basically everything is up, and many are blue chip stocks. Any help is appreciated.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, core cannabis revenues totaled $30.5 million, a 168% increase compared with $11.4 million for the first nine months of 2019;\n* Gross profit from the core cannabis business increased 221% to $8.7 million for Q3 compared with $2.7 million for the same period in 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, gross profit from the core cannabis business totaled $19.7 million, a 159% increase from $7.6 million for the first nine months of 2019;\n* EBITDA for Q3 was $4.4 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $733,000 for the same period in 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, EBITDA totaled $8.6 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $1.3 million for the first nine months of 2019;\n* The foregoing 2019 revenues, gross profit and EBITDA information have been adjusted, for comparative purposes, to remove the impact from the one-time sales of hemp seeds during the same periods in 2019; and\n* The Company continues to take steps to improve financial flexibility and improve liquidity through debt restructuring activities.\n\nJon Levine, CFO of MariMed, added \u201cDuring the quarter, we improved our balance sheet and financial flexibility by converting short-term, high interest rate debt to longer-term debt on much more attractive terms. We appreciate our lenders\u2019 and investors\u2019 continued support and believe this result reflects both the recognition of our progress to date, and shared confidence in our business strategy.\u201d\n\n**Where The Company is Headed:**\n\n* Extend geographic reach through direct ownership of cannabis licenses and related seed-to-sale operations in US and internationally.\n* Expand presence in new hemp-derived CBD market with premium materials and products.\n* Enhance Marketing and customer education of products, benefits and changing modalities.\n* Continue to provide best in class development, management and operational advisory to approved facilities nationwide.\n* Enter ancillary services at the top and bottom of supply chains, including seeds, branded products and e-commerce retail. \n* Advance field of research to legitimize and strengthen our go-to-market reach.\n\n**Technical Analysis:** \n\nI am not good with technical analysis. I am a big fan of Petedoom on twitter and his analysis. I have linked it below: \n\n[https://twitter.com/petedoom/status/1343565915103879168?s=20](https://twitter.com/petedoom/status/1343565915103879168?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/petedoom/status/1343891292141596679?s=20](https://twitter.com/petedoom/status/1343891292141596679?s=20)\n\n**Why I Like It:** \n\nMariMed in my opinion seems heavily undervalued. The company has increased revnues by 220% from Q3 2019 and increased gross profits by 221%. The company has a vast majority of partnerships which seem to bolster MariMed's profitability. The company has a vast array of products with good brands, CRM technology, education and research to support it. \n\nLastly, the marijuana legalization bill passed in the house recently. Despite the Senate vote being unlikely, under a Biden administration Cannabis should head up. \n\nLook in Mexico what's happening: \n\n[https://twitter.com/tomangell/status/1345075802405281792?s=20](https://twitter.com/tomangell/status/1345075802405281792?s=20)\n\nUSA: \n\n[https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3884](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3884)\n\nCanada: \n\nLook at similar Canadian plays! \n\nAll in all, with everything MariMed has to offer the company is currently valued at 47 cents? Seems heavily undervalued to me. I believe that if cannabis plays heat up, this most certainly could be one to heat up too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope you guys enjoyed!

I trust Ackman won\u2019t fail his investors considering they raised just a few billion for this man\u2019s unicorn acquisition. \n\nGIK - underrated EV merger. ELightning. CFO said: We have more than $800M of potential business in the pipeline as of the end of Sep.Also, as of Sep 2nd, the second strength comes from a backlog of contracted purchase orders of 150M. That effectively means all of 2021 is contracted &amp; close to a third of 2022 is as well. Solid imo. \n\nBB - You have a possible wave forming in the likes of hundreds of thousands of collective confirmation biased traders &amp; their urge to beat the market &amp; any short sellers that come after them. You can add GME &amp; AMC to this meme stock-ish list. This is not the most ideal path for someone who searches for value but like... squeeze + collective Reddit hedge fund + money making machine = fun time \n\nF, GM - Electric upside is big. Definitely a great 2021-2022 coming for these guys\n\nEXPC - this one is a coin flip. If you think helicopter travel to skip traffic as a public transport opportunity will become a market, this is for you. We\u2019re talking direct flights over the city to save you an hour in downtown Los Angeles when things calm down in like a year... two years... whenever. ARK is buying too. \n\nEXPR - Will Meade likes them. Sets PT at $10. Maybe just keep this on your radar for run potential. \n\nCRM - it\u2019s time for a come back. Chart signals this + Goldman put a new $315 PT. \n\nAAPL - I know, Apple is already on everyone\u2019s radar blah blah. I\u2019m saying this is finally the breakout from the range it was trading at for 4 months :] earnings next Wednesday. It\u2019ll be a fun time. It\u2019s going to fly high. Post holiday. \n\nBFT - don\u2019t ask me why, I just know it\u2019s going to be at least double it\u2019s current value very soon. Mergingggg. Steve Grasso about it too. Dude is a Wall Street Vet and he's putting his cred on the line. \n\n*RENEWABLES* - ICLN, SPWR, NEE, ENPH, REGI, FSLR. (My personal favorite and the one I have traded recently has been SPWR along with shares since March, path still clear, up from 07 highs). \n\nSolid airlines: (DAL, LUV) - LEAPS... that\u2019s all I gotta say. \n\nARKX - whenever that is public it\u2019s going to explode but you knew that. \n\nI know this wasn\u2019t some incredible revelation but I hope you enjoy this list of tickers with some upside.",

        "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI have been lurking on here for quite some time now and, going into 2021, I figured I'd start a thread to ask some of my questions for 2021. Maybe I will see them answered, or read suggestions / find inspiration.\n\nI started investing about three months ago and am currently invested in Vanguard All World, SAP (buying after the dip has worked out well), ICLN, Nvidia, AMD. I intend to hold all of them long-term with a hopeful profit of over 5%. Nvidia has a bit more room to grow, I hope, given their sales numbers, different tech and ARM acqusition, and I am also hoping for incredible sales numbers of AMD. \n\n I also hold GME because I am an absolute sheep idiot who bought into the hype high; I will probably sell low but am waiting for Jan 11. In the next few days, I want to buy a bit of Microsoft for 2021. Overall, I am looking for a relatively \"safe\" return of at least 5 - 10%, ideally a bit more of course. All my stock choices, however, are very tech-oriented. That is because it's the field in which I know most about the companies and their numbers, and also because they've been running well.\n\nHowever, I am very new and none of this of course means that these companies will run well in 2021. If we start seeing a return to normalcy in mid 2021, what are stocks that really benefit from that return to \"normalcy\"? I figured Salesforce could be an option because of its dip and them also probably benefiting from overall economic upturn, just like SAP. But that, again, would be tech. I read JPM and on this subreddit a lot, what would be the reasoning here? People are also mentioning Disney: is that because of Disney+ or because of reopening theme parks? \n\nSo, as you can see, I am open for suggestions. It'd be cool if you could help me out a bit! Thank you in advance. \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot invest in ARK ETFs, as none of my three European brokers offer these funds, and I am not willing to open a fourth broker account.",

        "selftext": "#1) Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ)\n\nThe Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.\n\nThe top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds. Many of these companies are valued at high multiples due to their growth potential. This is not financial advice; invest at your own risk.",

        "selftext": "I currently have just under $56k in an individual account, which I control.  It\u2019s comprised of Amazon, Apple, Salesforce, Tesla, PayPal, and Facebook.  The vast majority of it is Amazon, where I have 9 shares.  For months I\u2019ve been planning on trimming that position, but since the stock hasn\u2019t been able to hold any relevant gains since June, I\u2019ve been stuck waiting.  Assuming that it increases significantly after Q4 reporting, I plan on trimming 4-5 shares, and using that money to start new positions.  I feel like it is a good time (maybe slightly late to the party) to add small caps to my portfolio.  Since I\u2019m not as literate in small cap stocks as I am large cap stocks, I think that I\u2019m going to go the ETF route.  I have been looking into VTWO and IWM.

        "selftext": "In this post I will be looking at major option purchases from 12/23 - 12/31. The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.\n\nThe criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.\n\n# Call Flow\n\n*Processing img f4akm6czhd961...*\n\nTo start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.\n\n# Put Flow\n\n*Processing img t69x1ji4id961...*\n\nSome worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS', 'SKT', 'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.\n\n# Targeted Flow\n\nThe targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the \"Targeted Flow\" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.\n\n*Processing img 9lb67slcid961...*\n\nOnce again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information.  One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above).  Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out.  Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium.... CRAZY\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img j5cr8qxtid961...*",

Let\u2019s dive in.\n\n**Can we 10X from here?**\n\nFor someone like me that is on the younger side and with a longer investment time horizon, and probably you if you are reading this, an important question to ask yourself is \u201cDo I think this investment could 10x from here?\u201d. In other words, could this investment one day be 10 times what it is worth today? To try to answer this question, I will work through a pre-determined framework that I believe gives us the best path to find out.\n\nThe framework includes:\n\nLeadership \u2013 Desire, Purpose and Ownership\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nPrice Considerations\n\nExplosive Business Growth\n\n**1. Leadership \u2013 Desire, Purpose, Ownership**\n\nFor a company to do something as spectacular as 10x, we are going to need to see really strong and talented leadership. In Chris Mayer\u2019s excellent book \u201c100 Baggers\u201d, he dedicates a part of the book to talk about the importance of what he calls \u201cOwner Operators\u201d. By this he means that the CEO of the company owns a substantial amount of stock in the company themselves. Why is this important? If the CEO has their own personal wealth at stake in the company\u2019s stock (just like we do as shareholders) their interests are more aligned with shareholders and maximizing returns for shareholders than they would be if that CEO had no skin in the game. It\u2019s also better in my opinion if the CEO of the company was also the founder of the company. For these founder-CEO\u2019s that have money invested in their own company, it really is like their baby. Would you rather have your money invested with someone who views the company as their baby or with someone who was just hired to watch this kid (the company)?\n\nIn the case of Smartsheet, we check all the boxes when it comes to leadership. Mark Mader is not only an Owner Operator, he is also a co-founder. I touched on this a little bit in part 1, but Mark co-founded Smartsheet along with Brent Frei in 2005. They both played football (American football) for Dartmouth College, an Ivy League School. They met in the fall of 1988 when Mark was a freshman on the team and Brent, who had graduated the prior year, was serving as a Graduate Assistant for the team.\n\nAfter that season, Brent moved on to begin a career in computer engineering. Mark quit the football team after 1 year. In an interview with Forbes, he said that after his freshman season he thought it was too much to juggle Ivy League academics and being a NCAA Division 1 athlete. Mark started focusing solely on academics until a tragedy struck. One of his best friends from his high school football team got into an accident and was critically injured. His friend would never be able to play football again. This had a profound impact on Mark. He said in the interview that knowing one of his friends would never be able to play again made him realize that if he still has the ability to play football, he needs to go do it. He went to his old coach, told him the story about his friend and asked for his spot on the team back. The coach accepted and Mark went on to finish his career in the fall of 1991 as a 6\u20194\u201d, 245lb offensive lineman.\n\nMark said that this experience with his friend and re-joining the football team taught him not to take anything for granted. He said ever since then he tries to do his best with everything and make the most out of every opportunity. That mindset has served him well as he now sits as a CEO of a $8.5 billion company. But he\u2019s really just getting started. That mindset lives on today. The day that he took Smartsheet public, April 27, 2018, he was asked if he plans on celebrating the achievement, he said \u201cWe have 74,000 customers that don\u2019t want us to party, they want us to work on the product.\u201d How did Mark get to the point where he was CEO of a tech company with 74,000 customers that raised $150 million during their IPO? I\u2019ll share with you a little more history behind the company.\n\nAfter Brent Frei left Dartmouth, he started his career in computer engineering as I mentioned before. His career started with Motorola in 1989, then he went to Microsoft in 1991, and then he founded his first company, Onyx Software in 1994. It didn\u2019t take long before his buddy from college, Mark Mader, would come join him at the start-up. Mark joined in 1995 and eventually worked his way up to an Executive role within the firm.\n\nThe focus of Onyx was Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Brent was the CEO and Mark became the SVP of Global Services. Brent led the company through an IPO in 1999 right before the tech bubble burst. It was really unfortunate timing because a lot of their customers were dotcoms that went out of business. Brent was still able to lead them through stiff competition with Salesforce in the early 2000\u2019s until he hit a plateau in 2004. He decided to step down from the company he had founded 10 years earlier. On his last call with investors, he was quoted as saying \u201cI believe it\u2019s the right time for me to turn over the reins to a new CEO who can take Onyx to new heights over the next decade,\u201d. All the while, Mark was there in the background learning and observing. He saw what went right \u2013 they built a large publicly traded company from scratch. And he saw what went wrong \u2013 their growth stalled as they lost market share to Salesforce.\n\nOnly a year after resigning from Onyx, Brent was on to his next big move and he again recruited his friend Mark to help. They were going to found Smartsheet, a company to help improve the way people work. This time, Mark was a Co-Founder along with Brent and had a much bigger influence on the company. His influence got even larger in 2017, 12 years after the founding, when Brent left to found his 3rd company, TerraClear. Brent left to go back to his roots in Idaho where he grew up on the family farm. His new start-up TerraClear seeks to solve one of the largest unsolved problems in farming today \u2013 clearing rocks from farming land. As crazy as that sounds, apparently it\u2019s a big issue. Hence the name, TerraClear. Brent is still on the Board of Directors of Smartsheet.\n\nGoing back to the IPO date (April 27, 2018), which was only 4 months after Brent had left, Mark was asked by the press what he had learned from being at Onyx when they went public. Mark was very clear in his response and said that one of the main lessons from Onyx was to \u201cnot get too enamored with your product\u201d. With Smartsheet, he wants to make sure they\u2019re always improving the product and the user experience. He also said that investors don\u2019t buy a stock based on what you\u2019ve done in the past, but what you plan to do. \u201cIf you are always looking at the rear view mirror, then you are not running the business\u201d he said. This is exactly how I want the leaders of companies I invest in to be thinking. He is very forward thinking, customer focused, and humble. There is a lot of evidence to corroborate that he has followed through on the statements he made that day.\n\nOne of the first pieces of evidence I found that supports my thesis of Mark being very focused on the product and user experience is the incredible ratings that the product has received from its customers. I use a tool called Net Promoter Score (NPS) which is one of the most reliable and unbiased ways to find out what a customers true experience with a business is and how likely they would be to recommend it to a friend. For Smartsheet, their NPS is extremely high. It\u2019s on a scale of -100 to 100 so anything above 0 is considered to be good. If the rating is above 0, it essentially more people would recommend the product to a friend than they would tell them not to use it. Smartsheet has an NPS of 80, which is honestly one of the highest I have ever seen.\n\nFurther evidence to support Mark and the rest of management\u2019s commitment to product quality and user experience is the exceptional ratings the product has on the Apple App Store. This is just for the mobile version of the product, the app that you can download on your phone just like you would download the mobile version of Outlook. The rating in the App Store is 4.8/5. That\u2019s very impressive as well.\n\nBased on how customers are responding to the product, I think it\u2019s fair to say that Mark was not [B.S.ing](https://b.s.ing/) his way through that interview on IPO day. He and his management team really have been focused on creating a stellar product and the results are showing. When I say that \u201cDesire and Purpose\u201d are important traits of a leader of a company it means that I want to see a leader who has a real desire to do what he/she is doing as the CEO of the company, believes in their product(s) and services, and has a real purpose for why they want to do that. I can tell that Mark is committed to the mission of improving the way people work. Being one of the founders, and having written an E-Book on the \u201cProductivity Paradox\u201d that I mentioned in Part 1, I think this mission is very near and dear to his heart and that he has a desire to see the impact and scale of his company grow well into the future. As shareholders, that\u2019s what we want.\n\nAnother way to see if the leader of the company has \u201cDesire and Purpose\u201d is to see how his/her employees perceive them. Do the employees look up to this person? Do they feel motivated to work hard because they know what they\u2019re doing is meaningful and can make a positive difference in people\u2019s lives? One way I have of gaining insight into this is to look at the company\u2019s Glassdoor ratings and specifically the rating of the CEO. In the case of Smartsheet, the positive story continues. The company has a 4.1/5 rating on Glassdoor and Mark has a 90% approval rate from his employees which is well above average. To me this shows he\u2019s communicating the company\u2019s purpose to the employees very well and is motivating them to actualize that purpose.\n\nThere\u2019s one other piece of evidence I stumbled upon that gives good insight into the culture that Mark and his management team are building at Smartsheet. They were recently (12/17/20) awarded \u201cBest Company Culture\u201d and \u201cBest Companies for Women\u201d by Comparably. Below you can see a screenshot of the headline from a Business Wire article about this. It\u2019s one thing to be awarded for \u201cBest Company Culture\u201d but to also be a \u201cBest Companies for Women\u201d when you\u2019re in a heavily male dominated industry such as computer software, that really says something. It speaks to the culture of diversity and inclusiveness that Mark is building there which goes a long way in the year 2021 when social issues are at the forefront of people\u2019s minds more than ever. The modern enterprise has to build a culture of diversity and inclusiveness if they want to retain the most talented employees and keep them motivated. Smartsheet is doing a good job of this.\n\nSource \u2013 Smartsheet making headlines for their outstanding company culture.\n\nI think we\u2019ve found a lot of evidence to support that this leadership team has a strong desire to fulfil their purpose. It\u2019s evident that they want to help improve the way people work and that they\u2019ve invested heavily into making this happen while keeping employees motivated and focused on the goal. The last piece I look at for leadership is ownership. Does the CEO have a personal financial stake in the company? This is such a key thing to look for because as I mentioned earlier in the article, if leadership themselves owns a substantial amount of shares, then their interests and motivations will align with us, the shareholders. They essentially are a shareholder too, just like us. On top of the desire and purpose that we\u2019ve established is present, there\u2019s also a financial incentive for Mark and the team to lead the company to success, and ultimately, a higher share price.\n\nCurrently, Mark holds 490,267 shares which comes out to a value of $34 million as of this writing (1/14/21). I\u2019d consider that substantial for an individual person. Even more noteworthy is that Brent owns 3.2 million shares which comes out to a value of $218 million. Brent owns that much of the company still and he\u2019s not even involved beyond being on the Board of Directors. I think that\u2019s a testament to how much confidence he has in Mark to lead Smartsheet to new heights. Also, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that he left Smartsheet to help with his family business. He saw his 80 year old Dad picking up rocks on the farm with his bare hands and realized he wanted to help solve this problem in the farming industry. Leaving Smartsheet was not like when he left Onyx because the business was plateauing. As a matter of fact, Smartsheet was rapidly growing at that time and was about to go public. The fact that he still has $218 million worth of shares in the company shows he still believes in the company and what Mark can do with it now and in the future.\n\nThis concludes Part 2 of my Smartsheet deep dive.

        "selftext": "**TL:DR is at the bottom**\n\nHello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.\n\nMy name\u2019s Mark and I\u2019m an accountant with a passion for investing. About two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market today.\n\nI\u2019m a long-term investor. I am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time. I\u2019m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. If you want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the book \u201c100 Baggers\u201d by Chris Mayer.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI\u2019m excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month, Smartsheet. I\u2019m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock screeners with different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth), scan Twitter, talk to professionals in different industries, and try to observe what products or services are getting popular with my friends and family. One of the best investment decisions I\u2019ve made to date came after I talked to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf course. Shout out to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said, you never know where your next good investment idea is going to come from.\n\nIn the case of Smartsheet, I became aware of the company through a stock screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B), strong revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it\u2019s a subscription business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts, it cued me to take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet, the more I liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and that really struck a chord with me. In different roles I\u2019ve had as a teacher, tutor, and supervisor, I\u2019ve always found empowering people to be one of the most important keys to success. I will touch on this more later in the write up.\n\nAnother positive signal I got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I was sitting in the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was watching an interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of Smartsheet. My girlfriend overheard the word \u201cSmartsheet\u201d mentioned in the video and said \u201cAre they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue check mark?\u201d. I had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were thinking about the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it. She said \u201cMy company just transitioned all of our work onto Smartsheet. I really love it. Our marketing department is really excited about it because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d Hearing this just motivated me to learn more about Smartsheet.\n\n**The Thesis Statement**\n\nFor every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement that can serve as a reminder for why I\u2019m buying and holding that stock for the long term. I\u2019ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during times when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why you\u2019re holding this position.\n\nThe thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:\n\n*\u201cSmartsheet: A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the global workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work, managers and executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally consolidate their teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that tool and is innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the most out of their teams.\u201d*\n\nI think this thesis statement really captures the essence of what Smartsheet does. If you go to Smartsheet\u2019s website and look at the \u201cAbout\u201d page, you will find their \u201cAbout\u201d statement which says \u201cSmartsheet is the enterprise platform for dynamic work that aligns people and technology so your entire business can move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.\u201d Notice how their statement emphasizes helping businesses move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.\n\nIn my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the companies that were identified from the study in the order of their ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader in the space at 2nd place. Let\u2019s use our common sense for a second. At the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies on the list. Let\u2019s break them down 1 by 1:\n\n* Workfront was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront, you\u2019d have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn\u2019t be a pure play investment into the CWM space.\n* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)\n* Wrike is private\n* ServiceNow \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also, the company is already quite large ($106B market cap)\n* Asana is public but just IPO\u2019d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don\u2019t have much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company. Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment into the CWM space, they\u2019re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in several of Forrester\u2019s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you can invest in the best?\n* Monday.com is private\n* Microsoft \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.\n* Atlassian \u2013 This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple problems with them as an investment. 1) They\u2019re ranked way beneath Smartsheet. 2) They\u2019re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x (market cap already $58B).\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space and that they\u2019re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment in this space let\u2019s understand why this is important. Other than the obvious reason that we\u2019re in the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, why is this important?\n\nWell, let\u2019s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO, during the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th, 2020:\n\n\u201cLeaders are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work, work that is documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where priorities are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle times will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive the benefits from doing so.\u201d\n\nKey word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:\n\nAsynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc. \n\nSynchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc. \n\nAny communication that doesn\u2019t require a real-time response can be considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above. Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in 2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is called \u201cThe Power of Done\u201d. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent noticed through their own experience, and through different research studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This is a quote from their E-Book:\n\n\u201cAccording to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy, interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis, this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S. workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.\u201d\n\nThey mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets, there hadn\u2019t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork collaboration or task management. The fact that technology advances helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred to as the productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it and thus they founded Smartsheet.\n\n**How Smartsheet makes money**\n\nAt the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand how they make money. In Chris Mayers\u2019 excellent book, 100 Baggers, that I mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This isn\u2019t to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just because it has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a growth stock to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things I look at.\n\nBefore I talk about the revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little bit about the actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. Co-Founder/CEO Mark Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However, he realized that these spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full potential. He wanted to help people get more out of their use of spreadsheets. As a result, we now have Smartsheets which is a cloud based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no matter where they are with live information about project statuses, meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a few uses. Users can choose their way of viewing this information with different views such as calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt view. \n\nThe idea is that by enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information available to all members of a team about the status of a project, the tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous communication will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what they\u2019re hired to do \u2013 get work done. Think about how wasteful it is to hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down to see where they\u2019re at with their assignments. What if all this information was available for him, his managers, and his staff to see within Smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious work hours that could be used for coding, designing, and producing? That\u2019s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.\n\nFor Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I mentioned earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company. Whenever you see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that\u2019s a very good thing. With a subscription business model, the revenue is going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.\n\nSmartsheet\u2019s primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their cloud-based Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and potential customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform by either signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.\n\nSmartsheet offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided. Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration and automation to third-party applications.\n\nThe Connectors part of the business is something I find really interesting. Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet user interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true \u201ccommand center\u201d platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary pieces. You\u2019ll see this on the link above but some products that Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype just to name a few.\n\nI think that being able to sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the Smartsheet user experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot of these companies that people may perceive as \u201cSmartsheet competitors\u201d actually become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can be sold by Smartsheet as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral angle that Smartsheet is able to come from by selling Connectors to their perceived \u201ccompetitors\u201d reminds me a little bit of how Roku (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off of selling a Netflix subscription on their platform. I think just the fact that all these big companies like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc. allow their products to be integrated into Smartsheet shows that there is a high value proposition in the Smartsheet platform and that they would risk alienating their customers if they didn\u2019t allow for their products to be integrated with Smartsheet.\n\nOn top of the Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to sell, Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired 10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource allocation and planning. The name \u201c10,000ft\u201d is meant to be analogous to having a high level view of your company and all resources available within your company and how to deploy them. \n\nAlso, in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which provides a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and measure all forms of digital content. Combining Brandfolder capabilities with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage workflows around content and collaboration. This goes back to what I said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that her company\u2019s marketing team was \u201creally excited about Smartsheet because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d She told me that before Smartsheet, her company\u2019s marketing team had to constantly hunt down members of the creative team (photographers, graphic designers) to receive the latest photos, videos, and digital designs they were working on. She said it was a big pain for them trying to share this content over email and SharePoint. Now, all of the content is inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time. They can leave comments on the content, route to appropriate individuals for approvals, and have better insight into the status of all digital content that is being worked on. The acquisition of Brandfolder is really what allows Smartsheet to stand out in this department. \n\nNobody really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet\u2019s FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that effects the company\u2019s brand. Sales is running social media campaigns, product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts, and R&amp;D is teasing new product experiences in app. It can get really difficult for the company\u2019s Marketing/Branding team to stay on top of all this without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I think Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.\n\nAs you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal upgrades available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that, Smartsheet also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that empowers users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline business and simplify collaboration. There are so many instances within companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow. Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT departments and the coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. This places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes away time they can be spending on more complex/mission critical projects. Mark Mader is aware of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies now and in the future. He believes that everyday non-coder employees know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more relevant apps to help get work done than an IT department employee who doesn\u2019t even do the job that the app is being built for. Also, he believes this will reduce strain on IT departments and allow them to focus on more complex and mission critical projects.\n\nHere is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): \u201cI have been waiting for a solution like WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need, when and where we need it,\u201d said Hina Patel, Director of Sales Operations at Cisco. \u201cThe ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone involved in the process, no matter their role.\u201d As you can see, the value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform appears to be high.\n\nLastly, Smartsheet also generates revenue from Professional Services which is essentially providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet customers that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the most recent quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2% of revenue. Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:\n\nSubscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue\n\nProfessional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue\n\nThis is the end of my first article about Smartsheet. My goal is to drop Part 2 within the next week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth answer of the question \u2013 \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d\n\n  **TL:DR**\n\n* This is Part 1 of my two part deep dive on Smartsheet (Ticker: SMAR). \n* This first part introduces you to (1) me, (2) the company, (3) my thesis on the company, and (4) digs into how they make money.\n* Part 2 (to be released later this week) will go in depth to explore the question \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d If you enjoyed this article and want to make sure you catch Part 2, [subscribe here.](https://onthemarkpicks.com/subscribe-today/) \n* Smartsheet is an exciting SaaS company that\u2019s helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people\n* I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These are just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.\n\n**Disclosure:** I have no position in Smartsheet. I do plan to initiate a long position when the markets open again in 2021.  I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.",

        "selftext": "**Industry Overview**\n\nFinancial institutions are known for their lackluster online/digital experience. Many processes inside of these companies are done manually with paper and can take weeks to process and receive approval. Financial institutions are one of the most risk-averse sets of customers. \n\nBanks and other financial institutions will always be around. Although these companies may look different from today, this industry will always be around. That\u2019s why Buffett invests in banks. As cloud software and the regulatory burden becomes more expensive and time-consuming, financial institutions are looking to improve their processes to be more efficient and please customers. \n\nSimple processes can drag on for weeks in financial institutions. Cloud software, nCino, and nCino\u2019s competitors are helping solve this problem. nCino aims to change these manual processes and make financial institutions more nimble while still being compliant with all regulations. \n\nAccording to Gartner, banking had the highest global enterprise IT spending of all industries with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. Although nCino only defines its serviceable addressable market at $10bn, the broader IT industry gives nCino a long runway of future potential growth. \n\nnCino has a number of competitors. My initial research shows that nCino competes with Fiserv, Oracle, and other small companies. In order to invest in nCino, a deeper look into the competitive environment will need to be completed.  \n\n**Business Overview**\n\nnCino was founded in 2012 by a team of bankers. These founders built a software company solving problems for banks. The founders knew the struggles that often occur inside banks and used their knowledge to solve these problems. nCino is a bank operating system platform. It helps provide banks onboard, originate loans, open accounts, and many other processes. The CEO stated in an interview that \u201che wants the software to do everything from operations, ranging from treasury management to mortgages (coming soon), to tracking employees\u2019 efficiency.\u201d nCino already has relationships with over 305 financial institutions that use the nCino bank operating system, which is their main platform, and then nCino has another 920 financial institutions that use the portfolio analytics solution tool that was acquired in the acquisition of Visible Equity. \n\nnCino has already signed some of the largest financial institutions in the world. nCino boasts Bank of America, Barclays, TD Bank, and many regional community banks, credit unions, and challenger banks as customers. \n\nnCino sells its software on a per-seat basis. This gives it room to continue to expand within its existing customer base. nCino also stands to benefit from capturing more financial institutional clients and expanding their average contract value.\n\nHere is a list of nCino\u2019s offerings: loan origination, portfolio analytics, compliance and risk management, digital customer engagement, customer relationship management (CRM), client onboarding, deposit account opening, business process automation, and enterprise content management. \n\n**Total Addressable Market**\n\nnCino\u2019s S-1 touts that there are more than 28,000 financial institutions worldwide. Gartner also lists banking as the industry with the highest global enterprise IT spending with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. The financial industry is one of the largest industries and if nCino can help power even a sliver of this industry, it will be a good future for this company. Of course, I have to caveat this by saying that starting a t-shirt business and capturing 1% of the apparel industry may seem plausible, but it is impossible. I make this statement because nCino already has a strong base of customers and has done the work to capture this pie. This gives it the possibility to capture more market share, not all of it, but more. \n\nThe bull thesis for nCino is to be the main software operating system for banks. As banks become more reliant on technology, nCino will prove to be a critical piece of infrastructure. nCino will also develop more product offerings that help their customers. This enhances the stickiness of nCino and leads to upsell opportunities. \n\nnCino\u2019s management team lists the total serviceable market for nCino\u2019s bank operating system at more than $10bn. I believe this is within reason and management is likely underestimating (on purpose or not) the addressable market they believe they can capture. \n\n**Competitive Advantages**\n\nAlthough I like to be optimistic about companies when researching them, I do think nCino is quite an attractive company based on my research on the qualitative aspects of the business.\n\n* **Mission-critical product with high switching costs.**\n   * The solutions that nCino provides are for mission-critical processes that banks want to be done right. Financial institutions would rather have a manual time-consuming process than an automatic process that goes wrong. Switching costs come into play once customers are comfortable with nCino\u2019s product. As customers rely more and more on nCino, these customers are unlikely to switch. Switching from nCino (or any company) to a competitor may lead to outages, issues, and lots of problems that financial institutions will not risk having to deal with. Even if financial institutions attempt to build out their own bank operating system, it will be costly, prone to error, and not worth it! That\u2019s like trying to build out Stripe if you\u2019re an e-commerce company (@Shopify). Allocating capital to build out this function will make zero sense for financial institutions. It\u2019s better to stick to what you know and what you\u2019re good at. That\u2019s why nCino will have high switching costs.\n* **Economies of scale.**\n   * The cost of building out a suite of software products and deploying it to a large customer base is much cheaper for a large company than a small company. Just like no startup would try and compete directly with Amazon, Shopify, Salesforce, Stripe, etc, as nCino grows, no company will come close to competing in the same fashion due to their scale benefits.     As nCino looks to expand its product offering, the attractiveness of nCino\u2019s products to financial institutions will only grow. Financial institutions, a very risk-averse set of customers, want products that have been vetted by other financial institutions, and have offerings that solve critical problems.\n\n**Financials**\n\nLike many SaaS companies, nCino has two primary revenue lines. The first is recurring revenue similar to most SaaS companies. The second revenue source is professional services revenue.

More research into unit economics may provide an even more compelling story. \n\n**What\u2019s Interesting**\n\nThe financial industry is a risk-averse industry and usually, one of the last industries to adapt to change. This is changing with the increasing adoption of technology and software. The innovation occurring in FinTech and in financial institutions is growing. If nCino can be one of the main companies to be the operating system for banks (just like Microsoft/Salesforce is to most companies) then nCino may be an attractive investment opportunity. \n\nSalesforce also owns a large portion of nCino. nCino relies on the \u201cSalesforce Platform.\u201d Also, this may initially seem like a concern, Salesforce also owns 11.6% of nCino. It wouldn\u2019t make much sense for Salesforce to stop nCino from using the Salesforce Platform if they own such a material stake in the company. \n\nSome of the hedge funds that I follow have positions in nCino which is what initially attracted me to this business. Hedge funds like Dragoneer, Tiger Global, and Durable Capital have a position in nCino. Sure these positions may just be small positions to take advantage of the tech IPO pop, but future quarters will show if this is a long-term position for these funds. \n\n**Future Questions**\n\n* **Competition**\n   * In order to be more confident in nCino, I\u2019d have to know more about the banking industry and the various competitors and similar nCino product offerings. Through my research, I found some competitors, but little to no information on these companies because they are private or are just not in the typical VC crowd.  I also am not sure how hard it would be for Salesforce, Microsoft, or another well-funded company to try and launch similar product offerings to nCino. It seems from first glance that nCino has a strong suite of products, but not sure if this is something they\u2019ve built over time or is from the founders\u2019 background in banking. I doubt Salesforce would try and compete directly with nCino but may form some type of ongoing partnership.   \n* **Ownership**\n   * I like to see management teams with large ownership stakes in the businesses they run. With nCino, I don\u2019t see a large ownership stake. Although there were a number of founders and thus each founder has a small stake in nCino, the largest positions by far are owned by Insight Partners, Salesforce, and Wellington. I will need to do more research on digging into the ownership structure and see whether or not management is being incentivized alongside public investors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI think nCino is a strong company and in my opinion, it\u2019s one of the more attractive investment opportunities from the companies I\u2019ve outlined in the past. The financial industry is huge and if nCino can continue to innovate, build products, upsell existing customers, and sign contracts with new customers, I think nCino may be a stock that people will be talking about in 3-5 years. \n\nIt\u2019s had very strong growth thus far and likely will continue. Of course, the valuation is a key point with some concerns over the high multiple, but relative to similar high growth/high margin comparable companies, nCino fits into this bucket.",

        "selftext": "**TL:DR is at the bottom**\n\nHello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.\n\nMy name\u2019s Mark and I\u2019m an accountant with a passion for investing. About two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market today.\n\nI\u2019m a long-term investor. I am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time. I\u2019m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. If you want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the book \u201c100 Baggers\u201d by Chris Mayer.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI\u2019m excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month, Smartsheet. I\u2019m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock screeners with different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth), scan Twitter, talk to professionals in different industries, and try to observe what products or services are getting popular with my friends and family. One of the best investment decisions I\u2019ve made to date came after I talked to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf course. Shout out to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said, you never know where your next good investment idea is going to come from.\n\nIn the case of Smartsheet, I became aware of the company through a stock screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B), strong revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it\u2019s a subscription business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts, it cued me to take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet, the more I liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and that really struck a chord with me. In different roles I\u2019ve had as a teacher, tutor, and supervisor, I\u2019ve always found empowering people to be one of the most important keys to success. I will touch on this more later in the write up.\n\nAnother positive signal I got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I was sitting in the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was watching an interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of Smartsheet. My girlfriend overheard the word \u201cSmartsheet\u201d mentioned in the video and said \u201cAre they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue check mark?\u201d. I had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were thinking about the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it. She said \u201cMy company just transitioned all of our work onto Smartsheet. I really love it. Our marketing department is really excited about it because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d Hearing this just motivated me to learn more about Smartsheet.\n\n**The Thesis Statement**\n\nFor every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement that can serve as a reminder for why I\u2019m buying and holding that stock for the long term. I\u2019ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during times when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why you\u2019re holding this position.\n\nThe thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:\n\n*\u201cSmartsheet: A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the global workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work, managers and executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally consolidate their teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that tool and is innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the most out of their teams.\u201d*\n\nI think this thesis statement really captures the essence of what Smartsheet does. If you go to Smartsheet\u2019s website and look at the \u201cAbout\u201d page, you will find their \u201cAbout\u201d statement which says \u201cSmartsheet is the enterprise platform for dynamic work that aligns people and technology so your entire business can move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.\u201d Notice how their statement emphasizes helping businesses move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.\n\nIn my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the companies that were identified from the study in the order of their ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader in the space at 2nd place. Let\u2019s use our common sense for a second. At the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies on the list. Let\u2019s break them down 1 by 1:\n\n* Workfront was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront, you\u2019d have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn\u2019t be a pure play investment into the CWM space.\n* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)\n* Wrike is private\n* ServiceNow \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space. Also, the company is already quite large ($106B market cap)\n* Asana is public but just IPO\u2019d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don\u2019t have much data to track their performance as a publicly traded company. Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment into the CWM space, they\u2019re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in several of Forrester\u2019s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you can invest in the best?\n* Monday.com is private\n* Microsoft \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.\n* Atlassian \u2013 This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple problems with them as an investment. 1) They\u2019re ranked way beneath Smartsheet. 2) They\u2019re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x (market cap already $58B).\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space and that they\u2019re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment in this space let\u2019s understand why this is important. Other than the obvious reason that we\u2019re in the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, why is this important?\n\nWell, let\u2019s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO, during the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th, 2020:\n\n\u201cLeaders are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work, work that is documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where priorities are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle times will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive the benefits from doing so.\u201d\n\nKey word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:\n\nAsynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.\n\nSynchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.\n\nAny communication that doesn\u2019t require a real-time response can be considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above. Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in 2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is called \u201cThe Power of Done\u201d. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent noticed through their own experience, and through different research studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This is a quote from their E-Book:\n\n\u201cAccording to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy, interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis, this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S. workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.\u201d\n\nThey mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets, there hadn\u2019t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork collaboration or task management. The fact that technology advances helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred to as the productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it and thus they founded Smartsheet.\n\n**How Smartsheet makes money**\n\nAt the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand how they make money. In Chris Mayers\u2019 excellent book, 100 Baggers, that I mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This isn\u2019t to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just because it has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a growth stock to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things I look at.\n\nBefore I talk about the revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little bit about the actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. Co-Founder/CEO Mark Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However, he realized that these spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full potential. He wanted to help people get more out of their use of spreadsheets. As a result, we now have Smartsheets which is a cloud based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no matter where they are with live information about project statuses, meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a few uses. Users can choose their way of viewing this information with different views such as calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt view.\n\nThe idea is that by enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information available to all members of a team about the status of a project, the tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous communication will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what they\u2019re hired to do \u2013 get work done. Think about how wasteful it is to hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down to see where they\u2019re at with their assignments. What if all this information was available for him, his managers, and his staff to see within Smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious work hours that could be used for coding, designing, and producing? That\u2019s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.\n\nFor Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I mentioned earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company. Whenever you see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that\u2019s a very good thing. With a subscription business model, the revenue is going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.\n\nSmartsheet\u2019s primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their cloud-based Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and potential customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform by either signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses Smartsheet. For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.\n\nSmartsheet offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided. Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration and automation to third-party applications.\n\nThe Connectors part of the business is something I find really interesting. Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet user interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true \u201ccommand center\u201d platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary pieces. You\u2019ll see this on the link above but some products that Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype just to name a few.\n\nI think that being able to sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the Smartsheet user experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot of these companies that people may perceive as \u201cSmartsheet competitors\u201d actually become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can be sold by Smartsheet as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral angle that Smartsheet is able to come from by selling Connectors to their perceived \u201ccompetitors\u201d reminds me a little bit of how Roku (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off of selling a Netflix subscription on their platform. I think just the fact that all these big companies like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc. allow their products to be integrated into Smartsheet shows that there is a high value proposition in the Smartsheet platform and that they would risk alienating their customers if they didn\u2019t allow for their products to be integrated with Smartsheet.\n\nOn top of the Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to sell, Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired 10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource allocation and planning. The name \u201c10,000ft\u201d is meant to be analogous to having a high level view of your company and all resources available within your company and how to deploy them.\n\nAlso, in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which provides a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and measure all forms of digital content. Combining Brandfolder capabilities with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage workflows around content and collaboration. This goes back to what I said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that her company\u2019s marketing team was \u201creally excited about Smartsheet because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d She told me that before Smartsheet, her company\u2019s marketing team had to constantly hunt down members of the creative team (photographers, graphic designers) to receive the latest photos, videos, and digital designs they were working on. She said it was a big pain for them trying to share this content over email and SharePoint. Now, all of the content is inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time. They can leave comments on the content, route to appropriate individuals for approvals, and have better insight into the status of all digital content that is being worked on. The acquisition of Brandfolder is really what allows Smartsheet to stand out in this department.\n\nNobody really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet\u2019s FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that effects the company\u2019s brand. Sales is running social media campaigns, product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts, and R&amp;D is teasing new product experiences in app. It can get really difficult for the company\u2019s Marketing/Branding team to stay on top of all this without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I think Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.\n\nAs you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal upgrades available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that, Smartsheet also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that empowers users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline business and simplify collaboration. There are so many instances within companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow. Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT departments and the coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. This places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes away time they can be spending on more complex/mission critical projects. Mark Mader is aware of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies now and in the future. He believes that everyday non-coder employees know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more relevant apps to help get work done than an IT department employee who doesn\u2019t even do the job that the app is being built for. Also, he believes this will reduce strain on IT departments and allow them to focus on more complex and mission critical projects.\n\nHere is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): \u201cI have been waiting for a solution like WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need, when and where we need it,\u201d said Hina Patel, Director of Sales Operations at Cisco. \u201cThe ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone involved in the process, no matter their role.\u201d As you can see, the value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform appears to be high.\n\nLastly, Smartsheet also generates revenue from Professional Services which is essentially providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet customers that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the most recent quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2% of revenue. Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:\n\nSubscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue\n\nProfessional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue\n\nThis is the end of my first article about Smartsheet. My goal is to drop Part 2 within the next week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth answer of the question \u2013 \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d\n\n**TL:DR**\n\n* This is Part 1 of my two part deep dive on Smartsheet (Ticker: SMAR).\n* This first part introduces you to (1) me, (2) the company, (3) my thesis on the company, and (4) digs into how they make money.\n* Part 2 (to be released later this week) will go in depth to explore the question \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d\n* Smartsheet is an exciting SaaS company that\u2019s helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people\n* I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These are just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.\n\n**Disclosure:** I am long Smartsheet. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Management talks a lot about empowering people and  that really  struck a chord with me. In different roles I\u2019ve had as a  teacher, tutor,  and supervisor, I\u2019ve always found empowering people to  be one of the  most important keys to success. I will touch on this more  later in the  write up.\n\nAnother  positive signal I  got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I  was sitting in  the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was  watching an  interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of  Smartsheet. My  girlfriend overheard the word \u201cSmartsheet\u201d mentioned in  the video and  said \u201cAre they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue  check mark?\u201d. I  had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were  thinking about  the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it.  She said \u201cMy  company just transitioned all of our work onto  Smartsheet. I really love  it. Our marketing department is really  excited about it because it  makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.\u201d Hearing this just  motivated me to learn more about  Smartsheet.\n\n**The Thesis Statement**\n\nFor   every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement   that can serve as a reminder for why I\u2019m buying and holding that stock   for the long term. I\u2019ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long   so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during  times  when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why   you\u2019re holding this position.\n\nThe thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:\n\n*\u201cSmartsheet:   A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the  global  workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work,  managers and  executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally  consolidate their  teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that  tool and is  innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the  most out of  their teams.\u201d*\n\nI  think this  thesis statement really captures the essence of what  Smartsheet does. If  you go to Smartsheet\u2019s website and look at the  \u201cAbout\u201d page, you will  find their \u201cAbout\u201d statement which says  \u201cSmartsheet is the enterprise  platform for dynamic work that aligns  people and technology so your  entire business can move faster, drive  innovation, and achieve more.\u201d  Notice how their statement emphasizes  helping businesses move faster,  drive innovation, and achieve more.\n\nIn   my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM   software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable   independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM   space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise   capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of   customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the   companies that were identified from the study in the order of their   ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader   in the space at 2nd place. Let\u2019s use our common sense for a second. At   the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest   in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with   resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage   work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the   answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies   on the list. Let\u2019s break them down 1 by 1:\n\n* Workfront   was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront,  you\u2019d  have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn\u2019t  be a  pure play investment into the CWM space.\n* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)\n* Wrike is private\n* ServiceNow   \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing   here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also, the company  is  already quite large ($106B market cap)\n* Asana   is public but just IPO\u2019d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don\u2019t have   much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company.   Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment  into  the CWM space, they\u2019re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in   several of Forrester\u2019s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you   can invest in the best?\n* Monday.com is private\n* Microsoft \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.\n* Atlassian   \u2013 This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple  problems  with them as an investment. 1) They\u2019re ranked way beneath  Smartsheet.  2) They\u2019re already too big for me to confidently say they  can 10x  (market cap already $58B).\n\nNow   that we\u2019ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space  and  that they\u2019re arguably the best publicly available pure-play  investment  in this space let\u2019s understand why this is important. Other  than the  obvious reason that we\u2019re in the beginning stages of a remote  work  revolution, why is this important?\n\nWell,   let\u2019s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO,  during  the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th,  2020:\n\n\u201cLeaders  are recognizing  they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work,  work that is  documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where  priorities  are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their  teams  with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle  times  will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and   prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is   ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive   the benefits from doing so.\u201d\n\nKey word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:\n\nAsynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.\n\nSynchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.\n\nAny   communication that doesn\u2019t require a real-time response can be   considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above.   Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real   time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As   part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by   the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and   Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in   2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is   called \u201cThe Power of Done\u201d. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent   noticed through their own experience, and through different research   studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the   early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This   is a quote from their E-Book:\n\n\u201cAccording   to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy,   interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging   and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized  basis,  this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S.   workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.\u201d\n\nThey   mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances  in  work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets,  there  hadn\u2019t at that time been any great applications created for  teamwork  collaboration or task management. The fact that technology  advances  helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also  deterred  productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred  to as the  productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it  and thus they  founded Smartsheet.\n\n**How Smartsheet makes money**\n\nAt   the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand   how they make money. In Chris Mayers\u2019 excellent book, 100 Baggers, that  I  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth  as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This  isn\u2019t  to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just  because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a  growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the  first things I  look at.\n\nBefore I  talk about the  revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little  bit about the  actual product that they sell to earn this revenue.  Co-Founder/CEO Mark  Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate  world was being done  on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However,  he realized that these  spreadsheets were largely static and not  necessarily used to their full  potential. He wanted to help people get  more out of their use of  spreadsheets. As a result, we now have  Smartsheets which is a cloud  based platform that can be accessed by all  employees of the company no  matter where they are with live  information about project statuses,  meeting times and work that is  assigned to each employee just to name a  few uses. Users can choose  their way of viewing this information with  different views such as  calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt  view.\n\nThe  idea is that by  enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous  information  available to all members of a team about the status of a  project, the  tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous  communication  will be needed which allows employees to spend more time  doing what  they\u2019re hired to do \u2013 get work done. Think about how  wasteful it is to  hire a highly talented engineer but then make him  spend half his day  preparing for and doing status update meetings and  hunting people down  to see where they\u2019re at with their assignments.  What if all this  information was available for him, his managers, and  his staff to see  within Smartsheet without having to bother each other  and waste precious  work hours that could be used for coding, designing,  and producing?  That\u2019s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.\n\nFor   Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I  mentioned  earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company.  Whenever you  see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my  opinion that\u2019s a  very good thing. With a subscription business model,  the revenue is  going to be recurring every year and that type of  reliability (combined  with growth of course) is something you want as  an investor.\n\nSmartsheet\u2019s  primary  source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their  cloud-based  Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and  potential  customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform  by either  signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the   Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to   Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses   Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets   their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.\n\nSmartsheet   offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and   Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided.   Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration   and automation to third-party applications.\n\nThe   Connectors part of the business is something I find really  interesting.  Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top  work  productivity and communication software companies in the world to  allow  their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet  user  interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true \u201ccommand  center\u201d  platform while the products of the other companies become  ancillary  pieces. You\u2019ll see this on the link above but some products  that  Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud,  Microsoft  Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype  just to name a  few.\n\nI think that  being able to  sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the  Smartsheet user  experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot  of these  companies that people may perceive as \u201cSmartsheet  competitors\u201d actually  become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can  be sold by Smartsheet  as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral  angle that Smartsheet is  able to come from by selling Connectors to  their perceived \u201ccompetitors\u201d  reminds me a little bit of how Roku  (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off  of selling a Netflix subscription on  their platform. I think just the  fact that all these big companies  like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc.  allow their products to be  integrated into Smartsheet shows that there  is a high value proposition  in the Smartsheet platform and that they  would risk alienating their  customers if they didn\u2019t allow for their  products to be integrated with  Smartsheet.\n\nOn  top of the  Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to  sell,  Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal   plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can   sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired   10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource   allocation and planning. The name \u201c10,000ft\u201d is meant to be analogous to   having a high level view of your company and all resources available   within your company and how to deploy them.\n\nAlso,   in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which  provides  a centralized platform to organize, discover, control,  distribute, and  measure all forms of digital content. Combining  Brandfolder capabilities  with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic  solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration. This  goes back to what I  said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend  had mentioned that  her company\u2019s marketing team was \u201creally excited  about Smartsheet  because it makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.\u201d She told me  that before Smartsheet, her company\u2019s marketing  team had to constantly  hunt down members of the creative team  (photographers, graphic  designers) to receive the latest photos,  videos, and digital designs  they were working on. She said it was a big  pain for them trying to  share this content over email and SharePoint.  Now, all of the content is  inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team  can access it at any time.  They can leave comments on the content,  route to appropriate individuals  for approvals, and have better insight  into the status of all digital  content that is being worked on. The  acquisition of Brandfolder is  really what allows Smartsheet to stand  out in this department.\n\nNobody   really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days   for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out   quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a   light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary   plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet\u2019s   FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief   Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B   for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing   department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All   kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content  that  effects the company\u2019s brand. Sales is running social media  campaigns,  product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts,  and R&amp;D is  teasing new product experiences in app. It can get  really difficult for  the company\u2019s Marketing/Branding team to stay on  top of all this  without a centralized digital content collaboration  platform like  Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I  think  Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.\n\nAs   you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their  core  CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal  upgrades  available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that,  Smartsheet  also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that  empowers  users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that  streamline  business and simplify collaboration. There are so many  instances within  companies where an app needs to be built to streamline  a workflow.  Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT  departments and the  coders that sit within these departments to build  these apps. This  places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes  away time they can be  spending on more complex/mission critical  projects. Mark Mader is aware  of this and thus is heavily pushing  no-code as a solution for companies  now and in the future. He believes  that everyday non-coder employees  know their jobs/workflows best and  thus if you empower them to build  their own apps with a no-code  platform they will produce better and more  relevant apps to help get  work done than an IT department employee who  doesn\u2019t even do the job  that the app is being built for. Also, he  believes this will reduce  strain on IT departments and allow them to  focus on more complex and  mission critical projects.\n\nHere   is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet   customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): \u201cI have been waiting for a solution like   WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we  need,  when and where we need it,\u201d said Hina Patel, Director of Sales   Operations at Cisco. \u201cThe ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along   with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive   app will make it even easier to drive active participation from  everyone  involved in the process, no matter their role.\u201d As you can  see, the  value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform  appears to be  high.\n\nLastly,  Smartsheet also  generates revenue from Professional Services which is  essentially  providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet  customers  that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the  most recent  quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2%  of revenue.  Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:\n\nSubscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue\n\nProfessional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue\n\nThis   is the end of my first article about Smartsheet. My goal is to drop   Part 2 within the next week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth   answer of the question \u2013 \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d\n\n**TL:DR**\n\n* This is Part 1 of my two part deep dive on Smartsheet (Ticker: SMAR).\n* This first part introduces you to (1) me, (2) the company, (3) my thesis on the company, and (4) digs into how they make money.\n* Smartsheet is an exciting SaaS company that\u2019s helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people\n* I  am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These  are  just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.\n\n**Disclosure:**   I have no position in Smartsheet. I do plan to initiate a long  position  when the markets open again in 2021.  I wrote this article  myself, and  it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving  compensation for it. I  have no business relationship with any company  whose stock is mentioned  in this article.",

        "selftext": "**Industry Overview**\n\nFinancial institutions are known for their lackluster online/digital experience. Many processes inside of these companies are done manually with paper and can take weeks to process and receive approval. Financial institutions are one of the most risk-averse sets of customers.\n\nBanks and other financial institutions will always be around. Although these companies may look different from today, this industry will always be around. That\u2019s why Buffett invests in banks. As cloud software and the regulatory burden becomes more expensive and time-consuming, financial institutions are looking to improve their processes to be more efficient and please customers.\n\nSimple processes can drag on for weeks in financial institutions. Cloud software, nCino, and nCino\u2019s competitors are helping solve this problem. nCino aims to change these manual processes and make financial institutions more nimble while still being compliant with all regulations.\n\nAccording to Gartner, banking had the highest global enterprise IT spending of all industries with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. Although nCino only defines its serviceable addressable market at $10bn, the broader IT industry gives nCino a long runway of future potential growth.\n\nnCino has a number of competitors. My initial research shows that nCino competes with Fiserv, Oracle, and other small companies. In order to invest in nCino, a deeper look into the competitive environment will need to be completed.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nnCino was founded in 2012 by a team of bankers. These founders built a software company solving problems for banks. The founders knew the struggles that often occur inside banks and used their knowledge to solve these problems. nCino is a bank operating system platform. It helps provide banks onboard, originate loans, open accounts, and many other processes. The CEO stated in an interview that \u201che wants the software to do everything from operations, ranging from treasury management to mortgages (coming soon), to tracking employees\u2019 efficiency.\u201d nCino already has relationships with over 305 financial institutions that use the nCino bank operating system, which is their main platform, and then nCino has another 920 financial institutions that use the portfolio analytics solution tool that was acquired in the acquisition of Visible Equity.\n\nnCino has already signed some of the largest financial institutions in the world. nCino boasts Bank of America, Barclays, TD Bank, and many regional community banks, credit unions, and challenger banks as customers.\n\nnCino sells its software on a per-seat basis. This gives it room to continue to expand within its existing customer base. nCino also stands to benefit from capturing more financial institutional clients and expanding their average contract value.\n\nHere is a list of nCino\u2019s offerings: loan origination, portfolio analytics, compliance and risk management, digital customer engagement, customer relationship management (CRM), client onboarding, deposit account opening, business process automation, and enterprise content management.\n\n**Total Addressable Market**\n\nnCino\u2019s S-1 touts that there are more than 28,000 financial institutions worldwide. Gartner also lists banking as the industry with the highest global enterprise IT spending with approximately $376 billion spent in 2018. The financial industry is one of the largest industries and if nCino can help power even a sliver of this industry, it will be a good future for this company. Of course, I have to caveat this by saying that starting a t-shirt business and capturing 1% of the apparel industry may seem plausible, but it is impossible. I make this statement because nCino already has a strong base of customers and has done the work to capture this pie. This gives it the possibility to capture more market share, not all of it, but more.\n\nThe bull thesis for nCino is to be the main software operating system for banks. As banks become more reliant on technology, nCino will prove to be a critical piece of infrastructure. nCino will also develop more product offerings that help their customers. This enhances the stickiness of nCino and leads to upsell opportunities.\n\nnCino\u2019s management team lists the total serviceable market for nCino\u2019s bank operating system at more than $10bn. I believe this is within reason and management is likely underestimating (on purpose or not) the addressable market they believe they can capture.\n\n**Competitive Advantages**\n\nAlthough I like to be optimistic about companies when researching them, I do think nCino is quite an attractive company based on my research on the qualitative aspects of the business.\n\n* **Mission-critical product with high switching costs.**\n   * The solutions that nCino provides are for mission-critical processes that banks want to be done right. Financial institutions would rather have a manual time-consuming process than an automatic process that goes wrong. Switching costs come into play once customers are comfortable with nCino\u2019s product. As customers rely more and more on nCino, these customers are unlikely to switch. Switching from nCino (or any company) to a competitor may lead to outages, issues, and lots of problems that financial institutions will not risk having to deal with. Even if financial institutions attempt to build out their own bank operating system, it will be costly, prone to error, and not worth it! That\u2019s like trying to build out Stripe if you\u2019re an e-commerce company (@Shopify). Allocating capital to build out this function will make zero sense for financial institutions. It\u2019s better to stick to what you know and what you\u2019re good at. That\u2019s why nCino will have high switching costs.\n* **Economies of scale.**\n   * The cost of building out a suite of software products and deploying it to a large customer base is much cheaper for a large company than a small company. Just like no startup would try and compete directly with Amazon, Shopify, Salesforce, Stripe, etc, as nCino grows, no company will come close to competing in the same fashion due to their scale benefits. As nCino looks to expand its product offering, the attractiveness of nCino\u2019s products to financial institutions will only grow. Financial institutions, a very risk-averse set of customers, want products that have been vetted by other financial institutions, and have offerings that solve critical problems.\n\n**Financials**\n\nLike many SaaS companies, nCino has two primary revenue lines. The first is recurring revenue similar to most SaaS companies. The second revenue source is professional services revenue. Subscription revenue accounts for the majority of revenue and gross profit.\n\n**January 2020:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$138mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$74mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$103mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = \\~60%\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~70%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -20%\n\n**January 2019:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$92mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$45mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$64mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = \\~69%\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~69%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -25%\n\n**January 2018:**\n\nTotal revenue = \\~$58mn\n\nGAAP Gross profit = \\~$28mn\n\nSubscription revenue = \\~$38mn\n\nSubscription revenue growth = N/A\n\nSubscription gross profit margin = \\~67%\n\nGAAP EBIT margin = -32%\n\nAlthough nCino is not profitable on a GAAP basis like many of its software peers, the attractiveness of the growth story is compelling. More research into unit economics may provide an even more compelling story.\n\n**What\u2019s Interesting**\n\nThe financial industry is a risk-averse industry and usually, one of the last industries to adapt to change. This is changing with the increasing adoption of technology and software. The innovation occurring in FinTech and in financial institutions is growing. If nCino can be one of the main companies to be the operating system for banks (just like Microsoft/Salesforce is to most companies) then nCino may be an attractive investment opportunity.\n\nSalesforce also owns a large portion of nCino. nCino relies on the \u201cSalesforce Platform.\u201d Also, this may initially seem like a concern, Salesforce also owns 11.6% of nCino. It wouldn\u2019t make much sense for Salesforce to stop nCino from using the Salesforce Platform if they own such a material stake in the company.\n\nSome of the hedge funds that I follow have positions in nCino which is what initially attracted me to this business. Hedge funds like Dragoneer, Tiger Global, and Durable Capital have a position in nCino. Sure these positions may just be small positions to take advantage of the tech IPO pop, but future quarters will show if this is a long-term position for these funds.\n\n**Future Questions**\n\n* **Competition**\n   * In order to be more confident in nCino, I\u2019d have to know more about the banking industry and the various competitors and similar nCino product offerings. Through my research, I found some competitors, but little to no information on these companies because they are private or are just not in the typical VC crowd. I also am not sure how hard it would be for Salesforce, Microsoft, or another well-funded company to try and launch similar product offerings to nCino. It seems from first glance that nCino has a strong suite of products, but not sure if this is something they\u2019ve built over time or is from the founders\u2019 background in banking. I doubt Salesforce would try and compete directly with nCino but may form some type of ongoing partnership.\n* **Ownership**\n   * I like to see management teams with large ownership stakes in the businesses they run. With nCino, I don\u2019t see a large ownership stake. Although there were a number of founders and thus each founder has a small stake in nCino, the largest positions by far are owned by Insight Partners, Salesforce, and Wellington. I will need to do more research on digging into the ownership structure and see whether or not management is being incentivized alongside public investors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI think nCino is a strong company and in my opinion, it\u2019s one of the more attractive investment opportunities from the companies I\u2019ve outlined in the past. The financial industry is huge and if nCino can continue to innovate, build products, upsell existing customers, and sign contracts with new customers, I think nCino may be a stock that people will be talking about in 3-5 years.\n\nIt\u2019s had very strong growth thus far and likely will continue. Of course, the valuation is a key point with some concerns over the high multiple, but relative to similar high growth/high margin comparable companies, nCino fits into this bucket.",

        "selftext": "What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list.\n\n** How can I use this list? **\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

        "selftext": "In this post I will be looking at major option purchases from 12/23 - 12/31. The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.\n\nThe criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.\n\n# Call Flow\n\nTo start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.\n\n# Put Flow\n\nSome worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS', 'SKT', 'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.\n\n# Targeted Flow\n\nThe targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the \"Targeted Flow\" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.\n\nJust for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium.... CRAZY",

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nOne of the most important things I look for when analysing potential investments is whether or not the company has a strong economic moat. An economic moat gives a company a distinct advantage over its competitors, allowing it to protect and increase market share and revenue.\n\nI'm putting together a list of the most 'valuable' types of moats to look out for when analysing companies. Also trying to focus on more \"under-appreciated\" moats that investors often miss.\n\nWould love to hear if anyone has any suggestions on types of moats that could be added to the list???\n\n**Here's the list so far, would love your feedback:**\n\n(note: I focus on investing in tech companies so this list kind of reflects that)\n\n## Traditional Business Moats\n\n* **Technology:** Sometimes, companies can build a massive economic moat by having deep technology that is at least 10 times better than the competition. Google\u2019s search engine is the classic example of this. Google joined the search wars somewhat late but had a solution that was far better than Yahoo\u2019s.\n* **Economies of Scale:** The bigger your are, the lower your costs will be due to having more operating leverage. This means that you can earn more money per customer (at the same price) or provide a cheaper solution than your smaller competitors. Software companies in general are great examples of economies of scale due to the almost-zero additional cost of production involved in acquiring another customer.\n* **Network Effects:** Your product/service has network effects if its value increases as the number of people using it increases. Social networks and messaging products are classic examples of network effects. Network moats can be incredibly defensible. Why would I download a new messaging app when all my friends are using WhatsApp?\n* **Brand Loyalty:** A strong brand can be a moat. Think Apple, Coca-Cola, Gucci. Instantly recognisable brands that have built huge businesses by cultivating brand loyalty amongst their customers.\n\n## Under-Appreciated Moats\n\n#### 1. Professional Services:\n\nProfessional services typically involve providing hands-on setup, configuration and implementation support to your customers. This helps them to have the best possible experience of your product, suited to their specific needs. Providing professional services can create a unique economic moat for 3 key reasons:\n\n* **Stronger Customer Relationships:** By providing hands-on support to your customers, you will build a strong relationship and strong brand loyalty that is very difficult to replicate with \u201cready-to-go\u201d products.\n* **Sunk Costs:** The significant cost, time and effort involved in the implementation process will deter your customers from switching to a competitor without a very strong reason.\n* **Switching Costs:** Providing hands-on support will make it very costly for your customers to move to a competitor. They would have to replicate all of the integrations and configurations that you have helped them setup. While also needing to retrain their staff on a brand new system. Costly indeed.\n\n#### 2. Multi-Product Strategy:\n\nA multi-product strategy is a really powerful way of building a strong moat around your business. Even if the individual products are worse in isolation, the benefits of multi-product may far outweigh the negatives for customers.\n\nFor example, a competitor have built a sales analytics tool that is far better than Salesforce\u2019s analytics product. But a large customer is not comparing both analytics tools in isolation. A large customer is comparing your analytics tool against the fact that they can also get their CRM, marketing and customer support software all from Salesforce. One contract. One vendor relationship. One login for employees.\n\nThis presents a bit of a chicken/egg problem for competitors. How do you build a wedge into a market like this? It\u2019s not easy. That\u2019s why multi-product is such a compelling moat.\n\n#### 3. Data:\n\nData has always been a hugely valuable resource for tech companies. Many companies have built huge moats around their customer\u2019s data. Companies like Oracle are essentially databases on which different enterprise applications have been built. Another name for this is a system of record.\n\nThe huge emerging opportunity in data lies in *doing useful things with that data.* It sounds simplistic but many enterprise products are still essentially CRUD applications. They may allow customers to easily access huge amounts of data, but they don\u2019t allow you to do much more than create, read and update that data.\n\nWith machine learning, we are starting to see products that do really powerful things with data. For example, People.ai uses ML to help companies uncover new revenue opportunities from their customers. This is just the tip of the iceberg. For example, you can imagine an ML product that make hiring and promotion recommendations based on employee data. Or products that make marketing suggestions based on previous marketing campaigns.\n\nIt\u2019s fairly clear that incumbent companies have the upper hand here. A company like Salesforce already has access to customer data. They \u2018just\u2019 need to build products that can make intelligent recommendations from this data. This combination (system of record + ML) would be a massively defensible moat. As Salesforce provides better recommendations to its customers, they would be less and less likely to move and store their data somewhere else. A virtuous cycle (for Salesforce).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think of this list so far? What moats should I add to the list? Are there any that I should remove?\n\nThanks",

        "selftext": "First and foremost SaaS stands for Software a as Service. Often times these are software companies that have business models that are license or subscription based services. Their customers are usually companies of all sizes that would use their services for their employees. Think Salesforce and Slack as two examples of SaaS.\n\nNow to ASANA. This is a company that offers work management platform for employees to collaborate, coordinate task, roles, timelines, and more. The CEO is cofounder of Facebook Dustin Moskovitz. ASANA IPOed Sept 30th of last year at $27. Today it closed close to it\u2019s all time high of $37.14. \n\nIMO this company will only continue to grow their revenues and their revenues are sticky. Once employees of organizations start adopting this platform it will be hard to rip and replace. \n\nI\u2019ve used the product and decided today to add to my position now sitting at 500 shares with a cost basis around $35.25.  IMO this is getting in on the ground floor and I will thank myself in a few years.",

Okta primarily focusses on 6 main industries: Healthcare, Public Sector, Education, Energy, Financial Services and Technology providing their services to more than 9400 small, medium and large enterprises worldwide.\n\nOkta's main product is the Okta Identity Cloud which is comprised of 6 platform services:\n\n    Directories: stores users and attributes\n    \n    Integrations: ensures that apps (currently 6500+) can connect to Okta\n    \n    Insights: aggregates, analyses and disseminates data from Okta and its partners\n    \n    Identity Engine: customizable access experiences like authorization, authentication and registration\n    \n    Workflows: automates identity-centric processes\n    \n    Devices: collects device identity and context\n\nThese platform services can be leveraged using Okta's products, API's and SDK's like:\n\n    Single Sign On\n    Universal Directory\n    Advanced Server Access\n    Adaptive Multi-actor Authentication\n    Lifecycle Management\n    Access Gateway\n    API Access Management\n    Developer\n    One App\n    Enterprise\n\n**Okta Integration Platform**\n\nThe biggest part that makes Okta a key player is the fact that they integrated 6500+ applications into their cloud and on-premises systems which ensure that on all aspects, an organization can secure their processes. They integrated:\n\n* Human Resources Information Systems like bambooHR and Workday\n* Network Security like Cisco, PaloAlto and Fortinet\n* Application Delivery Controllers like F5, Akamai and Citrix Netsclar\n* Security Analytics like Splunk, Rapid1, IBM QRadar\n* Cloud Access Security Brokers like Bitglass and McAfee\n* API Gateways like AWS, Google Cloud, Apigee\n* Identity Governance and Administration like SailPoint\n* ID Proofing like Acuant, Evident and Experian\n* Privileged Access Management like BeyondTrust and CyberArk\n* Endpoint Security and Management like IBM, MobileIron and VMware\n* Healthcare Technologies like Cerner and AthenaHealth\n* Protocol Based Custom Integrations like Radius, LDAP and SAML\n* Bot Detection like Arkose Labs, Shape and Perimeter\n* Customer Data Integrators like Segment\n* Email Security like ProofPoint\n* SaaS Management Platforms like BetterCloud and Intello\n\nI've made this list, to show how versatile and broad their product is. They ensure that their single product can be used for a multitude of cases within the Workforce Identity, Customer Identity and Access Management market segments.\n\n**How they make money**\n\nOkta's business model follows a SaaS-based delivery model in which business subscribe to Okta's services and pay a fee per user per month. Okta's subscription revenues in the 9 months ending 10/31/2020 jumped 50% YoY to $571.2M.\n\n**Financials &amp; Valuations (as of** [10/31/2020](https://investor.okta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/okta-announces-strong-third-quarter-results)**):**\n\n* Current Market Capitalization (as of 1/15/2021) - $32.75B\n* Total Revenue (3 months): $217,379,000\n* Total Revenue (9 months): $600,684,000\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 3 months: ($72,764,000) \u2013 Up from ($63,495,000)\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 9 months: ($190,526,00) \u2013 Up from ($158,441,000)\n* Cash on Hand: $2.945B\n\n**Growth &amp; Opportunities**\n\nOkta is one of the companies that greatly benefited from the lockdowns all over the world, and the subsequent rise in the need for identity and access management services triggered by the  work-from-home wave. The company's momentum will highly likely continue through fiscal 2021 and beyond, with more and more companies looking to ensure safe and secure work-from-home environments that protects companies, their employees and their customers. CFO Bill Losch said on the company's third-quarter [earnings call](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/earnings),  \"We remain confident that the factors that are driving our business today will continue to drive our business well into the future.\"\n\nJust recently, [Okta's products were made available in the AWS Marketplace](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201202005943/en/Okta-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Bring-the-Okta-Identity-Cloud-to-AWS-Marketplace). It is expected that this move will drive top-line growth.\n\nOkta estimates that it will end fiscal 2021 with revenue of about $822.5 million, an increase of 40% from the previous year, and that it will surpass $1 billion in sales in fiscal 2022. Although Okta isn't profitable yet, one of its pro's is that the free cash flow consistently stays on the plus side and makes up 19% of Okta's revenue. One of the most important contracts in this business are annual contracts. Okta gained 100 customers in Q3 with $100,000+ annual contracts, totaling over 1700 customers. The number of large enterprise contracts ($500,000+) grew 50% YoY to 320. These now represent 80% of Okta's annual contract values.\n\nAs president-elect Joe Biden will take office later this week, one of the most anticipated moves is an [increase in cyber security](https://buildbackbetter.gov/press-releases/statement-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-cybersecurity/) spending by the new administration. Putting Okta, among other big cyber security players, into an excellent playing field the coming years.\n\n**Price Target**\n\nMarch 3 is the expected Q4 earnings. Okta is in a good position to beat their ER once again.\n\n[18 Analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OKTA/analysis?p=OKTA) combined have an average price target of $262.44.17 (upside of \\~4%) with tops being at $313.\n\n**TL;DR Okta is in a great position within the Identity and Access Management market which makes the company one of the ideal high-growth stocks moving forward. Personally, I think it is worth taking a look at and most likely a stock that will pay off not only when Q4 Earnings are reported, but easily for the next 2 years at least.**",
