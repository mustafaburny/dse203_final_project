        "selftext": "I\u2019m just an autist that wants to help my fellow dudes make money. Have I been guilty of this in the past? Absolutely. In my post history you\u2019ll definitely find me shilling for CLOV. Stupid piece of shit CLOV. \n\nTurns out, you\u2019ll find most of these stocks are shorted FOR A REASON. THEY SUCK ASS. THINK YOU DAMN APES, THINK. \n\nAMC and GME actually did squeeze. But those are RARE exceptions. And they totally poisoned this sub with a bunch of Neanderthals looking for the next short squeeze. Stop. Get help. It feels like we\u2019ve had 5 years worth of short squeezes in the last few months. It\u2019s over. \n\nWhy should you listen to a random nobody yelling at you on the internet? Because. People are making money out there while you baghold these crap stocks. SPY at an all time high. You coulda made more $$ playing Microsoft or Apple. \n\nOr actually, don\u2019t stop. Lose your money please. And then fuck off to your lonely 9-5 daily cocksucking for that $500 weekly paycheck. And never come to this sub again. So I don\u2019t have to read your bullshit. I just want to wake up, pull out my phone, and not see your dumb ass. Your wife/girlfriend however is invited. \n\nSo, want to know why your \u201cshort squeeze\u201d DD isn\u2019t working?! Here\u2019s the difference- AMC and GME are household names. If you want retail to pile on? It\u2019s gotta be a household name. Retail loves nostalgia. They love familiarity. \n\nSo is it a retail squeeze, or can you get the big bois on board? Here\u2019s some facts for ya- they don\u2019t need your shit DD. They have Bloomberg Terminals. They have 100x more data than we do, and they see it before we do, in real time, and they play market rotations and earnings. They\u2019re not googling 1 week old short interest data. They got the real time shit. They play this game on another level. And if you can\u2019t get them on board, and the stock isn\u2019t a household name, then you fucked up. \n\nSo this is what I\u2019m saying- I blame all you fucks for missing plays like NKE last week. \n\nCome on. NKE was a fucking given. It was written on the wall in neon letters and most of us missed it. \n\nTL;DR- want to make money? You can be a millionaire without ever touching a short squeeze. \n\nFucking rookie ass bitches.",

        "selftext": "Alright you retards, I'm taking the initiative to clear the air. I'm probably going to get a lot of downvotes, but I'm going to be straight up honest here.\n\nWe are not a team, this is not a cult, and this is not fucking collusion.\n\nGME, AMC, &amp; CLOV are three completely different plays. Stop fucking comparing the 3 with this cult like attitude.\n\n**GME** \\- Was being shorted because as per \"technicals\" it was a company that was going to shit (bankruptcy) if they didn't change leadership and incorporate strategic changes to their business model aka E-Commerce and the like. Additionally, the biggest reason GME picked up is in late December/early January is because it had a ridiculous/unprecedented short interest of %140. Making the short squeeze extremely likely to occur. The stock picked up, gamma squeeze and short squeezes occurred and it's still the play to this day. Why? because the remaining \\~15-20% short sellers still holding their positions are the same ones from the beginning who have accumulated billions in loses, thus still considered a major play + the company making big changes to their board of directors, adding e-commerce and more etc.\n\n**AMC** \\- This stock sucked dick when it was first picked up. The only reason this stock got picked up was because of nostalgia and because of people missing out on GME. The SI% on AMC back when GME rallied up was well below 20%. This company as well was on the verge of bankruptcy. It got picked up by the supporters like us apes and more shorts loaded in. AMC due to the retail investors \"Picking\" this stock to rally up actually has started to work on their business model and accrued $1B in investments and has started to really concentrate on building the business into a success (hopefully). When the CEO said the talks of bankruptcy are no longer on the table, is because even they knew at the time that filing for bankruptcy was a real possibility for the company. Again, the CEO has fucked over investors in the past by trying to continually dilute the float with adding more shares. On top of that prior to the stocks rallying up the board and CEO's paid themselves handsomely when the company was about to fail. Now, the narrative is different for AMC as the shorts that are in this stock are the same ones from the beginning and have also accrued unrealized losses. Also, seems the company has really pivoted to reconstruct their business model to become a success once COVID-19 is no longer hindering the world from being normal again, thus, making AMC still a very big play.\n\n**CLOV** \\- Was ridiculously shorted the moment it hit IPO. This had nothing to do with GME or AMC. The short interest on CLOV has been there since IPO. The play for CLOV is that it's a Medicare Advantage Disruptor, and provides a real use case and a cost effective solution to the traditional Medicare Advantage sub-segment that hasn't changed in ages. This stock has a large short interest, now probably greater then AMC and GME combined, low float, no debt, and has a very bright future for growth. It's also heavily invested by Alphabet (Google) and other major players. The firms shorting CLOV are not the same as those who shorted GME and AMC, separate that from your minds.\n\nYes, Melvin Capital, Citadel and others targeted GME and AMC, but this has no relevance to CLOV. No one gives a fuck, a viable stock that has a potential to disrupt a market segment that is also heavily shorted is the play for CLOV. That's it, simple as that.\n\nAll 3 of these stocks are completely different plays. Yes, a short squeeze and/or gamma squeeze will always be appreciated on any stock. But get this through your heads, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PLAY! They are completely different in respect to each other.\n\nWSB is a casino, we're here to place bets and hope for the best. This is not a team sport, this is not a cult, and this is not collusion. \n\nIf you don't like a stock, then don't throw money at it. But stop with the shilling and the cult attitude predominantly from GME and AMC diehards that can't grasp that WSB is a casino and not a subreddit solely about GME or AMC. (I'm not talking about GME and AMC holders as a whole, most of you are chill af, just some that are constantly shilling everything with a ticker thats not GME or AMC).\n\nNow with this shit said, I'm a big supporter of all 3. But for fuck sakes they are not the same play, stop comparing the 3.\n\nDon't forget AMC dropped to $6 and AMC bagholders were bag holding for months before it moved. GME dropped to $40 and GME holders were bag holding for months before it moved. \n\nEveryone needs to chill the fuck out, play your plays and keep it moving. Stop shilling shit and comparing shit when they're not correlated at all.\n\nBB and NOK became \"Meme\" stocks because fundamentally, they were undervalued for what the company actually does and where they're positioning themselves for the future. \n\nPeople just need to stop comparing and having these debates. 3 stocks, 3 completely different plays, fuck off and throw your money at which ever stocks you like and hope for the best, just stop with the comparisons and cult shit it's ridiculous.\n\nAlso, the short squeeze is nowhere near in sight. You think the short sellers are dumb as fuck? They're going to wait until inflation hits and fucks up the whole market. They're probably betting that once the market goes tits up, people bag holding these stocks will sell, why? Because they anticipate people will need to pay for bills, mortgages/rent, their children etc, and with the cost of living, cost of commodities inflating due to inflation, I can easily see how they're going to hold onto there positions (shorting these stocks) until this occurs. They're banking that when shit goes tits up, the investors in these stocks will also go tits up and FUD will kick in causing massive selloffs. (My personal opinion).\n\nSome plays on WSB are value plays, short squeeze plays, gamma squeeze plays, undervalued plays, oversold plays, etc the fucking list goes on.\n\nWSB is a god damn casino, so treat it as such. I wish you all the best and many tendies, regardless of what you're invested in. Downvote me to oblivion, idaf.\n\nCheers,",

        "selftext": "What do you think apes?!\n\nBeen waiting months for the right time to buy. 50% down means it can go up 100%. I see no reason AMC and GME can hit highs one time and not again a second time. Why are we so certain June was the peak? Why not end of July or August? I'm sure these stocks have been shorted aggressively on the way down. \n\nAMC announced it wasn't increasing share count, meaning there's now a limited supply. \n\nWhen GME shot up in February, I had the biggest FOMO ever. I had weeks to add shares at a lower price and kept waiting for the right time. \n\nWSB is SILENT right now. No more daily discussions on AMC / GME. Could hear a pin drop. I want to bring back that magic and excitement. What's a few shares between friends.  \n\nJPow is still printing money. Inflation through the roof. Oil hitting 5 year highs. Stock market at all time highs. People starting to go out and about again. What's stopping a MEME rally? \n\nI think we've all gotten too focused on dozens of random stocks (newegg, clne, etc.) and we forgot about our blue chips, GME and AMC. When in doubt, got to rotate back to the winners. \n\nI think the time is now. But more importantly....what do you think?!",

        "selftext": "I thought I had a brilliant, fool proof strategy that the market didn't know and I was first to discover but I was wrong.\n\nThe strategy:  Find weekly options deep out of the money that yield at least 0.5% of the capital requirement. The shot strike price must be below the 200 moving day average and you leverage up to get decent premiums.\n\nI started this in May 2021 selling deep out of the money TSLA naked puts. Then I realized this uses too much margin, so I learnt about credit spreads but I didn't act on it. Then came big tech earnings week and I decided to lay low and not trade at all, but then my tool scanned and found the AMZN deep out of the money puts are yielding similar returns to TSLA, which is basically almost impossible to find in the market unless it's something like AMC or other meme stocks.\n\nI decided to pull the trigger, so I sold 3280 shot, and bought 3200 long on 7/28 expiring 7/30. AMZN was trading north of 3650. I was certain it wouldn't drop 10% or even get close.\n\nWell after hours happened and I paniced, my life flashed before me, I had levered up $525000 in my account, and I also had levered up my wife's account for $280,000 for a total of $800,000.\n\nThis wasn't a YOLO, it wasn't a double my money scheme. I was thinking I could do this 52 weeks in a year, collect 0.5% yield on $800,000 of collateral and move to Hawaii.\n\nIt didn't work out like that. When the markets opened, I got out of the position with $76K of damage, and wiped out all my gains and then some, but I'm thankful to everyone who helped me here on reddit (elsewhere) and WSB discord, and of course my wife who when she found out we'd lose $800,000 just said, don't worry at least we'll be together.\n\nSo cautionary tale for those selling levered up bull put credit spreads and/or naked TSLA puts, those black swan events you don't think you can get close to ... well you can.",

        "selftext": "I am an experienced and seasoned trader, who has proudly turned a small $5,000 investment in January of 2019 into a fortune worth over $5,102. Most of my profits came from following the excellent DD on this sub, realizing I had lost nearly all of my money, and then getting really lucky playing biotech stocks right around COVID. At the height of my investing career I had turned that $5,000 into around $10,000 plus or minus $5,000.\n\nYesterday a realization dawned on me. I looked back at my comment history on a since deleted account and found that I had credulously bought into hundreds of plays based on TA and hype from ostensibly honest posters - people who positioned themselves as men of the people who wanted us all to succeed. I had to ask myself *if all of these people wanted me to succeed, why did I keep _losing money_ every time I followed their advice?*\n\nThe realization was this: I, boy genius, had been had by a pack of charlatans. These posters were not in fact benign and kind hearted genius day traders with brilliant plays based on scientific and technical analysis. Their DD may have been long and full of many colorful charts with arrows and candles and awesome phrases; but their hearts were empty and their premises were naught but lies!\n\nRather than trying to make *me* rich, they were fattening me - and people like me - up for the proverbial slaughter. Like so many suckered before me, I had nodded my head, opened my wallet, and bought whatever they told me: PLTR, AMC, NIO, GLD, SLV, AAL, the list goes on.\n\nSure *maybe* my account would become turgid for a few glittering moments but it never climaxed into a blizzard of cocaine and Benjamins as the posters promised. Usually I was left watching my options bleed on the daily as the initial frenzy of interest by retail mongoloids diminished and the dumb money flooded into the next frenzied promise.. time and time again.. time and time again.\n\nSo now that I have wizened myself to this treacherous game, I want to know. How do you identify the GOOD tips from the BAD tips. How do we know when a poster on here has the goods?",

        "selftext": "I went to the movies this weekend at an AMC theater here in my medium sized city (currently ranked the 3rd best place to live in the United States) and I observed a few things.\n\n1. On a Saturday night at 7:00 pm while some new popular movies are out the parking lot was about 1/8 full.\n\n2. There was no one working the box office selling tickets, you could only buy tickets from the automated machine, there were two of these machines and one was out of printer paper so you couldn\u2019t use it.\n\n3. There was no one taking tickets to get into the theater, AT ALL, you literally could have just walked into any movie carrying anything.\n\n4. The 7:00 movie we saw had a grand total of 22\nPeople in it.\n\n5. The tickets with tax were 24$ and a regular popcorn and regular soda was 15$, so nearly 40$ for two people to go to a movie (cheaper to stream it from home)\n\nThis is a doomed business unless something drastically changes. People are streaming from home for cheaper.  Black widow box office numbers are way down because of streaming.\n\nI will\nBe surprised if AmC still exist in a couple years \n\nApes be careful!! The fundamentals may still be there for a big squeeze, but get in, make some money and get out.\n\nDown vote me, call me a hedgie fud spreader whatever you gotta do, I\u2019m just telling you unemotional observations.\n\nI bought in at 10$ and sold 75% of my shares at 60$ but am still holding.\n\n\nBe careful smooth brained apes\u2026.",

        "selftext": "# Introduction\n\nLet me just preface this by saying this post is for those who take trading seriously, who harbor real hopes of earning a steady income in the market. This post is going to be long, and it is going to demand work from you to both understand and attempt to emulate. But that work will be worth the effort. I recommend you read it several times through, and keep as a reference. If you are just here looking for entertainment and gambling, that is fine, but this is probably a thread to skip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFour weeks ago I began a challenge to turn $4k into $1M. I began this to help educate others on the professional trading process, and to prove several points that are often in contention:\n\n**1) That it can be done,** \n\n**2) That good trading is actually simple,** \n\n**3) That technical analysis is real and effective,**\n\n**4) That small accounts have a huge edge.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here are my results from the FIRST WEEK of that challenge.**\n\n*Processing img 92wrzgrcasb71...*\n\n**Return first week: $658 (+16.5%)**\n\nThe question you should be asking yourself is: **How did I find so many sudden, big winners in a single week?** I will teach you exactly how below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, let's just get a bit of a rant off my chest. Hard words to follow, and a lot of you will disagree with these points, but some of you will benefit a lot from hearing it. These are some of the reasons you aren't making money, in my not so humble opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1) Stop chasing stupid memes and \"hot\" stocks. Create your own opportunities.**\n\nWhen I read the daily chat in subs, including this one, it gets really depressing quick. All I see are the same tickers posted over and over and over again, and usually total dogshit stocks. Everyone just copying what others tell them to trade, so few actually thinking for themselves or finding their own trades and opportunities. Like, why is half this sub bagholding SOFI and mentioning it nonstop? Was some recent DD posted on it and you all just hopped in blindly? Why the obsession with the other same tickers, like CLNE, that get posted again and again? Because others were posting about it? Look, I won't deny you can sometimes, potentially make money in meme stocks or reading DDs. But chasing memes or pump and dumps is not going to make you money long term.\n\nMaybe you looked at the fundamentals and you thought it was a great company with long term prospects. Ok, sure. But if you are trading on fundamentals, why the hell are you buying short term options? If you are a fundamental trader then you are a buy and hold investor with a year plus timeline. If you are buying weeklies or looking for a quick pop, fundamentals don't mean shit, technicals are what matter. Stop mixing long term strategy with short term trading, it just doesn't make any sense.\n\nSet up your own scanners. Do your own research. Find your own opportunities.\n\n**2) Stop trading slow as fuck megacap stocks with a small account.**\n\nWhen I see people with sub-million dollar accounts trading stocks like Ford or even Apple, I can't help but cringe. The one HUGE advantage that small accounts have is that they can trade the fast, explosive, hard moving small cap stocks without having to worry about issues like liquidity and wicking the price upward. *The reason you can beat the market hard with a small account is because you can trade the highest beta stocks that guys like Buffett can't.* But only if you focus on them.\n\nTrade the fast stocks. The stocks that really move hard. Those are the stocks that will get you rich quickly, not fucking BABA on a 2% move.\n\nThere is an acronym you need to learn, and become obsessive about. That acronym is ADR. Average Daily Range. If your account is less than a million, you should not even be looking at stocks with an ADR less than 5%. They are too slow. When someone asks me to judge a stock or setup for them, the very first thing I look at is the ADR. If it is less than 4 or 5 ADR, I tell them it is dog shit, whether I'm bullish on it or not.\n\nAAPL has an ADR of 1.6 at the moment. Garbage stock for small accounts. Is it rallying? Sure. It is rallying in 1.6% increments. Can you make money in that? Sure, even more with options. But you won't double your account in a month with Apple unless you YOLO everything into short dated options. It works until you go broke, which let's be honest, most people here have or will.\n\nTSLA has an ADR of 3.5. Not terrible, but you can do much better.\n\nSPCE has an ADR of 12.5. THAT is what you want to see. I made a 42% return on SPCE in 3 days last week, with SHARES. And I will show you exactly why I bought SPCE and many others before they exploded last week. It wasn't simple luck.\n\n**3) If you want to gamble with options, then go for it. But if you want to be an actual professional trader, you probably shouldn't touch options until you've shown consistency with shares first.**\n\nLook, if you just want to gamble and hope to get lucky, knowing you will probably go broke, that's fine with me. That's the WSB way. At least you are being honest with yourself. But if you want to get serious about trading, to make so much money so consistently you never have to work again, you should not be touching options until you've proven you can be consistently profitable trading shares.\n\nLeverage and margin is something that ought to be earned, not used just because it is there.\n\nOptions are extremely unforgiving. Let's say you buy a stock at 10, it rallies up to 12, then tanks back to 10 again, and you sell. With shares, you've just broken even. Not good, but obviously not bad either. Breakeven is fine for a trade. But do the same exact trade with options instead of shares, and you could be down 20% on it. Good luck overcoming that downward pressure as a noobie trader long term. Trading is hard enough without adding theta and vega rape to the mix.\n\n**4) If you want to be a professional, then think and act like a professional.**\n\nProfessional traders are process oriented. They are focused on improving their trading process more than they are on chasing the hot next trade.\n\nThat means having a method or system to your trading. Something you can repeat again, and again, and gradually improve. It means using scanners and finding YOUR OWN stocks and trades, finding tickers neither you nor most anyone else has even heard of before, and making tons of money on them. Browsing WSB for DD or the next hot stock is not a system, and likely won't lead to any lasting success as a trader.\n\nIt also means you have to work fucking hard. Success is rarely easy, much less in something as competitive as the stock market. If you are lazy, or don't want it enough, be honest with yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now, on to making money.**\n\nWhat follows is one simple setup that will make you money if traded correctly. I will teach you a process you can follow and repeat and improve upon. This obviously isn't the only way to trade, but I can promise you it beats the market significantly if done correctly. So learn it, and practice it, and start making money. From there, the rest is improvement, and branching out, and finding new strategies to test and perfect on your way to becoming an independent, professional trader. In other words, the rest is gravy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Breakout Swing Trading Strategy: The Setup.\n\n*Processing img 0nnm1qztasb71...*\n\nThis is a purely technical trading system. A lot of people will tell you technical analysis is nonsense and doesn't work. Those people do not know what they are talking about. I've made my living as a purely technical trader, and I assure you I am not the only one. Over my career I've picked far too many huge short term winners using nothing but charts for it to be simple luck.\n\nTo put it in one sentence: **We are going to look for strong, volatile momentum stocks that are breaking out of a consolidation pattern.**\n\nSounds easy, and it is, but the details are what really matter. So let's go in depth.\n\nWe will start by analyzing five of the trades I've made as part of my $1M challenge, so you can see exactly what I saw on the charts when I entered my positions. I drew two red lines on each chart to show the \"flagging\" pattern I was watching. The chart on the left is daily candles, chart on the right is hourly candles. Proof of these entries and exits can be found in both text and screenshot format in my history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Example #1: IDT**\n\nBought @ 37.70 on 7/1\n\nSold partial @ 47.00 on 7/2\n\nReturn: 25% gain in 1 day\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dxwixuarbsb71.png?width=1619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=403e77830fe05e1e0d8c38f76cb2098656af8abf\n\n**Example #2: SPCE**\n\nBought @ 37.25 on 6/22\n\nSold partial @ 52.8 on 6/25\n\nReturn: 42% gain in 3 days\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvlqevnsbsb71.png?width=1619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4f7d04aafb25e4a43700eb223b3b011f6fd652d\n\n**Example #3: \\[redacted small cap\\]**\n\nBought @ 3.81 on 6/24\n\nSold partial @ 4.44 on 6/25\n\nReturn: 17% gain in 1 day\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/23rk1b4ubsb71.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cb4eb4f83154b4d992cc6b6b3bc882e60d0ea43\n\n**Example #4: LPI**\n\nBought @ 68.86 on 6/21\n\nSold partial @ 91.39 on 6/25\n\nReturn: 33% gain in 4 days\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jiiuwlevbsb71.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa4d81b417b665324f1fca54f18995f361bfe5d5\n\n**Example #5: CRCT**\n\nBought @ 35.74 on 6/25\n\nSold partial @ 41.85 on 6/28\n\nReturn: 17% gain in 3 days\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpuatviwbsb71.png?width=1617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b2dded0bca2a31dda00d5c4f94b3550a5a5f5cc\n\n**What do these charts all have in common?**\n\n**1) Strong momentum stocks.** Every one of these (except CRCT which was a recent IPO) had doubled or more in the past six months. None of this buy low, sell high stuff here. We want to buy high and sell higher.\n\n**2) High ADR (Average Daily Range).** You want to trade the fast stocks, the truly explosive stocks, and a high ADR is one of the best ways to find them. The average ADR on these five stocks was above 8%. Our minimum ADR will be 5%.\n\n**3) Consolidation.** The stock made a big move upward, and then began trading sideways with a tightening range. Forming higher lows and lower highs. The ideal flagging pattern we are looking for is technically referred to as a \"pennant.\"\n\n**4) Moving Averages.** Every one of these stocks was either riding or bouncing off of their 20 day simple moving average. There is something truly magical about that yellow line on my charts, and I don't know what or why it is, but it simply works. This is absolutely key to remember, to avoid stocks that are either too slow or over-extended, focus on those at or near the 20 SMA. Occasionally you can find good breakouts above the 20 SMA that are riding the 10 SMA, but these have a higher failure rate in my experience.\n\n**5) Strong breakout from their range on high volume.** A \"breakout\" refers to a stock punching through the top of the consolidation flag you drew. Ideally you want to see fast rising price action on large volume. This is your entry point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to see more charts and examples of this strategy, [**this four hour video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx8GvtAxilk) should give you plenty. If you are going to employ this strategy, I highly recommend investing those four hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Trading Process\n\n**STEP 1:** Set up a scanner and run it the night before your trading day. I will give you all of my scanner settings below to get you started. Your welcome.\n\n**STEP 2:** Go through every single stock in your scanner. Look for the most promising stocks. In other words, the stocks that have the five criteria I listed above. If you spot a good stock, do three things: 1) Draw a flag around the consolidating price action. 2) Set an alert to the top of the range, to notify you when a breakout from that range occurs. 3) Add the stock to a breakout watchlist. I don't know if you can do any of this with Robinhood, but you ought to have a real broker and charting software by now. I use ThinkorSwim, but there's plenty of good software options out there, like TC2000. Don't be afraid to pay a bit for good software, if you have to.\n\n**STEP 3:** Before market open, you should now have a solid watchlist of breakout candidates. Go through the list and see which setups look the closest to breaking out, or which have already broken out in the premarket action. Also look carefully for anything that may bounce hard off the 20 SMA. These will be your primary focus, but you should also have alerts to all other stocks in your watchlist to notify you of a breakout.\n\n**STEP 4:** If a strong breakout from the range occurs, meaning good rising action on good volume, you want to buy quickly. I would recommend a minimum of 10% of your account, to a maximum of 25%, but follow your own personal risk tolerance. Set a stop loss order just below the low price of the day. You should always be using a stop loss, especially as a beginner and especially with these volatile stocks.\n\n**STEP 5:** If the stock has stayed above your entry price by the next day, you can raise your stop to the entry price if you wish, to limit your loss to breakeven. After 3-5 days, or after very strong price gain, you should take some profits. Anywhere from a quarter to a half of your position. The rest we will let ride.\n\n**STEP 6:** Use the 10 day simple moving average as a trailing \"soft\" stop for the remaining shares. If it looks like the price action is going to close below the 10 SMA, then close out the entire position. The reason I emphasize close is because intraday price action can be volatile, and you don't want to get stopped out from a small dip just below the 10 SMA, if possible. If you don't have the time to watch the market during the day, feel free to use a hard stop.\n\n# Scanner Settings\n\n**ADR (Average Daily Range) above 5%**\n\n**Price X% greater than Y days ago (1 month, 3 month, 6 month scanners)**\n\n**Price within 15% of 6 day high**\n\n**Price within 15% of 6 day low**\n\n**$Volume (close \\* volume) greater than 3,000,000**\n\n**Listed Stocks Only (No OTC, etc.)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1 Month: 25% Greater than 22 Days ago\n\n3 Month: 50% Greater than 67 Days ago\n\n6 Month: 150% Greater than 126 Days ago\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to adjust these settings to get more or fewer results.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ADR code for ThinkorSwim:**\n\n`#Hint: ADR`\n\n`def len = 1;`\n\n`def dayHigh = DailyHighLow(`[`AggregationPeriod.DAY`](https://AggregationPeriod.DAY)`, len, 0, no).DailyHigh;`\n\n`def dayLow = DailyHighLow(`[`AggregationPeriod.DAY`](https://AggregationPeriod.DAY)`, len, 0, no).DailyLow;`\n\n`def ADR_highlow = (dayHigh/dayLow + dayHigh[1]/dayLow[1] + dayHigh[2]/dayLow[2] + dayHigh[3]/dayLow[3] + dayHigh[4]/dayLow[4] + dayHigh[5]/dayLow[5] + dayHigh[6]/dayLow[6] + dayHigh[7]/dayLow[7] + dayHigh[8]/dayLow[8] + dayHigh[9]/dayLow[9] + dayHigh[10]/dayLow[10] +dayHigh[11]/dayLow[11] + dayHigh[12]/dayLow[12] + dayHigh[13]/dayLow[13]) / 14;`\n\n`plot ADR_perc = 100*(ADR_highlow-1);`\n\n**Screenshot (all scanners combined)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/334oc34jbsb71.png?width=1646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac5aa76d696358d6f2ad15ababe6045bf139a158\n\n# The Other Side of Breakouts: Break Downs\n\nI'm going to recommend that you don't anticipate breakouts. In other words, don't buy a stock simply because it is trading in a good consolidation pattern. Wait for the price to break upward from the range before you buy. The reason for this is that consolidation flags don't only break up, they can also break down. I'll just mention that this can actually be used as a profitable shorting strategy, but I won't go into depth on that in this guide. And I don't recommend shorting for a beginner trader either. Let's take a look at a few examples of recent break downs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SOFI**\n\nSOFI formed a decent flag in June, but then broke down from that range on 6/24. This day on 6/24 would have been a clear signal to either exit a position, or to short the stock. The price simply collapsed hard after this point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9fk1wrn0csb71.png?width=1623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cf5299e56581d562e7ed71f80bf42b78886cdde\n\n**AMC**\n\nAMC formed a very strong looking flag in June. I actually broke my own rules and bought this in anticipation on 6/29. But I exited the position quickly on 7/1 when it became clear the price was breaking down from its range. After that, the price collapsed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y91p2tj1csb71.png?width=1625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86bf88d5c3acfd4253ae31424396d0c187c444ca\n\n# Putting it all together. More complex charts.\n\nLet's take a look at a couple little more complicated, tricky charts. We need to stretch your brain a bit with less simple examples.\n\n**\\[redacted small cap\\]**\n\nHere you can see three consolidation flags back to back, with differing follow through. Flag, breakout, flag, breakout, flag, break down on the 20 SMA. You will frequently see hard rising stocks following this \"stair-stepping\" sort of pattern. Still pretty simple, so let's try something a little harder to see.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rve956djisb71.png?width=1623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94584a68a32c9ada4cd5494af413ae41833feead\n\n**PLBY**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qbkvm3m4csb71.png?width=1609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c145defa11d2a47b4097e23b8374acc32d543c2e\n\nStudy this chart carefully, and you can see everything discussed so far. PLBY formed a nice flag in May. It broke down from this flag on 5/11. But then it seemed to trade sideways for a bit and form another, larger flag again.\n\nNote that the breakout/breakdown point for the first flag was the 20 SMA, and the breakout/breakdown point for the second flag was the 50 SMA. This is no coincidence, and will be seen often. Some stocks will move based on the 50 SMA rather than the 20 SMA, and these can be traded as well, but they are slower moving stocks, and I recommend for smaller accounts to just focus on those stocks near the 20 day.\n\nThe failure point for the second flag was on 6/14. After that the price has collapsed.\n\nOne more thing to note on this chart. There are two points where the price on PLBY broke hard upward from it's range, but then quickly fell back down into the range. These are referred to as \"false breakouts,\" and will happen to you often. Note that the first false breakout occurred well above the 20 SMA, which is one reason to avoid breakouts well above the 20 SMA. They just haven't consolidated enough and have a higher failure rate. Patience is king.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**When is the best time to employ this strategy?**\n\nThis strategy should only be employed during a rising bull market, or possibly during a sideways market. Breakouts will not work well in a declining market, and some other strategy must be employed.\n\nThe absolute best time for breakouts is shortly after a pullback in the market, when stocks begin to recover quickly. You can see some explosive moves during these periods.\n\n**How do you deal with breakouts that have gapped up in premarket?**\n\nThose are more difficult. It all depends on the price action. If something has gapped up huge in premarket, I will generally just pass on it. But if something is just starting to break out in premarket, I will look to enter. The exact percentage is difficult to say unfortunately, but anything up more than 10% is usually a pass for me.\n\nIf I do enter premarket gappers, I won't enter immediately on open. I'll give it one to five minutes to watch the price action. If the price is stalling or dropping at open I won't buy it. But if it is showing strong volume and rising, that is what I want to see for a buy.\n\n**Can this strategy be done with options instead of shares?**\n\nIt is possible, but I wouldn't recommend it, especially to start. Breakouts have a high failure rate, and options are very unforgiving to failed trades. If you do decide to use options, I would suggest being much more aggressive with your profit taking, perhaps even selling same day on a breakout. Since this is a swing trading strategy, you can go quite short dated on the expiration, around one month dated should be fine unless you want to try for a bigger move or gamble with even shorter expiry.\n\n**What do you set your stop losses at?**\n\nAlready explained above. First day, the lows of the day. Second day, cost basis. After that, use 10 day SMA as a trailing soft stop.\n\n**When do you take profits?**\n\nAlready explained above. Take quarter to half profits after first big run up, usually around 3 to 5 days. Then use the 10 SMA as a soft trailing stop.\n\n**What if the stock gaps down hard overnight? My stop won't protect me from that!**\n\nThis is true. The only way to avoid overnight risk is to be a pure day trader and to never hold overnight. Personally I find swing trading to be far more profitable, since the big moves take days to play out. Swing trading also gives you much more time and freedom to live your life, since you can simply hold a winning position for days or even weeks, and don't have to sit and stare at a screen all day long to make money.\n\nStocks gapping down big overnight is actually quite rare, but eventually you will experience it. But, let's do the math. Let's say you put 10% of your account into a stock, and some news comes out and it tanks a whopping 30% overnight. As a percentage of your account, that is 10% \\* 30%, or 3% of your account. Definitely not good, of course. But you aren't going to go broke losing 3% of your account. It can be overcome with time and good trading. This is just part of the risk of being a trader.\n\n**I am curious if you handle \"memestocks\" or other very popular stocks differently. I hear a lot of people say these stocks don't act rationally. Do you take more/less risk with stocks like this?**\n\nYes, meme stocks often have much more support and move stronger than most other stocks. For this reason I usually have more conviction to trade them, so I will put on a bit more size or even slightly anticipate the breakouts. But I don't trade meme stocks just because they are meme stocks, they must fit the criteria and patterns described above.\n\nMeme stocks represent opportunities for massive gains and so you should take a bit more risk with them. If you got in GME early, which I did, you can make life changing money.\n\nUnfortunately today you've got too many people trying to pump too many names and everybody ends up diluting each other. It's not like a few months back when the names were much more consolidated.\n\n**Do you use any fundamentals in your trading?**\n\nNone. My trading horizon is too short for fundamentals to make any difference in the price action. Fundamentals only make a difference for long term investors. If you are a short term trader, you don't need to worry about fundamentals at all imo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Additional Resources\n\nI was going to offer several links here, but don't want to break any rules...

YouTubers that post 2 times a day to talk AMC got ridiculous amount of likes and subs which grows their channel. Never saw their position, if the were still holding or even if they had one. They took advantage for their own gain and everybody fell for it. Guarantee there were some that believed in this and all this theory stuff and had positions but again screw those people too that dragged AMC holders a long and gave them hope trying to profit on their shares. \n\nIn the end, this is WSB and love the dumb shit people do on this sub and the gains people make and AMC was awesome for me from $14 to $50 and got out. But people need to know heggies were not the predators on this it was the people that were taking advantage of retail investors and brainwashing them and making \u201cAPE NATION\u201d a thing and saying $100,000 a share is the floor if you hold. \n\nSincerely, \nChris Hanson (To Catch a Predator)",

        "selftext": "Looking closely, I think AMC today's action is a big short trap.  More people will expect AMC to hit $30 to fill the gap below.  However, AMC seemed to bounced off long term trend line ( as shown) very nicely.  If this strong trend line hold, I'm seeing AMC above $100 next week.  \n\nTo be more specific, so many people drew the bull flag and see support at $50.  Because it broke $50, shorters are more encouraged and add more positions.  I think $41.5 is the real support as shown in the chart.   \n\nAlso, the way $SPY being very shaky this week, I think it will broke down sometimes this week and early next week. Once all the smart money get out of SPY stocks, with all that cash, they will pour into meme stocks once more.

        "selftext": "When a stock pumped hard and then had a sharp correction, trading the continuation after the correction can be very profitable.\n\nThere are many different signals that indicate the end of a correction. A very reliable and high probability one is the head and shoulders pattern. Head and shoulders patterns in general signal tops and bottoms. When looking at the AMC chart, we can see that an inverted head and shoulder pattern is forming:  \n\n\n[inverted head and shoulders pattern forming - AMC](https://preview.redd.it/usv6egq4f2d71.png?width=1428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc762ba263380b8dc4d407c058155ec3e7381224)\n\nHead and shoulders patterns are usually traded by waiting for a break of the neckline, in case of AMC this is around 44 USD. Another popular way of trading these patterns are waiting for a break of the neckline and then waiting for a pullback after the initial break which touches the previously broken neckline. The Yolo way to trade this pattern is to enter when the previous weeks high is broken (around 38.50 USD). \n\nThe stoploss order is usually placed below the right shoulder, so around 34 or below.\n\nThe target of a head and shoulders pattern is the distance from the head to the neckline, applied to the breakout. In the case of AMC, this would be 60 USD.\n\nLet's have a look at other indicators that can signal a change in trend:\n\nRSI:  \nThe RSI indicatoes that the stock is not overbought anymore. It also indicates that price is at support:  \n\n\n[RSI not overbought anymore.](https://preview.redd.it/8304fp12j2d71.png?width=1424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f75b829eb1ea56482a42a01da46ec9df13fc32c8)\n\nMACD:  \nThe MACD indicates a shift of the trend to the upside:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qon8ozywj2d71.png?width=1426&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66636c6273bd54a09e02e87f06cad42dc744f650\n\nThis continuation trade opportunity is definitively worth watching, not only because there is a good probability that we will overshoot 60 by a nice margin. \n\nA break and close below 34 invalidates this analysis.\n\nGodspeed retards.",

        "selftext": "Had to post again because a sentence in my previous post caused it to be deleted.\n\nI apologize in advance for not confirming anyone's bias - if that's what you are looking for stop reading now.\n\nSome of you might know me from my previous AMC/GME analysis where I detailed the setup for the most recent runs:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nexq9s/gme\\_ta\\_big\\_breakout\\_today\\_setup\\_looks\\_better\\_than/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nexq9s/gme_ta_big_breakout_today_setup_looks_better_than/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfg8mj/amc\\_ta\\_broke\\_out\\_big\\_last\\_week\\_best\\_setup\\_since/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfg8mj/amc_ta_broke_out_big_last_week_best_setup_since/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nI've been getting a lot of requests for this, and seen a **ton** of completely false technical analysis for these names, so I figured I would clear the air and provide an **unbiased** roadmap from someone with no position.\n\nLet's dig into the charts -\n\n[$GME 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/4mbrhsb7v1b71.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e328ffbaf0c02398074e571f7e7c88ed860337c)\n\nStarting with $GME, let's break it down color by color:\n\n**(RED)**\n\nAscending triangle coming from upside. These are more likely to have a bullish outcome. However, this is on a longer timeframe. It would break up above **344** and targets **400 --&gt; 450 --&gt; 500.** You would want a daily close to seal the deal. This setup breaks down and is invalid below **163,** from there - no support until **145.**\n\n**(TEAL)**\n\nDescending channel coming from downside. This are bearish in nature. It means the near term trend is down and likely to stay that way unless we break above the upper boundary with a daily close. In this case, you would need a break above **209,** which would target **241.26, 274.29, 291.30 -** and **maybe** the top of the pattern at **344.** Until then, it is sell the rip short term.\n\nWhen a pattern breaks against it's bias - the resulting move is often less pronounced and I look for about half the move I would look for if it broke with it's bias. That's why in this scenario, if we broke above, you would want to see it form a **bull flag, falling wedge, or ascending triangle (continuation pattern)** to get that true follow through to the far end.\n\nThis breaks down with the red setup below that **163** level.\n\n(**YELLOW)**\n\nThese are price levels on the 1 year chart. They are as follows from top to bottom - **291.30, 274.29, 241.26, 205.49, 189.66.** Below, they are resistance. Above, they are support. Under the pattern, support is **145.00, 100.00.**\n\nMoving onto $AMC -\n\n[$AMC 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/xn42mhw5v1b71.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7785ff88f6b50dedbc23436c5b235dad4ae3e759)\n\n**(RED)**\n\nWith that large bounce on **7/8 -** this has actually become a **falling wedge.** These are **bullish** in nature. That being said, we are obviously in danger of breaking it down today. For that to not happen, we must hold **38.54** on every daily close, sloping down each day. Below, **the setup is invalid** and nearby support is at **36.77** and **33.61.**\n\nThe pattern breaks up on a daily close above **55.00** sloping down each day. Price targets for the breakout would be **65.10, 75.00, 100.00.**\n\n**(YELLOW)**\n\nThese are price levels on the 1 year chart. They are as follows from top to bottom - **65.10, 61.18, 51.00, 36.77, 33.61, 20.46, 16.79.** There is a few more but they are so far away there is no reason to plot them. I try to keep my charts as clean as possible.\n\nNote the gap at **33.61 -** this is also one of the most important supports on the chart. Gaps like to be filled, and it's likely we do fill this one.\n\nRemember a breakdown is always confirmed by a candle close on it's respective chart, in this case the daily. For that reason, we could see a candle wick under - fill the gap - wick back over. A close under that level would be very unhealthy and likely mark a move back to **20.46.** This is the highest probability point to go short.\n\n\\---\n\n*Keep in mind technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. I'm providing the most high probability entries &amp; exits - with the most favorable risk/reward ratios. I am not making an absolute prediction of future prices.*\n\n*Not Financial Advice*",

        "selftext": " I truly HATE what has happened to WSB due to the whole FUCKING meme stock revolution.  \n\nInstead of just being happy with ourselves for unexpectedly making bank with TSLA, AMC, GME, et al, many of us thought we were suddenly geniuses.  \n\nAnd many of those who weren't IN on those parties the first time wanted to be THE NEXT TIME!! \n\nWe also got a reputation in the Media for thinking outside the box AND acting in CONCERT to MOVE STOCKS. (In other words something very close to PUMPING!)\n\n     \nThe sub got FLOODED with new people, many of whom were just plain GREEDY and/or STUPID, and many of whom broke the rules. Who weren't FUNNY. Who didn't have anything of value to share. Who wanted just to PUMP their own stock.  Mods were busy night and day trying to keep it reasonable.\n\n All other types  of formerly interesting and often very valuable discussions started to subside. And with it, a very WONDERFUL, and rare good-humor. After called each other names, we actually REACHED OUT WITH KINDNESS to those of us who were experiencing loss or some other trouble. Increasingly, to me at least, it has become less kind, and interesting, and a lot more venal.\n\nIn the last few days, have you seen what is happening to the AMC subs? Its partisans are all on an **ALEX JONES-LEVEL** **CRUSADE** against all the ***im******aginary enemies*** that are ***secretly manipulating*** the prices downward. **NEVER MIND THE STOCK WAS $1.92** on January 1st for good reasons, and could reasonably be expected to return to earth at some point...NOoooo! \n\nThere were 'investigative reports' about illegal naked shorts and fake shares. People started taking it all WAY TOO  SERIOUSLY. They put their student loan money on it, they could barely wait for Friday so they could put their checks on it.  One guy used the fact that he needs to take care of his handicapped mom to put ALL of his money on it.  It now is an ALL OUT WAR against some fuck named Kenny who is supposedly masterminding all this evil. And the only way to fight it is to BUY MORE STOCK.\n\n First of all, it's NOT a conspiracy. Or if it is, we should acknowledge that WE ALSO ARE A CONSPIRACY, okay?ot. But even if it were, how is it effective to just SIT THERE AND LET THEM KEEP CONSPIRING AGAINST YOU??!! I mean, the more you prove you can't win, the more you should just LEAVE THE FUCKING GAME, No? But I am actually worried somebody is going to get HURT  by this. It's TOO SERIOUS,  GUYS. IT HAS TO STOP!!       **I don't want**  **Sept 11 NIHILISM IN MY SUBREDDIT, OKAY?!**\n\nHere's what I think...we need to stop being the fucking 'meme stock promoter boys' and go back to being the 'hidden opportunity exploiters', the class clowns, etc. \n\n I'm pretty much a permabear anyway, and don't try to hide it, but I get yelled at, banned, and called a 'shill' and a lot of other shit for trying to TELL PEOPLE who are not experienced that **WE ARE NOT HERE TO ENDLESSLY PROMOTE MEME STOCKS whose time has GONE.**\n\nSo, I PROPOSE we start SHORTING meme stocks, or buying puts on them. I've made like 60% on my admittedly tiny portfolio in the last 2 days with puts on AMC. I'M  GONNA START RUBBING IT INTO YOUR GREEDY APE ASSES, TOO!!\n\n     \nWhich reminds me.  I am kinda SICK of this APE motif, too. It's so OVER-DONE. Fuck, I didn't VOTE for that! Now all the media is calling us that. Okay, you idiots that want to pretend you are too dumb to care about the valuation of stock but want to call anybody who disagrees with you a SHILL, You be the APES!!  I don't even remember what we were BEFORE. OH YEAH....WE USED TO BE AUTISTS, REMEMBER?\n\n But would we stay on the NEWS, with CNBC counting how many times we mentioned 'blubber' if they had to refer to us a AUTISTS??  NOOOO!! Chad and Veronica would WRITE ANGRY EMAILS to REDDIT. No, we had to TONE IT DOWN. So we became nice, SOFT, friendly apes. Lots of poo and banana joke material there. AH HAHAHAHAHA!! So VERY funny, those apes.\n\nI want Bears, Shorts and AUTISTS to have EQUAL RESPECT. Do you hate Hedge Funds?  GREAT!!! Make a case for us SHORTING THEM and maybe we will do it.  But don't get your damn knickers in a twist if I don't give a shit about your grandma not being able to afford a new colostomy bag because I refuse to help pump your fucking worthless meme stock, **ASSHOLE!!** \n\nAnd if your being TOO DUMB to understand that WHAT GOES UP MUST **EVENTUALLY** GO TITS UP, then good riddance, Monkey Boy!!  FUCK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH!!",

        "selftext": "Did you come to Wallstreetbets today to read a novel? We'll you've come to right post, friend! This hot off the presses steaming pile of trash has it all: charts **and** text! With a side of **disappointment** and **shattered dreams**! All for the low price of wasting time you didn't need anyway!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\nPart 1. The Meme Demystified\n\nPart 2. The Meme Charts\n\n1. GME\n2. AMC\n3. BB\n4. BBBY\n5. CLOV\n6. SPCE\n\nPart 3. The U.S.S. Failboat\n\n1. RKT\n2. WOOF\n\nPart 4. The Week Ahead\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 1. The Meme Demystified**\n\nMy basic thesis for the meme stocks is that they are all following a relatively similar, and somewhat predictable pattern. There was a recent post here that claimed all the meme stocks were totally different plays. This is wrong. In fact, they are all basically the same play, with some variation. Here is a list of the essential elements of the meme stock pattern: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Memes**: This just boils down to retail attention; DDs, memes, ppl posting stupid yolos, etc.\n2. **Option wizardry**: Seeing there is a 'new thing' over on the ol' internets and it's going up, some big money motherfuckers starting buying call options in stupid quantities, forcing market makers to hedge, **the thing** then happens.\n3. **Diamond handing**: A bunch of idiots catch a case of FOMO and pile into the stock at terrible prices, then once they're sitting on devastating losses, they say to themselves: 'you know I *always* believed in this company' and promptly declare they are diamond handed apes, and they'll *never* sell.\n4. **Higher-low**: The refusal to sell by the ~~retards~~ brilliant new investors who see value that others don't, *causes* the rapidly falling stock price to stabilize at a new higher-low, proving the case that their diamond handing actually did something. \n5. Go back to 1 and repeat for another leg higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at the charts in the next part, it's my contention that the higher-low should be at the same level the stock broke out of on the prior move. In other words: spike, drop to breakout, stabilize there, spike again, drop to second breakout, stabilize there, ... repeat until lambo. \n\nSPCE is an example of a case were the stock fell all the way back down after it's early year breakouts, but I'm not sure it ever properly fit the pattern.\n\n***There's no fucking pattern, dipshit. TA doesn't work on meme stocks! It's just randomness!!!!*** I hear you typing in your comment. I see a pattern in these moves. Further, the underlying mechanism of call option wizardry appears the same as well (GME, part 1, notwithstanding). As does the effect of diamond handing.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 2. The Meme Charts**\n\nFirst, let me say the State of the Memes this week is **wounded**.  As the charts show, across the board (except SPCE) the whole of Memelandia got pretty well beat to shit. \n\nStarting with GME: \n\n[GME](https://preview.redd.it/ukgcqozlnma71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c3c70553d72942ff2d3e936e46239c6df908ef6)\n\nGME has completed four rounds on the wheel of lambos. It is, like all the meme stocks, experiencing the early stages of a break down of the pattern. You can fiddle around with were you think Launch #4 should be drawn and put it around $195, then squint and turn you head a little to the right and everything will look just dandy. \n\nIs GME dead? No. Just wounded. Get back up into the Support Zone #4 and it's game on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext AMC:\n\n*Processing img dbivb5gkoma71...*\n\nAMC is that weird kid you went to school with. He was nice enough, but it was always a little awkward to hang out with him. Like you were never quite sure what he was going to do/say next. The reason underlying this is likely the fact that y'all bought damn-near the whole company already. \n\nIs AMC dead? No. It's a weirdo that I expect should drop all the way back to $14.54 before finding support. But at this point it could literally do anything. (Except go up again. That's definitely not happening until we get some kind of consolidation ... somewhere.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone's favorite Canadian, BB:\n\n[Oh, Canada!](https://preview.redd.it/6haay06epma71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52acbe79317f76bf4a9e43636c87a34890197c38)\n\nNot too shabby, not too great. Like the last girl you took home from the bar. You didn't have to get *that* drunk to make the call, but you weren't going to pick her sober. \n\nIs BB dead? No. We've broken under Support Zone #3 (or #2, if you don't want to count the Dec jump as a proper meme launch). However, we haven't completely collapsed, and if you know anything about TA, you know that you can just redraw the lines to reinforce that poorly thought out decision you made when you entered the position in the first place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreat bedside table selection, BBBY:\n\n[I really like these bedside tables... that I got from Wayfair.](https://preview.redd.it/e0d1mj63qma71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3cefbc8df2ff395550d482556355d6bc7f8fe17)\n\nNobody talks about this ticker any more, but it actually looks like its in the best shape of the bunch. \n\nIs BBBY dead? Absolutely not. In fact, I'm thinking of using margin to hop aboard (cause almost all my money is tied up ~~bagholding~~ *with a long term invested in* CLOV). It found support this week right were it was supposed to and it ended the week with green candles. Maybe being forgotten about around here is a good thing.....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeprechaun 8, The Night of Broken Dreams, CLOV:\n\n[I might have to visit a church..... how much do favors from Jesus cost, anyway?](https://preview.redd.it/9swz2j03rma71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6333324df38e3cf30320f0b63f85547e0caead6)\n\nI'm really, really, *really*, hoping my thesis that the price needs to stabilize at the previous breakout point is wrong. Or that I'm drawing the breakout lines wrong. Or that Buddy Jesus is going to forgive me for all those hookers and all that cocaine. I'm sorry, okay!\n\nIs CLOV dead? No, but it just got kicked straight in the nuts and is lying on the ground writhing in pain wondering why a girl that likes you would kick you in the balls to show that she likes you. The $9 mark is basically the last hope. Unless you want to look to SPCE for your comparison (but that's just cherry picking charts to find one that helps you sleep at night; you know, standard practice for TA)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRocketman, Sir Big-balls Branson, SPCE:\n\n[Expect more rockets](https://preview.redd.it/s8t2qm06sma71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed9ab72b20cd2f0662e9d3c64168c98454a63bc5)\n\nI'm not convinced this chart belongs with the others, but I squinted really hard and kinda sorta see how it might fit the pattern. There is just so much extra going on with SPCE that it is not going to play nice for TA. \n\nIs SPCE dead? Of course not. Branson survived, and that means SPCE is going to be just fine. Still, I think a retrace back to \\~$40 looking for support would not be unwarranted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 3. The U.S.S. Failboat**\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list of the failures, but RKT and WOOF stand out to me as examples of Team Fail.\n\nFirst, the not-rocketman, RKT:\n\n[This is not the way to the moon](https://preview.redd.it/kbsinyb3tma71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db532489fb141a71183654af327c744cb68851d8)\n\nNo matter how you redraw my breakout line, this is a clear fail. In fact, after the push up, the stock put in an all-time **low**. That is not how you get a lambo.\n\nIs RKT dead? As a meme stock, yes. Dead and buried. As a long term investment? I could see the case for it, I guess...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnlike, WOOF, which is just hot garbage blended into your dog's food:\n\n[Rocket ship to the Center of Earth. That's where the adventure is!](https://preview.redd.it/zw4u0u7mtma71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce8e9394e6f4be03d1cfddee607d7de0bbb93cb7)\n\nCan you even say this was *ever* a meme stock, proper? I don't think so. This is P&amp;D action. \n\nIs WOOF dead? In all ways, yes. Wasn't there a pet company during the dotcom bubble that went tits up....? Some lessons need to be learned twice it seems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Part 4. The Week Ahead**\n\nAs I said at the beginning of Part 2, the State of the Meme is **wounded**. Last week's action was bad, across the board for everyone not in SPCE (or somehow, someway, for reasons I'll never understand, holding NEGG....). It's not over yet, though. Wounded is not dead. Hell, even dead can just be *mostly* dead. That's what the Princess Bride taught me, and I've learned everything I know from movies, so it must be true. \n\nHowever, a stand **must** be made. A line in the sand **must** be drawn. Someone, somewhere, needs to stand up and say **enough is enough**. We are ~~human beings~~ *just oversized children* god-damnit! \n\nIf we have another week of across the board bleeding, shit has the potential to go south, and fast. On top of it, this coming week has a bunch of options expiring because monthlys. Expect maximum pressure. When you've got your opponent on his back foot, you don't let off, you hit harder. If they smell blood in the water--and the charts look to me like blood in the water--they are going to try to finish the job and obliterate the Defenders of Memelandia once and for all. \n\nDo I honestly think the whole of \"the Suits\" is some cabal that would like to see this crazy ass party stop? No. I'm quite sure a bunch of them are on the long-side of these moves. They ***are*** the Options Wizards. But there are definitely some that want this boat roll over and if it looks like they can do it, then they go for it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Good luck, and may the lambos be with you.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions or ban:\n\n[CLOV &amp; F, a fateful pairing....](https://preview.redd.it/dhka7jy0yma71.jpg?width=1921&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee57b075cdaafef09b519b1491e6d911d60f2aa3)",

You had dreamed of the apocalypse: where your AMC $5 puts would print and your outrage at the valuation for TSLA would be justified. Yesterday signaled the beginning of a beautiful future. A future in which droves of retards would crash and burn, millions would go unemployed, dollar would become worthless and mohawked gangs would roam the earth while you and you alone could gloat while posting your gain porn on WSB. This is you from yesterday:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xigwggswrec71.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee7dff2eabc8ab3b26a8ce2d6086297c235e4aab\n\nBut today it all went poof. SQQQ is in the dumps, your puts are back to -98%, you parents are kicking you out of the \"daylight\" basement and worst of all, you had to delete all your comments on the sub... again. This is you today:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7xkzhdn0sec71.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2679ea435d3e5bac94b112c3af7671330ab6a56\n\nHaving gone through all that, and as a friend, I want to tell you: it doesnt have to be like this. You dont have to be a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. Not that I care about you being \ud83c\udf08. I love and support the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. Be a\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc02 and see if I care. But a \ud83d\udc3b? That\u2019s just a lifetime of suffering.

Any arguments? I didnt think so.\n\nSo I ask you again: do you want to go to the moon or be stuck in a dirty forest getting herpes from Yogi? The choice is yours friend. You too can be a happy tard, gaining money when everybody else gains and losing when everybody else does. You wont be any richer because...retard and all , but you will have friends.

        "selftext": "Did you come to Wallstreetbets today to have your ~~terrible~~ *excellent, well-thought out* investment decisions validated? Are you scrolling endlessly, searching in vein for that sweet, sweet hit of confirmation bias? Well, my friend, this **is** ~~not~~ the post for you! Featuring the great horizontal line drawing skill you've come to expect from a guy named Cbass, with a ***free bonus*** of some non-horizontal lines! Wow! So much value! Wait--THERE IS MORE! Now, for a limited time, some rambling, low-effort DD that you'll probably just scroll past on your way to spamming rocket emojis! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\nPart 1. Meme Status\n\nPart 2. Cum-tastic Charts\n\nPart 3. Donkey Dicks\n\nPart 4. The Short-Term Gamble\n\nPart 5. The Long-Term Gamble\n\nPart 6. And now my Watch has begun....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\------------------------------------------------ \n\n**Part 1. Meme Status**\n\nI've stated [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oib6l8/the_state_of_the_meme_a_ta_of_all_your_favorite/) the definition of 'Meme Stock' I use, but in short it is thus: \n\nMeme-DDs get made &amp; price goes up--&gt;Options Wizards buy options &amp; **Thing** happens--&gt;idiots FOMO in at terrible prices, then diamond hand--&gt;diamond hands result in higher-low--&gt;repeat for next leg up.\n\nBasically, there are two kinds of plays around here: True Memes and P&amp;Ds. The True Memes have two distinguishing features: 1) the involvement of the Options Wizards who buy all those options forcing the MMs to hedge and causing the **Thing**, and 2) after the retracement, the price action stabilizes at a **higher-low**. \n\nObviously, this could all just be me seeing bunnies in every cloud. I'm naught but a simple man with his intentions writ clear upon his trucker hat, so take what you will from my ramblings. However, when comparing the likes of GME, AMC, BB and BBBY with things like RKT, CRSR, WISH, WOOF, etc, it appears there are some tickers that have the follow through after the initial push and those are what I'm calling the True Memes. \n\nSo, is CLOV a True Meme? Answer: **it's hanging on by a worn thread**. \n\nIt remains my contention that a higher-low is a requirement for the 'follow through' on these plays. After all, if the ticker returns back to its pre-meme price (which for many of these is the all-time low), or worse, goes even lower, what then did the 'diamond handing' accomplish? Answer: jack shit. Think of it this way: if a bunch of people flood into the stock and buy up enough of the float, supply and demand dictate that the price *should* stabilize at a higher-low. Yes, the stock market is full of fuckery and it's not as simple as all that, but if the price just slides back to the low, the simple conclusion is: there are not as many of you as you think there are. \n\nAlso, going back down to the pre-meme low, or worse, is about as demoralizing as it can get. Many so-called 'apes' are going to say 'fuck it, I was had' and dump their shares for a loss. Further, it is going to severally damage the image of the play, making it look like 'nothing more than another P&amp;D.'\n\nOf course, I could be proven wrong here. CLOV could fall down and put in a new all-time low before shooting the moon. Who cares if your wrong as long as you still make money\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\------------------------------------------------ \n\n**Part 2. Cum-tastic Charts**\n\nFirst, the daily chart with Cbass's patented horizontal lines:\n\n[Clov-tastic](https://preview.redd.it/2p48jy2j27d71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b6072e7598b01fd3df17d33b2a42a28dd6ea97f)\n\nMy theory regarding the True Memes was not merely a higher-low, but that the higher-low should ***specifically*** be around the breakout level of the previous move. We are way the fuck under that, so I'm just gonna toss that one out the window because it both makes me wrong and fills me with regret. So I've just applied Cbass's Second Law of TA: When you're wrong, just move the lines until you're right again.\n\nLast week, the ticker found some support at $8. Which is technically a 'higher-low', with the all-time low being $6.31. That's $1.69 higher. ***Impressive***. It was actually an obvious place to stabilize (for a few days). I mean, everyone and their mother knows the 92.5% Fibonacci retracement level is like, *totally* the real level and super-duper important. \n\nNext up, I've prepared two charts in accordance with Cbass's First Law of TA: You can always find a chart &amp; indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear.\n\n[Sexy wedge breakout that totally means something](https://preview.redd.it/7l37izwj57d71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81806c9a7a1da78f165d2caad87c6c85459b1073)\n\nAs you can see here, I found the **hidden** downward wedge that we've already broken out of, and therefore the next logical stop is $100/share. ***This is how TA is done***. I've seen some posts by some fucking rank amateurs that I'm pretty sure were referring to me when they claimed that there were people posting 'tons of shitty TA.' Bruh, you wish you had these skills. Cbass don't need no fuckin' Bollinger bands, Keltner somethings, so-called 'moving averages' or any of that fancy bullshit. I *could* do it all with horizontal lines, but look here, I figured out how to draw *other kinds of lines*.\n\nHere's another example of my superior line-skills:\n\n[Look at 'em skills and burn with jealousy](https://preview.redd.it/mstskgyi77d71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b988d3bf2c072f6e219e4dd7b95547e1bdd5ab4)\n\nHere you can see we were in a downward channel from the beginning of the month and we're now not in ***that*** downward channel. Which means we **can't possibly** go down anymore. Again: $100/share imminent. Furthermore, the upper channel has clearly turned from resistance into support. Bruh, it just do get more bullish than this. \n\nExcept if I do this:\n\n[Drawing a sad-face downtrend line](https://preview.redd.it/flgwlice77d71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59d666de69e1bb228c5511f701266f7eb2a068a2)\n\nHere, I just found a different line that maintains the bearish case. In this world, when the price gets back up to the red dashed line, it will be promptly rejected to $0. But I own this stock and this outcome doesn't make me any money, so for ***reasons*** this chart is wrong and we definitely do not exist in this version of reality. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\------------------------------------------------ \n\n**Part 3. Donkey Dicks**\n\nNow, I've never done DD on anything until *after* I bought it. Thus, in keeping with tradition I've taken a cursory glance at the underlying company of this wunderkind of a ticker after finding myself down 40%. In short, it's ***basically shit.*** \n\nSomeone right now is screaming Cathie Woodisms at their screen, like: **disruptor, innovator, AI, machine learning, tech, growth, next-gen**, etc. Dude, these guys sell insurance to old people. Worse, they only sell one kind of insurance: Medicare Advantage. Will they make money in the future? Yeah, sure. But there is no fucking universe where this narrow category of business is going to command a premium like Tesla or whatever the fuck Cathie is pumping these days. You can fantasize about the whole of the human species paying endless subscription fees for the privilege of being driven around in a self-driving Tesla that smells like someone had sex in the back seat. You're high, but it is *technically* possible. Clover Healthcare has a subset of the elderly in one country as their maximum consumer base. And the government has their hand in the mix. \n\n\"But their saving the government money with their ***software platform***!\" 1) The government doesn't actually give a fuck about saving money. If the past two years taught you nothing else, I hope this at least got through. 2) Calling a computer program a 'software platform' doesn't make it anything more than a program where you input information. Is it really that much more than a fancy version of Microsoft Excel? I doubt it, but maybe if they gamify the button clicking they can get people hooked with the dopamine effect. It just looks like advertising to me; kind of like when the term computer program got replaced with 'app' in order to make it sound like something more than just a program running on your phone. Whatever, before I ever get old enough to be on Medicare Advantage, I'm going out in a blaze of hookers and coke so I'll never get the chance to click those buttons. \n\nCLOV gets compared to a lot of the mainline insurers, e.g., United Health Care (UNH). UNH has a market cap *literally* 100x CLOV, and yet people are like \"CLOV totally ***deserves*** to be valued like UNH.\" UNH has an income of $14.5**B**. CLOV is at -$55**M**. Even sitting at a market cap of $395**B**, UNH is only running a p/e of 27.6, with a forward p/e 19.4. They are a massive company that offers all varieties of insurance and they are making fucking bank, thus their stock is steadily climbing to the moon. You can point at the 80/20 rule and make the case that it is responsible for the spirally cost of health care in America and I'll nod my head and agree, but that does not mean CLOV is riding into this dusty town to save the day. They are in too narrow a category to have an appreciable effect on overall costs, in my opinion--assuming they have any effect at all. \n\n\"But Clover is growing at ***double digits***!\" It's easy to grow double digits when you start with no customers. After 2023, I believe the estimate is 5-7% per year. It's not terrible, but it's not going to take you to the moon. If CLOV is able to expand out into the general insurance market and take away market share from the big boys, then okay, there's some case for the crazy valuations people are throwing around. But I've as much chance of snorting lines off the titties a Victoria's Secret model while raw-dogging her on the hood of a brand new lambo parked on my yacht... anchored off the pristine white sand beaches of my new private island.\n\n[Be Bold, sign up for Globo Gym](https://preview.redd.it/ecokntoqi7d71.jpg?width=970&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=827d4edb502eb6f0993de5c284bc6b9e2d2182b2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\------------------------------------------------ \n\n**Part 4. The Short-Term Gamble**\n\nSo, given that the TA on CLOV is a crap shoot (as all TA is) and the underlying company is less than amazing, why the fuck would anyone in their right mind buy this ticker. Simple: **gambling**. That is what CLOV was, is, and all it ever will be: a gamble. And *you came here gamble,* because this is the fucking casino. That's why I bought it. I was wrong about an immediate turn around after the first launch and so now I'm stuck sucking pond scum. Such is life. \n\nIs the short-term gamble over? No, not yet. As the charts show, CLOV is bottoming out, which means the next direction ***should*** be up. Obviously, because it's gambling, down is possible, but nobody came here to hear that. Furthermore, CLOV remains one of the top tickers sentiment-wise. A lot of eyes balls has the potential to materialize that sudden move upward that everyone is pretending they're not here for. On top of that, the SI remains high. I think the importance of SI is way overblown, but most people think otherwise and that belief alone will drive retail toward the ticker. Finally, it looks like the Options Wizard took one shot at this thing (I don't know this for certain), and there is a chance they will come back around to it if things start moving up. Thus, there remains the potential for a second massive launch. \n\nSo let's assume someone is looking at this and thinking, \"Okay, based on the charts I might take a stab at this.\" The next question is: Get in now, or wait for $7? This is impossible to answer, of course, but if you are like me, then if you buy now, it will drop to $7 because the stock market exists to fuck with you, ***specifically***. By the same rule, if you wait, then it will take off without you and you'll FOMO in at $25. Pick your poison.\n\nOf course, my theory of these plays states a breakdown back to lows ends the play. If it does happen, I will obviously just revise my theory so that I'm still not wrong--because I do TA how it's supposed to be done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\------------------------------------------------ \n\n**Part 5. The Long-Term Gamble**\n\nLong-term, CLOV is still just a gamble. The delusional idiots will tell you this is a 'can't fail' investment. All investments can fail, including this one. People like the 'fall-back' position: i.e., I gambled on the short-term jump and lost, but that's okay because long-term this is a 100% winner. This is how you get ~~delusional bagholders~~ *a cult*. \n\nAt the current price level, is CLOV a good long-term gamble? It's the definition of mediocre. Will it be at $500 in ten years, 'because that's where UNH is now.' Not unless JPow initiates hyperinflation, in which case that new fleshlight you've got on your Amazon wishlist is going to be a $1000--so, you know, *bigger* problems. A more reasonable target is mid-20s (low $30s at best) within 2-5 years assuming there is no moon landing and the retail interest dies off and CLOV becomes just another ticker in the garden. The current 12-month average price target is $10.30.  Again: **This is gambling**.\n\nThere are a bunch of believers for this stock (like any ticker that gets its own sub reddit), and I think if we end up in the long-gamble, much like poor Lord Stannis, they will be in for some disappointment.\n\n[What you thought you bought vs. What you actually bought](https://preview.redd.it/giidi4f4q7d71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c200009a29a4702ba7ca271b799dd3dce03ade6c)\n\n \n\n\\------------------------------------------------ \n\n**Part 6. And now my Watch has begun**\n\nI'm a bagholder. I'm not gonna lie about, bullshit you, tell you I'm happy about it, or claim I've discovered the secret to curing your financial woes. Much like Stannis, First of His Name, Rightful King of the Seven Kingdoms, I thought I was to be the savoir of my own story and yet here I am, freezing my balls off at the Wall with a bunch flee-ridden dudes and an old lady in magic makeup, waiting to see if the cold or the ice zombies kill me first. \n\nAs you can see from my positions below, I'm not in the worst spot--not in the best, either. My odds of break-even are pretty good. I might have to wait two years to get there, but I think I'll get there even if CLOV falls off the face of the internet. My odds of doubling my money are okay, if I'm patient enough. Which I won't be... obviously. Odds of 10x in 10 years *without* the Wizardry: 0.1%, ***exactly***. Like all my trades, my entry into this position is full of shoulda, coulda, woulda's. So it is will us all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Good luck, and may the lambos be with you.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions or ban, (AKA the ***Portfolio of Destiny***):\n\n[CLOV &amp; F, the true, can't fail, Vegas marriage](https://preview.redd.it/ta174h3lt7d71.jpg?width=1930&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bce669c77d629d9bb73e4726750000a4afb5a2a)",

A massive 10% on a large float stock. Great job to anyone who bought into the DD a month or so ago on NOK and made profit. \n\nOther then that just a normal day.

        "selftext": "# SOFI to Fly Pre earnings 8/20\n\n**I have read so many DD's on this sub regarding SOFI. Many of those DD's were just people trying to pump their position in order get some tendies. I will make sure to only summarize and include some parts of those DD's that were not meant for pump &amp; dump. This is a NON BIASED SOFI DD &amp; Analysis. Let's get started -**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***What is SOFI?***\n\n**Social Finance, Inc aka SoFi** is an American online personal finance company. A mobile-first service based in San Francisco, SoFi provides a suite of financial products that includes student loan refinancing, checking accounts, mortgages, personal loans, credit cards, stock investing and banking through both their mobile app and desktop interfaces. It is an ALL in one app for all your financial and investing needs.\n\nLook at the products sofi has to offer. The company has an amazing easy to use user interface and very smooth app.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1bam7fqzec71.png?width=2658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64ff396904447a22bd4d94af98271f93887d63b1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What separates SOFI from other competitors?\n\nThe one single factor that gains Sofi a lot of revenue and sales is **\"Convenience\".** Because they provide a lot of services, they are able to attract their customers to get different products.\n\nLet's say you decide to buy a car and go to Sofi for a car loan. The Sofi team asks you to provide your Social security, pay stubs, previous bills, etc. and then finally grants you a car loan. Now, let's say after 3 months your friend who has been making a bank trading AMC and GME tells you to invest and you don't have a brokerage account. You eventually would end up knocking SOFI's door and ask them to let you invest because why the fuck would you want to fill out forms and apply at other brokerages. Now, let's say after couple of months of trading, you end up losing all your money because you're an APE who yolo'ed entire savings into 1st ever options play. Now, you need money for that business degree because you suck at investing. What would you do here? Would you go to some student loan company and fill out all the forms, provide credit history, etc. or would you just call up SOFI and ask them to loan you some tendies? The simple answer is **\"Call up SOFI\" because it's convenient.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# SOFI also came up with IPO investing.\n\nYou can now invest in IPO's even before they're traded on an exchange. Cool, innit?Unlike Robinhood, SOFI would never restrict the sale of the securities to the members in secondary markets. However, if you invest in an IPO and sell within 30 days then you might be restricted from IPO purchase for next 30 days or so. More details can be found on their website - \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcmkpaqrzec71.png?width=2852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afbaa5cff6c608b2262c4ee20a53d4c9fa06893b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# History of SOFI &amp; how did it become such a big company\n\nSoFi was founded in 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, four students who met at the Stanford. The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. The company's inaugural loan program was a $2 million pilot at Stanford. For this pilot, 40 alumni invested about $2 million in approximately 100 students, for an average of $20,000 per student.\n\nThe founders were soon able to raise $1billion from softbank few years ago. The company is very successful and trading way below their valuation price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Let's have a look at the SOFI's chart this year\n\nThis is 1 year chart for Sofi, it has a very very strong support at 15$. The stock has gone below 15$ only twice in 2021 and then rallied the following 2 weeks. The movement of this stock is like a spring, a huge dip is followed by an insane highs. The earnings are due 8/20 and I strongly believe that this stock will run before the earnings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/na00wbnszec71.png?width=2134&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb97b09ec2f01c7b8085470e82a09c6ac9243ca2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Price Targets\n\nMichael Miller, an equity analyst at morning star said that $20.50 is a Fair Value for this stock. It's currently trading at $15.10 at the time of writing this DD. That's an upside of 25%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vgaq59ntzec71.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22ec9ef2f9c9302c86e930bd90db0a8641bb7c96\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Summary of why is SOFI a good play?***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* A very strong support at 15$ price, in the last 7-8 months, this stock has rallied after a huge dip. With the earnings coming up for this company, I am positive that there will be a rally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Sofi is positioned to be a #1 leader in the fintech sector. They are jacks of all trades and offering different products to their customers all within one app or website.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Convenience of being able to apply for student loans, investing, mortgages will attract consumers because who wants to end up applying at different companies for different needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Sofi acquired GALILEO which is a very big company. You haven't heard of this company yet because it's a B2B company. Sofi paid about 1.2B$ for it. They're basically a payment processing platform like stripe, square, paypal etc which is used by all top fintech companies around the globe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The main goal of SOFI is to be able to provide as many products and services they can to their consumers. They are soon going to be a OneStopShop. Their goal is to basically become an amazon of FinTech and provide all the services in one place. By acting as a one-stop shop for its customer\u2019s finances, SoFi intends to create powerful cross-selling advantages that will reduce its cost of acquisition and give it a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* SOFI has acquired Golden Pacific Bancorp and applying to become a national bank in the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The company saw its client growth accelerate in 2020, with more than 2.2 million members on its platform by the end of the first quarter of 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The company\u2019s expanded product lineup along with increased adoption of digital banking during the pandemic has helped accelerate SoFi\u2019s growth, with the number of members increasing by nearly 80-90% in 2020. Rapid growth has continued into 2021, and SoFi remains the only company utilizing a digital full-service model, giving it a clear product niche. Source - morningstar\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* It is projected that SOFI would get an approval to become a bank in late 2021 or early 2022.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* It is projected that revenue will increase at a 43% CAGR over the next five years as the company benefits from its unique product offering as well as the revenue contributed by its 2020 acquisition of Galileo, which is only the one section of SOFI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* During the company\u2019s SPAC merger, the company issued equity to PIPE investors to raise more than $1.2 billion in capital, on top of the $800 million that was generated by the SPAC merger itself. This along with debt paydown that occurred both immediately prior and during the SPAC merger has left the company in a good financial position.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* SoFi has more than $2 billion in cash and over $4 billion in debt, but that entire debt money is used to finance its lending activities. I believe that there is only little financial risk for SoFi, and incase company decides to re strategize their investment decisions then they would have plenty of money to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The adjusted Net Revenue and EBITDA are increasing and trending in the right direction, with 151% and 70% growth YOY respectively and the total products used by members has grown by 121% YOY and financial products has grown 273% YOY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR ;**\n\n**Not a Finance Advice**\n\n**The stock could rally prior to earnings on 8/20**\n\n**$18-$20 calls expiring 8/20**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPosition :\n\n50 contracts, strike 20$ expiring 8/20\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/auclbtwlzec71.jpg?width=739&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9eb33422179e9b6c0ca93bdb94ff0c177132697b",

        "selftext": "**Preamble:**  Let\u2019s just say that Robinhood has seen better days. A vast majority of us absolutely hate Robinhood right now. I feel that it\u2019s justified given the blatant disregard they had for retail investors during the GME saga. Adding to this, most of their revenue is driven by the extremely controversial Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) which is currently in the focus of SEC.\n\nBut rational investors do not reject a company completely based on how they feel about the company\u2019s business practices. In an ideal world, capital allocation happens based on alignment with the mission statement and practices of the company, but there\u2019s more than one way to make a profit in the market.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of companies doing extremely well even though they have been in the continuous focus of public ire and legal issues (Think Nestle with their dubious practices, BAC after the Occupy Wall-Street movement, EA with their micro-transactions, and Amazon with worker abuse).\n\nAnd for all the hate Robinhood gets and posts about moving out of Robinhood, just sort the gain/loss/yolo posts for the last month in any investing subreddit and you can still see a significant chunk of trades being made through Robinhood.\n\nYou can choose to not use their product, but it\u2019s not financially prudent to reject an investment opportunity without due diligence. All the DDs that I have seen exclusively focus on the negative aspects and then reject the IPO, and I think that\u2019s unfair. Especially given that over the past 20 years, [\\~69% of IPO\u2019s have gained value on listing day with an average increase of 12%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/)That\u2019s a 12% average gain in just one day!\n\nBasically, what I wanted to know was this \u2013 **Is Robinhood IPO a good investment opportunity?**\n\nSo, strap in while I try to condense 300+ pages of Robinhood S1 and my own views into a 5-minute read on **The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of Robinhood**.\n\nThe Beginnings\n\nRobinhood had a spectacular launch by any metric. They had [amassed nearly 1 million users](https://medium.com/inside-viral-loops/how-robinhood-got-nearly-1-million-users-before-the-company-even-existed-dfb1a57231f8) before the company even existed by gamifying their beta program. Their promise was very simple. $0 transaction fees for all the trades.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/x2uft7pjiwc71.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29f594d10a96fc494640e62171baef195855855e)\n\nFrom the very beginning, [Robinhood had planned to create revenue](https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/18/zero-commission-stock-trading-robinhood/?_ga=2.76461904.47963929.1626865862-335952608.1624635175) from\n\na.\u00a0Premium API access\n\nb.\u00a0Trading on margin\n\nc.\u00a0Interest from holding custody of user\u2019s assets\n\nd.\u00a0Payment for order flow\n\n### The Good\n\n**Growth:**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/t9tg350liwc71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd626b15048e4b0d63c1a7e5a3a1ae0d00ddf261)\n\nThe company has grown exponentially over the years (even before the meme stock frenzy) with them approximately doubling the funded user base every year. The current retail frenzy only pushed up this growth rate. Adding to this, 80% of the users who joined them in 2020 were through word-of-mouth and Robinhood Referral which enabled them to grow organically. We don\u2019t have enough data to tell how this has changed following the GME scandal, but the one thing we can be sure of is that people are definitely still talking about them. The revenue has also followed suit growing by 309% for the year ended Q1\u201921.\n\n**Profitability \\[1\\]:**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/sccvtzuliwc71.png?width=472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=639fb6255f6298bca22ee6f3d286da79429a9f3b)\n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely for a company that is growing almost 100% every year to be profitable, especially in the tech world. But Robinhood was briefly profitable in 2020 before having a $1.4B net loss in Q1\u201921 due in part to a $1.5B fair-value adjustment to convertible notes and warrant liability.\n\n**Product:**\n\nIt\u2019s undeniable that they have a very well-designed product suite. It makes it very easy for first-time investors to invest in stocks (this is also reflected in their user base with more than 50% of them being first-time investors). The Robinhood gold monthly subscription program currently has more than 1.4 MM customers. Adding to this, their \\*rypto, cash management, and educational solution combine to create a well-suited ecosystem for first-time investors. The stickiness of the product can easily be seen in the monthly active user numbers.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/c06u6ksmiwc71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52e1b83a70ececce4283513e39f5521d764dbd14)\n\n### The Bad\n\n**Revenue Stability**\n\nRobinhood\u2019s income is highly dependent on retail investors getting into the riskiest investments \u2013 Options, \\*ryptos and Margin. This would be extremely dependent on a highly volatile market that we saw over the past year. Once/if this settles down, the revenue stream is bound to reduce. This in itself would generate a conflict of interest with Robinhood actively encouraging this risk-taking in the user interface, through [dark patterns and gamifying the experience](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html).\n\n**Competition**\n\nAlmost all the major competitors who used to charge a per transaction trading fee have now [cut down their commission to zero](https://money.usnews.com/investing/portfolio-management/articles/brokers-that-offer-commission-free-trading). While this might not be the only USP of Robinhood, for a new investor coming into the trading ecosystem, Robinhood is not a compelling choice given the controversies surrounding them. The only thing they have going for them with regards to competition is an exceptional user interface, which again is subjective to the user.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nAccording to the [updated prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021013986/robinhoods-1a1.htm), Robinhood is aiming for an initial price target of $38-42 a share, which would value the firm at $27-35 Billion. The company expects to raise around $2.2 Billion from this IPO. While a high valuation is not unlikely for a tech company, $HOOD is potentially valued now at 37x historical FY 2020 Price-to-Sales or P/S. This, when compared to Charles Schwab (10.8x) and Tiger brokers (20.1x) is on the higher side. Most probably the justification for such a high valuation is their current trajectory of customer growth and the average age of the customer (younger customers tend to be more valuable over the long run).\n\n### The Ugly\n\n**Payment For Order Flow (PFOF) \u00a0and Regulatory Risks \\[2\\]**\n\nAhh, finally we come to the most controversial part of Robinhood. The irony here is that PFOF was invented by Bernie Madoff. If you want a detailed understanding of PFOF, you can read it [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp) or [here](https://a16z.com/2021/02/17/payment-for-order-flow/). The TLDR version is\u00a0\n\n&gt;A broker takes your market buy order for 100 shares of Acme, Inc., aggregates it with all the other small Acme buy orders, and sells that to a market maker, who fills the order. The market maker pays your broker for the volume\n\nThe spread between the buy and sell orders are then shared by the market maker (in Robinhood\u2019s case Citadel) and the Brokerage (Robinhood).\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6dl9gqdoiwc71.png?width=515&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c14cda402a97628c136bc66d406d8e1ef41973e2)\n\nAlmost all the major players (except Fidelity) have some amount of revenue coming in from PFOF and this is not necessarily a bad thing. From my understanding, this actually benefits the retail investor by moving the cost of the transaction from the user to the market maker.\n\nBut the main concern for Robinhood here is the amount of revenue they are generating from PFOF.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/se7aogbpiwc71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01521f90aa415d277ebb372996cbf212544676b4)\n\nFor Q1\u201921, 81% of the company\u2019s revenue came from transaction-based revenue (PFOF). In contrast, PFOF contributes [less than 20% for TD Ameritrade](https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/AMTD/no-login-required/0P4oc9vg/TD-Ameritrade-Revenues-How-Does-Ameritrade-Make-Money-) and Charles Schwab. Adding to the high risk of having more than 80% of revenue from one source, Robinhood has been repeatedly fined for not having the customer\u2019s best interest in mind.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0FINRA fined HOOD $1.25M in 2019 for not getting customers the best prices\n\n\u00b7\u00a0FINRA announced that Robinhood would pay a record $70M in fines and restitution over the outages and Robinhood agreed to the settlement.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0They are facing more than [90 lawsuits after the GameStop trading halt](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/robinhood-faces-lawsuits-after-gamestop-trading-halt.html)\n\n\u00b7\u00a0Finally, SEC chairman Gary Gensler has said that not every country allows PFOF and they are going to take a closer look into PFOF.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRobinhood started off with an extremely promising idea and then dropped the ball at its most important moment. Undoubtedly, they are going to report a blowout Q2 earnings report shortly following the listing and the stock is going to pump (They would have made a killing with the Dog\\*coin rally in April and May and other meme stock rallies such as AMC/CLOV in Q2\u201921).\n\nAnother interesting insight that we could make from their Q2 report when it\u2019s announced is if they had any net user attrition following the scandal. The age-old saying of \u201cany publicity is good publicity \u201c would be put to test! If they still maintained their growth story with AUM and active user base increasing consistently, that would be impressive, and we would know that the investor sentiment that we are seeing now is not actually translating to lost business.\n\nWe might need to re-evaluate this analysis once the IPO is over and they have announced their Q2 report and the market has settled down. But right now, given that we have an overall picture of the company and how they make money, **I feel that the risk factors far outweigh any potential listing gains that you could make**!\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] It\u2019s extremely hard to be objective when the company keeps on trying to pull one over you. The following chart is from Robinhood\u2019s official filing to SEC. They have shown +7MM and -57MM net income as the same size (that red line is the same length in both). Note that the losses are also shown in green and the scale is completely off. The actual scale can be found in the post.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/5lk9oppqiwc71.png?width=607&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5908ee207b1cbc278f53185cc9b6656b22e8a8ae)\n\n\\[2\\] Fun fact: The risk factor section in the S1-Filing is 75 pages long and over 52,000 words. No wonder their Chief Legal Officer Daniel Gallagher (Ex-SEC Commissioner) got that $30 million bonus.\n\n*As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.*\u00a0Hope you enjoyed this week\u2019s analysis.",

        "selftext": "### The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week \u2013** **SPY** finished the week above its bullish expected move, up 1.5% vs the 0.8% options were pricing. The SPY has moved more than its expected move and established new highs over the past few weeks, while its implied volatility (and expected move) has compressed as moves have mostly been in one direction to the upside.\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are pricing about a **0.7%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming (4 day) week. That corresponds to about **$429** as a *bearish consensus* and **$437** as a *bullish consensus*.\n\n**Implied Volatility** \u2013 The VIX was lower into the holiday weekend, closing at around 15. That\u2019s the lowest levels of market implied volatility since pre-pandemic. In January 2020, before the Covid sell-off, the VIX was as low as 12. Its historical mean is near 19 but that incorporates long periods of time of low volatility (and the VIX in the low teens) with occasional bouts of extreme volatility and spikes in the VIX.\n\nLooking out on the VIX futures curve, December VIX futures are about 22. In other words, near-term options are compressed, while expectations of future volatility (and therefore latter month option prices) are trading higher.\n\nThose looking for near-term hedges will find options prices on the inexpensive side historically, and the least expensive in over a year. Those implementing short premium strategies near term (covered calls, iron condors, credit put/call spreads etc.) will find the premiums (or ranges that they are selling) tighter than they have been in over a year.\n\nExpected Moves for This Week (via **Options AI**):\n\n* SPY **0.7%** (was 0.8% last week)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### In the News\n\nAs markets made new highs meme stocks were once again some of the most actively traded names, yet their implied volatilities (and expected moves) have tended to compress from a few weeks ago. Here are the expected moves for this week in some of the trending tickers, and their change vs their expected moves from last week (mostly less, albeit with a 4 trading day week):\n\n* Gamestop **GME 8%** (was 13% last week)\n* AMC Theaters **AMC 13%** (was 15% last week)\n* Virgin Galactic **SPCE 13%** (was 19% last week)\n* Contextlogic **WISH 11%** (was 16% last week)\n* Clover Health **CLOV 11%** (was 13% last week)\n* Workhorse **WKHS 11%** (was 10% last week)\n\n### \n\n### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings\n\nEarnings reports are on the light side this week. Things pick up over the next few weeks with some of the big banks next week and big tech later in the month.\n\nHere's a sneak peek out to the week of July 12th, with GS, JPM, BAC, WFC and more set to report. Link [here](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings-calendar/next-week) to the earnings calendar, free to use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8v1drhtpkf971.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=187e2ce72390df37cb6c67af125c71c5dd46d69c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0tyqcrn3lf971.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=237dd04703b01805d309c9a1bd8822289ee3e8c7\n\nLet me know what I missed or if you have any questions about options in a low vol environment. The TL:DR version is that options have a hard time pricing a steady move higher, but that could create some opportunities for those looking to scoop options on the cheap side, particularly hedges. It also means that individual stock volatility can sometimes overshoot to the cheap side, especially if it has some idiosyncratic event coming up (like earnings). On the short premium side, if the trades are near term, it's basically a battle between low implied vol and realized vol (actual moves). IOW, it's all about expected moves.",

        "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI started noticing that theres alot of hype around tech stock like WISH, GME, AMC, SOFI, MRIN. I understand the whole short squeeze and potential pop for all of them (as we have clearly seen) but we dont we talk about another industry like EV or even cannabis stocks.\n\nJust wondering what peoples options and opinions on legalization and where this could go in terms of cannabis stocks such as these and more. Some of them aren't penny stocks and have alot of cash and potential on them. What are you thoughts? Personally I'm in TLRY but I may get into the other three for speculation purposes and the big pop. I think mid july is a good time for cannabis what a out you.\n\nIf you want to DM me or talk in a discord chat I'd love to even get know what other investment people are making outside of the WSB community and maybe what kind of weed that people enjoy and for which purpose (pain, thc, cbd, oil or whatever you use)\n\nLet's talk!!",

        "selftext": " So, I did a DD on $PTON a few months ago, which brought me to this competitor company. I would\u2019ve included it on my list of competitors in that post, but it hadn\u2019t merged at the time.\n\nI see this company as a potential 2-3x bagger either in the short-term or within 1-2 years, and here\u2019s why.\n\n**Overview:**\n\nBeachbody ($BODY) is a fitness company that\u2019s been operating for 20+ years (founded in 1998). They\u2019ve just recently completed a three-way merger with FRX and Myx Fitness.\n\nBeachbody has brought their digital content, fitness instructors and subscribers, as well as nutritional products to the table. Myx Fitness has brought their fitness equipment.\n\nUnder the name Beachbody, they plan to be a direct competitor of Peloton, but aiming at the \u201ceveryman\u201d market as opposed to the health nut/upper-income market like Peloton. For that reason, their subscriptions and equipment are cheaper. \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Here\u2019s what makes it look good:**\n\n* 400 million in cash on hand\n* Zero debt \n* 3.2 million subscribers \n* 95.8% month over month digital retention \n* 1 billion in combined revenue estimated for 2021\n* Has some big names on board \u2013 Arnold Schwarzenegger, LeBron James, Shaq\n* Has experienced CEOS directing things, especially in the area of digital content service \u2013 Kevin Mayer (ex-CEO of TikTok, and ex-VP of Disney+), Carl Daikeler (CEO and founder of Beachbody), Jon Longdon (CEO of OpenFit and co-founder of Beachbody)\n* Carl Daikeler claims he doesn\u2019t plan to sell a single share\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can read more about the merger and the company\u2019s info in [this article](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/forest-road-acquisition-corp-and-the-beachbody-company-announce-combined-first-quarter-2021-financial-results-for-beachbody-and-myx-2021-05-19-91591019?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts&amp;tesla=y). \n\nSo, basically, we\u2019ve got a company with experience, seemingly good financials, a massive subscriber pool (many of whom are fanatical like PTON subscribers), and excellent retention rate.\n\nYou can read about the details of expected earnings, their plans and products through the [investor presentation](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f75fdc89cf35e7524ec4b54/t/6023f07523d4531acaea9e8b/1612968070409/Beachbody+PIPE+Presentation.pdf).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So, with all this promise, why is the price of the stock so low?**\n\nWell, for one thing, it has just merged, and a drop after de-spacing while people lock in profits is common. Also, Beachbody hasn\u2019t had much PR, so there hasn\u2019t been a lot to push this stock up. It\u2019s relatively undiscovered by the wider market and volume is low. \n\nMarket makers have been using this to their advantage, and are having a great time pushing around retail. They\u2019ve been shorting it heavily, taking it as low as it can go to make maximum profit.\n\nFor this reason, buying shares rather than options is the better choice. Last month, the MMs took the stock price down to precisely $9.99 at the very end of the day of expiry of $10 calls, so that they\u2019d all expire worthless. The manipulation was blatant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So, if MMs are controlling this stock, why am I bullish?**\n\nBecause all it takes is a bit of PR and volume, and this stock could take off. The MMs are controlling this right now because they can, but it\u2019s impossible for that to last forever once there\u2019s PR, earnings and the wider market recognises its value. They\u2019ve shorted it HEAVILY, and last I read it was at approx. 27% short interest percentage, and only 40,000 shares (https://fintel.io/ss/us/BODy) available to short.\n\nIt's also been the only other NYSE stock on the SSR list along with $AMC.\n\nCatalysts are already starting which is recently pushing up the share price. The first 2 analysts have brought out their PTs \u2013 one at **$12** and another at **$16**, so analysts thus far are decidedly bullish on $BODY.\n\nBeachbody\u2019s CEO Carl states they plan to spend a lot of their cash on marketing, so we can expect to hear more and more about Beachbody in the coming months.\n\nNow, I can\u2019t say how much the MMs are allowing this price rise right now, but the fact of the matter is, in this current market and with all the catalysts expected to come, it\u2019s highly unlikely they could maintain this low share price permanently. At some point they have to cover or reverse position. \n\n**Short Squeeze**\n\nSome people are talking about a short squeeze with regards to this stock, which, yes, it\u2019s a potential short squeeze candidate, but if there\u2019s one thing $GME and $AMC has shown us, it\u2019s that you need a LOT of buying pressure to even have a chance of that. It\u2019s pretty rare to have a short squeeze happen, and I\u2019m not hanging my hopes on that. The thing is, in my opinion, we don\u2019t NEED a short squeeze here. The MMs must know that this isn\u2019t a sustainable position for a growing company, but since we\u2019re still early in the game, they can eke as much money as possible out of retail before more big boys and more retail buyers load in.\n\nA lot of people, including myself, aren\u2019t selling because it\u2019s obvious this stock is worth more than its current price. It\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\n**Bearish Points:**\n\n1) *There are many who say this company will fail because it\u2019s got some MLM practices.* \n\nThat would worry me if they hadn\u2019t been in operation for 20+ years, and, as shitty as I sound, I\u2019m not bothered since other MLM-type companies like Herbalife do just fine. I just want to make money on the stock. The fact that it\u2019s got ex-Disney+ and ex-TikTok CEO on board makes me even more confident.\n\n2) *Things are still speculative. We haven\u2019t seen their earnings yet.* \n\nYep, fair enough. There is still some risk in that regard. There\u2019s also the likelihood this merger and future expenses like R&amp;D and marketing will cut into their profits, possibly making it negative for a year or two like Peloton was. However, this current market is very bullish and forward-looking, so I could see the stock price going up or maintaining anyhow, especially since it\u2019s already so low. \n\n3) *This is a pandemic stock. After the pandemic is over, it\u2019ll crash along with Peloton.*\n\nIt certainly looks like we're in a bubble right now, and many are holding their breath for when that bubble might burst, or at least have a bunch of corrections. I can see it happening with Peloton at some point (it\u2019s already had a correction though it\u2019s climbing back up), but this stock price is already so low, it can\u2019t really fall much further, so in that way it\u2019s very low-risk compared to a lot of other investments. Great upside, small downside. Also, the pandemic has changed things permanently, and while I agree it has given stocks like PTON a big boost, I\u2019m of the belief that this technology is going to be the future, so I\u2019d expect both PTON and BODY to recover eventually, even if they happen to be brought down by corrections.\n\n**Disclosure:** I currently have 1,100 shares at $10.34. My PT is between $15-18 in the short-term providing the overall market stays bullish, and $25-35 within 1-2 years. As always, do your own DD, don\u2019t take my word for it, etc., etc.",

        "selftext": "So I'm wondering what other people's perspectives/plans are when the stock market crashes. I personally haven't bought a single paper asset in over a year. Stock markets are at all time highs right now, I honestly cant understand why a long term investor would buy paper assets right now. Short term plays make sense, the stock market has always been appealing to the get rich quick type, however this year has shown me that people are living in fantasia. My friend truly believes AMC will top 1k, that is living in fantasy land, but he isnt alone lol. I've chosen real assets(gold, silver, real estate, precious gems/metal) in preparation to make $ off the crash, I'm also learning how to buy property without using any of my own $. Cash flow business makes debt obsolete. What's your hedge? And damnit dont use the C word, as much as I love it and buy it these mods will remove my post",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow apes r/wallstreetbets. Long time lurker here, decided to make account earlier this year since everything went private and just causal browsing became almost impossible amongst all the market drama. I have decided to put together this DD, but I would appreciate any critical commentary if you see something I'm missing or if you know more on the topic.   \n\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \n\n\n* I have been passive investor for most of my life, only this year, I have started being more active with trades and scalps. \n* I have no professional financial training and I am not a financial advisor\n* I could be just any random 13 year old kid from the internet telling you what to do.  \n\n\nTake all the information here with the grain of salt and do your own judgement.  \n\n\n# About SHEN\n\n[SHEN](https://www.google.com/search?q=shen+stock&amp;rlz=1C1GIVA_enDK879DK879&amp;oq=shen+stock&amp;aqs=chrome.0.35i19i39j69i57j69i60l3.1018j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), or Shenandoah Telecommunications Company is telecommunication company providing various broadband, wifi, fiber optic services. Totalling 1139\\~ employees and being in business since 1902, you can see that we are talking about a company that has been around for some time, managed to adapt and be a relative success in oversaturated market.  \n\n\nSHEN has few major streams of revenue:  \n\n\n* Access, Local, and Fiber Lease\n* Cable Service\n* Wireless\n* External revenues and investments   \n\n\nI won't go deep into the all of these streams, briefly what you need to know is that the Company has sold their wireless asset sale to T-Mobile US and is focusing more on their broadband infrastructure, further expanding their main source of revenue.  \n\n\n# Fundamentals \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember reading [Intelligent Investor](https://www.google.com/search?q=intelligent+investor&amp;rlz=1C1GIVA_enDK879DK879&amp;oq=intelligent+investor&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j46j0j0i395l4j69i65.1819j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) or listening to any financial legend talking about P/E ratios, EPS, ROE and bunch of other things that you barely understood even though they seemed important ?  \n\n\nIn the times when everything is priced in several years ahead, it's really hard to find a company with solid fundamentals, that is still going under the radar.   \n\n\n* Shares outstanding - 49.94 mil\n* Market Cap - 2.84 B\n* P/E - 17.24\n* EPS - 3.30$\n* Divi yield - 0.60%\n* Avg. volume - 187K\n* ROE - 29%  \n\n\nFor a company in oversaturated market such as Telecommunications and controlled by giants such as T-Mobile, Verizon, Viacom, to keep such a great fundamentals is nothing but amazing. How did they achieve it ? Simple, while everyone was trying to dominate big cities and get the main piece of cake, SHEN was focusing on expanding their influence in the rural areas. Yes, internet, exists, outside of the metropolis and even the folk in the country side want to be online so they can eat some popcorn watching you lose your life savings on AMC puts.   \n\n\nLet's sum up why these fundamentals are a good sign of a healthy company. Anything with P/E under 20 is almost a unicorn nowadays, everything is being priced in several years ahead and on potential that might not be there yet, while SHEN goes under the radar this entire time.   \n\n\nIn Short, SHEN does better in fundamentals than most of the Industry respective to the company size.   \n\n\nWhat this all mean ? In the most simplistic way, with 52 Week 38.77-57.65 you can be certain that the company is not going away anytime soon, they have been around for more than 100 years, they are slowly expanding, sure it's not Google, it's not T-Mobile, but they are keeping it lowkey in the rural areas where there is still plenty of room to expand, opposite to the big cities where you have to rival the giant companies.   \n\n\nThe company is beating expectations on quarterly basis  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mooxgloo7g971.png?width=331&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02ee797165edab7b125aaaf7b3b7fb1717312ed2\n\nSeeing a lot of green, that's what I like.   \n\n\nRegarding the potential market cap and share price targets. I believe the company just solely based on their fundamentals and stable revenue/earnings streams, could be worth much more. However, the average volume on the stock is barely 187K therefore it's been going under the radar for some time.   \n\n\n**Why there seem to be no interest in the stock?**   \n\n\nEven though it's only a speculation, we are living in the time where everybody wants to get rich quickly on the most notorious stocks or invest in the to known giants that took control over their respective industries. If you want something a growth stock, you can always just buy some giant company in the sector or just buy some index fund.   \n\n\nThat could be one of the reasons why it's hard to notice a company that had been around for a long time, is growing in the rural areas, expanding, closing deals and makes sure there is a stable income/revenue stream. However, that does not change the fact that the company has much more potential and could be undervalued.   \n\n\n# FREE TENDIES (SPECIAL DIVIDEND) - 18.75$ / share \n\nNow to the actual play. To be honest, I too haven't known about SHEN since this announcement, I had couple of dividend paying stocks, but this opportunity was too good to ignore.   \n\n\nSHEN is focusing more and more on their main revenue stream - broadband and decided to sell of their Wireless assets and operations to T-Mobile in an [insane sale](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shenandoah-telecom-declares-special-dividend-122122682.html). The sale totaled 1.94 billion dollars which at the time was almost the amount similar to the company's market cap.   \n\n\nSHEN is giving away 936.6mil of this sale back to the shareholders. ,making it 18.75$ per share, which is insane and will be payed out on August 2nd if you are a shareholder as of recorded date July 13th !   \n\n\nThe rest of the proceeds they used to cover all of the debt and are expected more than 19.6mil to be reinvested back to the stock, further pumping the price up.   \n\n\nWhy is it such a big deal ? If you didn't just skim through the fundamentals, you would have found out that the company's fair value is around 56$/share. What is it trading as of this moment ? 56.81$ so even despite the news of crazy special dividend, we are trading around the fair value of the company !  \n\n\n**But but but, the share price will always rebalance itself after the payout date.**  \n\n\nYes and no, in some cases it doesn't have to, but if you enter anywhere under the 60$ in order for you to lose money on this play, the stock would have dump below their 52 week low. This is basically free guaranteed gain. You don't have speculate if Richard Branson reaches the Space or if Elon finally delivers on the self driving system. This is almost literally free win, or as it is common to say, it can't go tits up.   \n\n\nJust the fact that 19.6 mil is expected to be reinvested back. That's 345k shares bought at the current price, almost twice as much as your average daily volume.  So even if the stock dumped right after the Dividend payout, you have guaranteed stock buybacks happening, all while the fundamentals and future outlook for the company is still holding strong.   \n\n\n**Yes, yes but it's a dividend stock and I don't know a lot about them.**\n\nOne of the best metrics for the divi stocks is to see if the company keeps increasing the divi   \n\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.marketwatch.com\\/story\\/time-to-sell-out-of-these-3-small-cap-telecom-stocks-2016-07-25?mod=mw\\_quote\\_news](https://preview.redd.it/oi2lhj83cg971.png?width=815&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45a38a817e137b0ce96887c2899368b732f34461)\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/shen/dividend-history](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/shen/dividend-history)  \n\n\n# Final Thoughts \n\nSpecial dividends does not occur that often, they are here and there and can cause massive spike in the share price in the short amount of time while. Especially if the pay out is literally almost 1/3 of the entire market cap.   \n\n\nI believe that any entry below 60$ - 65$ / share is still amazing because in order for this to go \"tits up\", the stock would not only have to drop below it's 52 Week low (38.77), but also stay there, all in while being fairly valued at 56  \n\n\nMoreover, selling a big portion of their assets to T-Mobile could make the company an acquisition target. Since they are popular in rural parts of the country, acquisition of SHEN could be an easy entry for any of the telecom giants to enter rural areas. Which in turn could further skyrocket the price, but that's purely a speculation.  \n\n\nI am planning on holding after the special dividend pay out with selling a small portion of the position on the dividend payout and holding rest for the longer term.   \n\n\nI would like to hear any opinions on this play, any bull/bear case is very welcome. Any criticism is welcome, let me know what you think !  \n\n\n# TL;DR\n\nCompany paying out insane special dividend 18.75$/share on August 2nd if you hold shares before July 13th, while maintaining solid fundamentals.  \n\n\n**Position**  \n598 shares at 56.96 avg",

However, people seemed to like it when I shared the google doc, so I'm posting it here. As of right now my $NEGG position is still basically the same. I don't have the 12.5c calls anymore though - so 107calls instead of 125calls)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in October 2020  Newegg, an online retailer that mostly sells electronics, announced it is going to go public back  in a \"reverse merger\" with LLIT in some time in Q1 of 2021, which we now know [closed on May 20, 2021](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1474627/000121390021027815/ea141330ex99-1_neweggcomme.htm)\n\nNow here comes the juicy parts and it\u2019s all based on Form F-1 located on edgar ([See link to double check what I\u2019m saying](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001474627/000121390021025755/ea140678-f1a7_lianluosmart.htm))\n\nThere are 363,325,542  shares outstanding but the public float is only is less 1% of this number . There are two chinese guys who own most of the shares outstanding Zhitao He and Fred Chang, owning approximately 60.91% and 35.98%, collectively 96.90% of the company,  so Zhitao owns about  224,394,452 shares and Fred owns about 130,724,530 shares. The shareholders of Newegg before the merger own  1.31% of shares outstanding, so 4,759,564. Leaving the public float  1.79%, aka 6,503,527. In the form they say that they are authorized to issue 6,250,000 common shares with 4,736,111 as Class A (aka the shit we can trade), and 1,513,889  as Class B. As of the filling of this form (May 12 2021)  there were 3,465,683 common shares outstanding. The float directly offered to the public is 2,729,755 out of the 3,465,683 and the float that the underwriter owns is around 735,928.\n\n*Unsure about the chinese risk F-1 &amp; edgar forms getting hard to read only sure about float ---to be continue*\n\n**See below for a summary of the offering**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lkcspsllzt971.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd66f13230a50746b85f8202c7c7139a6ac37919\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# When does lockup end?\n\nWell according to the SEC form that summarizes the investors rights ([link](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-027834/)) lockup ends 180days after the closing of the merge. The [merger was closed on May 20, 2021](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1474627/000121390021027815/ea141330ex99-1_neweggcomme.htm), and 180days from May 20th is November 15th. Now my mans Zhitao He is a bitch, straight up owned by the Bank of China, in the filling it explicitly says Zhitao pledged all his shares as collateral so he wouldn\u2019t get double tapped. So that\u2019s 60.91% of the shares that we really don\u2019t have to worry about, even though we never really had to worry since lock up ends in November. Fred Chang is a boss, probably counting down the days when he can sell his shares, travel to Tulum, and start drinking soy milk latte\u2019s, do ketamine, and  meditate and be zen while sporting his Jesus robe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h8313lpmzt971.jpg?width=794&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65cb39022acd9cb74d657c77dcdd30e082bd84c5\n\n# What about the squeeze\n\nSo we have verified that the float is between \\[2,729,755, 3,465,683\\], which is the smallest number I\u2019ve actually ever seen for a company. How squeezy is it? Well I came across this company doing a completely different analysis. I was interested in failure-to-deliver data that the SEC provides and what it could tell me. You see recently there have been alot of seemingly random stocks popping. Me and some others share the opinion that it\u2019s due to NSCC-2021-002 being implemented a couple weeks ago, and rule DTCC-2021-005  being implemented a couple months ago. See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/user/jn_ku/comments/m4fnfg/gamestop_moass_no_tinfoil_hat_required/) to see it\u2019s significance for all the meme\u2019s we know and love. So I got all the FTD data from the SEC from 08/2020 - 06/2021 (1st half of June) from the [SEC\u2019s website](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm), and calculated FTD/Float for all the meme stocks we know and love, and some rando stocks that popped recently as well. For $NEGG I calculated the float to be the midpoint of average of the two number, 3m.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vypk6jmnzt971.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d2574130393469dc40d032dbd92d62d9aff4ef0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6mvd6nnzt971.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6ede5517207f88c05781718371d6ec37428b6a6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI gave the outliers colors, and all the other stocks grey scale. So yup your hunch is correct shit has become more volatile after cooling down a bit after the GME squeeze. Outliers usually are the most volatile stocks, GME/AMC  ftd data was screaming \u201clook at me\u201d before the actual pop in shortly after. $NEGG is screaming the same thing right now.\n\nLet\u2019s consider Ortex data and its relation to FTDs. Ortex doesn\u2019t have a API and if it did I don\u2019t have time to look at it so I\u2019m doing a spot check. So let\u2019s pick a random stock say $SENS\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hnrmnlyozt971.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4babb5f83a72ccdb9fcf1470c7beb0b6090f8d04\n\nThe average loan age hit one of it\u2019s peaks on June 7th at 54.23days,  so a good amount of loans were taken out on around April 14  (*54days before June 7th*). Go back to the FTD graph search for $SENS, the peak of \\* \\`FTD as a percentage of Float\\` almost exactly lines up\\*. Let\u2019s try another one, $GME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bf9dy4rpzt971.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4e2186f0090584cb6efa7aa170577533fcc5f18\n\nPeak of average loan age at Jan 25 2021 of 85days, placing the date on Nov 25th, the FTD graph shows this as well. Ok, last one let\u2019s check $UWMC\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jm3pzeqzt971.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2219785964acacb666a42e2e77e707838a59a93\n\n$UWMC had a peak of avg loan age on Jun 10th, subtract 41days from that day and you get April 29th lining up pretty well with $UWMC largest FTD spike.\n\nOk so I\u2019m basically saying that for stocks without data on ortex you can get a sense of where the shorts have opened positions by looking at the peaks of ftds. I only checked stocks with relatively large peaks as a percentage of float idk about others. So basically for $NEGG there has been a considerable amount of short positions opened May 15 - Jun 15, these guys are underwater.\n\nNext notice that GME FTD spike wasn\u2019t the day that the tendie god turned on the money printer that magical January, it was actually in November. Every stock that has reach GME level of \\`FTD % of Float\\` moons later, the spike never really lines up with the dildo to heaven. It could happen a week later, months later, days later, but it seems that for the outliers its going to happen. $NEGG is in the middle of a squeeze and its FTD spike rival stocks that have gone +200 to +400% during the moonshot. The smaller the float and the higher the spike, the more the pop. I haven\u2019t quantified this.\n\nIf you checked interactive brokers during the day you would have noticed that $NEGG had 0 shares available to short, and the borrow rate is &gt;50%. At peak squeeze borrow rate usually spikes &gt;100%. Lastly, in the last two days the short volume ratio has gone up by a factors &amp; volume has gone up as well\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k32u8odrzt971.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8700f42420fd701af7899bffd6551844984163d\n\nOne thing I failed to mention is that the stock is already expensive to buy -- $20 -- ensuring that doubling down on shorting requires substantial capital. Looking at iborrowdesk.com we see that nice juicy slow creep up of borrow rate, and reduction of shares available to borrow, while the price slow bleeds up. So $negg is expensive to double down on and it expensive to borrow. Now look at your fave stock that has squeezed borrow rate   &gt; 100% rn $negg borrow is a moderate \\[50%? Need check\\]. So basically what I\u2019m saying is that $NEGG is in the beginning to mid part of a squeeze. Not a squeeze perpetuated by a hardened group of loyalist and propelled by whales. A squeeze caused by a &lt;3.5m shares float, while all the exchanges having the wrong information, the realization is happening that there were barely any shares to begin with. This will be like a bank run, and I don\u2019t have a logical price target. It could go up to $70.\n\nLastly, for squeezes price instability is needed aka liquidity is drying up. If you\u2019ve been watching the intraday movements at all, with wide bid/ask spreads and limited orderbook. This plus increases in historic volatility indicated price instability/liquidity drying up.\n\nLiquidity/ price instability is one of the main characteristics in which you can identify a squeeze; in general it indicate future volatility either a big move up or down, (too many buyers smashing the ask button, or too many sellers smashing the bid button) but we have enough information to identify the direction\n\nSee this wrinklebrain comments for more info about liquidity:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/maxjustrisk/comments/o37n9h/weekend\\_discussion\\_jun\\_19\\_20/h2idegc?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/maxjustrisk/comments/o37n9h/weekend_discussion_jun_19_20/h2idegc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/maxjustrisk/comments/o83chk/weekend\\_discussion\\_jun\\_26\\_27/h39t83c?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/maxjustrisk/comments/o83chk/weekend_discussion_jun_26_27/h39t83c?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nNote that if I had something better than thinkorswim I would be looking for the barcoding [candlestick pattern](https://www.google.com/search?q=barcoding+stocks&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS908US908&amp;oq=barcoding+&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0j46i175i199j0l7.2849j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) oh well, have close enough approximations that indicate that its happening.\n\n*Asking around for ActiveTick data to see if this pattern exists, to be continued\u2026.*\n\n# Technicals\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/as1fpqlszt971.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=513c1003e2662c1276386a8c019371a931b23708\n\nThis Cup and Handle makes me get a little chubby dude.\n\n# Fundamentals\n\nThis is the part i care least about,but it feels good to not yolo on a shit company (sorry $RIDE hodlers).\n\nNewegg has been a one stop shop for PC building for years.

I love Newegg as a company, and I'm freaking amped that they're public, so full disclosure, I've got biases. That being said, I think it's a solid buy. It seems only one analyst has really put a price target on it. I don't know who the analyst is, but any google search for a price target pings back the same, beautiful, 44$ prediction, spread across all of our favorite market commentators. (WSJ, Market Watch, Yahoo) If that's not enough to get you excited, we go to their financials. In 2016 they made a measly 13M$. 2017 came around, and they made an abysmal 1M$. 2018, though? 2.15B$. Mind you, they went from making 1Million dollars... to 2.1 BBillion. 2019, and 2020 were both in the 2 Billion dollar range. (Via WSJ) And now? GPU prices are inflated to high hell, son! Despite that, Newegg seems to be able to Earnings announcement is going to be fantastic! Lastly, let's take a look at technicals. Yesterday and the day before, NEGG had a huge run up! Literally having doubled its price at one point. (Ran from 10$ to 21$ before coming back down.) In that time, it showed strong support at 13. I thought we might see 13$ again today. Besides that, it showed support yesterday, at it's first dip, at 15$, bounced from there up to 19.5, before getting rejected. After it's rejection, it showed support at 16.75 for AH/PM, at 15.75$ for the intraday low. AND THEN IT BOUNCED BACK TO 17.75! If we break down under 15$, We might see 13$, again. Right now, it's gearing up to retest 21$. A rejection from that will likely put us back in this 17.75 range. If we break that 21$ resistance? Then we might get a test of 22$. We might see another gamma squeeze as brokers start hedging for the 22.5$ Calls.\n\n*(btw he\u2019s off about the gamma sqz; options just got introduced, everything else is interesting)*\n\nIt also has some recent good news: [https://www.tomshardware.com/news/neweggs-new-pc-building-service-might-hold-stock-on-rare-components-behind-pre-assembly-paywall](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/neweggs-new-pc-building-service-might-hold-stock-on-rare-components-behind-pre-assembly-paywall)\n\n# Positions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/no2woixuzt971.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04fa15e546fc8ae511df1879c0e5833437cdf097\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ykjovwnvzt971.png?width=1538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca9370ca929c3ecec2f8b46ad4bbeb70c711442e\n\nI\u2019m risky af probably better positions out there, took out 20k Jul 6, 2021, positions as of pre-market july 7. The 13 $30 calls bought Jul 6, 2021for about $3 a pop, end of day they were $6.3, high of $8.1. Don\u2019t think i\u2019ve said this, but I believe legit $NEGG is a money printer.\n\n# Advice\n\nTaken from u/Fatinspiration\n\n* **Don\u2019t sell on dips.** You\u2019re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it\u2019s heading up. *Sell high, not low, retards.*\n* **Don\u2019t buy calls on rips.** With everyone expecting a squeeze *at any moment* option premiums that are already high rocket to insane levels in minutes. You\u2019re absolutely fucked if you buy calls on rips, even if you\u2019re right.",

        "selftext": "Gather around you filthy degenerates, and hear me divulge a strategy that even Michael Burry would give his good eye for. Ever since I was a wee lad, I sought the quickest and easiest way to riches. I scoffed at Tim Ferris and his \"4-Hour Work Week\", \"He'll have my attention once he's written \"The 4-Hour Work Year\"\" I would jeer. My disdain was without prejudice, I thumbed my nose at even the blue-collar lotto players at our local gas station, enduring the stench of week old hot-dogs and dirty mop water was too great an ordeal for even a guaranteed chance at riches.\n\nAs the years went by my young mind began to cower under the looming shadow of a cursed future shuffling papers and hoping my 401k kept ahead of inflation, that was until I discovered an app that changed my path forever. Robin Hood might have once been an English legend of yore, but to me he was a glowing green icon on my cracked iPhone screen, an app whose feathered logo pulled me in with a level of seduction every harlot from the East Coast to the West would kill for. With less effort than it took to give my successful CPA brother the bird, I was able to purchase options in such prestigious firms as the National Bank of Greece and Dryships Inc. The thrill of a lotto ticket and the awe of watching a magician make my college tuition disappear...all in one app, I was hooked. \n\nEventually, the thrill and awe began to feel more like a novelty, and the rumblings of my belly and holes in my underwear began to scream \"priorities\". I decided to take a step back and try my hand at being the respectable son my parents had always wanted. I graduated college, got my masters, and landed a 9-5 job that most liberal arts majors would drag their gonads thru shattered glass for. Still, I was empty. The uncapped profit horizons and bellowing margin call notifications still pulled at my heart, and as I ran in the darkness of my dreaded white-collar maze, I saw a familiar green glow. \n\nAfter re-downloading the app, I decided to study the markets more meticulously. I would learn all about a stock's technicals and fundamentals I told myself. I would discover the next great bubble and someday have Christian Bale portray me in my inevitable biographical blockbuster. Those goals were soon crushed however. I was no Burry or Buffet, I was a gambler who for whatever reason had a knack for turning dimes into dollars short-term, but would lose my house when the numbers and timeline got too big. \n\nI needed a strategy. \n\nEventually, this is the \"strategy\" I settled on, and with fortune thus far on my side, from getting in early on $AMC to making a few years salary from $MRNA (see my thread from last month: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8pahs/why\\_is\\_no\\_one\\_talking\\_about\\_mrna/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8pahs/why_is_no_one_talking_about_mrna/?sort=new)), I plan to stick with it until my inbox fills up with overdraft protections notices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[PART 1: Ticker Picking\\]\n\n*1 - Pick tickers that have at least a couple of weeks of forward momentum. You're not Benjamin Graham, you're a starving fish hoping the river's current takes you to more fertile waters and not the local sewage plant.*\n\n*2 - Pick options that are JUST outside of the money but have at least two months before expiration. Nobody has time to learn what the hell theta is, so just buy the contract that will at least hold enough value to buy you a pizza from Little Caesar's if things go south in a hurry.* \n\n*3 - Don't hold onto an option any closer than a week before expiration. Remember, worst case, pizza money.* \n\n*4 - Get religious. You'll be doing a LOT of praying.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[PART 2: Bankroll Management\\]\n\n*1  - Define your initial bankroll.* \n\n*2 - Define winning.* \n\n*3 - Cash out when you win.* \n\n*4 - Start over with your initial bankroll + 10% of winnings.*\n\n*So  if you decide that 2.5k a year of your disposable income is gambling money that's your bankroll. Define winning as something like \"10x my  bankroll or 6 months of any profit.\" Whenever  you win, cash out, bump your bankroll slightly and start again. If you  find yourself at the start of a new year and you still have your initial  bankroll, you can add the 2.5k designated for the new year to your  bankroll whenever you win and are about to start over - or you can hold  it in reserve in case of a total loss (what I would recommend) - but don't ever just lump a New Years bankroll into a given \"game\" while its  in progress.* \n\nGood luck, and this is not financial advice.",

        "selftext": "(A synthetic  long is where you buy a call and sell a put at the same strike price, often close to the underlying price)\n\nOften when you use a synthetic long, the actual  debit is small compared to the price of the call by itself. In some cases the difference  is enough between the long call and the short put that I get even a small credit.\n\nIf you're  bullish the gains you get are basically free....since your actual premium  was so low. And if there's  a really strong bullish rally you can buy the short put back for pennies. I've seen this happen a few times with TSLA and AMC synthetic  longs. After I buy the put back: my out of pocket cost is extremely  small....I can let the remaining long run with little consequence. \n\nThis strategy  is even more awesome for LEEP options: as all you really pay is the difference  between the short put and long call. If there's  a stock you're  long term bullish on: buy a synthetic  long Leep spread. When a rally happens, buyout the put and you got a cheap LEEP. And because  you bought a leep spread: it's unlikely  the short put would get executed early (but of course can happen), as the put buyer's breakeven needs much larger losses than a weekly put. \n\nCan someone tell me what I'm missing? Yes it ties up collateral (on most platforms since you can't  sell naked puts), but the risk looks very favorable compared to just going long on a stock.",

        "selftext": " AMC Entertainment (AMC) is better to buy now, said Jefferies analyst John Janedis, as the company\u2019s recently-released quarterly results show that losses are starting to narrow even as box office sales remain strong. On May 21, AMC reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of $0.05 per share, against analysts\u2019 consensus of $0.05 per share. For the next quarter, AMC expects adjusted EPS in the range of $0.06 to $0.08, in line with consensus. \u201cAMC reported an encouraging quarter with moderate box \\[office\\] attendance offset by costs that remain elevated in a challenging economy,\u201d stated Janedis, in a note entitled, \u201cEvery Little Bit to know about stock trading\"  \n\n\nBackground information:  \nAMC Entertainment, Inc., is a leading theatrical exhibition and entertainment company operating predominantly in the United States and Canada. The Company is one of the largest motion picture exhibitors in the United States and a major producer of live theatrical content. AMC has the ability to provide theaters with a full range of film, food, and beverage, and other complementary programming. On November 30, 2016, AMC announced its intent to acquire London-based Odeon &amp; UCI Cinemas Holdings (O&amp;U), the largest motion picture exhibitor in Europe. O&amp;U was demerged from UK-based AMCN plc (NYSE: AMC) just one week earlier.\n\nA couple of years ago, the stock was trading at $20 per share when everything was rosy for the company under its then CEO, Ed Zasadny, but later became one of the worst-performing stocks on Wall Street in the years that followed.  \nA few weeks ago, the stock had recovered some of its value because of the news that its operational losses had narrowed in the second quarter. The company is expected to report higher net income and lower losses, but Zasadny\u2019s successor, Hohler, is looking to cut the company\u2019s expenses. Although the company has said that it has no plans to cut jobs at the moment, it is possible that employees will have to accept a reduction in their compensation.\n\nFirst of all, it is hard to believe that their stock has dropped as low as a dollar. Over the past few years, I have found that the big investment firms have been more than two for one the number of stocks they short as they have stocks they own. That means for every $2 they hold over a company\u2019s stock they will have a $1 position against the same company. Now, because of this enormous short position from the investment firm, the stock has gotten hammered down. When a stock moves up and you hold an investment over the stock, this is known as your \u201clong\u201d position. This holds true for investment firms as well. \n\n AMC is a great stock not just because of how it is performing right now, but also because AMC has performed well in terms of earnings and also the potential for future growth. AMC\u2019s revenue increased over the fourth quarter as well as over the previous year. AMC\u2019s revenue increased from a year earlier, as well. AMC recently reported a loss of about -2% compared to this time last year and improved earnings to an amount that was better than analysts predicted. AMC\u2019s revenue increased from a year earlier, as well. AMC recently reported a loss of about -2% compared to this time last year and improved earnings to an amount that was better than analysts predicted. \n\nI hope this helped you monkey to believe in its raising to the moon!!!",

It would be like if Apple abolished the iPhone. Free Trading is their Model. \n\n4) As Order Flow is a linear business, 1 unit of order flow results in $1 extra. In order to reach 150x multiplier to reduce PE to 'reasonable tech company levels' we would be looking at 150x the net volume being transacted on Robinhood. \n\n5) Robinhood \n\nExcerpts from S-1 Filing: \n\nWe incurred operating losses each year since our inception in 2013 through 2019, including net losses of $6.1\u00a0million, $57.5\u00a0million, and $106.6\u00a0million for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. We expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in the future as we increase our sales and marketing efforts, continue to invest in research and development, further develop our products and services, improve and expand our customer support functions and expand into new geographies. \n\nMoreover, as of March 31, 2021, options to purchase 18,096,127 shares of our Class A common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of approximately $2.23 per share were outstanding and 81,820,160 shares of our Class A common stock were subject to outstanding RSUs (including 27,663,658 shares subject to 2019 Market-Based RSUs). \n\nThere are currently &gt; 96 million shares held by employees.   \n\n\nFunding Rounds:\n\nYear   Amount    Valuation    Baggers at IPO dump\\_price \n\n2017   $110m      $1,3b           24x\n\n2018    $363m      $5.6b          5.7x\n\n2019    $323m      $7.6b          4.2\n\n2020    $280m      $8.3b          3.8x\n\n2020   $320m        $8.6b         3.7x\n\n2020   $200m        $11.2b      2.8x\n\n2020   $460m       $11.7b        2.7x\n\nBull Case 1: \n\nRobin Hood has been growing at a very fast rate therefore its' valuations validate this. The insider investors are incentivized to hold. \n\nBear Case 1: \n\nThe insiders made anywhere between a minimum of 2.7 --&gt; 24x already within the last few years, private firms typically take profits and reinvest in other startups. (Unless Robinhood grows at exponential rates going forwards)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSelling Pressures: \n\nImagine if you're an Ape working at RH and you can cash in on a 10-20 bagger immediately in 30-days, would you sell? \n\nAn average engineer who worked at Robinhood for 4 - years on average holds \\~ $400k-800k in RSUs (at a price of $2 per share). At the time of IPO we're looking at $4-8m if you sell. Maybe you hold, maybe not in. \n\nIf you're an investor who invested in Series G-1 , G-2 (the lastest bagholders). You've got yourself a 1-2 bagger already in 1 year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonal Opinion:\n\nRobin hood is being evaluated as a \"Growing Tech company\" at multipliers that seem unreasonable. \n\nRobinhood does not have a roadmap that provides a way to reach earnings through their current model which is Payment for Orderflow.  \n\nEven with the introduction of their \\[censored\\]currency, Coinbase ambitiously is boasting a forward P/E of 30x. \n\nEven as a growing Fintech like Square is at a P/E at 201x, and mature Fintech such as Paypal is at 30x.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: Short 500 shares of RH\n\nThis is not financial advice, tons of companies fuck over their customers at some point.

        "selftext": "*Legal and regulatory matters*\n\n*Early 2021 Trading Restrictions*\n\nBeginning on January 28, 2021, due to unprecedented market volatility and related portfolio margin demands imposed on RHS by the clearinghouse National Securities Clearing Corporation, RHS temporarily restricted or limited its customers\u2019 purchase of certain securities, including GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., on our platform (\u201cEarly 2021 Trading Restrictions\u201d).\n\nWe have become aware of approximately 49 putative class actions and three individual actions that have been filed against RHM, RHF, and/or RHS in various federal and state courts relating to the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions. The complaints generally allege breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and other common law claims. Several complaints further allege federal securities claims, federal and state antitrust claims and/or certain state consumer protection claims based on similar factual allegations. Approximately 18 of the putative class actions also name other broker-dealers and/or market makers as defendants. On February 5, 2021, certain plaintiffs filed a motion before the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (\"JPML\") to transfer and coordinate or consolidate the actions filed in connection with the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions into a multidistrict litigation in the Northern District of California (the \"Transfer Motion\"). On March 1, 2021, we filed a response to the Transfer Motion, in which we supported transfer and coordination or consolidation of the actions into a multidistrict litigation in either the Northern District of California, or in the alternative, the Middle District of Florida. On April 1, the JPML entered an order centralizing the cases identified in the Transfer Motion into a multidistrict litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the \u201cTransfer Order\u201d) captioned In re: January 2021 Short Squeeze Trading Litigation, Case No. 21-2989-MDL-ALTONAGA/Torres (the \u201cMDL\u201d). On April 19, 2021, the court held an initial case management conference.\n\nRHM, RHF, RHS and our Co-Founder and CEO, Vladimir Tenev, amont others, have received requests for information, and in some cases subpoenas and requests for testimony, related to investigations and examinations of the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions from the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California (\"USAO\"), the SEC staff, FINRA, the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office, other state attorneys general offices, and a number of state securities regulators. Also, a related search warrant was executed by the USAO to obtain Mr. Tenev's cell phone. There have also been several inquiries based on specific customer complaints and with respect to employee trading. In addition, we have received information and testimony requests from certain committees and members of the U.S. Congress and Mr. Tenev has provided testimony with respect to the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions. We are cooperating with these investigations and examinations.\n\nDue to the preliminary nature of all of these proceedings, we are unable at this time to estimate the likelihood or magnitude of any possible losses related to these matters.",

I am married to love of my life, but feel like the world is falling apart\u2026 long story short I have a trading addiction that has made my life totally different since COVID started much like all of you I\u2019m sure I lost my job and began trading. I made my first big win off of Tesla and I was hooked. Long story short I gained 100lbs and neglected my relationship with my wife to the point she has left me as of last week\u2026 she said lose weight and stop trading and we may get back together. So after doing lots of research on the first part I thought of a trainer\u2026 then was like no I\u2019m to lazy for that\u2026 then I did digging into bypass surgery\u2026 know a friend who had success\u2026 anyway I came across a procedure called a lapband made by reshape life sciences and they have a minimal invasive procedure that just wraps around the stomach to mimic the shitty gastro bypass of yesterday. So I\u2019m like fuck yeah I\u2019ll do that. Only problem is the trading part. I literally stare at $gme and $amc charts all day. I lost my job doing this because my boss kept catching me doing it instead of my tps reports.

        "selftext": "Good evening WSB Apes\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted to make a post that\u2019s good enough to post on WSB. I often lay awake at night with my cock pointed at the ceiling thinking of what I could possibly write on here that would not be taken down by mods. Nothing I\u2019ve come up with in my head has ever seemed good enough. But fuck it I\u2019m drunk and high and the wife is with the boyfriend so I think I\u2019ll give this shit a try. Please down vote the fuck out of this as this will probably be worst thing you ever read.\n\nSo WSB consists only of true retards. From what I\u2019ve gathered if you want to cement yourself as a real WSB baller then you yolo meme stocks and buy shitty calls that will never print. This you already know. WSB has turned to more fuckery day in and day out. In some way we are all drawn to it. If we can\u2019t get off on what stocks to push then at least we can get the best advice in the world on all other shit in life. Hookers, sex, love, Cramer, weed, and oh yeah stocks. In some way this is our way of life. Our escape from reality. We love being apart of something and to us apes this is our playground of fun. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve bought high and sold low because of you fucking retards. I literally believe in my balls that this is how you buy stocks. Why the fuck would anyone listen to you assholes on here? I\u2019ve looked at so many stupid charts and graphs and I\u2019m way too retarded to understand that shit and apparently the rest of you are too. \n\nThe days of GME and AMC were long before I became a member of WSB. Those days seem to be over and new product has taken its place. So many different stocks are being pushed and none of them seem to be worth shit. It\u2019s easy to jump on what\u2019s doing well because that\u2019s what all you retards do. I\u2019m guilty too because I do that same whack shit too. Fucking something about rockets and ape emojis that I just can\u2019t stay away from. So we do it. We hate ourselves. We love ourselves but at the end of the day we just want to make money. We are all just as greedy and miserable as the hedge funds we fight. We want to see that green dildo rocket so high that we literally lose track of life. That\u2019s why all our wives have boyfriends and why we will all drive lambos some day. \n\nSo in the end I hope this posts. I hope I have enough shitty karma or whatever else the fuck you need to be cool enough to post on here. I know there are people just like me who wanna make an awesome shitpost on WSB. This is for you to hopefully show you it is possible if your drunk and high and down 50% on your stocks. Thanks for advice retards. I look forward to continue losing money with you all. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\n\nTL:DR\nGet all your advice from WSB and no where else. \n\nMuch love signing off. See at lambo.\n\nMods I am too retarded to give the shitpost flair or maybe I\u2019m not allowed to shit post on weekdays so I listed it as TA. Please change it or just delete as this was my attempt.
