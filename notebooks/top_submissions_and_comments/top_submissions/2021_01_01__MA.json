        "selftext": "I deleted a couple posts showing my $BB positions because I don\u2019t want anyone IRL seeing balances \n\n\u201cJuST mAkE a NeW acCoUnT\u201d \n\nStfu reet\n\nI\u2019ll probably delete this as well soon but I know some of you autistic bastards need to hear this now, yes you, who put market orders first thing Friday morning expecting $BB to rocket from high 10\u2019s to 15\u2019s in a single trading session. Pure majestic autism. \n\nI come out of Plato\u2019s cave to tell you I understand your pains. I was there not too long ago... you see... \n\nBack in November I noticed $BB cleanly up-trending on the hourly bouncing off the 9 and 26 MA (I use ichimoku) heading towards a resistance level that had already formed a double top \n\nLike a true Gamblers fallacy believing retard I made a wager: \n\n$10k into $6 calls expiring March on the DD that: \u201cwhat are the chances it falls AGAIN there\u201d ... that\u2019s it. \n\nA few days later AWS news came, and that $10k turned into $70k. Pure luck. Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn\u2019t. She went that day.\n\nIn that moment of seeing massive profits on AWS news day, I experienced violent and absolutely tremendous autism and thought, this thing is going from $5\u2019s to $15 in a single trading session, yes, even more retarded than you guys that bought the top on Friday \n\nSensible thoughts couldn\u2019t penetrate my helmet fast enough as drool gushed from my gaping mouth, gasping for oxygen and yelling at the top of my lungs what barely resembled words about Lambo\u2019s and Yachts... so I hurled about $100k into shares at $8.77 and about $10k more into $15 leaps \n\nI proceeded to watch my profit dwindle to nothing as earnings came and bent me over so hard I couldn\u2019t bring myself to watch the stock for a week \n\nI thought about selling the bottom, I was there, order ready typed, just needed to hit the send button, and I was going to close my position around $6.7ish and be back to break even after striking gold \n\nBut you know what, I remembered it\u2019s just money. I remembered that everything in reality is in flux, and changing, and decaying, and being born again, and to just flow with it and stop clinging and desiring one set of experiences over another (aka a fat bank account over giving $5 blowies behind a Wendy\u2019s) who cares? \n\nAll is well lads. So let go of the burden if you bought the top and are stressing, it\u2019s really fine. Look at what\u2019s happening right now:\n\n1) Insane volume, insane moves, erratic behavior (something is going on behind the curtain) \n\nPS: this movement and volume is NOT because of WSB, full stop. Big players are making huge moves here, and fast, we don\u2019t know why yet \n\n2) 1 Billion annual revenue \n3) Soon to come online a RECURRING AUTO DATA business that will drive revenue into growth cycle, BB is literally Microsoft Windows for cars but the auto sector was still underdeveloped technologically to benefit from this position, hence this vertical is finally about to print HUGE HUGE HUGE MEGA BILLIONS ANNUAL. This was always the plan and they just had to wait it out until the auto sector caught up with them digitally \n\n(The auto data tech sector is so lucrative it made Papa Elon the richest person in the world, and forced a fucking god damn phone company to join the race \ud83c\udf4e\u2014it\u2019s huge)\n\n4) UNDER, FUCKING, VALUED \n5) VERTICALS GALORE\n5) FB settled, imagine the BALLS on BB going after this massive and dirty tech behemoth run by a literal lizard, they are honest Canadians doing God\u2019s work \n6) IOT, AI, smart city\u2019s, insert other buzzwords \n\nI could go on and on, and honestly, I\u2019ve never felt more comfortable holding ANY stock than this \n\nMoral of the story: as I let go and accepted my circumstances and decided to diamond hand \ud83d\udc8e \ud83e\udd1a BB to the death, within a few days I proceeded to watch the fattest, thickest, randomest, greenest dildo penetrate my butt hole to the high heavens and take me from what was $70k profit to 0 profit back up to $130k profit. I\u2019ve trimmed half the options, I don\u2019t even know why tbh, reverse autism maybe, but I\u2019m riding my remaining calls and entire share position to Valhalla. \n\nWill likely add more if it dips. But...\n\nJust hold. Something is cooking on BB. You have to be a retard not to see it. Look at the fucking daily chart, look at the volume, the gaps, the swings, BB chart literally has Tourette\u2019s syndrome right now... \n\nThis stock has not moved like this for 10 years. \n\nIt might stall a little, deflate from here, consolidate a bit more, or it might blast off again any second. Point is, nobody knows when, but it looks like in a short time, we will know why this stock is moving the way it has. Something is DEFINITELY going on behind the scenes the public is not aware of and neither is the media \n\nFor fucks sake I found the court docs showing global settlement with FB is done 24 hours before gay ass Bloomberg even picked it up. The majority of the investor world still thinks they make fucking phones for Gods sake. Everyone is sleeping on this \n\nA note on Jim just in case he reads this:\n\nJim Cramer hates this stock because 1) BB and John Chen are not bootlicking CEO\u2019s jerking off CNBC and massaging Cramers asshole for air time, they\u2019re a tightly run, honorable company doing real things 2) He most likely became a bag holder during the epic fall of the BB phone and sold for a fat loss and wants to protect his ego by continuing to ignore the facts on the company\n\nThe guy wants you to invest in CRWD with a fucking ridiculous market cap, no verticals, and less revenue than BB. Promoting a literal bubble over a value play. What a bizarre world we live in. Take advantage of it, I hear this phrase all the time and I fucking hate it, but this is literally \u201cfree money\u201d \n\nKnow what you own. There is TRUE value in this company. No hype. Pure value. \n\nDiamond hand, double down, buy more, and just hold. You are in good hands \ud83d\ude4c\n\nTl;dr diamond hand $BB",

        "selftext": "Obviously if you own an index fund you don't have to make this decision, more power to you. For those preferring a more concentrated portfolio style, I think this is an interesting question - because these are all great companies, but naturally one must be better than the others.\n\nIf you had to pick just one of the mega-caps, which do you buy today?\n\nMy personal thoughts:\n\n- Facebook. I see potential competition to their network, but the balance sheet is a fortress and valuation has been pushed down a bit due to general public hatred. A contrarian pick. (B)\n\n- Apple. In my opinion the valuation of this has run away farther ahead of its earnings relative to the others, making it the least attractive of the bunch for me. (C-)\n\n- Amazon. Doing amazing things, looking at the last several quarters their earnings seem to be accelerating - however the p/e is higher than all the rest. (A-)\n\n- Microsoft. The sleeper choice, solid valuation in addition to growth. Not flashy but a money printer. (A)\n\n- Google. My perception is that they're slipping - taking lots of high risk/high payoff bets that don't appear to be paying off yet. Feels potentially contrarian but I'm not wildly excited. (C)?\n\n- Bonus: Mastercard/Visa. Secular trend away from cash makes these seem like long term great picks, in spite of fin-tech disruptors. Not cheap valuations though. I favor MA over V for efficient use of capital. (B+)\n\nJust my opinions of course. Your thoughts?",

        "selftext": "GME GANGGGG!!! Most of you know I've been long GameStop since 2017, initially. I am an OG GME bull and yearn for our true value to be recognized by the market. RC Ventures sees it. Many others (Senvest, Michael Burry, Hedgeye, etc.) do as well. \n\nBut Melvin Capital does not. They wish we would file for bankruptcy so they can just escape this trade. Alas, they didn't close when the price was $2.57. Greed will be their downfall. But, they are smart. They see the data and for that reason I must enlighten you all about what I am seeing in the data, too. Remember though, one quarter doesn't make or break this thesis. \n\nGameStop 4Q results will be weak, barring a spontaneous console creation event. Holiday results will be weak. The reality is while the future may be brighter than the wasteland the Melvin perceives for GME, the present isn't so great being at your core primarily a B&amp;M retailer. It doesn't matter how in demand your products are if supply isn't there. I placed more notes in the image.\n\nThe reality is the order rate had been excellent earlier in the quarter and had been tapering for some time, spiking when resupply events occurred. I had trimmed my estimates previously, but given the continued slowing of the order rate (\\~62k/day to start January) and viewing some US CC data that reflects a slowing sales performance as the quarter went on, it is my duty to share my belief that the forthcoming Holiday results will not be that strong. As I noted in my last post, there was also embedded console resupply included in my January base case, I have removed that assumption, too. \n\nBut let's not get too upset, fellow retards. While Melvin and its army of bankruptcy believers will spew forth vitriol claiming how weak sales prove nO oNe ShOpS aT gAmEsToP, the truth is they know what is coming from RC Ventures and will look to use any entrance of retail shorts into the trade as a means of  supply purchasing their shares from to cover some. The price may retrace if this proves true, however the reality is RC Ventures has bought at $16, and will likely deem a price under the 50 day MA as an excellent buying opportunity especially if they clearly communicate to the market that the reason for the price appreciation is Ryan Cohen, not George Sherman. \n\nLook, it's a chess match, take the DD aside and think about it. Management reported 3Q and shares tanked. Ryan Cohen bought, and can be seen by observers as the primary catalyst for the upside move. Now, management will report Holiday Sales (and whatever else they have in mind at ICR \\[I view a strategic partnership or a smallish technology oriented M&amp;A play as my base case\\]) and the price will likely dip next week. Do you believe Ryan Cohen won't take the opportunity to ramp his position up another 2% to 14.9% if the price dips below $15? He will file on Form 4 within two business days and show himself to be the savior, once again. I am speculating, but given the clear preference of WSB, Twitter, and StockTwits for #WeWantCohen its safe to say that retail is on his side. He will likely gather more votes under his own power and from those in alignment with his viewpoint. A forthcoming board slate would be publicized in early March. This is a war, always has been. \n\nPlay tactically if you wish, or \ud83d\udc8e \u270b. I would advise against FD buying (in almost all cases, but especially this time). Here's the model.\n\nI'd rather tell it like it is (as the data informs me) rather than put out BS. Hopefully I'm overly conservative. Call me \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b if you must, but I'll own GME longer than 99% of you. Still have a price target of \\~$100 by 2023. Cheers\n\nHere are the broader analyst estimates: [https://imgur.com/a/GYRKhUy](https://imgur.com/a/GYRKhUy) \\- $2.417B consensus rev vs. mine $2.35B, $1.66 consensus EPS vs. $1.49.",

        "selftext": "* 2021 starts off with a bang as VIX shoots up an ungodly 30% during intraday peak. During intraday low, the Dow was down as much as 700 pts (-2.3%), Nasdaq -345 pts (-2.6%), and S&amp;P -94 (-2.5%). WSB reeled in horror as stonk somehow doesn't always go up. The market sell-off accelerated in the morning after 10 AM as the market continues to keep an eye on the GA run-off election with polls increasingly being more favorable for the DNC candidates. No doubt an extra wrench was thrown to the GA GOP Senate campaigns as POTUS continues to pressure GA officials on figuring out votes cuz that's totes normal thing for a sitting President to do.\n\n* For those WSBer who failed basic HS civics class, just one GOP win in the two senate seats run-off will keep Biden's more progressive agenda at bay (and likely the recent tax cut in tact) as the GOP and McTurtle retain control of the Senate, while a DNC win will secure both legislative branch for Dems, as VP Harris be the tie breaking vote in the Senate. Will this mean a bigger stimulus package? A renew market-sell off? Should ANTM, UNH, and others quiver in fear? Find out later this week as results will unlikely be clear even after polls are close on Tues night.\n\n* Jack Ma, Alibaba's very public CEO has reportedly been missing in action in the past few months as speculation starts floating about his disappearance due to the CCP. While memes float about of Ma being tucked away in a Chinese state prison with Randy Marsh due to pissing off Pooh Bear, shares of BABA continues to be pressured despite a rebound last week as CCP's antitrust probe on both Alibaba and its subsidiary Ant Group chugs on. BABA closed the day -2.10% at $227.85, while competitors PDD closed -6.13% to $166.78, and JD closed the day -1.79% at $86.33.\n\n*  QS, the SPAC turned meme EV stock took a nice more than -40% dive today as shares sold off on... well, who the fuck knows why it sold off. The EV battery maker took on a NKLA-like trajectory and rallied as much as $120 before steadily trimming its gains in the past week. For those who are adventurous, OTM Jan 15 puts  such as 35p are going for $1.55 while 40p are going for $3.3. But honestly, do you really want to baghold QS at those pricing if assigned?  Shares closed the day down more than $34 (-40.84%) to $49.96. If you sold puts, you dun goofed.\n\n*  Haven, the AMZN + BRK + JPM venture in \"disrupting\" health care has disbanded after the 3 year attempt. Turns out having sensible health care in America is hard as fuck. Shares of healthcare companies UNH, HUM, et al. were up during pre-market and morning hours, but faded through the day as overall macro pushed the sector down.\n\n*  In more \"wait is this really America\" news, more than 200 GOOGL employees and contractors in both the US and Canada have decided to unionized to promote a less shitty workplace and ethical business practices (once a upon a time, Google's motto was \"Do No Evil.\"). Collectively known as the Alphabet Workers Union, the group's aim is to start small and eventually amass enough membership to actually address some of the more lofty goals: namely pay and working conditions. GOOGL closed the day down -1.51%, though more likely inline due to overall macro than this thus far non-material news.\n\n*  Elon chan and his meme stock continues to kill whatever remaining short sellers are left, as TSLA reaches new ATH after Q4 delivery report. Despite the FY number being \"missed\" by 450 vehicles, the quarterly delivery of 180,570 vehicles handily beat Wall Street's estimate of about 174k vehicles and shares are up bigly to close up 3.42% at $729.77. How did we ever doubt those WSB degens who loaded up $3,500 strike calls pre-split which are now ITM!? Truly, they were ahead of the times in knowing that TSLA will shoot up an additional 76% in the next 3 months.\n\n*  On Chinese EV side of things, NIO delivered 7k vehicles in Dec 2020 while XPEV delivered 5,700 vehicles - both numbers are record \"growth\" for the two company which shows a YoY growth of 121% for NIO and 326% for XPEV. WSB with OTM FDs know these \"growth\" well as their FDs goes from 100% in value (but still down all-time of 85%). NIO closed the day up 9.75% to $53.49 and XPEV trimmed their intraday high of 10%+ to close up 2.97% at $44.10.\n\n*  In WSB meme stock land, things are a fairly mixed bag as GME continues to fade after reaching a recent 52-week of $22.35. The definitely-not-going bankrupt video game retailer closed the day down -8.44% to $17.25. PLTR, despite being up more than 2% in pre-market, closed the day relatively flat at -0.76% to $23.37. Finally, steel gang got a respite today as MT closed the day up 4.59%, though intraday high was up as much as 8%.\n\n*  Looking for cheap and relatively \"responsible\" WSB meme stock play? You can do GME covered call and sell April 35c for about $1.6 (though I'd recommend selling on a green day for $2+). This will net you 100 shares of GME for less than $15.70 per share and cap your imaginary gains at $35 if the squeeze does happen. Conversely, you can go with GME April 20c/35c debit call spread for a \"low price\" of $2.4 per spread, or for those who prefer to sell FDs to fellow WSBer, poor man's covered call of Jan 2022 $25c and selling weeklies and/or April 35c will suffice. At the end of the day, the fact that April 35c has so much value still to it should be taken advantage if GME has a green day. For MT, June debit call spread is probably the way to go, with 25c/35c a possible spread. These are not financial advise and if you listen to a stranger online and lose your pants on the play - then that's too bad.\n\n*  DJI closed down -382 pts (-1.25%), IXIC closed down -189 pts (-1.47%), SPX -55 pts (-1.48%), and RUT is down -28 pts (-1.47%). Notable numbers and ERs this week: ISM manufacturing index tomorrow at 10 AM ET, BBBY reports on Thursday before market opens while MU reports after market close. Load up on those MU 90c for 7/20 - this time it'll definitely hit!\n\n(Last week's recap: none cuz I was enjoying the covid yacht party).",

        "selftext": "* The market opened slightly red but quickly reversed because JPow realized this was no way to start a New Year, with Chadsdaq and S&amp;P being propelled to green status thanks to Tim Apple and gang. DOW got further lifted by action from BA, GS, CVX, and INTC (who's really only being carried by MU). Small caps eclipsed SPX and IXIC today with RUT/IWM up as high as almost 2% during intraday high as value play starts looking more appealing. RUT closed up 1.7% and IWM closed up 1.61%.\n\n* \"I'm totes not dead.\" Says Jack Ma, according to a person familiar with the situation who's relaying the info to a CNBC  reporter on Ma's whereabouts. The beleaguered CEO who's in the crosshair of the CCP is keeping it easy and out of the limelight after running afoul of his overlords by talking up CCP's heavy handed action towards Ant Group. Who knew if your fucking financial empire touches the livelihood of 90% of the country there may be consequences if you don't toe the line. BABA closed the day up 5.51% to $240. Meanwhile, PDD touches new ATH and closed the day up 12.24% to $187 while JD is up 10.61% to $95.\n\n* The Chinese ADR/ADS sector gets a lift today partly thanks to NYSE's overnight about-face on delisting Chinese Telecoms. BILI hits new ATH and closed up 8.15% to $102.46 thanks to favorable reception from their secondary listing on the Heng Sheng\n\n* Semi sector is on a run today thanks to MU, with Citi upping, NAND and DRAM manufacturer from Sell all the way up to Buy with a PT of freaking $100 as we enter another cyclical season. RBC Capital also raised PT from $57 to $83, Deutsche Bank from $75 to $83. Will MU $90 be back in favor and no longer a meme strike? Find out later this week. F in the chat for MartyMoho. If only he bought fooking shares and ride through two more additional cyclical season and a global pandemic. Ez dub. MU closed up 4.33% to $77, LRCX closed up 3.46% to $494, and AMAT closed up 3% to $89. MU reports earnings this Thursday after market close.\n\n* GM pop 2% when news broke at 10:29 on positive US sales number from Q4, while shares were fading slightly as the market digest the news, eventually the positive momentum took over and shares closed the day up 2.84% to $41.66. ROKU pop to close up 5.44%, closing at $335 thanks to WFC analyst raising PT from $275 to $414 (yep) and keeping his overweight rating. \n\n* Today's big movers: FUBO was up as high as 21%, M-A-R-A was up as high 23% while B-N-G-O drilled more than -30% during intraday lows after an initial halt in the early mornings. FUBO closed up 12.83% to $27.35, M-A-R-A closed up 23.43% to $13.59, and B-N-G-O closed down -31.25% to $4.95.\n\n* The GA run-off election is on the market mindset as voters are heading to the polls. Meanwhile, Congress is set to confirm Biden's win over Trump, a procedural formality that generally receives little news coverage but not in the current timeline. Expect POTUS to rage over Pence on Twitter later tonight if the latter confirms Biden's Electoral College win. Look to weed and clean energy sector for pops if the Dems somehow wins both seat. No doubt many WSBer have already loaded up on FDs to showcase the sick gains porn tomorrow if the magic happens.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR is up more than 5% but those with OTM Jan 15 calls are likely having their ass handed to them by the greeks, while a similar story exist over at GME as the stock fades away morning gain to close the day up 0.70% as theta rampage $20c, $22c, and $23c (if your strike is even further out then RIP to you). MT and steel gang are faring better, with the stock retaking yesterday's high and closed up 2.84% to 24.63.

        "selftext": "Hear ye, hear ye, retards! Welcome back to the next big autistic ascending asset, CALLaway ($ELY). I have previously provided DD in three separate posts: Part 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo5p5/callaway/), Part 2 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx7sh6/callaway_part_2/), and Part 3 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxxd4q/callaway_part_3/). **As mentioned previously, we are talking about a $2.5 billion market cap company that has $1.7+ billion revenues of their own and just bought Topgolf, which has revenues of $1.1+ billion and growing at ridiculous levels! \ud83d\ude80**\n\n**In the last post, I focused on the synergistic effect from CALLaway purchasing Topgolf. This time I want to talk about the people behind CALLaway, and I will be using the DD of one of my favorite retards,** u/rwm3188**.** The founder, Ely CALLaway. was a Southern gentleman army vet who made wine, golfed, and absolutely fucked. **He named the first driver he created \u201cBig Bertha.\u201d** You know this man loved the thick, and when fat women complained he just made them test out the driver. (cite [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/06/sports/ely-callaway-golf-club-maker-dies-at-82.html)). **The current CEO, Chip Brewer, lives and breathes golf. He turned around Adams Golf in the '00s and made them profitable, and grew Callaway's market cap steadily since he took over in 2012**. The only significant dips in the stock price under his leadership appear to have been cyclical and correlate with greater market dips/crashes. He has an MBA from Harvard, which should be a strike against him, but he\u2019s a bit old school so that\u2019s ok. **\ud83d\ude80**\n\nNow we come to **Dolf Berle, the former Dave &amp; Busters cowboy who currently helms Topgolf** and [still has a Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dolf-berle-b475b111/). First of all, his name is fucking Dolf; not to be mistaken with Dolph Lundgren, but equally if not more badass. **Our Dolf is a decathlete and he competed on American Ninja Warrior.** Put him in a ring with Tim Cook, Elon Musk, and Alex Karp, and see who comes out. I fucking dare you. He also has an MBA from Harvard, which should also be a strike against him, but he also has an MA in African Studies from the University of Zimbabwe, which only elicits autism in its purest form. Although Dolf will likely be leaving the company following the merger, there is no doubt he has left his imprint on our baby. **\ud83d\ude80**\n\nLet\u2019s make magic happen my retards. You all inspire me, and hopefully we can make ourselves rich as all hell. I want to give a special shoutout to all the retards working overtime, especially  [u/Healthy-Cash8610](https://www.reddit.com/user/Healthy-Cash8610/), who has been working overtime and spreading the good word over the weekend. We have a movement here, let's make it big. **Buy $ELY stock and calls. Autists Assemble!**\n\n**TLDR: $ELY to the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19**",

        "selftext": "Disclosure: \n\n1.50,600  $GSAH Warrants as of  1/8/2021\n\n2.Please read my previous DD's as referenced below. On average 30-50% return on the SPAC's I vouched for at the target entry prices I recommended. \n\n[Figure 1. MoneyLion is a potential target of $GSAH](https://preview.redd.it/u6hnntrz44a61.png?width=225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7c29f03b3d7a39d12fbf10c5830da445aa5c765)\n\n**#TLDR**\n\n$GSAH  is a $750 million   SPAC  that is the lead contender in bringing MoneyLion, a private Fintech company public. This is based on the remarkable close working relationship between the executive at MoneyLion, Goldman Sachs, and FT Partners.\n\nJust as recently as 2019 FT Partners, which is run by a previous Goldman Sachs investment banker, helped MoneyLion raise $100 Million in order to compete in this rapidly growing banking niche. The CEO of MoneyLion is himself a former Goldman Sachs investment banker. \n\nLastly, detailed review of the linkedin and twitter accounts of $GSAH, MoneyLion and FT Partners reveals close working relationships hinting at an obvious target.\n\n**Buy:** $GSAH commons &lt; $11.50 prior to release of  LOI/DA. This is close to Net Asset Value (NAV) at $10.00. Limited downside risk of \\~10% with potential upside that is $20+\n\n**Buy:** $GSAH warrants &lt;  $3   prior to the release of LOI/DA. High Risk/ High Reward. I believe the new fair value for pre-LOI/DA  quality Fintech SPACs (ex. $FUSE)  will be $2-3 as more  money enters the SPAC sphere. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 1: Summary**\n\nGoldman Sachs Acquisition Holdings Corp II (NYSE: GSAH) is a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, stock purchase or similar business combination with one or more businesses. The company is sponsored by an affiliate of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and will be managed by the Permanent Capital Strategies (PCS) team within Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM). GSAH II will employ Goldman Sachs\u2019 full range of resources to pursue opportunities across a variety of industries.\n\nGSAH II announced the launch of its $700 million initial public offering on June 29th, 2020.The team is led by CEO Tom Knott.\n\nAs of 1/08/2020 $GSAH has progressed 26.30% towards its deadline in finding a target. As a comparison IPOE progressed 12.60% towards its deadline before declaring their target as SoFi  on 1/7/2021 \\[6\\].\n\nResearching the Twitter and Linkedin accounts associated with $GSAH suggests the  target is most likely MoneyLion, a private Fintech firm.  This is further supported by multiple relationships between Goldman Sachs, the CEO of the SPAC, FT Partners, Steve McLaughlin, and MoneyLion. I expect a LOI in Q1 2021 based on current SPAC trends. IPO to LOI/DA has been about 4-6 months.\n\nMoneyLion is a financial company that was founded in 2013. In 2015, the company launched a mobile app with personal financial management and lending tools. In 2018 MoneyLion launched zero-fee checking with early access to paychecks and cashback rewards.The New York mobile bank raised $160M in funding in 2019, which gives it a valuation of nearly $1B \\[8,9\\]. I think the target is OK and will do reasonably well in the current financial environment and premium on innovative Fintech companies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Figure 2. Dee Choubey, the CEO of MoneyLion worked for 4 years at Goldman Sachs as an investment banker. He is still based in New York City and has close working relationship with peers at Goldman Sachs \\[1,2\\]](https://preview.redd.it/hhuxlkvg64a61.png?width=671&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2514bf4d39ad8527f961080819ce0fe3aa7e3933)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Figure 3: Money Lion Twitter account following Steve McLaughlin who is the CEO of FT partners.

He previously served as  Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the  Board of Directors. Mr. Knott has served as the head of the Permanent Capital Strategies (PCS) Group in the Consumer and Investment Management Division (CIMD) of Goldman Sachs since March 2018. Mr. Knott led all aspects of Goldman Sachs\u2019 co-sponsorship of GSAH I from its initial public offering in June 2018 to its merger with Vertiv in February 2020. Prior to his role in the Permanent Capital Strategies Group, Mr. Knott worked within the Credit Alternatives Group in the Consumer and Investment Management Division of Goldman Sachs beginning in 2014. Mr. Knott earned a B.A. in history from Wake Forest University in 2009 and a MA in Management from Wake Forest University in 2010. Mr. Knott was selected to serve on our Board due to his ten-year career of investing in public and private markets, as well as his current experience managing the PCS team and overseeing the search, diligence, underwriting, structuring and execution processes necessary to complete a successful business combination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1.Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division:    A consistent leader in M&amp;A and capital markets, the Investment Banking Division has deep relationships with private equity and corporate clients in all sectors. $GSAH will work with their Investment Banking Division to identify opportunities in the areas that they deem appropriate and attractive for their business combination \\[10\\]\n\n2.Goldman Sachs\u2019 PWM Group:    A network of more than 800 advisors in 26 offices globally that covers more than 12,500 clients and has deep connectivity with CEOs, founders, and family owners of privately held businesses around the world, as of December 31, 2019. The  PWM network provides $GSAH with unique access to privately owned businesses that may be considering strategic alternatives \\[10\\].\n\n3.Previous SPAC experience: Management team previously took $VRT (Vertiv) public and is currently valued at $18.27 as of  01/08/2021.\n\n4. Even if their target fails to be MoneyLion this is a solid Fintech/Technology SPAC that probably will be worth over $20.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1.Goldman Sach\u2019s can be an unethical company when it comes to their financial dealings. $GSAH\u2019s management and support system is concretely in the Goldman Sach's financial environment.\n\n2.Management has a competent, Harvard MBA type, associates but may lack in the creative/innovative front.\n\n**Part 3: Under-writers**\n\nThe under-writers are Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Both are in the top 3 underwriters/bookrunners in the world\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA.Citigroup: Well experienced underwriter  with more than 60 SPACs under their management in the past 4 years including $SBE and few other blockbuster SPACs from 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pq0oyvbc4a61.png?width=1064&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00e61c7d5dfae56cc51753d37d77af6deb3cd704\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plx5qmacc4a61.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3062ff126097e3c318ac134cab2d16ca070b66c2\n\n[Figure 5.

The other underwriter is Goldman Sachs which is also one of the top 3 by bookrunner volume \\[12\\].\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 4: Positive Catalyst**\n\n1.$2000 Stimulus being approved by the new Biden Administration\n\n2.Peaceful and orderly transition of power on January 20th  2020\n\n3.Announcement of LOI/DA \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 5: Negative Catalyst**\n\n1.Market downturn\n\n2.

This is based on the remarkable close working relationship between the executive at MoneyLion, Goldman Sachs, and FT Partners.\n\nJust as recently as 2019 FT Partners, which is run by a previous Goldman Sachs investment banker, helped MoneyLion raise $100 Million in order to compete in this rapidly growing banking niche. The CEO of MoneyLion is himself a former Goldman Sachs investment banker. \n\nLastly, detailed review of the linkedin and twitter accounts of $GSAH, MoneyLion and FT Partners reveals close working relationships hinting at an obvious target.\n\n**Buy:** $GSAH commons &lt; $11.50 prior to release of  LOI/DA. This is close to Net Asset Value (NAV) at $10.00. Limited downside risk of \\~10% with potential upside that is $20+\n\n**Buy:** $GSAH warrants &lt;  $3   prior to the release of LOI/DA. High Risk/ High Reward. I believe the new fair value for pre-LOI/DA  quality Fintech SPACs (ex $FUSE) will be $2-3 as more  money enters the SPAC sphere.   \n\n\n**Friendly reminder:**\n\nAsymmetric risk.

        "selftext": "Seen a lot of posts lately where dipshits use \"TA\" to show a breakout is coming in 7 years. Lucky for you they're idiots who couldn't tell a correction from a recession.\n\nHere's some stupid basic charting I simplified so even you numnuts can understand: PLTR has been trapped in a Gemini Sinosoidal Paradox since its ATH. You can see from the collapsing pennant that PLTR is entering a long-banana split (not to be confused with a long-plantain dip) for tendytown (represented by checkered flag). The minimum has been reached at the 32nd lattitude, implying incredible longitudinal momentum over the coming 2-3 weeks as PLTR escapes a Greek Debt Trap (represented by Euro sign, as Euros sounds like Gyros). We're entering the red zone of the chart and implied volatility in options is less than the realized temperature of the stock (red=hot). Options are trading at a discount so this is the time to buy before a breakout at 2:55pm EST today. This appears to be confirmed by volume, which is forming a circus tent parabola that is clearly at its local minimum. Parabolic Brownian motion will be priced in the second the 6 period EMA crosss over the 20 period MA - for you complete idiots, that means we switch from average motion to exponentially average motion (Nike Swoosh velocity for my cultured acquaintances out there). This is literally 1st grade textbook, still learning to read TA and I'm surprised no one cought it sooner.\n\nPLTR 15/01/2021 36C\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/siylbkic7xa61.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adc19fdee91038024bae4962a67141b4eb7395ac",

The 0.382 retracement during this time frame was also roughly the same area the red 200w MA resided, which provided confluence for the gay bears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j9xzweewwm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45f488b30cf0f9d122c775298800ea52b84e3cda\n\n11/14/2016, Nokia very briefly broke below the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and was very rapidly brought back up to test the red 200w MA. This major test of resistance was, yet again, a failure. From this moment forward Nokia was only able to genuinely break above the red 200w MA one time, 01/07/2019. After ranging above it for only a few short months, Nokia broke below and a subsequent retest caused a massive 42.29% drop in less than 4 months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/etvy6bvwwm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e6f46a8038b393789966aa751c2d4bfa39145da\n\nFor approximately 3 months afterwards, Nokia attempted to regain upward traction. It was rejected immediately as soon as it hit the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, causing yet another major 48.34% selloff from Covid fears. This selloff yielded a low of $2.34, the lowest share price it has had in approximately 2,750 days. On the week of 07/27/2020, Nokia was able to again very briefly break above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. After producing a low volume bull flag below the 200w MA, it was rejected to a low of $3.21. Since the Covid price of  $2.34, $3.21 has so far been the next higher low for Nokia and has since produced another fairly low volume bull flag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z1lrfnj1xm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1854900a6c47ecb596d43eaf8643da4d8cc595cd\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the retards like myself who can't maff very well, 2,750 days comes out to 7.53 years. During Covid, Nokia hit a fucking low that it has not seen in over SEVEN POINT FIVE YEARS. SEVEN POINT FIVE YEARS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-RSI analysis-\n\nThis is where shit gets fucking \\*interesting\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vwh8jmx1xm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a60db103050a04f08ff4ed4bb5773714a3e8f931\n\nThis is the weekly timeframe.\n\nNotice the trendline. On 9 different occasions, Nokia has attempted to break above it only to be rejected and fail support tests.\n\nOn the 10th occasion, Nokia was able to have a minor breakout, successfully retest the trendline, and have a significant rise thereafter.\n\nThe 10th occasion has so far been the longest Nokia has been able to stay above this trendline, with 2 major successful tests of support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1d2l1wc2xm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=583631d853cc314794e4524fbe1979b9905d5d33\n\nIt is now battling with the bullish 50 RSI area for the 3rd time. Each of two prior tests of 50 RSI also coincided with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. That means this is a major zone.\n\nAfter breaking back below the 0.618, the RSI trendline was successfully tested for support. It then bearfagged back up to the 0.618, only to nosedive on a high volume dump.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img hx7jsnp2xm961...*\n\nThis is the 2 week RSI.\n\nNotice how on 3 separate occasions, 60 RSI has so far been rejected. The first two occasions were roughly the same price point, while the third occasion was with a significantly lower high.\n\nThis shows hidden bearish divergence, which was likely a major reason for the price to have dumped so hard from its local high. One thing I have learned about hidden bearish divergence is that it is often an early indicator of buyer strength. It pretty much always results in a retracement, but thereafter, a fairly large rise. This occasion is so far clearly no different.\n\nNotice also that there is significant bullish divergence in the RSI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d5utlt63xm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=500b6016b6dd1b8524e851ebd150168dac68bf67\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the 2 month RSI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w8ck0em3xm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77b1582663e94cf7e91bb22587f1751a0f3855f0\n\n50 RSI is getting hardcore rejected every time price causes the RSI to go anywhere near it. This is a strong indicator in my experience of accumulation.\n\nThe moment 50 RSI breaks on the 2 month RSI and there will likely be a very, very parabolic amount of buying support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy second favorite of this TA: the 3 month RSI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i2z7gn04xm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71b056135b91044375d9f96ea8b502a230d4ec0a\n\n40 RSI absolutely refuses to break, but hey, it has on a few different occasions. Notice the reactions in price however whenever 40 RSI breaks.\n\nPrice moons.\n\nAfter a bullish engulfing candle starting 04/01/2020, 2 subsequent 3 month candles have so far been rejected at entering below 40 RSI, one of which having a very long tail and closing as a long legged doji. This is another strong indicator of reversal aka buying support. They also coincide with the 0.786 and near perfect closes below the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement.\n\nSomeone is accumulating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Patterns-\n\nAnd now, my favorite part of this TA.\n\nHave you been wondering what the big ass white line is for in some of my screenshots, or do you already know? They say when something is too good to be true, it almost always is. I won't ever give up hope that it isn't, however.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tm5z6lf4xm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4451933afe22fdd8e8874ea3350f9c3c92dac3b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are 2 white lines in this screenshot. Both are what I believe \\*could be\\* inverted head and shoulders patterns. If either one of them completes, they can very very easily jump start the next rise in this asset.\n\nIf the small one completes, the target for it will be the 7th time contending with the 200w MA residing currently at $5.07.\n\nIf both of them complete, Nokia has a minimum price target of roughly $9. IF however the $9 target is met, it will have over doubled the current price for this stock. That \\*will\\* cause FOMO.\n\nI will admit, I've had not the greatest luck in spotting real inverted head and shoulders patterns. They let me down alot. :()\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, 1/20/22 leaps are currently at $13/$14 a piece right now on Robinhood.\n\nIf you pay $14 for a 12 month leap contract, you're essentially 'betting' $1.1666 per month that Nokia will make you money.\n\nI find it incredibly difficult to believe you won't make at least SOME money on this play.\n\nEspecially considering months ago, this particular contract bottomed out at $0.12. It just did it again. Double bottom?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI apologize ahead of time if anything seems off, I have checked and double checked this TA to make sure screenshots are accurate, etc..but I'm far from perfect. I guarantee you I fucked something up.\n\nanyway, buy Nokia while you're waiting on GME or PLTR or NIO or whatever. Think deep in your thoughts what constitutes a *real* meme stock and **NOKIA?** ...\n\nhidadsoup",

        "selftext": "(*Editor's note: It's a wild day for the market and the country, and I will try to be as neutral as possible despite the fuckery afoot)*.\n\n* Dems clinched the GA Senate run-off election as Warnock defeats Loeffler while Ossoff defeats Perdue (the first millennial Senator). As the results became more clear last night, futures took a deep dive particularly for NQ, while conversely small caps enjoys a favorable bump. The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. \n\n* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.\n\n* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.\n\n* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).\n\n* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.\n\n* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.\n\n* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.\n\n* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):\n\n    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. \n\n    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. \n\n    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.\n\n* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&amp;P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts. Stay in school kids and avoid storming federal buildings or Twitter will start banning your fucking account. (TWTR locks POTUS account for 12 hrs and is down -1.99% AH).\n\n(Yesterday's [recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr7ze8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_market_driving_news_jan_5/)).",

        "selftext": "### Purpose\nIn this document I will present evidence showing that the AJAX-Plaid merger is likely and was planned out months beforehand. Note that everything in this post is factual and can be backed up with multiple sources *except* for the \"Tying it all together\" section which is speculation on my part.\n\n### AJAX\nI'm not going to deep dive into the AJAX team, the team is impressive and you can see for yourself if you're interested [here](https://ajaxcap.com/team/). The key member to keep in mind here is co-founder **Dan Och**. Dan Och is founder of hedge fund Och-Ziff(now renamed to Sculptor Capital after he left in 2018), which as of September 2019 had an AUM of $33.3 billion. \n\n### Och-Ziff\nOch-Ziff is important here because from 2016 through 2018, **William Barr** was on Och-Ziff's [board of directors](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/08/02/946734/0/en/Och-Ziff-Appoints-William-P-Barr-to-Board-of-Directors.html). See [here](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1196111.htm) for the options that were granted to Barr from Och-Ziff over this period of time. \n\nWilliam Barr, better known as Bill Barr, served as the *U.S. Attorney General from [February 14, 2019 \u2013 December 23, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr), presiding over the Department of Justice(DOJ) during that time.* This timeline will be important later on.\n\nFor now, let's assume that Barr and Och have at least a working relationship.\n\n### Och's relationship with Plaid through BoxGroup\nBoxGroup is an investment firm focused on startups that has a close and long-standing relationship with Plaid.  \n**Zach Perret(CEO/Founder of Plaid) turned down a job at BoxGroup to start Plaid**  \nNimi Katragadda, partner at BoxGroup, says that \"**Plaid is a company BoxGroup had known longer than any other investor**\".   \nIf you look at BoxGroup's [investments page](https://boxgroup.com/#investments), Plaid was \"Launched in BoxGroup Office\".  \n\nAfter leaving Och-Ziff, Dan started another hedge fund--*Willoughby Capital*.   \nWho initially invested in/funded BoxGroup? **\"The small group consists mostly of family offices like Willoughby Capital, billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Och\u2019s family office.\"** \n\n[Source, article from Oct 10, 2019](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2019/10/10/boxgroup-takes-on-first-outside-investors-in-new-funds/?sh=76b93d62165a)\n\nFor now, let's assume that Och and Perret at least know of each other.\n\n### Visa's failed takeover of Plaid\nVisa's failed takeover of Plaid is strange for the following reasons: \n1. Visa has had many similar acquisitions in the past\n2. Other large acquisitions have successfully happened in the fintech space recently\n3. The timeline overlaps with AJAX's timeline almost perfectly\n\n#### Visa's past acquisitions\nSources for this section: [1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/09/30/visas-acquisition-spree-is-part-of-a-well-thought-out-strategy/?sh=7572d0f19d2f), [2](https://www.crunchbase.com/search/acquisitions/field/organizations/num_acquisitions/visa). I will go over just a few of the many acquisitions that they've made in the past couple years.\n- Cybersource, $2 billion\n\t- Cybersource is an e-commerce payment management company that simplifies and automates payment operations.\n- Payworks, Undisclosed amount\n\t- Payworks offers a solution for POS software providers and payment service providers to accept payments through multiple channels by integrating its payment gateway in their software.\n- Verifi, Undisclosed amount\n\t- Verifi offers a faster solution to resolve chargebacks and reduce costs for merchants and issuers.\n\n#### Similar acquisitions in the fintech space\nMastercard and American Express also announced plans to acquire fintechs this year. Mastercard said it agreed to purchase data aggregator [Finicity](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=Mastercard+finicity) for $825 million in June, and American Express completed its estimated $850 million purchase of online lender [Kabbage](https://about.americanexpress.com/all-news/news-details/2020/American-Express-to-Acquire-Kabbage/default.aspx) in October. \u00a0\n\nAnd, of course, *Intuit's acquisition of [Credit Karma](https://investors.intuit.com/news/news-details/2020/Intuit-Completes-Acquisition-of-Credit-Karma/default.aspx) for $4.7 billion* that just successfully completed on Dec 3. It's hard to argue that Plaid and Visa is more of an antitrust infringement than Intuit and Credit Karma.\n\n#### Plaid Acquisition Timeline\n- *Jan 2020* - Visa announces they are acquiring Plaid for 5.3 billion dollars. They expect the deal to take 3-6 months to close. [Source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjE6Kn08KDuAhVaEFkFHVrbAY4QFjAVegQIKhAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fusa.visa.com%2Fabout-visa%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases.releaseId.16856.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw2F1lvEng7H2LzNG1o0ctiI).\n- ***Oct 27th, 2020*** - **AJAX announces its IPO**. [Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201027006294/en/Ajax-I-Announces-Pricing-of-750-Million-Initial-Public-Offering).\n- *Oct 28th, 2020* - AJAX units begin trading. [Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201027006294/en/Ajax-I-Announces-Pricing-of-750-Million-Initial-Public-Offering).\n- ***Oct 28th, 2020*** - **DOJ announces it's considering litigation actions against the Plaid acquisition.** [Source](https://www.bankingdive.com/news/visas-plaid-antitrust-department-of-justice/587939/)\n- ***Nov 4th, 2020*** - **DOJ files antitrust suit against Visa Plaid acquisition.** [Source](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-block-visas-proposed-acquisition-plaid)\n- *Jan 12th, 2020* - Visa calls off Plaid acquisition. [Source](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/visa-plaid-call-off-merger-ending-doj-litigation)\n\n#### Tying it all together\nHere's what I think happened. **Plaid didn't want to be acquired/taken over by Visa and needed a way out.** Maybe they never wanted to be acquired. Maybe they changed their mind after the pandemic made them more profitable and they realized their valuation could be greater than 5.3b. Either way, I think that **Plaid and Dan Och come up with a plan involving Barr to get Plaid out of the takeover--in exchange, Och benefits by having the opportunity to take Plaid public through his SPAC.**\n\n#### Other random facts supporting this thesis\n\u00a0- AJAX's target: \"a scaled, high-quality asset in the internet, software, financial technology or consumer sectors.\", exactly describing Plaid.  \n\u00a0- AJAX has a fund value of $750-862.5 million, large enough for Plaid.  \n\u00a0- AJAX's team contains the co-founder of Square as well as key members from Willoughby Capital.  \n\u00a0- AJAX has a 10% promote fee instead of the usual 20%. \n\u00a0- This one is a little silly, but navigate to Plaid's [quickstart documents](https://plaid.com/docs/quickstart/) and you can ctrl-f for \"ajax\".  \n\u00a0- AJAX commons listed at about $11.30, meaning the big players were willing to pay up to roughly 11$/share. I would say say that NAV for AJAX is technically closer to 11 than 10 as a result.  \n\u00a0- If not Plaid, AJAX still has a strong connection to BoxGroup through Willoughby Capital.

        "selftext": "Just sharing this with you guys as these are on my radar. Share your thoughts!\n\nWith the undeniable growth of the cleantech/sustainable/renewable market, I've made a list of **7 CleanTech SPACs for 2021** yet to confirm a target acquisition(s). Some of these are still pretty fresh so we are going to have to let some more time pass to really know which direction they are headed and whether or not they are worth getting into any positions. I've done a decent amount of research on each and have included some of the basic data that I've collected along the way for my own speculation portfolio. I'm going to continue to watch these moving forward and will most likely make some plays moving into this year. As far as I'm concerned the most important aspects of these are the connections their leadership has, so I've included this info with each.  It gives you a decent idea of the background of the management team and hopefully a better approach to investing. (FYI, some is this is somewhat meaningless but interesting none the less.) Thought I'd share the following info with you all and would love to hear what you guys/gals' thoughts/outlook are on any of these and if they have been in your playbook.\n\nI'm personally mostly interested in non-EV plays that are more in line with utility and energy sectors: Solar, Wind, tidal, thermal, Clean Fuel, Grid, Carbon removal, Transition &amp; Optimization Tech, et cetera. Let face it, carbon isn't going anywhere in the near term and a lot of money is going to be made cleaning/assisting up the current energy system to transition into more reliable and better, cheaper, and more efficient renewable resources. Hope you enjoy and please let me know if you have any feedback!\n\n^(NOTE: Common prices as of the market close 12/31/2020.)\n\n\\---\n\n**ACTC - ArcLight Clean Transition Corp.**\n\n**$11.08**\n\n**Avg.

There are always big gain opportunities, but comeback stories often have a lower floor than other highflying momentum opportunities (GME, EVs, SPACs). \n\nCatalysts &amp; opportunities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RELATIVE VALUATION:**\n\nFirst and foremost, this is a great company. This isn't some kind of \"I'm the smartest idiot in town\" play where you try and make a buck off of something worthless. This is a truly undervalued equity. Chinese stocks have been super hot lately. Mega hot. This isn't necessarily bubbly. China is arguably the strongest market in the world and the emerging middle class over there will fuel rocket-like growth for years to come. Look up Dalio's thoughts on China if you need to be convinced. Stocks like JD, PDD, BILI, BIDU, NIO, have all seen unbelievable rises. Money managers are foaming at the mouth looking for Chinese exposure. I don't blame them. However, after these astronomical rises, money managers will start rebalancing positions and looking for new opportunities. Cue Alibaba. This one has herpes currently. It won't have herpes forever. There's a black swan risk for Alibaba. It won't happen. As gains get trimmed in other Chinese stocks money will flow to BABA undoubtedly. The valuation is too sexy. It's been underperforming for reasons that have absolutely fucking nothing to do with fundamentals. \n\n**UM AKSHYUALLY IT'S A VIE YOU DON'T OWN THE STOCK**\n\nShut the fuck up. People talk about the ownership structure like it's a latent scam to defraud American's of 100s of billions of dollars. This will not happen. China needs access to US capital markets. This would singlehandedly destroy that relationship and hamstring China. Yes, China is the manufacturing capitol of the world. Yes, the USA is the financial capital of the world. We are mutually dependent. If this falls through, we all have way bigger problems than your $2000 call position. Market is fucked period if USA &amp; China go nuclear in the financial markets. Nothing functions without Chinese sourcing.\n\n**INVEST WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT**\n\nCCP has a ownership interest in Alibaba. The CCP also came out and said that they want ownership stake in Ant as well. It's so transparent. CCP is pushing down Alibaba's value, seizing more ownership, then going to let it fly with favorable outcomes to the FUD that they created themselves. Do you really think China is going to kill something that is seen as the golden goose of Chinese ingenuity and progress? China wants to become an economic superpower at all costs. I don't care if the put Jack Ma in prison for life. This thing will continue to grow. Baba is bigger than Jack Ma.\n\n**HOLY FUCK LOOK AT THE FUNDAMENTALS** ***( skip if you're afraid of numbers )***\n\n30% YoY revenue growth. 60% YoY growth in AWS copycat. 900 million MAUs. FCF up 33% YoY to $6 Billion US. Increased share buyback.\n\nAnd the margins. Look at the fucking margins. 29% net profit margin for FY 2019. With 30% Revenue growth. AMZN's net margin is 4%. This thing is an EPS powerhouse that will continue to see ***bonerworthy*** FCF and boost buybacks. In my opinion, this is literally the cheapest listed stock in the world. Held down by FUD.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*FINALLY- WHAT MAKES THIS MOON?\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**#1- Jan 20-** Joe Biden takes office. He wants to show all his friends how much cooler he is than Donald Trump, so he gets a patty-cake deal done with China. Fears about delisting subside. Institutional money gets braver. Black swan risk becomes more muted. I expect positive China relationship commentary to come out within a month of him getting sworn in. His administration will be much less hostile and unpredictable. Great for BABA &amp; US/China relations.\n\n**#2- Feb 11-** Earnings. Earnings will be stellar as always. China handled Covid way better than we did and its economy has been chugging ahead at full stream. The great numbers will remind everyone how fucking cheap this thing is. Expect a pop if it hasn't already ran up a shit ton beforehand. \n\n**#3- Date unknown-** Resolution gets announced between CCP and Alibaba. It will not be as bad as everyone expects. This is literally a dog and pony show to show everyone how cool and strong the government is. Once that uncertainty gets removed, this thing flies. Same goes for Ma reappearance. When that dude comes back with his 1000 yard stare and says everything is cool, expect an instant pop in share price. There is literally every bad piece of news baked into this. This is where you want to be going long. \n\n**How do I play it?**\n\nShares are fine. I was long BABA shares, sold them to buy LEAPs because the pricing was so good. 40% IV not bad for the actual volatility I expect. I wouldn't buy calls expiring before the summer. Time is your friend here because of the situation and waiting on clouds. It has been trading in a tight range from 220-245, If it dips back to 220 I'm adding summer expiry 270 strike calls to my position which I will unload when it breaks out, letting my LEAPs ride.\n\nWhen this thing shakes off the bad press it will fly. I can see $400 before EOY, at which price it'll still be cheaper than its peers.\n\n**Positions: 2x 300C LEAPs expiring Jan 20, 2023, cost basis $6500, current value $8200**   \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zmxn6yd12yb61.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e0602474177995e29d60835e172a5b3295defa7",

        "selftext": "Before this whole fiasco, I was high on BABA as were many of my peers. Jack Ma seems to have pissed off the Chinese government by publicly criticizing regulators and now he seems to have disappeared off the face of the earth.\n\nThe Chinese government doesn\u2019t give a shit, they\u2019re straight up mercenaries. They don\u2019t even pretend to disguise their brutality. For Christ\u2019s sake, they\u2019re genociding an entire group of people (Uighurs, a Muslim minority in western China)!! Point is, if they want you gone, you\u2019re gone. I\u2019m not informed enough to cite specific examples, but haven\u2019t they disappeared billionaires before?? Not making a political statement here, I just want to make money...or rather...avoid losing money due to my BABA position.\n\nSure, Jack Ma could simply be laying low until the heat dies down. No one knows for sure.\n\nMy question is buy, sell, or hold?\n\nMy gut is telling me to sell and take the ~12% loss (I got in just a few months ago) and do some tax loss harvesting and repurpose the $ to something more stable. Otherwise, I fear my 12% loss can balloon to 40%.

        "selftext": "**GameStop short squeeze is ON! Alibaba continues to push into the EV world. Intel spikes while AMD &amp; TSM suffer. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news!**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market finishing mixed, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/qybhmjC) gaining .43%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YL4XS6m) also gaining .23% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/YTFwLcx) lost just 8 points to close out the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0r28dsT) dropping almost 5% again, continuing the downtrend after that huge spike with the Georgia elections, as it sits at similar levels to the ones before Christmas.\n\nDespite the positive gains for the broad stock market SP500, [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/PrDh7DD), we saw about 57% of the companies declining yesterday, with most of them trading below average volumes, as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average still sits over 70%, which is pretty high. Yesterday we saw 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/wJH4B8C) finish in the green with Real Estate and Utilities posting gains of more than 1% while the laggards were Energy, Industrials and Materials, as we saw large-cap growth companies finally [OUTPERFORMED](https://ibb.co/kKtRY96) for once in 2021, with small &amp; mid-caps giving up some of the big gains they have posted in this short year, though, Large-Cap Growth companies are still underperforming by 3% compared to the next factor group in 2021.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Ms0qkCh) from yesterday, which shows pretty mixed results as expected, with most of the big tech companies posting small gains like Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and the rest of the bunch, with Alibaba posting a 4% gain after some EV news popped up and Intel also gaining almost 7% and pushed the rest of the Semiconductors down with TSM and AMD both down over 3%.\n\nWe also got a lot of economic data yesterday as the US [DEFICIT](https://ibb.co/QXXDBrc) fell by $2B to $143B in December compared to the previous month, but is up 10 fold from the $13B deficit from the same period in 2019, and this doesn\u2019t even include any of the $900B stimulus packaged that passed late in December, while the December consumer price [INDEX](https://ibb.co/n1Jr9G2) increased by 0.4% m/m and Core CPI also increase by 0.1%, coming in-line with expectations, as the Atlanta FED business inflation expectations [ROSE](https://ibb.co/t2v98jw) to 2.2% in January compared to December, though sales and profit margins compared to normal, decreased since the last month, while one of the FED\u2019s Vice Chairs [RESTATED](https://ibb.co/WtNxQKM) that the FED won\u2019t raise rates until the average long-term inflation stands at 2% for a year.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/C79879d) we get lots of important economic data with Jobless numbers in the early morning, which are expected to come around the same numbers as the previous week and end with the Money Supply and FED Balance Sheet while the stock market will also turn its eyes to see what the FED Leader Powell announces in terms of the FED keeping the money printer going, and of course to see what Biden announces about a further stimulus packaged that is expected to be as big as $2T.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/9bHNxrx) spiking yesterday after the company decided on a change in leadership, this move put some selling pressure on rival companies like TSM, AMD &amp; others, but I think this is more of a \u201chype move\u201d right now. Intel has still fallen behind it\u2019s competition and it will take massive Capex and R&amp;D investments to catch up, so the selloff in other players should rather be a buying point, especially for AMD.\n\nWe also saw [Target](https://ibb.co/Phk4N4s) reporting huge comp sale increases with a 4.3% increase in traffic and a massive 12.3% increase in the average ticket, as comparable digital sales more than doubled.\n\nWe also saw, their same-day services post an impressive growth of almost 200%, as they remain one of the best plays in the consumer discretionary sector, as 95% of their sales were fulfilled by their 1600 store that are within 10miles of \u00be of the US population.\n\nAlso, guys, these small cap companies keep on giving me reasons to come back to the same points I have been making in the past weeks, with company after company issuing shares, with the latest ones being [Nano](https://ibb.co/qDRKJ7Y) Dimension which are diluting their shares by about 20% while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/27StT0c) has also increased their stock offering by another 300.000 shares.\n\nWhile in another kind of news we saw [GameStop](https://ibb.co/pLMSXrb) soar yesterday finishing the day up over 57%, after a huge short squeeze pushed the stock up as high as 90% at one point. This has happened after GameStop has [PUSHED](https://ibb.co/F3S2XTT) for a change in leadership with plenty of experience in the e-commerce and online marketing world, with 3 veterans from Chewy, which has been an impressive performer in the online e-commerce business. The [STOCK](https://ibb.co/y8XVnd7) Is up another 20% in pre-market right now as the short squeeze keeps increasing the pressure on the bears.\n\nWe also saw [Alibaba](https://ibb.co/vjKdwKW) making a couple of headlines yesterday, which helped push the stocks 4% higher, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is expected to continue to allow investments in Alibaba, Baidu &amp; Tencent, while also continuing their charge into the [EV](https://ibb.co/0tVsJSS) world, with a new electric sedan that features wireless charging in cooperation with China\u2019s state owned SAIC Motor. This is their latest push into the EV world, as Alibaba is also an investor in Xpeng. This news, might help the stock see a recovery, that could be boosted if Jack Ma finally appears and the Ant Group IPO eventually receives the green light.\n\nAnd one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Z8RSWQL) is that Affirm went public yesterday and started trading at just over 90$, more than 80% above the IPO price, as the IPO mania keeps on pushing any recent IPO to big pops on the first day of trading, but unfortunately, retail investors do not benefit from this, as the actual return for people who manage to buy right at the open price, is under 10% while also risking a severe drop in the next days. Hopefully more companies will move to direct listings IPOs which will allow retail investors to get part of the action, which will benefit most of the people, not just the \u201cbig players\u201d who get in at much lower prices.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/T8wRNxc) Markets are in the green while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/LkrrWtc) are also pointing to a good open.\n\n\ud83d\ude4fThank you everyone for reading!\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "**SoFi valuation and expected price target**\n\nAs we\u2019ve all heard, IPOE is in the process of finalizing a merger with SoFi, a juicy fintech firm out of San Francisco, expected to occur sometime in Q1. It\u2019s been given a post-transaction equity valuation of $8.7b (at the usual $10 per share), and the stock essentially doubled on announcement this month, currently trading around $21-22. Which leaves us to wonder - is SoFi now worthy of a $19.6b valuation?\n\nTL;DR\n\nYou bet your tits.\n\nThe individual services provided by SoFi are fairly straightforward and would be a fairly easy valuation on their own, but since so many of them are consolidated into one bundle, there\u2019s not too many companies we can size SoFi up against. With that said, we can look at some of the individual services in SoFi and the respective competitors in those fields which, in aggregate, can provide a sense of where this mother is heading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Banking**. SoFi recently received conditional approval to secure a bank charter. Banks are generally boring, trading at multiples of around 12-15 (P/E). But more importantly, with banking status, SoFi gets access to cheaper capital which increase its margins across the board for every dollar they lend out. Jamie Dimon, who owns the goddamn universe, recently expressed apprehension about fintech elbowing into their industry. SoFi, Square, Stripe, Robinhood\u2026 these firms are going to continue chipping away at traditional banking over the next 10-20 years. And with every new wave of high school and college graduates who realize there\u2019s no practical reason to drag your ass into a brick and mortar bank to make a deposit or buy a checkbook or talk to a mortgage broker, that\u2019s another wave of customers deciding to download a tidy little app instead, readily available beside their Instagram and Grindr.\n2. **Credit cards**. This, in my opinion, is going to be a huge driver of SoFi\u2019s stock accretion in the next few years as it\u2019ll bring more people into the fold. It\u2019s a relatively new launch for SoFi and reportedly increased the company\u2019s membership to \\~1.5 million members as of September 2020 (which is expected to double this year). Along with a little plastic, every new member is exposed to the boutique of financial services provided within the company which, in turn, feeds it additional business in their home loans department, student loan refinancing, etc. SoFi\u2019s target demographic is also low risk, high-earning individuals which decreases the likelihood of default while increasing their margins as compared to traditional lenders. Visa, Mastercard, &amp; AmEx are a few outfits you might have heard of, and they trade at multiples of around 40.\n3. **Mortgages**. Again, the crowd SoFi is servicing is far lower risk than your typical bottom-feeding mortgage company, and when you consider SoFi will offer jumbo loans (mortgage loans &gt; $510,400), this turns a potential liability into a fat, reliable revenue stream. The mortgage industry average P/E isn't great (around 13), and recent mortgage companies going public have done shittily (see Rocket and UWMC), but I wouldn't call mortgages a cornerstone of SoFi's success.\n4. **Investment/payment services.** If there\u2019s any recent fintech company that might help provide some insight as to where SoFi is heading, look at Upstart. This is an algorithmic lending company that IPO\u2019d in December and immediately launched into the stratosphere, trading at roughly 20x *sales*, never mind earnings. The P/E is something mind-boggling like &gt;400 and hasn\u2019t slowed down a bit.\n\nIn short, I\u2019m bullish on SoFi.\n\nAs for price targets, I think it\u2019s generally easier to catch a dry fart in the wind, but we can sniff around and see which way it\u2019s blowing. Like I said, as a combination of industries trading at multiples ranging from 15 (banking), to 40 (credit cards), to the nosebleeds of digital payment services (they acquired Galileo and intend to aggressively acquire more), I think a realistic multiple for SoFi (read: tech) is going to be &gt; 40. Stock prices are going to continue to be delirious for the next few years since there\u2019s nothing else to invest in and interest rates will remain low, but that\u2019s another discussion.\n\nSoFi will continue to grow over the next several years, and if it hits the projected figures for 2025, then its currently price is roughly 18x 2025 earnings. Which is a lot. But with an expected multiple of &gt;40 (in my opinion), I suspect it will climb to $32-35 around merger, pull back a bit to the 25-27 range, and then gradually work its way to $45 by EOY. Who knows from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, and I'd love to hear your feedback.",

        "selftext": "I've seen a few posts about ADRs recently talking about how all chinese stocks (NIO BABA TENCENT) are based in the Cayman Islands and no one's really buying stock in these chinese companies and that China has no need to uphold these agreements - As a disclaimer, before I go on, I was to say I do own stock in NIO and BABA as well as AMZN, AAPL and a few other small AI companies.\n\nWhile many of you may be technically correct about ADRs, it fundamentally ignores the foreign policy climate of almost all countries and more specifically ignores the way China's foreign policy is being conducted right now - I'm not an expert and you should of course do your own DD but what I've noticed from all these posts is that they are all ignoring the idea of Soft Power.\n\n**Lets define what soft and hard power are**: I've taken these definitions from wikipedia, because they're concise and as always wikipedia is well referenced (damn teachers!)\n\nSoft power: In politics (and particularly in international politics), soft power is the ability to attract and co-opt, rather than coerce (contrast hard power). In other words, soft power involves shaping the preferences of others through appeal and attraction - Foreign Aid is an excellent example of the use of Soft Power\n\nHard Power: Hard power is the use of military and economic means to influence the behavior or interests of other political bodies. This form of political power is often aggressive (coercion), and is most immediately effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and/or economic power\n\n**Why is this important?:**\n\nWhile China is on its way to becoming a global superpower its not there yet, there are more economically reliable countries (US) and countries with more functional military might (Russia and US) - I say functional here because military might isn't just man power and number of soldiers.\n\nChina uses hard power when it comes to domestic policy, through the use of censorship, coercion of officials, imprisonment of dissidents and so on and so forth. ([https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/))\n\nHowever, they've also learnt from the collapse of the USSR which collapsed in part due their international and economic isolation among other factors ([https://www.britannica.com/story/why-did-the-soviet-union-collapse](https://www.britannica.com/story/why-did-the-soviet-union-collapse)) - Now China doesn't want that to happen and to ensure it doesn't, it's followed an interesting hybridisation of communism and capitalism where private companies are closely linked to the government but are allowed to compete and have private ownership. However this has meant that chinese companies and by extension China as a country has to be attractive to outside investors and that's where soft power comes in.\n\nThroughout the pandemic and even before China has been trying to expand its soft power further in the hope of eventually leveraging itself into the world's leading super power. Case and point is the Free trade agreement it signed with 14 other asia-pacific countries creating an even larger free market than the eu (16% vs 22%) ([https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/15/china-and-14-asia-pacific-countries-agree-historic-free-trade-deal](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/15/china-and-14-asia-pacific-countries-agree-historic-free-trade-deal)). While this gives it more economic power, it also gives china great headlines!\n\nThis isn't the only way China is trying to garner a better image of itself and therefore more soft power - For a long time, China has been and is commonly viewed as one of the largest polluters in the world ([https://ge.usembassy.gov/chinas-air-pollution-harms-its-citizens-and-the-world/#:\\~:text=The%20People's%20Republic%20of%20China,health%20and%20the%20world's%20economy](https://ge.usembassy.gov/chinas-air-pollution-harms-its-citizens-and-the-world/#:~:text=The%20People's%20Republic%20of%20China,health%20and%20the%20world's%20economy).), pollution that has been killing around a million of its citizens a year - so to not only improve their citizens lives (though how much of the main motivation that is I'm very skeptical) but to also capture the ongoing trend of renewable energy becoming the dominant energy market in the next decade or two, China has been pouring money into clean energy initiatives, so they not only capture a significant slice of an upcoming dominant market but they are also able to position themselves as the clean energy capital of the world.\n\nLet's be clear though, the current pandemic has affected their soft power and reduced it massively which leads onto the crux of my argument.\n\n**How Soft power relates to ADRs and Stocks?**\n\nFor China to successfully follow through with their plans (leveraging soft power into economic might - the tried and tested american way to an extent - except america had WW2 and the Marshall plan to reach this point sidenote: I know that's massively reductive and there's a lot of other factors involved in america becoming a superpower including a shit load of hard power i.e. nuclear bombs and military might) they require investment not just from domestic sources but foreign sources otherwise they gain no soft power. So how does this relate the ADRs:\n\nIf China and Chinese companies were to renege on their agreements with these shell companies, it would lead to major banks, hedge funds and entire countries to disinvest from the chinese economy - a counterpoint I can imagine in the comments may be that it's technically not a reneging because the these chinese companies and chinese law doesn't state that you can own shares but the optics of it certainly are. Every major newspaper would be covering it, people who have invested would be using their soft power (their vote) to push for harder line on china and so would banks who would be disinvesting by their droves from chinese ADRs. I know I wouldn't be buying anything from China again because the risk is too high and that would be the most dangerous thing for the chinese government. They are trying and have until now succeeded in creating an image of a stable thriving economy\n\nDisinvestment may sound sensationalist and to an extent I would agree it may be but the most recent example is BABA stock - The disappearance of Jack Ma not only lead to a massive drop in BABA stock but countless headlines about how dangerous it is to invest in Chinese companies - and while I'm sure Jack Ma when he returns will have to change to adapt to his potentially curbed reality, the chinese government will have also realised that they'll need to adapt to ensure that they don't lose the soft power they've spent over 40 years cultivating ( look up Deng Xiaoping's China reform and opening-up policy).\n\nAnd to address comments that I'm sure will say China can be self sufficient without any foreign investments - I'm sure they can but that path has until now lead to ruin for other countries, the primary example being the USSR and a less prominent example being North Korea. The chinese government is ruthless, efficient and they're certainly not stupid.\n\nOf course if anyone thinks I'm wrong, please let me know - I also understand that the BABA example is more nuanced than how far I've gone into it because of Jack Ma's Ant group going onto central bank turf but the logic behind the point stands.\n\n**TLDR: China would lose their soft power, banks and people would disinvest in China if they didn't honor their ADR agreements and would set China onto the path of future economic ruin and upheaval - I could be wrong though**\n\nEdit: Hong Kong is an interesting counterpoint to my argument, but I would say that to a certain extent, Banks knew HK would be bought under the CCP and still think they can make money there - also Hong Kong massively damaged Chinese Soft power and if there had been a better president I think the effect would have been huge but there wasn't and the markets are over it - if ADRs aren't honoured, then Banks and hedge funds would lose money and I think that that's their bottom line and a red line for them - I could be wrong though",

        "selftext": "Alibaba is looking poised to run after a quiet breakout from its downward trend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter easing of some negative catalysts, the investor outlook on Alibaba is looking increasingly optimistic. With Jack Ma confirmed alive and well, Joe Biden's incoming inauguration, and the removal of Alibaba, Tencent, and others from potential delisting threats, the company is looking oversold in a run-up to its first earnings report since the start of its troubles in late October of last year. Alibaba's main e-commerce business remains unaffected, and the growing Chinese middle class will drive continued growth for Alibaba's main business. Continued investment into cloud computing, entertainment, and many other industries allows Alibaba to diversify its revenue and avoid the anti-monopoly crackdown of the CCP, while still remaining one of the fastest-growing large-cap companies in the fastest-growing country of the 21st century.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's clear from Alibaba's EV collaboration with state-owned SAIC Motor that the company is not going anywhere soon. They recently announced a $5-8B bond sale and upsized an existing stock buyback FROM $6b to $10b, signaling confidence in the long-term presence and health of the company. The drama surrounding the canceled Ant Group IPO has proven to be overblown, as it appears regulators will be issuing a slap on the wrist to Alibaba, and restructuring Ant Group (which BABA holds a 33% stake in) to operate more like a typical bank, as opposed to the high-risk, low-collateral consumer lending that has facilitated their rise. Alibaba's transparent cooperation and smooth conduct with regulators will probably earn them more lenient punishments, and the company's critical role in the liberalization of China's economy and their competition on the world stage will make regulators hesitant to kneecap one of their most valuable national assets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[3 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/tre93wka6dc61.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ac2315522cf48600576b3fef53139a445204321)\n\nIt found a bottom at $210 and has been slowly edging upwards, trading in a range of $220-250 with strong support and resistance at both levels. The higher highs and higher lows found in the past few trading days help confirm this. This week, the ticker has consolidated around $245 for a push above $250. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nActual (not in an endearing way) retards will spout sinophobic propaganda and accusations of 'CCP shill' at anyone who proposes that Alibaba presents a buying opportunity. Smart people make money where there's money to be made. If the GMEs, BBs, and CCIVs of the world seem too speculative and risky for you to put a large stake in, Alibaba is one of the best opportunities you will ever get to invest in one of the most fundamentally solid, profitable companies in the world: large-cap stability with the growth potential of Amazon in 2014.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I am holding 17 shares, and 1 each 1/21/22 300c and 320c. make your own plays, but this thing is going nowhere but up in the medium term.",

Alibaba is an ecommerce giant that is paramount in every single Chinese persons' lives. On one hand, Ma has a big mouth; he shouldn't speak out against the CCP so tread with caution. On the other hand, there isn't much negative news in China against Alibaba currently. Sales on the ecommerce giant is business as usual.\n\n* Price Target - *$300*\n* Entry - Buy *$270 and below*\n* Risk 1-5 - *2*\n* Timeframe - 2-4 months\n\n**$THCX** \\- I will be buying at least 100 shares of this cannabis ETF and selling covered calls next week.

        "selftext": "[SPX Monthly Chart:](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/7rPzyt3E-SPX-Monthly-Risk-Reward-Less-Favorable/)\n\n* The market basically closed the year at ATH (3pts off) and is within a hair of 3855, which is the 138.2% Fib of the March low.\n* The rising monthly channel (shown above) shows that markets are stretched near resistance and already outside of their bollinger bands. The weekly band is at 3774.\n* While I believe there is room for upside into 2021, the risk/reward is **NOT** favorable here anymore. Sentiment is stretched and a correction would be welcomed with open arms.\n* I anticipate a 10-15% correction to start the year, which would align us with the rising 200dma near 3219. We ended the year in a tight range, and there is potential to carry into 3855 based on January 15 open interest and gamma positioning.\n\nLast few days I have been selling stocks and calls aggressively in anticipation of a correction. I am long TLT calls (flat) and SPY puts (down 37%).\n\n**Sentiment:**\n\n* The AAII Sentiment Survey is quite elevated near multi-year highs and shows overly bullish sentiment.\n* The Advisors Sentiment Report reports the views of over 120 independent investment newsletters (those not affiliated with brokerage houses or mutual funds) and reports the findings as the percentage of advisors that are bullish, those bearish and those that expect a correction. The current Bull to Bear spread is one of the highest in decades, yet another indication of frothy sentiment.\n* The NAAIM Exposure Index is currently at 89 and off some 100+ prints but remains elevated to the averages.\n* The BAML Fund Manager Survey shows the three most crowded trades are:  \n\n   * Long Tech via shares\n   * Short USD\n   * Long Bitcoin Spot via Perpetual Swaps\n   * Fund managers are \"all-in\" on leverage. This is evidenced by our DIX print on Thursday yet again showing dark pool buying.\n* Consumer Confidence deteriorated sharply in December, as the resurgence of COVID-19 \"remains a drag on confidence.\u201d\n* CEO Confidence, as tracked by the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index hit a two week low at 47. This is the sharpest drop in economic outlook since April.\n\n**Market Health:**\n\n* NYSE Cumulative Adv/Dec:  \n\n   * Actually pretty healthy right now. This is still well above all of its important moving averages and remains in an uptrend.\n* NYSE McClellan Oscillator:  \n\n   * Neutral currently.\n* NYSE Summation Index (NYSI):  \n\n   * Most commonly used by fund managers to find divergences. Above a short term 5/8 day exponential moving average is a buy signal. Below flashes a short term sell signal. This is *currently showing a sell signal.* However, sell signals in rallies tend to be early signals...\n* Moving Averages:  \n\n   * The 8/21-week EMA crossover has long been a favorite signal for momentum in individual names and also works with Indices. The 21-week EMA is important support for growth/momentum stocks. In general, you want to be long when the 8 week is above the 21 week and short when it is below with crossovers being key trend inflection signals. The 12-month moving average (MA) and monthly MACD are good longer-term risk management tools. The price action relative to the 200-week MA provides a good gauge for the health of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s secular trend. Pullbacks or corrections (aka cyclical bear markets) for the S&amp;P 500 that hold above or near the rising 200-week MA are a secular bull market pattern. Pullbacks that decisively break the 200-week MA are a sign of a secular bear market. Most corrections on the S&amp;P 500 during the 1950-1966 and 1980-2000 secular bull market held between the 100-week MA and the 200-week MA. The 2015-2016 S&amp;P 500 pullback fit this secular bull market correction pattern. The secular bear market periods from 1929-1950, 1966-1980, and 2000-2013 saw sustained periods below these long-term moving averages. This means that the 200-week MA provides a good secular bull market risk management tool or stop loss. Using this history as a guide suggests that the Ichimoku monthly cloud is a good trailing secular bull market stop loss. History also suggests that a decisive move below the monthly cloud confirms a secular bear market for US equities. *Currently we are above all moving averages and this is a bullish signal.*\n\n**Economics:**\n\n* The common theme appears to be an expectation of a synchronized global growth in 2021.\n* The optimism on 2021 delivering a record year for corporate profit growth and strong GDP growth around the globe is very contingent on a successful vaccine rollout. The current surge of cases and hospitalizations in the US and Europe is resulting in further restrictions and lockdowns that will weigh on growth expectations, or at least push out pent-up demand. Consumers have led the recovery so far with a boost from fiscal stimulus but the key to a self-sustained recovery is a strong capex cycle which is seen kicking off in Q2 2021. The labor market will also be in focus after record low unemployment the pandemic saw the number jump to 14.7% in April, the highest since the Great Depression, but has recovered rapidly though losing some momentum as it finished the year near 6.5% unemployment and consensus expectations to reach 5% by the end of 2021, still far-off from the 3.5% pre-crisis rate.\n* The recovery has already started in 2H20 in the US &amp; China while the European recovery has been more subdued. The driver of the strong 2021 recovery will be the full reopening of economies worldwide which makes a successful vaccine distribution critical. The US Dollar is closing 2020 weak and looks to have some structural issues with surging deficits, Fed\u2019s intention to boost inflation, easy financial conditions, and expected economic and political improvements. The combination of easy monetary policy, a rebound in old economy industries and a global upswing in growth provides a healthy backdrop for 2021. The balance sheets of households, corporate and governments are expanding alongside the aggressive monetary policy and signs of inflation returning causing a rotation back to value and cyclical growth supported by a steepening yield curve.\n* GDP is seeing rising 6.4% globally in 2021 according to Morgan Stanley, the consensus is for 5.4% growth. In the US those numbers are 5.9% and 3.8% respectively.\n* Inflation would be the key risk into 2021 with it likely to start showing up in 2H21, and the risk being an overshoot could start a disruptive shift in Fed policy. Surging debt remains another concern, as a share of U.S. GDP, total debt has spiked near a record high and total nonfinancial debt has surged to new all-time highs. The rapid increase in government deficits is due to the combination of 1) the budget shortfall that already existed and was growing, plus 2) the deficit spending to fund the stimulus programs to date.\n* The other clear risk in 2021 is China where debt defaults are rising and could spark a move to credit tightening and a recession that would strangle the global recovery. The overall default rate is currently low but the percentage spike in debt/GDP was the highest since 2009 which could lead to policy tightening in 2021.\n\n**Market Valuation and Fundamentals:**\n\n* The NASDAQ continue to outperform in 2020 with a 45%+ YTD return compared to the S&amp;P at +15% as major secular trends in technology continue to play out. The trend of rapid rotational moves also continue with growth often seeing selling pressure for a few days before quickly recovering and resuming the longer-term uptrends. Into 2021 earnings growth is expected to be a record though room for multiple expansion is minimal. A combination of improving economic conditions causing greater business and consumer confidence should drive strong earnings growth in 2021. Increased fiscal spending and a moderation of tariffs provide additional tailwinds. In 2020 many businesses shedded labor and transformed business models to higher productivity to offset the collapse in demand and low inventories with rebounding production point to margin expansion in 2021. The 2021 environment shapes up to be one of solid earnings growth, a return of buybacks and modest multiple contraction. The growth versus value debate is likely to continue but the low-rate environment continues to favor growth, but even more-so a greater preference for quality, companies with strong balance sheets, cash flow generation, and returns on capital should continue to outperform. We are seeing historically strong earnings revision ratios and a record percentage of stocks with dividend yields above the rate of the ten-year Treasury, both conducive to allocations to equities. Compared to bonds, equities can act as a hedge in case of inflation and, with a thorough selection process, can still offer returns closer to historical returns.\n* My forecasts for 2021 take into account consensus expectations, a bull case for a strong vaccine rollout, and a bear case for disruptions to the vaccine rollout and geopolicatical potential issues. I am assigning a 40% probability for the bull case, 40% for the base case, and 20% for the bear case to arrive at a S&amp;P fair value of 3600 though 1H21. In 2H21 we start to look to 2022 estimates and feel we can approach $200 EPS with slight multiple contraction to 22X leaving upside potential to 4400 for year-end 2021.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/QqPjfbU](https://imgur.com/a/QqPjfbU)\n\n* For 2021, the bottom-up EPS estimate (which reflects an aggregation of the median EPS estimates for CY 2021 for all of the companies in the index) is $169.20. For CY 2021, analysts are projecting earnings growth of 21.7% and revenue growth of 7.7%. The 6% trend growth rate since the 1930s would point to S&amp;P 500 EPS getting back to trend levels of $187 in 2022. An optimistic vaccine scenario would see S&amp;P 2022 EPS well above $200.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/lLhmsb3](https://imgur.com/a/lLhmsb3)\n\n* The low rate environment impacts the multiple, and assuming the 10-year stays low, the Fed keeps rates at zero, and credit spreads stay firm, a valuation framework would put a trailing PE at 24X and forward at 21.5X for the current environment. The spread between the S&amp;P dividend yield versus the corporate Baa bond yield is near historical highs and the ERP (Equity Risk Premium) is very high by many measures. Assuming the spread between the dividend yield and IG corporate yield goes back to 2012-19 levels, it would point to 30%- plus upside for S&amp;P 500 valuations. Assuming some rise in rates as the spread narrows more from falling equity yields would point to 20%-plus upside. In 2021, policy support should remain in place to curtail risk aversion. Besides the risk of a credit crisis, concerns over a late-cycle overheating have been pushed further out due to the pandemic-induced recession and policy makers\u2019 increased inflation tolerance. When comparing relative attractiveness across asset classes, which ultimately steers a substantial part of investment flows, equity markets continue to look quite attractive. Since the beginning of 2020, real bond yields in the USA have declined by over 100 basis points, outpacing the decline in earnings yields (inverse of the price-earnings ratio), thus supporting higher valuation multiples. Currently the difference between the earnings yield and the real bond yield as a measure for the equity risk premium (ERP) is higher than the long-term average, suggesting that equities offer an attractive excess return over bonds. Although lower interest rates support higher multiples due to the increase value of future earnings, a return to normal could push long-term interest rates higher and exert downward pressure on equity valuation multiples.\n\n[Sector Growth Rates](https://imgur.com/a/IJPIPWW)\n\n**Analyst 2021 Predictions:**\n\n* Morgan Stanley: $3900 - After a year of big swings in valuations, 2021 will be about who can deliver on earnings. 2020 was all about beta and understanding how equity markets trade in and around a recession that handed us the fattest pitch we\u2019ve seen in a decade. 2021 will be much more about stock picking (alpha) and should favor those companies that can deliver earnings growth that isn\u2019t already expected or priced. MSCO prefers companies with earnings growth most tied to re-openings and an economic recovery and also favors small caps. Financials are also preferred due to positive upside skew on rising rates and better credit; Materials and Industrials on demand rebound, earnings leverage and inflation protection; and Health Care given its GARP characteristics and re-rating potential with fading political overhangs.\n* Bank of America: $3800 - Stocks have already priced in much of the expected recovery in the economy and corporate profitability, leaving just slightly more upside heading into next year. Even as investors ride a wave of vaccine-related optimism, potential negative catalysts abound. The recovery is intact and the world likely reopens in the 2H, but a lot of optimism is priced in already on vaccine/recovery. Vaccine execution risk, delayed fiscal stimulus and longer lockdowns are risks. But a few themes support stocks: the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield is 3x the 10-year yield, and S&amp;P 500 dividends are set to increase in 2021. And unlike bond yields, earnings are nominal and participate in inflationary upside \u2013 where inflation risks may be running higher, given rampant money-printing and a potential post-vaccine spike in demand. BAML picks value stocks over growth, cyclicals over defensives and small caps over large caps, given each of these groups\u2019 likelihoods to be disproportionately boosted by a post-virus economic recovery.\n* Goldman Sachs: $4300 - A vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. The economic reopening coming alongside a vaccine, in tandem with a status quo policy environment cemented with a divided government, will help push the S&amp;P 500 to 4,300 by year-end 2021 and then to 4,600 by the end of 2022. The forecast assumes that the Senate will remain under Republican control following the Georgia run-off elections in January, the economy will continue on a path toward a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery, corporate profits will rebound, Fed funds rate will hold near-zero and the yield curve will steepen while the 10-year Treasury yield climbs only modestly.\n* Deutsche Bank: $3950 - Much of 2020\u2019s run-up in the stock market came with multiples expansion, as prices escalated despite a drop in earnings, as companies dealt with fallout due to the coronavirus pandemic. Next year, as the economy recovers and a vaccine allows for long-lasting re-openings, earnings growth will rebound and multiples will de-rate. The pattern of the equity market recovery, bottoming halfway through recession and recouping most of its losses before it\u2019s over, has been typical but the continued run-up means valuations are high. In our reading, elevated multiples reflect increased participation of retail investors which we see as sustaining, but we expect the multiple to begin to de-rate. For 2021, a recovery in earnings \u2014 which essentially increases the denominator of the price-earnings ratio \u2014 should lower multiples. That said, an increase in companies\u2019 payout ratios as dividends and buybacks return could at least partially offset this. A gradual correction of overvaluation argues for the current overvaluation of 5 multiple points to diminish but remain significant at 3.6 points, putting the end-2021 multiple at 20.5X.\n* Jefferies: $4200 - Improving prospects for a vaccine, easy lending conditions and broader participation among cyclical and value stocks will help propel the stock market higher in 2021. November\u2019s historic stock market rally, led by cyclical and value stocks in the energy, financials and industrials sectors, reflected broadening equity strength beyond just big tech and software shares. That rotation is anticipated to continue into next year, helping push the broader market higher. Notwithstanding the second and third Covid-19 waves permeating the world, there is a palpable feeling that the global economy is resynchronizing with the household, corporate and government balance sheets expanding simultaneously alongside aggressive monetary policy. The much-maligned value and cyclical growth sectors are slowly making a comeback as inflation pressures begin to return. This rotation has been supported by a steepening in the yield curve and with growthier stocks trading sideways. Improved visibility towards a successful coronavirus vaccine, easier lending conditions, little evidence of deflation and a sentiment switch from growth to value will lift US bank shares through 2021. Rising global capacity utilization rates, firmer producer prices, improving world trade volume, booming housing/autos and a weak dollar are the perfect environment for the S&amp;P 500 Industrials. The S&amp;P 500 materials sector is blowing off in response to a weak dollar, higher commodity prices, an upswing in global manufacturing and a restocking cycle.\n* CSFB: $4050 - Our 2021 forecasts are designed to answer a simple question: what the future will (2022) look like in the future (end of 2021). From this perspective, we are forced to de-emphasize the near-term, focusing instead on the return to a more normal world. As we look toward 2022, the virus will be a fading memory, the economy robust, but decelerating, the yield curve steeper and volatility lower, and the rotation into cyclicals largely behind us. Since the stock market discounts future events, each of these prospects for further improvement down the line should translate into a higher S&amp;P 500 as investors price in these events.\n* UBS: $4100 - The vaccine-related developments that drove stocks\u2019 gains in November and early December have now been baked into market expectations, leaving vaccine distribution the next milestone for equity investors to consider in 2021. The key driver of U.S. equities will be the pace of vaccinations, similar to how shifts in mobility drove equities through the spring and summer. As people get vaccinated, they are likely to \u2018normalize\u2019 spending on areas impacted by COVID shortly thereafter. We see the rotation toward cyclical services spending and other COVID-hit areas as a key investment theme for 2021. UBS is overweight the consumer discretionary, industrials and energy sectors given that consumption and production will likely rebound next year. It downgraded materials and financials to Neutral. It is also Underweight consumer staples, utilities and REITs and Neutral on information technology, but overweight communication services and health care on still attractive growth relative to valuations. UBS maintained an upside case for the S&amp;P 500 of 4,400, which would emerge in the case of higher-than-baseline growth against a backdrop of still-low interest rates. However, in a downside case, the S&amp;P 500 could fall to 3,300, which would entail a weaker recovery and/or tighter financial conditions.\n* BMO Capital: $4200 - Heading into 2021, stocks are poised to keep reaping the benefits of the massive infusion of monetary support from the Federal Reserve, along with an anticipated additional round of fiscal stimulus. This constructive policy environment is likely to help push equities higher even as virus concerns linger for at least the first several months of the new year. Even with recent positive vaccine and treatment developments, the global pandemic and its unprecedented impact is unlikely to fade in coming months. As such, the massive fiscal and monetary response in the U.S. and around the world (also unprecedented) will likely remain in place to combat its negative economic impact for the foreseeable future. Such environments have historically supported continued stock market gains and we see no reason why 2021 will be any different. Aside from the global financial crisis, 2020 represented the swiftest quarter-over-quarter earnings collapse for the S&amp;P 500 where index EPS plummeted nearly 50% during 1Q, thus, we anticipate that 2021 has the potential to be one of the best years ever in terms of earnings growth, something we believe will also help to push stock prices higher. We remain optimistic and expect another year of double-digit gains as the economy and society slowly transition back to normal.\n* Barclays: $4000 - Markets are right to be optimistic about the global economic outlook in 2021, with growth returning and inflation rising but staying below central bank targets. Projected global gross domestic product growth of 5.6% in 2021, rebounding from a 3.6% contraction this year, with most Western economies reaching so-called herd immunity from Covid-19 in the second and third quarters of the year. Forecasts reflected the recent slew of positive vaccine results with efficacy rates exceeding expectations, which point to a significant boost for growth in the second quarter of 2021. Barclays also suggested the inflation outlook would not indicate any unwinding of current unprecedented levels of central bank support. Labor markets are recovering, but we are still at very high unemployment, so there is undeniably a lot of slack in the system. That means that when it comes to core inflation and the underlying drivers, to wage costs etc., that was unlikely to happen in the short run, meaning even next year. It would take several years really to come back. While Barclays anticipates a gradual improvement in inflation, it will not be significant enough to cause central banks to consider tightening their accommodative monetary policy stances. We have an environment whereby growth comes back, inflation stays relatively muted, and you have central banks continuing to support the recovery, and tightening is still far out.\n* Oppenheimer: $4300 - The S&amp;P 500 is likely to post another double-digit percentage gain in 2021 as the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines underpins a lasting economic recovery. This outcome is based on six key assumptions: First, that the public will expediently accept and receive COVID-19 vaccines and second, that equity investors will discount the success of the vaccines in reversing the disruptions brought on by the pandemic. Thirdly assumes that at least one of the two Senate seats in the Georgia runoff election will go to a Republican lawmaker, thereby retaining their control of the Senate and reducing (if not necessarily eliminating) the risk that the Biden administration will eradicate the corporate tax reform act of 2017. Fourth, the Federal Reserve will continue its low interest rate regime in tandem with accommodative monetary policy, and fifthly, that congressional lawmakers will step in with another round of fiscal stimulus by the first quarter of 2021 at the latest. Lastly, that investor appetite will continue to tilt toward \u201cstocks that favor diversification and both growth and value segments of the market in a relatively low interest rate environment that favors equities, real assets and other asset classes over fixed income for intermediate and longer-term objectives. The vaccine rollout is arguably the most important in determining the trajectory of the S&amp;P 500 next year. Ultimately the stock market is broadly dependent on economic growth to drive revenues and earnings across the sectors.\n* JP Morgan: $4400 - Investors are entering 2021 against a confluence of market-positive events, including improving prospects for widespread vaccinations and sustained economic reopening, gridlock in Washington and accommodative central bank policy. Given the COVID-19 crisis, vaccine distribution is likely the linchpin event. But even with widespread vaccine availability still months away, optimism over early vaccine efficacy data has already sparked a rally among stocks hardest-hit by the pandemic. The equity market is facing one of the best backdrops for sustained gains in years. After a prolonged period of elevated risks (global trade war, COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. election uncertainty, etc.), the outlook is significantly clearing with the business cycle expanding and risks diminishing. We expect a \u2018market nirvana\u2019 scenario for equities with the melt-up continuing into 1H21, driven by earnings recovery and multiple expansion. Much of next year\u2019s stock market rise is likely to come at the beginning of the year, as lingering uncertainties over vaccine distribution, the results of the Georgia senate race and additional monetary and fiscal stimulus start to dissipate. While the broader backdrop should still remain constructive in the second half of next year, by then the market will have likely priced in close to a full recovery and investors may start to expect a gradual shift in central bank forward guidance away from the current exceptionally accommodative stance.\n* BTIG - $4000 - Global synchronized growth underpinned by central bank ease and a Washington which sees Election 2020\u2019s decidedly mixed outcomes as a catalyst for cooperation (spend, it\u2019s necessary) and centrist government (no tax hikes) results in a Redistribution of Wealth consistent with the 2003-06 synchronized reflation period where Value outperformed. Growth, Small Cap outperformed Large Cap, and International equities outperformed the S&amp;P 500.\n\n**Gold:**\n\n* [Monthly](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GLD/TUbcSBg2-GLD/)\n* Gold had a solid year in 2020 gaining more than 20% as a long base breakout that triggered in June 2019 continued to play out higher and reached its measured move objective while the rally briefly broke above 2011 highs before pulling back. If we look at Fibonacci extension targets of the 2011-2015 correction GLD has upside targets at $207 and $220. The 2018-2020 rally has Fibonacci retracement support levels at $162.5 and $152.5. Gold rallied in 2020 on economic uncertainty and a flight to safety and has pulled back in Q4 with the greater optimism for 2021 taking hold. On an allocation basis, Gold may be losing some of its luster as a store of value with the momentum seen in Bitcoin , although that has not been seen to this point with global gold ETF inflows topping a record in 2020 as a way to diversify portfolios and hedge against inflation. However, November saw the second largest outflow on record. In 2020 the lockdowns resulted in a 5% decline in global output, so the supply-side is expected to rebound in 2021. Gold prices should be supported by inflationary pressures, a deep fiscal deficit and a weaker USD. Goldman sees Gold reaching $2300 in 2021 as recovery from the coronavirus-related recession fuels higher inflation next year. Further fuel could be added from a recovery in demand from India and China.",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, first wanted to thank everyone for the community here. I appreciate your contributions. This is my first post and I'd love any feedback! \n\nI've been doing a lot of work in the US cannabis space and 2021 is shaping up to be a big year for the cannabis industry and for Ayr Strategies (AYRWF), a US multi-state operator.\n\n**TL;dr: The stock could be a 3-6x over the next two years and 10x+ longer-term. The US MSOs will be the most direct beneficiaries of growing cannabis consumption, and AYRWF has a strong management team, the highest growth over the next two years, best-in-class margin profile, and lowest valuation.**\n\n*Note: the company is listed in Canada under AYR.A and is available over-the-counter under AYRWF (OTC ticker recently changed from AYRSF to AYRWF).*\n\n**Thesis**\n\n* Cannabis is a $80-100Bn consumer staple category but only $20Bn are legal sales. The rest of the market is illicit. In addition to seeing the overall industry grow, the US operators should see a strong tailwind from illicit sales converting to legal sales\n* AYRWF is expanding its footprint in seven high-growth states including MA, PA, NJ, AZ, OH, FL, and NV (see table below)\n   * Limited license dynamics gives AYRWF a buffer against new competition\n   * Recent acquisitions in Florida and New Jersey give the company a strong position in two large, growing markets. Deals slated to close in 1Q21/2Q21\n* Strong financial profile\n   * AYRWF projected to grow \\~140% in 2021 (75% organic) and 65% in 2022 (40% organic)\n   * The Company has 40%+ EBITDA margins currently\n* Company has a strong, sophisticated management team with a background in finance, mergers &amp; acquisitions, and operations. They run a tight ship as evidenced by their high EBITDA margins and ability to execute through COVID-related disruptions throughout 2020\n* Several industry catalysts including:\n   * Adult use legalization in PA, FL, OH\n   * Banking bill that decriminalizes cannabis. Would improve margin profile, improve cost of debt, and would allow AYRWF to list on a major exchange\n      * Banking bill would be a major catalyst for all of the US operators\n* Stock is significantly undervalued\n   * AYRWF trading at 9.5x and 5.0x 2021 and 2022 EBITDA, respectively vs peer average of 21x 2021 and 13.5x 2022\n   * For context, GRWG trading at 40x+ 2022 EBITDA\n\n**What is the stock worth?**\n\n* If AYRWF simply traded at the group average of 13x 2022 EBITDA, the stock would be worth $75, or a 3x from here...\n* ...but what would you pay for a high-growth consumer staple business growing 40%+ organically with 40%+ EBITDA margins? 25x EBITDA ($145 target price - 6x upside)? 30x ($170)? 40x ($230 - 9x upside)? I believe the stock will get a higher valuation as we get positive news throughout 2021 and cannabis increasingly becomes a part of the mainstream\n* How does the valuation gap close? Deal closures, execution, and discovery. Until recently AYRWF has been a strong but smaller player that not many people had heard of. Through a series of acquisitions (some of which have yet to close) the company will have a diversified footprint indexed to some of the best markets in the US. The company is well positioned to become a top 5 MSO by the end of 2021\n\n**Risks**\n\n* Recently announced deals to acquire assets in FL and NJ don't close\n* Delays in implementation of adult use sales in AZ and NJ\n* Execution missteps\n\n**Overview of AYRWF's state footprint**\n\n* PA: market estimated to grow \\~60%/year from 2020-2025 (assumes adult use legalization by 2023)\n   * AYRWF expanding from 1 dispensary to 6 in 2021\n* MA: market estimated to grow 10.5%/year from 2020-2025.\n   * MA is already an adult use state but the story here is around Boston where AYRWF recently received a license to operate a dispensary in downtown Boston. Sales to begin in 2021\n* NV: market estimated to grow 12%/year from 2020-2025. NV performance through COVID shows strength of this market\n   * AYR has 6 dispensaries\n* NJ: market estimated to grow 80%/year from 2020-2025. Adult use sales likely to begin in mid-2021\n   * AYRWF recently acquired a vertically-integrated license in NJ including 3 dispensaries\n* AZ: market estimated to grow 15%/year from 2020-2025, with growth front-loaded in the next couple of years as adult use sales begin in 2021\n   * AYRWF has 3 dispensaries currently\n* FL: market estimated to grow 25-30%/year from 2020-2025 (assumes adult use legalization by 2023)\n* OH: market estimated to grow 50%/year from 2020-2025 (assumes adult use legalization by 2024). Relatively nascent medical market that has surprised many jumping out to a $250MM run-rate in a little over a year\n   * AYRWF bought cultivation and production assets in OH",

        "selftext": "**GameStop short squeeze is ON! Alibaba continues to push into the EV world. Intel spikes while AMD &amp; TSM suffer. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news!**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market finishing mixed, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/qybhmjC) gaining .43%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YL4XS6m) also gaining .23% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/YTFwLcx) lost just 8 points to close out the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0r28dsT) dropping almost 5% again, continuing the downtrend after that huge spike with the Georgia elections, as it sits at similar levels to the ones before Christmas.\n\nDespite the positive gains for the broad stock market SP500, [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/PrDh7DD), we saw about 57% of the companies declining yesterday, with most of them trading below average volumes, as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average still sits over 70%, which is pretty high. Yesterday we saw 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/wJH4B8C) finish in the green with Real Estate and Utilities posting gains of more than 1% while the laggards were Energy, Industrials and Materials, as we saw large-cap growth companies finally [OUTPERFORMED](https://ibb.co/kKtRY96) for once in 2021, with small &amp; mid-caps giving up some of the big gains they have posted in this short year, though, Large-Cap Growth companies are still underperforming by 3% compared to the next factor group in 2021.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Ms0qkCh) from yesterday, which shows pretty mixed results as expected, with most of the big tech companies posting small gains like Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and the rest of the bunch, with Alibaba posting a 4% gain after some EV news popped up and Intel also gaining almost 7% and pushed the rest of the Semiconductors down with TSM and AMD both down over 3%.\n\nWe also got a lot of economic data yesterday as the US [DEFICIT](https://ibb.co/QXXDBrc) fell by $2B to $143B in December compared to the previous month, but is up 10 fold from the $13B deficit from the same period in 2019, and this doesn\u2019t even include any of the $900B stimulus packaged that passed late in December, while the December consumer price [INDEX](https://ibb.co/n1Jr9G2) increased by 0.4% m/m and Core CPI also increase by 0.1%, coming in-line with expectations, as the Atlanta FED business inflation expectations [ROSE](https://ibb.co/t2v98jw) to 2.2% in January compared to December, though sales and profit margins compared to normal, decreased since the last month, while one of the FED\u2019s Vice Chairs [RESTATED](https://ibb.co/WtNxQKM) that the FED won\u2019t raise rates until the average long-term inflation stands at 2% for a year.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/C79879d) we get lots of important economic data with Jobless numbers in the early morning, which are expected to come around the same numbers as the previous week and end with the Money Supply and FED Balance Sheet while the stock market will also turn its eyes to see what the FED Leader Powell announces in terms of the FED keeping the money printer going, and of course to see what Biden announces about a further stimulus packaged that is expected to be as big as $2T.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/9bHNxrx) spiking yesterday after the company decided on a change in leadership, this move put some selling pressure on rival companies like TSM, AMD &amp; others, but I think this is more of a \u201chype move\u201d right now. Intel has still fallen behind it\u2019s competition and it will take massive Capex and R&amp;D investments to catch up, so the selloff in other players should rather be a buying point, especially for AMD.\n\nWe also saw [Target](https://ibb.co/Phk4N4s) reporting huge comp sale increases with a 4.3% increase in traffic and a massive 12.3% increase in the average ticket, as comparable digital sales more than doubled. \n\nWe also saw, their same-day services post an impressive growth of almost 200%, as they remain one of the best plays in the consumer discretionary sector, as 95% of their sales were fulfilled by their 1600 store that are within 10miles of \u00be of the US population.\n\nAlso, guys, these small cap companies keep on giving me reasons to come back to the same points I have been making in the past weeks, with company after company issuing shares, with the latest ones being [Nano](https://ibb.co/qDRKJ7Y) Dimension which are diluting their shares by about 20% while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/27StT0c) has also increased their stock offering by another 300.000 shares.\n\nWhile in another kind of news we saw [GameStop](https://ibb.co/pLMSXrb) soar yesterday finishing the day up over 57%, after a huge short squeeze pushed the stock up as high as 90% at one point. This has happened after GameStop has [PUSHED](https://ibb.co/F3S2XTT) for a change in leadership with plenty of experience in the e-commerce and online marketing world, with 3 veterans from Chewy, which has been an impressive performer in the online e-commerce business. The [STOCK](https://ibb.co/y8XVnd7)  Is up another 20% in pre-market right now as the short squeeze keeps increasing the pressure on the bears.\n\nWe also saw [Alibaba](https://ibb.co/vjKdwKW) making a couple of headlines yesterday, which helped push the stocks 4% higher, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is expected to continue to allow investments in Alibaba, Baidu &amp; Tencent, while also continuing their charge into the [EV](https://ibb.co/0tVsJSS) world, with a new electric sedan that features wireless charging in cooperation with China\u2019s state owned SAIC Motor. This is their latest push into the EV world, as Alibaba is also an investor in Xpeng. This news, might help the stock see a recovery, that could be boosted if Jack Ma finally appears and the Ant Group IPO eventually receives the green light.\n\nAnd one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Z8RSWQL) is that Affirm went public yesterday and started trading at just over 90$, more than 80% above the IPO price, as the IPO mania keeps on pushing any recent IPO to big pops on the first day of trading, but unfortunately, retail investors do not benefit from this, as the actual return for people who manage to buy right at the open price, is under 10% while also risking a severe drop in the next days. Hopefully more companies will move to direct listings IPOs which will allow retail investors to get part of the action, which will benefit most of the people, not just the \u201cbig players\u201d who get in at much lower prices.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/T8wRNxc) Markets are in the green while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/LkrrWtc) are also pointing to a good open.\n\n \ud83d\ude4fThank you everyone for reading!\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "From reading what you degenerates write on this god forsaken subreddit, it\u2019s safe to say that you guys are fans of squeezing the living shit out of short sellers, right? Well I have a stock for you that will accomplish just that. Moreover I strongly believe it looks primed up for the oh so coveted Infinity Squeeze that we all strive to take a ride on. This company is called Joyy, trading under ticker $YY. \n\n$YY is under attack from our favorite neighborhood short seller Carson Block of Muddy Waters. You may remember him from the report he released on Luckin Coffee (which wasn\u2019t his work) and more recently the report on $GSX (which I agree with and is actually a complete fraud). While I respect Carson, he is dead wrong on $YY and I can tell you with an *extremely* high degree of confidence that he used the bullshit short report to tank the stock and cover a short position he has been long underwater on. I will get into the details in just a minute.\n\nSo WTF is $YY? $YY or Joyy is an extremely popular video streaming platform that owns the apps YY Live, Bigo Live and Huya (which they spun out and sold to Tencent). $YY recently announced that they came to an agreement with Baidu to sell YY Live to them for $3.6 bn. This would leave the company with Bigo Live as the remaining asset and a nice big fat cash balance of $7.1 bn. At a market cap of $7.5 bn, you are basically getting Bigo Live for free. Bigo Live is growing revenues 130%+ per year and is basically the Only Fans of Asia. Tik Tok is worth 20x sales and growing slower. If we even give $YY 1/5th the valuation, this stock will quickly 3X from here. Notice I didn\u2019t say just China...because after they sell YY Live, the company has no China exposure and is headquartered in Singapore. Bigo Live is consistently in the Top 10 grossing apps on Google and Apple App Store globally. \n\n$YY management came out and refuted MWs fraud claims wholeheartedly saying:\n-the report contains errors, unsubstantiated statements and misleading conclusions/interpretations.\n-the company is open to cash verification and diligence to be conducted by competent third-party advisers.\n-announced a $300 mln buyback and massive dividend (FIND ME A FRAUD THAT PAYS ITS SHAREHOLDERS DIVIDENDS...ILL WAIT)\n\nMuddy Waters is stretching to make an insane call. You\u2019re telling me that $YY\u2019s core asset is completely fraudulent and they were able to trick Baidu AND Tencent due diligence teams into buying assets from them for EXTREMELY large sums of money? AND trick GOOGLE AND APPLE TOO!?!? Come the fuck on. We have spoken with countless former employees and competitors who all have said the company is totally legitimate. You\u2019re telling me $YY has planted ex-executives (who have no reason to lie) with expert networks to make false claims? Come the fuck on again. Finally, my MOST IMPORTANT POINT - if you are a top grossing app on the Google or Apple App Store, you are paying a tax of 30% to Google or Apple for all in-app purchases. Muddy waters is claiming 80% of the revenues are false and coming from round tripping/bots of the company. WHY WOULD A COMPANY COMMIT FRAUD BY PAYING THEMSELVES FAKE REVENUE ONLY TO GIVE AWAY 30% OF THIS REVENUE TO GOOGLE AND APPLE!!! COME THE FUCK ON PEOPLE. \n\nAfter the Muddy Waters hit job, Snow Lake Capital\u2019s Ma Ziming revealed in an interview that he was awakened in the early morning to understand the situation, and immediately increased his holdings of $YY stock by $100 million USD. Who is Snow Lake Capital you may ask? Maybe you guys might remember the short report that Muddy Waters put out on Luckin Coffee. This short report was not the work of Muddy Waters but in fact was the work of Ma Ziming\u2019s fund Snow Lake Capital and Muddy Waters simply released it on their behalf. Which makes this $100 million buy of $YY EVEN MORE JUICY.\n\nhttps://xueqiu.com/3582153332/163835924\n\nZhu Xiaohu said in the circle of friends,\"Muddy Waters only dared to short $YY in the second half of the night. Otherwise, you will definitely get beaten up.\u201d Funny enough, Carson Block always releases short reports on Chinese stocks between 3-5am Shanghai time when it\u2019s a position that he covers up quickly.\n\nLast thing I will leave you with is the #1 shareholder of $YY is Lei Jun who is the founder of Xiaomi. He is worth $25bn USD and a top 10 richest guy in China and owns close to $2Bn of $YY stock. He tried to BUY THE ENTIRE COMPANY...All of $YY...at around $70/share a couple years ago. He was the Chairman of the Board. WHY WOULD AN INSIDER TAKE A FRAUD PRIVATE WHEN HE COULD SELL HIS STAKE TO IDIOT U.S. INVESTORS LIKE YOU. This is what normal frauds would do. INSTEAD $YY is paying out dividends and buying back tons of stock from their (according to Muddy Waters) \u201cfake cash pile.\u201d WAKE UP MARKET, Muddy Waters wrote this report in February (that\u2019s when it is dated) and is now releasing it FOR THE FIRST TIME because they have been under water for months on the position and realize this is their chance to get out with Baidu about to buy the company. They needed a quick hit job to cover their position and now they are out. \n\nThe next catalyst here is the Baidu deal. When the deal formally closes (expected to in Q1 of this year), this will start squeezing really hard as the market somehow thinks a MW report will prevent Baidu from closing. Those of you who think the deal is in question - Baidu is already promoting/integrating YY Live on its platforms to provide additional traffic thereby corroborating previous reports from Chinese media that the sale of the domestic business of YY Live to Baidu isn't in jeopardy due to short reports. \n\nConclusion - We will get an infinity squeeze of epic proportion. Thank me later.",

        "selftext": "I know there was another thread about this, but I can't find it and have a lot to say, but the topic is massive and nuanced, and it directly relates to dozens of holdings discussed here ad nauseum, so please have patience with this additional thread. \n\nFacts ([per the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/20/chinese-billionaire-jack-ma-makes-first-public-appearance-in-months)): \n\n1. Jack Ma is an outspoken, opinionated, sometimes controversial figure, very prominent in Chinese culture. (opinion: Elon Musk is a solid American contemporary to use as a base understanding of Ma's influence and cult of personality.) His disappearance was a MASSIVE deal. \n2. He was last seen on 24 Oct, pissing off the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). His disappearance gained little to no attention for nearly two months, until he was removed and replaced as a judge from what I am guessing can be loosely regarded as a version of Shark Tank for businessmen in Africa. He was also conspicuously pulled from all promotional pieces. This caught global headlines in December.  \n3. Amid global speculation and watching his pride and joy Alibaba continue to shed tens of billions of dollars in market value, he remained silent for another month. \n4. He resurfaced as part of a small-time annual event for approximately 100 rural teachers. Notable quotes include: \"My colleagues and I have been studying and thinking, and we have become more determined to devote ourselves to education and public welfare...Working hard for rural revitalisation and common prosperity is the responsibility for our generation of businessmen.\u201d Notable quotes do NOT include: anything relevant to his time away or the timing of his reappearance. \n\nInterpretations:   \n\n\n1. An early version of a Bloomberg headline claimed his re-emergence \"end\\[ed\\] speculation\" about his months out of public view. False. Aside from the gaping holes of knowledge which remain unaddressed, the quotes we DO have from him also paint a pretty dark commentary about what it means to live in China.  \n2. \"My colleagues and I\" -- Hold up. Which colleagues? Were there any less-famous Chinese moguls or Ma associates who were also missing? How many? \n3. \"...have been studying and thinking...\" Studying what, exactly? Why did they take three months to think about it? To me, this paints pictures of the Uighur \"Reeducation Camps\" (concentration camps, forced labor camps, whatever you want to call these terrifying places) and China's ongoing practice of forced propaganda indoctrination. \n4. \"...we have become more determined to devote ourselves to education and public welfare\" ... His historic pet project Ant Group was shattered in globally humiliating fashion, reducing his wealth by 11 figures in literally an instant, and sending the value of his assets further downward by another 11 figures over the following weeks and months, and his first public comments are about--wait for it--devotion to education and public welfare? Fucking terrifying, especially in light of the previous point.  \n5. \"Working hard for rural revitalisation and common prosperity is the responsibility for our generation of businessmen.\" This is designed to be a statement communicating a noble and respectable value, and if all businessmen of the world felt this way, humanity as a whole would be better off. But what I see is a deafeningly loud and clear threat from CCP to every last one of \"our generation of businessmen.\"\n\nBottom line: \n\n* Investing in Chinese holdings is something I plan to continue, but on smaller levels with smaller holdings across more companies. However, this all underscores just how impossible it is to assess risk in Chinese investments. Without feeling confident that you have your finger on the pulse of whether the CEOs and Boards of Directors for all companies you hold are successfully staying out of CCP's crosshairs, we must consider every last Chinese company to be under a completely unpredictable and wholly existential threat at all times. I fully believe that had Jack Ma just stfu and kept his eyes on the road, Ant Group IPO would have happened, and BABA's share price would be approaching $400 by now, instead of breathing a sigh of relief in the $260's, without a $37 billion IPO in its future, and with an anti-trust investigation still waiting to play out. \n* Also: friendly reminder that Chinese securities traded in American markets aren't shares or stock, they're American Depository Receipts (ADRs). On a fundamental level, the value of these can technically cease to exist at the whim of the Chinese government. I imagine that being in the final 90 minutes of the Trump administration somewhat reduces the threat posed by this risk, but it is and will remain an ever-present reality.\n\n*Disclosure: BABA shareholder since getting in at $200 in May and averaging up repeatedly until November, with other Chinese holdings of BEKE, BIDU, JD, LI, NIO, NIU, TCEHY, XPEV*",

        "selftext": "I am avoiding investing in anything CCP related because our short sightednes is being used against us for our medium - long term destruction - what do you think of this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/chinas-nationalist-agenda-behind-its-opening-up-to-foreign-banks/](https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/chinas-nationalist-agenda-behind-its-opening-up-to-foreign-banks/)\n\n \n\n\"In [a recent op-ed](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2020-10-06/commentary-mulan-disney-and-the-dilemma-of-doing-business-in-china), I wrote how the controversy over Disney\u2019s *Mulan* embodies some of the ethical dilemmas and pitfalls that face companies doing business in China. On one hand, to maintain their presence in China these companies must comply with the demands and expectations of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). On the other hand, doing so comes with the cost of significant reputational risk at home.\n\nBut the influence Beijing seeks to gain on Western media companies such as Disney and Comcast is but a subplot in a much larger story, and China is playing a series of bigger games in which its Communist Party is thinking a dozen moves ahead of their chief opponent \u2014 the United States. Since China\u2019s path to victory over the United States will depend in large part on our ignorance the what games it plays and the strategies it employs, the U.S. must quickly become privy to both to stand a chance.\n\nThough the strategic game of choice in much of the world is chess, in China it is wei qi. China is employing a comprehensive strategy to encircle us across many domains of competition. The CCP knows it cannot win a kinetic war with the United States and so it is finding other ways to fight the hundred years\u2019 war against the United States. And among those ways is using our short-term thinking, our hunger for market opportunities (aka greed), and our openness against us.\n\n#### 1. China\u2019s Most Dangerous Game\n\nTo understand China\u2019s game, it helps to studying their primary tactic at the moment, which involves aggressively opening their financial markets to the U.S. in ways they never have before, and China is doing this despite [tense political relations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/us-china-relations-will-remain-tense-says-former-american-ambassador.html) between the two nations. Just in the last few months, China has given approval to leading Wall Street firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase, to expand their businesses in China. In August, BlackRock [received official approval](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackrock-gets-go-ahead-for-a-mutual-fund-business-in-china-11598687419) from the Chinese government to set up a mutual fund business in Shanghai. Days later, Vanguard announced it was moving its [regional headquarters](https://www.ft.com/content/46683cde-9707-4023-9378-52e6491f8817) to Shanghai. JPMorgan Chase, meanwhile, is set to pay $1 billion to become the first foreign company to [assume full ownership](https://www.ft.com/content/f785d18e-e4c8-4b67-85ea-da71e9f8f6f2) of a pre-existing Chinese mutual fund business. This is all in marked contrast to Beijing\u2019s previous requirement that Western firms partner with local Chinese entities to do business in China\u2019s financial markets.\n\nWhy is China opening up their financial markets and why now? China is *not* doing this because it needs the money. Part of the reason it is doing this is because it wants to study Western banking models. There are numerous examples of China bringing in Western companies and letting them make money in China but essentially forcing them to teach Chinese companies that are positioning themselves to set up competing enterprises that will eventually destroy the China opportunities for these very same Western companies. When a Western company fights back via the legal system, as the Dallas-based Tang Energy Group has done against the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), they find China to be a formidable opponent even [when fighting on home turf](https://apnews.com/article/055b6cebe41649999d48fa1b5265fb19).\n\nIf you study China\u2019s past collaborations with the West in other industries\u2014its partnerships with Disney and Comcast being notable examples\u2014a pattern comes into focus. Essentially, what Beijing is doing is laying down the foundations for an ecosystem set up to extract commitments and support for their policies from Western companies. This ecosystem consists of numerous interlinking components, including the [social credit ranking system](https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/chinas-new-company-tracking-system-comply-comply-comply/), the national security law, and [cybersecurity laws](https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/china-cybersecurity-no-place-to-hide/). With these components now in place, the CCP is inviting into China an increasing number of Western companies from varying industries, most of which will not be able to resist the prospect of tapping into what is now the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nFor its part, the CCP is not interested in providing access to its markets without getting something in return and what it wants most of all, is for foreign financial institutions to favorably represent and support their nationalist narratives and policies back home in the United States. U.S. banks and financial companies are the perfect vehicle for Beijing to achieve these aims since the financial sector has tremendous lobbying power in Washington and is by far the largest source of [campaign donations](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-lobbying/banks-spent-record-amounts-on-lobbying-in-recent-election-idUSKBN16F26P) to political parties and candidates.\n\nThis is not just an abstract hypothetical. China has already done this, very recently in fact with Standard Chartered and HSBC, two British banks with operations in Hong Kong and the mainland. Beijing gave the ultimatum to these two British banks that if they did not publicly express support for the [national security law](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52765838) in Hong Kong they would lose the right to continue doing business in China. Both [banks complied](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/business/hsbc-standard-chartered-hong-kong-law-intl-hnk/index.html) in a move [widely criticized by](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-hsbc-hldg-stanchart/hsbc-stanchart-criticised-for-backing-hong-kong-security-law-idUSKBN23B0FD) the international community. But the CCP didn\u2019t stop there; it also demanded both companies crack down on clients with ties to the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. The banks [complied with this](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-security-wealth-exclusive/exclusive-global-banks-scrutinize-their-hong-kong-clients-for-pro-democracy-ties-idUSKCN24L096) as well.\n\nAnother more recent example is the CCP abruptly [slamming the brakes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ant-founder-jack-ma-faces-backlash-from-regulators-11604442018) on Ant Group\u2019s highly anticipated IPO, just days before its shares were set to begin trading in Shanghai and Hong Kong on Nov. 5, costing the company tens of billions of dollars. This came just over one week after Ant Group co-founder Jack Ma criticized Chinese regulators for stifling innovation with a \u201cpawnshop mentality.\u201d The CCP shut down this IPO and then [disappeared Jack Ma](https://www.ft.com/content/751c2500-f50d-47c9-8f04-a28ad62285fd) as retaliation and as a reminder that the CCP controls all private industry in China. Duly chastened, Ant Group publicly pledged to [\u201cembrace regulation](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3108145/ant-group-executives-meet-chinese-regulators-days-trading-debut)\u201c, but Jack Ma has not been seen nor heard from for going on a month now.\n\nThese are tactics China has been before and will use again with the foreign banks and financial institutions rushing in now.\n\n#### 2. Why Companies Comply With China\u2019s Demands\n\nWhy do Western companies not just refuse to comply when China makes these kinds of demands? Why would they support policies that so clearly run counter to the democratic principles of their home countries?\n\nFirst, as part of the contractual conditions for doing business in China, the Communist Party requires foreign companies to not say or do anything disruptive to the stability of China\u2019s social fabric. What is considered \u201cdisruptive,\u201d however, is deliberately left ambiguous and open to the CCP\u2019s arbitrary interpretations. Companies that violate this rule may not only lose their right to operate in China, they may also be required to forfeit the intellectual property they brought with them. To illustrate, if the CCP were to disapprove of something Disney said, Disney might not only be forbidden to release any future films in China, their highly profitable Shanghai Disneyland and other joint ventures would thereafter belong entirely to their government-owned Chinese business partners. This is likely why Disney has been [slow to answer](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-mulan-china/u-s-lawmakers-quiz-disney-ceo-over-xinjiang-connection-to-mulan-idUSKBN2630AZ) questions from U.S. or U.K. lawmakers about their involvement with Xinjiang, or answered those questions in only the vaguest terms. They do not wish to provoke CCP ire.\n\nOf course, Western companies could always just say \u201cno\u201d to the CCP\u2019s demands, or they could conclusively prove their commitment to their home countries and democratic principles by being willing to sever their ties with China. The reason they do not do this is simple: once these companies have invested resources to establish their presence in China, and particularly once they are generating profits in China, they have too much to lose.\n\nBut why would Western firms agree to such contractual terms in the first place? For the same reasons they comply when the CCP makes its demands: money. The prospect of tapping into the world\u2019s largest economy is too enticing for companies to pass up. Perhaps corporate America\u2019s proclivity to focus on short-term profits blinds companies to the very real risks of making deals with China. Or perhaps they do not believe China would actually try to manipulate them in such a way (though it is clear from the examples of Standard Chartered and HSBC that China [very much would](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/business/hsbc-standard-chartered-hong-kong-law-intl-hnk/index.html)). These companies also may ultimately be agnostic about the countries and the principles to which they are loyal. But for whatever permutation of reasons, foreign banks right now are happily walking into the honeytrap the CCP has set for them. Insidious as all of this is, one cannot help but marvel at the strategic genius of using our own short-term thinking against us. As I often say, China looks miles down the road; we look inches down the road.  \n\n#### 3. Why This Matters for the American People\n\nFrom tech to fashion to the media, Western industries are becoming increasingly complicit in China\u2019s manifold [human rights violations](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/). I fear banks soon will be as well, but there are two bases for cautious optimism. One is the bipartisan support in Washington for sanctions against China for its human rights abuses. If enough political momentum can be built before China exercises its influence over American banks and their lobbying power, this could prevent serious problems down the road. However, there would need to be an international effort on this because the U.S. cannot deter China alone. Though the Republicans have sought to frame Joe Biden as being China\u2019s choice, the reality is that Biden is not only a China hawk, he also has the diplomatic dexterity to bring world leaders back to the U.S.\u2019s side for a concerted effort.\n\nThe other source of hope lies with U.S. citizens becoming increasingly aware of China\u2019s game plan and articulating their concerns through their purchasing patterns. The banks need to understand that we know they have choices in this matter, and that the best choices would be those that are loyal to U.S. interests. Activist-led movements like the recent call to [boycott Disney\u2019s ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/05/mulan-disney-china-hongkong-boycott/)[*Mulan*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/05/mulan-disney-china-hongkong-boycott/) raise the likelihood that Americans will become more concerned about these issues. The challenge here is that the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing economic crisis in America have created an atmosphere of self-preservation, and this has emboldened China to push harder and faster to take their plan to the next stage.\n\nWe the people can and should become more active players by bringing China\u2019s nationalist agenda to the center of the national discussion \u2014 not at the expense of the other issues we care so deeply about\u2014the economy, the coronavirus, the preservation of democracy \u2014 but precisely in the name of them.\n\n**UPDATE:**\u00a0Just today, the CCP has provided us with another example of how it seeks to co-opt foreign companies that do business in China. See [Xi Jinping wants Starbucks and Howard Schultz to help repair US-China ties](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/14/business/starbucks-china-xi-jinping-intl-hnk/index.html).\n\nThis post was guest written by [David Jacobson](https://www.smu.edu/cox/Our-People-and-Community/Faculty/David-Jacobson).

We're riding this baby to Uranus. short positions most likely increased after \"shit\" earnings that were not bad at all. we've only seen the beginning of the squeeze as Technicals look unsustainable long term but primed for a rally short term, share buyback working in tandem with Cramer pumping the stock creates a bloodbath for gay bears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis week has been **great** for bulls. First GME came through for us and fucked over Melvin and the rest of the boomers leaving us with all these sweet tendies to pick up off the ground and BBBY has EXPLODEDDD this week following a bad earnings call that led to a huge sell off and retreat to **$17** from **over $21**. But was the earnings call really as bad as everyone thought it was? Is the price movement just a result of a short squeeze that is already over?\n\nI think not\n\n1. earnings were **not** as bad as people acted they were, you bet your ass bears tried to short this shit in reaction to the supposed negative numbers while over looking these : **69% increase in digital sales, 150 million share buyback program to complete by end of Feb, continually trimming debt, pivoting to curbside/delivery/digital sales programs and increasing the value of coupons through membership programs to promote brand loyalty** (think Amazon Prime free shipping), **RECCURING REVENUE BUNDLE ( THIS SHIT IS CRACK FOR YOY GROWTH, think AMZN, NFLX, and even NIO now)** \n2. **76 million shares in short interest out of 114 free floating.** this is self explanatory after GME but whats interesting is these numbers are from a December 31st settlement. This absolutely grew over the earnings on the 7th. making this potential for profit even more likely. our favorite boomer, Cramer, also pumped the fuck outta this stock on Mad Money TWICE recently stating the short interest is an attempt by bears to capture the stock despite strong promise from within the company.\n3. **Active war between bulls and bears...and the bulls are winning.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ws6fvrrvneb61.jpg?width=947&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf86ce31db3b6797a3be7ef4a2fdba4371b8bb76\n\n1. **TA looks incredibly solid.** Riding the RSI at 70 all day baby. MACD Signal line cross was never destructive, consolidates around support levels, then built up a climb over time, challenging areas of support and bouncing off of them to new highs and lower lows. Trending above 50 day MA, 25 day EMA, and using 10 day MA as support, testing multiple times throughout the day and later consolidating alongside it today until AH.",

        "selftext": "Ill be up front about 2 things, i own 60 shares of BABA (bought both \"dips at 280 and 230\") and also I am not nearly as experienced as some people on here.\n\nBut one thing i can do is research, and have patience. All the silly quotes that you read on here, i think the absolute best one is time in the market &gt; timing the market. \n\nIve done a bunch of research on BABA and I think that i share many opinions with others on here and its just....wait. Don't sell and just hold on. Its pretty unlikely that they get delisted in the NYSE just because of the amount of money thats invested. You can always count on one thing, you can follow the money. The money showed a Biden victory back in sept/oct, and it shows BABA will at some point come back up. After reading several things on them i took a few things away and wanted to share them or discuss them.\n\n\" In its most recent quarter, Alibaba's revenue jumped 30% to $22.9 billion, and adjusted operating income rose 44% to $4.4 billion, showing the company's enviable profit margins. Additionally, its cloud-computing division saw 60% revenue growth in the quarter to $2.2 billion. Based on those numbers, Alibaba would likely be worth double or even triple what it is today if it were an American company. \"\n\n\" The lesson for Alibaba investors, therefore, seems to be that there are risks from the CCP's current actions against Ma and the company, but the investor response seems overblown. Alibaba is a leading tech giant in a country set to become the world's biggest economy in the next decade, but it's being valued as a stodgy company in a slow-growth industry. That looks like a mistake. Investors may want to take advantage of the current discount. \"\n\nSo im always open for a discussion but my best advice is to just buy more if you can afford it but hold strong.

        "selftext": "* 76% of WSB who's still in GME collectively orgasmed yesterday as GME pushed to the stratosphere with the stock soaring as high as 90% during intraday high. Profit taking and volatile swings brought the shares down to a modest close of \"only\" up 57% at $31.40. u/DeepFuckingValue, who has titanium alloy diamond hands (now known as DFV hands) posted an update and to the surprise of no one, is still holding his 1,000 contracts of Jan 15 $20c on Wednesday afternoon. (Note: He took gains on the contracts today though I'm not sure at what point in the day while keeping his April $12c).\n\n* The pump action resumed for GME this Thursday morning with premarket pushing the underlying back to $38 once again and commenced to another wild session of large movements. Initially trading around $34 to $36 in morning, GME started to rip once again when noon struck and ran as high as $43 for the day. GME closed the day up 27% to $40. If you're STILL not in GME, these back-to-back days have pushed IV to new highs and even OTM contracts months out will be commanding large premium (~160%+ IV for April and 140%+ for July). Proceed with caution (who am I kidding just go all in).\n\n* Morning economic numbers: jobless claims continues its dismal trend, with first-time claims hitting 965k last week vs the consensus of 800k (oof). Last week's total was 784k. As with before, market did not react to the numbers cuz its PrIcEd iN. Import prices rose 0.9 in Dec vs 0.6 expected.\n\n* Jpow spoke at 12:30 PM today in a Princeton Uni session and reaffirmed what everyone has largely expected: rates will continue to be low and while the Feds will raise rate eventually, Jpow says that its \"no time soon\" given economic situation.\n\n* Are they big tech or big cuck? The market reversed course and big tech continues their sell off, with MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, and AMZN all retreating more than -1% as yet another sector rotation commenced. Payment providers got an extra dose of sell-off with V closing at -3.43% and MA closing at -5.25%, despite both having positive PT from Deutsche Bank today with V having a PT increase of $270 from $220 and MA PT increase of $420 from $383.\n\n* Small caps performed strongly today as money flow throughout the day into \"value\" grabs. RUT/IWM closed the day up 2%. Notable underlyings beyond GME are BBBY (up 18.77%), MIK (up 9.6%), M (up 5%), WSM (up 4%), and KIRK (up 9.58%).\n\n* In WSB meme stock land MT continues in its channel, gaining 2.95% today to close at $24.81 PLTR got hit with another downgrade, this time via Citi as the analysts believes the stock is vulnerable to a few upcoming catalyst, including lockup expiry and an deceleration in growth. PT for Citi is $15 (don't worry tho surely WSB is \"in control\" with this stock too). PLUG drilled more than -5.74% during intraday low as JPM initiated with a neutral rating and downgraded sector competitor FCEL. PLUG closed the day down -4.26% to $64.63 while FCEL closed the day down -8% to $17.60, fending off intraday low of more than -12%. ICLN, the clean tech ETF continues its range bound trading and will likely require a clear catalyst in terms of what the $2 tril stimulus actually entails to move further. Buckle up, loser.\n\n* Despite being green most of the day, major indexes retreated to red as power hour neared. Indexes went red and lost all its morning gains as the sell-off accelerated into closing hours. DOW closed the day down -0.22% or -69 pts, IXIC closed down -0.12% or -16 pts, SPX closed -0.38% or -14 pts, and RUT closed up 2% or 43 pts. While the retreat was modest compare to yesterday's close, the intraday reversal was quite jarring esp if you're trading FDs (and let's face it, you definitely were loading up on those Jan 1/15 calls).\n\n* Earning season will soon be upon us and the first wave are starting later this week. Tomorrow morning financials kick things off as WFC, JPM, and C are all reporting before market opens. If banks shat the bed, expect a pounding for the Dow given how large of a component they are still to the stupid index. Expectations are fairly high as JPM has had a flurry of upgrades in the past few days with PT of $150 from Piper Sandler, $152 from Jefferies, and an upgrade to buy from neutral at BofA.\n\n* Biden will unveil his $2 tril stimulus package/plan in a speech later tonight at 7:15 PM ET. Please pump those green tech cuz I have an embarrassing amount in SPAC/EVs.\n\n(Yesterday's recap: none cuz I was lazy and enjoying gains.

        "selftext": "**TLDR: China would lose their soft power, banks and people would disinvest in China if they didn't honor their ADR agreements and would set China onto the path of future economic ruin and upheaval like the USSR - I could be wrong though but read on for my analysis with references (mostly!)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've seen a few posts about ADRs recently talking about how all chinese stocks (NIO BABA TENCENT) are based in the Cayman Islands and no one's really buying stock in these chinese companies and that China has no need to uphold these agreements - As a disclaimer, before I go on, I was to say I do own stock in NIO and BABA as well as AMZN, AAPL and a few other small AI companies.\n\nWhile many of you may be technically correct about ADRs, it fundamentally ignores the foreign policy climate of almost all countries and more specifically ignores the way China's foreign policy is being conducted right now - I'm not an expert and you should of course do your own DD but what I've noticed from all these posts is that they are all ignoring the idea of Soft Power.\n\n**Lets define what soft and hard power are**: I've taken these definitions from wikipedia, because they're concise and as always wikipedia is well referenced (damn teachers!)\n\nSoft power: In politics (and particularly in international politics), soft power is the ability to attract and co-opt, rather than coerce (contrast hard power). In other words, soft power involves shaping the preferences of others through appeal and attraction - Foreign Aid is an excellent example of the use of Soft Power\n\nHard Power: Hard power is the use of military and economic means to influence the behavior or interests of other political bodies. This form of political power is often aggressive (coercion), and is most immediately effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and/or economic power\n\n**Why is this important?:**\n\nWhile China is on its way to becoming a global superpower its not there yet, there are more economically reliable countries (US) and countries with more functional military might (Russia and US) - I say functional here because military might isn't just man power and number of soldiers.\n\nChina uses hard power when it comes to domestic policy, through the use of censorship, coercion of officials, imprisonment of dissidents and so on and so forth. ([https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/))\n\nHowever, they've also learnt from the collapse of the USSR which collapsed in part due their international and economic isolation among other factors ([https://www.britannica.com/story/why-did-the-soviet-union-collapse](https://www.britannica.com/story/why-did-the-soviet-union-collapse)) - Now China doesn't want that to happen and to ensure it doesn't, it's followed an interesting hybridisation of communism and capitalism where private companies are closely linked to the government but are allowed to compete and have private ownership. However this has meant that chinese companies and by extension China as a country has to be attractive to outside investors and that's where soft power comes in.\n\nThroughout the pandemic and even before China has been trying to expand its soft power further in the hope of eventually leveraging itself into the world's leading super power. Case and point is the Free trade agreement it signed with 14 other asia-pacific countries creating an even larger free market than the eu (16% vs 22%) ([https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/15/china-and-14-asia-pacific-countries-agree-historic-free-trade-deal](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/15/china-and-14-asia-pacific-countries-agree-historic-free-trade-deal)). While this gives it more economic power, it also gives china great headlines!\n\nThis isn't the only way China is trying to garner a better image of itself and therefore more soft power - For a long time, China has been and is commonly viewed as one of the largest polluters in the world ([https://ge.usembassy.gov/chinas-air-pollution-harms-its-citizens-and-the-world/#:\\~:text=The%20People's%20Republic%20of%20China,health%20and%20the%20world's%20economy](https://ge.usembassy.gov/chinas-air-pollution-harms-its-citizens-and-the-world/#:~:text=The%20People's%20Republic%20of%20China,health%20and%20the%20world's%20economy).), pollution that has been killing around a million of its citizens a year - so to not only improve their citizens lives (though how much of the main motivation that is I'm very skeptical) but to also capture the ongoing trend of renewable energy becoming the dominant energy market in the next decade or two, China has been pouring money into clean energy initiatives, so they not only capture a significant slice of an upcoming dominant market but they are also able to position themselves as the clean energy capital of the world.\n\nLet's be clear though, the current pandemic has affected their soft power and reduced it massively which leads onto the crux of my argument.\n\n**How Soft power relates to ADRs and Stocks?**\n\nFor China to successfully follow through with their plans (leveraging soft power into economic might - the tried and tested american way to an extent - except america had WW2 and the Marshall plan to reach this point sidenote: I know that's massively reductive and there's a lot of other factors involved in america becoming a superpower including a shit load of hard power i.e. nuclear bombs and military might) they require investment not just from domestic sources but foreign sources otherwise they gain no soft power. So how does this relate the ADRs:\n\nIf China and Chinese companies were to renege on their agreements with these shell companies, it would lead to major banks, hedge funds and entire countries to disinvest from the chinese economy - a counterpoint I can imagine in the comments may be that it's technically not a reneging because the these chinese companies and chinese law doesn't state that you can own shares but the optics of it certainly are. Every major newspaper would be covering it, people who have invested would be using their soft power (their vote) to push for harder line on china and so would banks who would be disinvesting by their droves from chinese ADRs. I know I wouldn't be buying anything from China again because the risk is too high and that would be the most dangerous thing for the chinese government. They are trying and have until now succeeded in creating an image of a stable thriving economy\n\nDisinvestment may sound sensationalist and to an extent I would agree it may be but the most recent example is BABA stock - The disappearance of Jack Ma not only lead to a massive drop in BABA stock but countless headlines about how dangerous it is to invest in Chinese companies - and while I'm sure Jack Ma when he returns will have to change to adapt to his potentially curbed reality, the chinese government will have also realised that they'll need to adapt to ensure that they don't lose the soft power they've spent over 40 years cultivating ( look up Deng Xiaoping's China reform and opening-up policy).\n\nAnd to address comments that I'm sure will say China can be self sufficient without any foreign investments - I'm sure they can but that path has until now lead to ruin for other countries, the primary example being the USSR and a less prominent example being North Korea. The chinese government is ruthless, efficient and they're certainly not stupid.\n\nOf course if anyone thinks I'm wrong, please let me know - I also understand that the BABA example is more nuanced than how far I've gone into it because of Jack Ma's Ant group going onto central bank turf but the logic behind the point stands.\n\nHong Kong is an interesting counterpoint to my argument, but I would say that to a certain extent, Banks knew HK would be bought under the CCP and still think they can make money there - also Hong Kong massively damaged Chinese Soft power and if there had been a better president I think the effect would have been huge but there wasn't and the markets are over it - if ADRs aren't honoured, then Banks and hedge funds would lose money and I think that that's their bottom line and a red line for them - I could be wrong though",

        "selftext": "I highly recommend this episode with Alex Sherman. They cover what it takes for Bloomberg to give the \"okay\" to publish an article on a rumored merger or acquisition.\n\n[https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/episode-21-inside-the-ma-press-with-bloombergs-alex-sherman](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/episode-21-inside-the-ma-press-with-bloombergs-alex-sherman)\n\n**The snippet that got me excited:**\n\n**Ben:** It\u2019s interesting that your incentives are kind of the opposite. I mean, a lot of publications these days, the incentives are around page views and their CPMs. And what they want to do is make something seem splashier than it is so they get more attention. For you guys, you don't want to be the boy that cried wolf and you have a responsibility to your paying customers to deliver to them what you believe is the most accurate representation of the news. So you actually have an incentive not to downplay things but certainly to play them accurately. And if others are overplaying them, then you might be incentivized to give your customers the kind of edge by making sure to downplay it just to negate the overhyping.\n\n**Alex:** Absolutely. Which actually I think makes this place sort of a good place to work because you don\u2019t get caught in that game. You can sort of feel good about yourself when you go home at night that your sole obligation is to just be as right as possible.\n\n**David:** Your incentives are aligned with the truth.\n\n**Alex:** Absolutely. And that helps a lot when we cover M&amp;A because I am reliant on people that are directly involved in these transactions to give me the information to put out these stories. In other words, we can hear all sorts of information from indirect sources, maybe they\u2019re bankers that aren\u2019t working on a deal or maybe they\u2019re rival executives, or maybe they\u2019re ex-board members, or maybe they\u2019re friends of an executive, or maybe they\u2019re traders who have a financial incentive on their own.\n\nWell, none of those sources are good enough for us to publish something on it because they\u2019re not direct. So when Bloomberg runs a story, as someone who reads it you can be certain of the fact that this is not indirect information. There have been a number of cases where I have put out a story and it\u2019s happened to be the day before earnings or something like that.",

        "selftext": "Stocks broadly dipped today (Jan 4), and tomorrow, the positions will likely dip further because of uncertainty over the GA runoff elections. But fear not and BTFD. Here're some top picks:  \n\n\n1. NIO. Just released its December 2020 delivery numbers yesterday, and as expected, they killed it. 121% increase in deliveries for 2020. Deliveries doubled year-over-year. There are also rumors that Nio will open its first non-Chinese store in Copenhagen, Denmark. It's comfortably over $50 today. I predict $60+ by Nio Day. Furthermore, I predict over $100 by eoy. Anything below $45 looks good rn. Weeklies might be worth it, but to be safe, go for leaps.   \n\n2. JMIA. This is the African Alibaba-Amazon. I'm being a touch anecdotal, but I bought BABA when it was $60/share, and while waiting for its meteoric rise, BABA received the same criticism 12 years ago that JMIA is getting now (\\[China's\\] infrastructure is weak! They're not tech-savvy! They're not revenue positive!), I also see parallel upsides: JMIA knows its customers. It services over 12 countries and has a customer base of 1.2-Billion people. That's more customers than what Alibaba has in China. Furthermore, JMIA's platform has a payment system like Alipay, a food delivery service like DoorDash, and a travel booking service like Expedia all bundled in one platform that happens to also be one of the most popular websites/mobile apps in Africa.   \nJMIA will monopolize many industries in the large and rapidly growing continent of Africa. MasterCard and Goldman Sachs are some of their investors. The two co-ceo's (Europeans) formerly worked at McKinsey, and their African co-founder is a Harvard MBA alum and successful entrepreneur. Fun fact: Alibaba outcompeted Ebay in China and became the de facto local E-commerce provider. Similarly, JMIA out-competed Amazon and Alibaba to be the most popular platform in Africa.    \n\n3. PLTR. The stock price will suck for a couple of months, but hear me out. Compared to its share price, the covered call premiums are juicy. I have 1000 shares and make around 300 - 700 a week from holding them. I don't mind holding for the long term because of the enormous upside. Most of PLTR's current clients are government groups like the US Military, the FBI, and the Greek Government, but they plan to increasingly expand their services to private companies under the \"Foundry\" Platform, which is projected to have a market size of $56B. According to the PLTR website, Foundry will serve \"approximately 6,000 companies with more than $500-million in annual revenue\". It's no wonder CEO Alex Karp said investors will be \"pleasantly surprised.\" It might dip below 20 near-term, but hold for the long-term tendies. \n\nAgain, the above three stocks will likely suffer from the GA Senate runoff election's volatility, but these are opportunities to load up on more shares and/or buy leaps. We're still in a Fed-fueled secular bull market. A republican senate would be favorable for stocks, but I think NIO and PLTR in particular will have an overall favorable increase under a blue wave, while JMIA is just too similar to Alibaba to ignore right now. They are one earnings-beat away from mooning. \n\nWas bored and made a short vid based on these positions:   \n[https://youtu.be/9ZsIGhddNow](https://youtu.be/9ZsIGhddNow)\n\n  \nAs always, do you own DD, and Happy 2021!   \n\n\nLet's make tendies.",

        "selftext": "What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been.

Mostly due to tech stocks running up from the Biden inauguration.\n\nKeep in mind I started with $313,000 last year and ended with $650,000 before I switched over to Webull.\n\n**Watchlist**\n\n**$BABA**\\- Opened above the 180 MA with Jack Ma's reappearance. This one could be a very interesting buy if it forms a strong upwards trend. However, be careful. Don't assume because Ma is back online, means everything is ok. With Chinese New Year, China's biggest holiday, coming up, Alibaba has potential for huge profit. $BABA is up 5.5% today and will run up to $300 and more eventually. The biggest question is time. Alibaba is an ecommerce giant that is paramount in every single Chinese persons' lives. On one hand, Ma has a big mouth; he shouldn't speak out against the CCP so tread with caution. On the other hand, there isn't much negative news in China against Alibaba currently. Sales on the ecommerce giant is business as usual.  \n\n* Price Target - *$300*\n* Entry - Buy *$270 and below*\n* Risk 1-5 - *2*\n* Timeframe - 2-4 months\n\n**$THCX** \\- I will be buying at least 100 shares of this cannabis ETF and selling covered calls next week. Decriminalization is imminent and a vote is near. Legalization is a possibility in this administration although I don't think it would come anytime soon.\n\n* Price Target - *$25*\n* Entry - Buy *$17 and below*\n* Risk 1-5 - 4\n* Timeframe - 1-3 months\n\n**$PRNT** \\- 3D Printing ETF managed by ARK Invest. This is gaining more popularity online, and anything ARK is and has been very, very successful. Personally, I want to hold this long term - for years. For now though, I'll be selling covered calls. This one is a little more expensive to acquire 100 shares - around $4000.\n\n* Price Target - *$46*\n* Entry - Buy *$38 and below*\n* Risk 1-5 - 3\n* Timeframe - 4-6 weeks\n\n**$SURF** \\- Surface Oncology is an ARK Invest baby that is clinical stage immuno-oncology company that is engaged in the development of cancer immunotherapies. ARK manager, Cathie Woods, has helped us make a lot of money so it is hard not to take a close look at this stock. Only $14, you can buy 100 shares for $1400 and start selling covered calls with me next week.\n\n* Price Target - *$22*\n* Entry - Buy *$14 and below*\n* Risk 1-5 - 3.5\n* Timeframe - 2-4 months\n\nTrading Charts and original Post:\n\n[https://www.prostockadvice.com/post/journey-to-1-million-january-20-2021](https://www.prostockadvice.com/post/journey-to-1-million-january-20-2021)",

And, some just don't need approval and can be sold in open market without giving a shit to FDA.\n\nHell. One of their product is to replace Testosterones. I think this is serious issue in some people and proper treatment is necessary to get the morning, evening and night \"wood\" for obvious reasons.\n\nOne of their competitor filed a lawsuit against them. They couldn't win so now the $LPCN guys are counter-suing them for damage.\n\nThis will run probably this whole month as result of lawsuit is in February.\n\nIf they win the lawsuit, which is highly likely, Mars can be our guaranteed destination. \n\nIf they don't. They have a good set of market-leading products in their pipeline to not let the company die.\n\nChart also doesn't look like a messy mountain. Seems like steady and healthy growth kind of thing.\n\nLastly, they have an Indian CEO and lots of Indian CEOs made companies super successful in America.

Stock was up 40% today. Looking for major continuation moving forward here. Today Cinedigm announced that it has acquired Fandor, a subscription streaming service, with plans to relaunch indie film service which closed its doors in 2018. Cinedigm believes they could top 1 million subscribers within 24-30 months. The fandor acquisition solidifies Cinedigm's postion as THE leading global streaming company for independent films. Referenced as \"the Netflix of Indie.\"\n\n$EQ - Initial product candidate, itolizumab, is a first-in-class immune-modifying monoclonal antibody that targets the CD6-ALCAM signaling pathway. The CD6-ALCAM signaling pathway plays a central role in the modulation of effector T cells (Teff cells). Activated Teff cells drive a number of immuno-inflammatory diseases across therapeutic areas including transplant science, systemic autoimmunity, pulmonary, neurologic, gastrointestinal, renal, vascular, ophthalmic and dermatologic disorders. Therefore, we believe itolizumab may have broad therapeutic utility in treating a large and diverse set of severe immuno-inflammatory diseases. 2 hour chart ultimate moving average just crossed over the golden cross indicator and printed a \"long.\" This most likely has a PR coming soon about its prime candidate. Price Target: $8.98\n\n$TBLT - OFFERING announced today. Look for a short term pull back to $0.90-95 (old resistance). Weekly buy arrow just printed on the supertrend. Resistance since June 2020 was just broken last week. The daily ultimate moving average just crossed over the golden cross indicator today, implying to me that this recent move is just the beginning for TBLT. Great swing opportunity here after the offering is complete that was announced today and it pulls back to test new support level. The company is now roughly 2 years away from profitability. Market will anticipate the future new earnings.\n\n$BORR on a healthy pull back. Support seems to have been found around .88-.89. If my calculations are correct. With current ROC we should see a nice run incoming from imminent MA golden cross on the daily chart. There are indications that this move can fail. Def worth watching.

Bullish trend\n\n$AAPL - \u201cApple\u2019s stock is not detached from a realistic outlook on the future of the business (excluding an Apple Car). If anything, the stock may continue to be a bargain.\n\nWhile Apple\u2019s stock trades at a premium relative to its five-year average price-to-earnings multiple, at 32 times estimated earnings the stock trades well below comparable multiples for Amazon (58 times) and Netflix (57 times). And of course, Apple shares trade below the 204 times forward price-to-earnings multiple on electric vehicle favorite Tesla (TSLA).\u201d PT: $150 by the end of March.\n\nBackburners: #GRTS #ACRS #INUV #SENS #TRXC #NDRA #DARE #MOTS #EH #IBIO",

        "selftext": "[Previously, on Guess the Company](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ksvib2/guess_the_company_5_ticker_trivia_due_diligence/)\n\nHi fellow kids, I'm back again today with yet another DD where I reveal the ticker at the end rather than the beginning.\n\nLet's see how quickly you can figure out which company this is:\n\n\\-This NYSE listed company is trading at the same level as where it was 1 year ago, gaining 80% since its lowest point in March 2020\n\n\\-This company has a 5 year average return on capital of 6.1%, compared to its industry's average of 0.91%.\n\n\\-Based in New York, this company was founded by Henry Wells and William Fargo\n\n\\-As of the last report, this company has $46b of total debt\n\n\\-This company recently drew the attention of federal investigators who are looking into whether it has been using \"misleading and aggressive sales tactics\" to sell its products\n\n\\-With over 100 million customers, this company facilitates over $1 trillion in revolving credit annually\n\n\\-In 2016, this company lost an exclusive partnership with a multinational corporation to Citigroup.\n\n\\-Losing this one single partnership COST this company about 10% of its revenue!\n\n\\-This company currently pays a quarterly dividend of 43 cents\n\n\\-Its largest shareholder Berkshire Hathaway inc owns approximately 18% of this company\n\nHave you made your guess yet?\n\nIf your guess was &gt;!WFC (Wells Fargo &amp; Co), you would be wrong! !&lt;\n\n&gt;!The correct answer is actually AXP (American Express Co.). Outlook for AXP: AMEX is becoming more and more aggressive with its sales tactics to coerce business owners into accepting their product while at the same time sticking to its modus operandi of charging 50% higher merchant fees than its competitors Visa and Mastercard on the basis that AMEX cardholders are perceived as affluent. According to American Express, AMEX cardholders average 60% higher income than non-AMEX cardholders. This statistic is probably skewed by the fact that Warren Buffet has been carrying an AMEX card since 1964.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!With e-commerce and alternative payment options on the rise, physical charge cards are going to become a thing of the past. Amex's business model which revolves almost entirely around collecting merchant fees is on shaky grounds.  TLDR: Boomer stock, no thanks. OPTAP: $120!&lt;\n\nDisclaimer: I do not hold any positions in this company. This is not financial or investment advice.",

What happens? If it is not cost efficient for other countries to setup miners to counterbalance this power dynamic, why would they?\n\nIs this idea over-exaggerated and paranoid?",

Jack Ma seems to have pissed off the Chinese government by publicly criticizing regulators and now he seems to have disappeared off the face of the earth.\n\nThe Chinese government doesn\u2019t give a shit, they\u2019re straight up mercenaries. They don\u2019t even pretend to disguise their brutality. For Christ\u2019s sake, they\u2019re genociding an entire group of people (Uighurs, a Muslim minority in western China)!!

No one knows for sure.\n\nMy question is buy, sell, or hold?\n\nMy gut is telling me to sell and take the ~12% loss (I got in just a few months ago) and do some tax loss harvesting and repurpose the $ to something more stable.

        "selftext": "So I\u2019m not sure to flair this as DD or discussion as I\u2019m not sure myself, first time posting here.\n\nI know this stock hasn\u2019t been talked about for some time here, but I\u2019d like to know your opinions.\n\nAtm I might be drunk so definitely ask for clarification. Shoot it down ifI\u2019m stupid, I\u2019m ok with that. Failure is part of the learning process.\n\nAt the moment it\u2019s pretty clear that the ARM deal, as the P/E of 115 would suggest, probably in a relatively rational market is one of the few things that would justify its current value. \n\nAnd as some of us would know from a few months ago, this deal can\u2019t go through without the approval of the Chinese and Europeans, the biggest being of course the Chinese.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know why the takeover is a big deal: ARM is a British company who controls the biggest share of patents on IP cores: \u201ca reusable unit of logic, cell or integrated circuit layout design\u201d acoording to Wikipedia, so they\u2019re makig their revenue by selling their patented chip designs, thus being integral to a huge part of the semiconductor industry. \n\nWhat people fear is that this would mean a near-monopoly in this semi-conductor industry by Nvidia: e.g. ARM delivers around 90% of the smartphone chips. Given the fact that Nvidia is trying to grow in the data centre and AI development sectors, ARM is pivotal in this. It would be like getting a scientist in Civilization V: a huge boost in comparison to their competitors, of which INTL consistently underperforms and AMD is still not yet on the level if it comes to GPU\u2019s.\n\n\nGiven the fact this would give Nvidia a lot of power in China: ARM has a joint venture in China and being a US company they might not trust this deal carries a big risk. Even though Softbank, ARM and Nvidia were confident that this deal would go through the 18-month paperwork that is this takeover, but since Jack Ma has been gone missing, things might look different.\n\nI\u2019ve seen people here saying it\u2019s the CCP being butthurt, but I\u2019ve got a different view of it, and I thought it was the Washington Post that thought the same: the CCP wakes up to the danger that the big tech and data companies provide as they present a enormous threat to their power. Being dependent on Western technology and Biden still willing to continue the hard line (albeit in a more subtle way) of Trump towards China the stance towards US companies doesn\u2019t change. The stance of the CCP towards tech companies in general might. And thus the initially already unsure deal becomes even more unsure, as the Brits fear that the takeover will lose jobs and knowledge in their country. \n\nI\u2019d like to hear your thoughts on this: how has the Jack Ma incident changed the CCP\u2019s stance on technology? And how does it affect the Western companies? There might still change a lot in the temaining 15 months but I myself do expect a harder line towards Western tech companies in China. I\u2019d love to hear your arguments against and for.\n\nBull case: I\u2019d say they\u2019re leading in some very potential big industries and they are very able to convert that lead: the competition is still far away. With ARM they will consolidate this.\n\nBear case: When looking at the P/E it\u2019s overvalued and potential upside is priced in and it seems that due to the wait of the approval the stock atm is going sideways, and there might be resistance against the deal. I\u2019ve not mentioned it earlier but also the Europeans don\u2019t seem too happy with this, not to mention China which I did mention.\n\nI hope you\u2019ve become any wiser of this, questions or sources do ask.\n\nFor those who ask positions I\u2019ve been owning 2 shares since June/July bc I\u2019m poor.",

        "selftext": "Hi r/securityanalysis, I am trying to become better at researching investment ideas and here is a piece I recently put together. I would love some feedback and a discussion on your thoughts on it. \n\n**The Situation and Company Background**\n\nAffirm is a leading buy now, pay later (BNPL) provider that allows consumers to have the flexibility to pay for their purchase over a period of 6 weeks to 48 months with merchants that have added Affirm as a payment option. The company is expected to trade under the ticker \u201cAFRM\u201d and start trading next Wednesday with price talk around $38/share, which equates to an equity value of around $9.2B. This is a severely lower valuation than other fintech peers such as Afterpay, Square, and Shopify. We believe that AFRM should be valued at least $20B to $30B using a conservative FY23 EV/Sales total company comp of 13x compared to Afterpay at 18.3x, SHOP at 28.1x, and Visa and Mastercard around 16x. \n\nThe company mainly operates in the United States, and as of September 30th, has already partnered with over 6,500 merchants and has 3.9M active consumers but recently acquired PayBright, a Canadian based BNPL provider. Affirm generates most of their revenue through fees charged to merchants when a customer uses the BNPL option at checkout. Additionally, the company generates revenue through simple interest charged to consumers that have chosen to extend their payment options beyond the interest-free payment length. Merchant fees range from 2 \u2013 3% while APR ranges from 0 \u2013 30%. Additionally, the company earns fees through customers who utilize a virtual debit card, gains on loans sold to third-party investors, and servicing fees on loans managed by Affirm. \n\nIn FY20 (June end), Affirm saw +92.7% revenue growth to $509.5M, with $256.8M in merchant network revenue (50.4% of revenue) and $186.7M in interest income (36.6% of revenue). Additionally, active customers grew +76.9% to 3.62M active users and gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew +77.0% to $4.6B. We note that Affirm is currently reliant on one merchant, Peloton (PTON) for their revenue as the partner accounted for 28% of FY20 revenue and the top 10 merchants accounted for 35% of revenue. \n\n**Investment Thesis**\n\nWe believe that Affirm will be the dominant BNPL provider in the future in the United States that will benefit from increasing usage of BNPL at checkout. We anticipate Affirm\u2019s recent partnerships with e-commerce platform Shopify (SHOP) and payment company Adyen (ADYEN.AS) will help drive a flywheel effect to allow Affirm to establish itself as the dominant BNPL provider in the United States as both platforms will help bring additional merchants and consumers onto the platform. We expect the Shopify partnership to help capture a differentiated market that is underserved compared to competitors Afterpay and Klarna. With the addition of Shopify, hundreds of thousands of vendors can now add a BNPL option seamlessly which will allow Affirm take market share, which will further drive the flywheel effect. \n\nWe also believe that Affirm provides a better product suite than competitors from the perspective of both the merchant and consumer. Affirm\u2019s product provides more flexibility on payment term length compared to its competitors, offers virtual debit cards to allow consumers to use Affirm at retailers that have not currently partnered with Affirm, and a no fee and competitive high-yield savings account. Additionally, Affirm charges substantially lower merchant fees. Together, we believe merchants are more likely to choose Affirm when deciding on which BNPL company to implement, which will further compound the desirability of implementing Affirm as their consumer and merchant base grows.  \n\nFinally, we anticipate Affirm to serve a Millennial, Gen Z, and Gen X population that has not adopted credit card usage like their older generations. Their generations are more accustomed to online shopping and utilizing digital payments but have built a distrust in traditional credit due to seeing their older friends and family negatively impacted during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n**Comparable Company Analysis and Valuation**\n\n[Comp Sheet](https://imgur.com/CLgDfsK) Source: Factset, and [Valuation](https://imgur.com/UM5iiOS) indicate a fair value of $20B to $30B equity value compared to IPO pricing of around $9.2B. This is another severely underpriced IPO that is poised to pop on the first day of trading. \n\n**Buy Now Pay Later Background**\nAffirm offers a new alternative way that people can transact. Consumers have been utilizing different methods to trade for goods and services since the dawn of man. Transactions have originally started through bartering for different items and goods and evolved into using coins made from precious metals as accepted methods of payment. In a more modern world, we have moved to utilizing paper currency and coinage, and more recently, into credit/debit and digital wallets. The way people shop has also significantly evolved throughout time. Gone are the days merchants carried their wares across different towns. Although we still have outdoor markets much like Greek agoras in 1,000 B.C., we have evolved in the way we pay for goods and services at markets. Local stores and department stores, which dominated the way consumers shopped in the 19th and 20th century, are in a decline. Now, we are entering a new period in how consumers shop; online. With this revolution, we can see continued shifts and advancement in the way people pay and we believe the \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d option is the innovation that has the potential to upend the traditional credit/debit card market.\n\nAffirm will become the second largest publicly traded BNPL provider, behind Australia\u2019s Afterpay. The BNPL payment option is an alternative way for a consumer to pay for product by providing flexibility regarding payment terms and is a point-of-sale (POS) loan.  Although the BNPL payment method is still miniscule compared to traditional payment methods such as credit and debit cards, accounting for approximately 1% of e-comm sales in 2019, Worldpay\u2019s 2020 Global Payments report expects penetration to increase 3x to 3% of e-comm sales utilizing BNPL by 2023. In EMEA, the payment method is already more established and accounted for 6% of 2019 e-comm payments and Worldpay expects it to reach ~10% penetration by 2023. Market research company eMarketer estimated that U.S. consumers spent $590B on e-comm in 2019. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the first 3 quarters of 2020 had 16.3% of retail sales ex-auto penetration through e-comm, compared to 12.5% in the same period LY, and e-comm dollars spent grew +34.2%. With the pandemic reshaping how consumers shop and accelerating the growth of e-comm sales usage and spending, we believe that BNPL usage could potentially beat Worldpay\u2019s estimates. \n\nAnother key piece for Affirm\u2019s success relates to their credit risk model. Unlike a traditional credit card where a consumer is approved for a credit limit at the time of application, Affirm provides a credit limit in addition to analyzing risk at the transaction level and can approve/reject purchases at the time of purchase. The company\u2019s risk model has allowed them to approve 20% more customers compared to other competitors while still limiting delinquency and default rates. Additionally, their 36-month delinquency rate is more than 50% lower than the credit card industry average of 2.5%, with a rate of 1.1%. We also estimate that AFRM\u2019s net charge-off rates are also about 50% lower than industry average, ending FY20 with 1.8% of loans charged off compared to the credit card industry average of 3.7% in the same period. Although traditional credit card companies can lower a consumer\u2019s credit limit at any point in time, they are often slow to react as their algorithms rely on antiquated methods such as credit scores, transaction history, and credit usage. This indicates credit card algorithms are utilizing data that could be older than a month to make credit risk decision. Affirm\u2019s proprietary risk model has brought the credit risk model into modern times with real-time economic data in addition to SKU level data to assess risk more advantageously and at a transactional level.\n\n**Why Affirm?**\n\nAlthough Affirm is not the only BNPL provider in the U.S. and was not the first provider, we believe that Affirm\u2019s product suite is superior compared to competitors such as Afterpay and Klarna. Currently, Afterpay only lets consumers split their purchase into 4 interest free payments split in 2-week intervals across 4 payments, spreading payments across 6-weeks. Klarna\u2019s product is essentially identical. Affirm allows consumers to split their purchases monthly for up to 48 months, with most interest free periods ranging up to 12 months. Additionally, we believe Affirm is more compelling for the retailer to utilize because the merchant fees charged are substantially lower (2 \u2013 3%) vs. Afterpay (3 \u2013 6%) and Klarna (up to 5.99%). Affirm also offers a virtual debit card, which lets you use your Affirm account to pay at retailers that have not currently partnered with Affirm as their chosen BNPL provider. \n\n[Affirm vs. Competitors](https://imgur.com/tVivw6t) Source: Company websites\n\n**How Can Affirm Continue to Grow and Improve?**\n\nAffirm is Still Missing Multiple Pieces to Become the Dominant BNPL Provider. Although we are bullish on Affirm\u2019s long-term prospects and impressed with their current progress, we believe there is still room to improve. We believe two key components of a dominating alternative payment company are still missing, and once implemented, can accelerate new user adoption. (1) Affirm needs to implement a rewards program, similar to traditional credit cards and Klarna\u2019s \u201cVibe\u201d rewards program. Affirm highlighted most of their users have the ability to pay for their purchase in full but prefer the financial flexibility of splitting payments. We believe Affirm\u2019s users are financially responsible consumers and may face hesitation to utilize the BNPL option vs. a credit card as there is no rewards/cash back offering at Affirm. We expect Affirm to offer a rewards program in the near future, which would impact profitability, but would help drive customer acquisition in the long-term. (2) A physical card that allows the user to utilize Affirm\u2019s BNPL option in retail stores could help drive additional GMV growth. The card would be programmed to follow the merchant\u2019s current agreement and timeframe of repayment that the merchant and Affirm have already agreed too. However, if the card is used at a non-partner merchant, AFRM would allow the card to be used as a 0% APR credit card with repayment term lengths determined by their proprietary credit risk model. Recall that a credit card was used to pay in 40% of in-store transactions, and we believe a physical card can help complete AFRM\u2019s product suite. We also believe the card can help bring Affirm on equal footing with competitors that have partnered with substantially more merchants as consumers can use the Affirm card online with any merchant.\n\n**The Bears**\n\nAffirm is in a distant third place with 3.9M active users in the U.S. as of September 30, 2020, trailing Afterpay\u2019s 6.5M active U.S. customers and Klarna\u2019s 10M customers in the same period. Additionally, Affirm currently has 6.5k active U.S. merchant partnerships compared to Afterpay\u2019s 13.9k U.S. partnerships and Klarna\u2019s 235k+ global partners. Lastly, Affirm lags both competitors in GMV. Affirm saw $5.3B in TTM GMV compared to Afterpay\u2019s $11.1B AUD and Klarna\u2019s $35B+ USD from January to September 2020.  We do highlight that Affirm is the leader in average GMV/customer at $1,359 compared to Afterpay at $991 and Klarna at $412, which we believe is due to high exposure to PTON and other higher-AOV retailers.\n\nAffirm is still heavily reliant on Peloton (PTON), but we believe they have a symbiotic relationship. PTON offers Affirm as an option to finance equipment at 0% APR for up to 39 months. Our field checks and PTON\u2019s 10-K indicate that substantial portion of PTON equipment purchases are financed through AFRM. AFRM also disclosed that 28% of FY20 revenue came from their PTON partnership. A big critique of AFRM\u2019s business model is that they are too reliant on one merchant for their revenue. We believe that this could pose a risk in the intermediate future, but analysts expect PTON\u2019s performance through FY2021 (June 30-end) to remain strong. PTON recently reported an explosive 1Q (Sept-30 end) with +233% revenue growth but +281% growth in their connected fitness segment, which is the segment that recognizes sales of their Peloton Bike. \n\n[PTON Connected Fitness Revenue Estimates](https://imgur.com/734f82O) Source: FactSet and PTON\n\n**Still Undervalued Excluding PTON**\n[Still valued at $22B excluding PTON revenue](https://imgur.com/M5aoT3p) Source: My estimates from backing out PTON revenue contribution\n\n**Valuation**\n\nWe use a blended valuation to arrive to a $94 implied value/share, which provides +147% upside to the high end of the IPO price talk of $33 to $38/share. Our valuation is based on a 75%/25% blend of a multiples-based analysis on FY2023E and a DCF model. Our EV/sales analysis assigns a 16x multiple on merchant network revenue, 12x multiple on interest income revenue, and a 2x multiple on servicing income, virtual card revenue, and gain on sale of loans. This provides a total company EV/sales multiple of 13x FY23 estimates. This is lower than APT\u2019s 18.3x FY23 EV/sales multiple, which we believe is justified due to AFRM\u2019s revenue mix that is more concentrated towards interest income revenue, lower GMV, fewer active customers, and high reliance on one merchant. However, AFRM is a fast-growing alternative payment company that is growing share in a fast-growing industry, has strong partnerships that we believe will help drive growth long-term, and a strong leadership team with successful experience in the internet/payment space. For DCF, we use a WACC of 10.9%.\n\n[13x FY23 EV/Sales Valuation](https://imgur.com/UM5iiOS) Source: FactSet, and [10 Year DCF Analysis](https://imgur.com/dItAhab) Source: My estimates\n\n[Finally, a more conservative sensitivity table indicates ~$73 valuation with a very conservative EV/sales multiple and lower 3-year CAGR assumption.](https://imgur.com/4FAtFHA) Source: My estimates\n\nNote: All ideas are my own and I will be buying the IPO on Wednesday. This does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any security discussed.",
