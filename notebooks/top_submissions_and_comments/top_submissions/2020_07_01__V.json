        "selftext": "On social media, this disruptor company has been called the Robinhood of fintech.  Its customer base is the little guy: small and medium enterprises the world over.  Thanks to its fintech, the company enables these same businesses to obtain trade finance and engage in global trade, treading where at least 60% of banks and trading companies won\u2019t in a $40 trillion industry.  This first mover aims to address the $1.5 trillion gap in SME trade finance.\n\nBetter yet, this industry disruptor has not only survived the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has thrived.  [Not least because it is based in Singapore, a solid financial hub with robust disease control measures.]\n\nTrade and trade finance will only migrate more and more to the online platform of this [\u201cmost innovative fintech company\u201d in Asia-Pacific](https://d2tyltutevw8th.cloudfront.net/media/document/press-release-the-innovators-2020-regional-winn-1588769601.pdf) (*Global Finance*).\n\nLater this very month, Triterras will enter into a definitive merger agreement with the 7th-ranking special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) on Robinhood\u2019s list of Blank Check Companies: Netfin Acquisition Corp ($NFIN).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8omJ_Hzz08M\n\n**TRANSACTION VALUES**\n\nPublished transaction values are as follows:\n\nPre-money equity value is approximately $670 million.\n\nPost money equity value is approximately $939 million.\n\nProposed enterprise value is approximately $995 million.\n\nTo put things into a conservative perspective:\n\nPre-money equity value to NFIN market cap ratio (7/02): 1.92\n\nPost-money equity value to NFIN market cap ratio (7/02): 2.69\n\nProposed enterprise value to NFIN market cap ratio (7/02): 2.85\n\n**GROWTH PROSPECTS**\n\nWhile already profitable at $87 million EBITDA and $46 million consolidated net income, Triterras is aiming to more than double these two performance measures by the end of their next fiscal year.  Of the $1.5 trillion gap in SME trade finance, it has addressed $4.1 billion, and aims to more than double this by the end of fiscal 2021.  That the company has three modules for its Kratos platform, [two more than the end of calendar 2019](https://www.gtreview.com/news/fintech/blockchain-fintech-triterras-goes-live-with-trade-finance-product-for-smes/), indicates its commitment to developing that platform further as part of its business growth story.\n\nSomething suggests that $NFIN\u2019s proposed enterprise value may be a discount on a growth company.  Its valuation seems to be based on a multiple of fiscal 2019 EBITDA, rather than on a multiple of sales.  It is definitely not based on a multiple of fiscal 2021 sales.\n\nOh, well.  Let that proposed enterprise value stand before the merger.  It just might go noticeably past that in the short term, even after all the equity dilution is said and done.\n\n*Disclosure: Long on $NFIN.*",

I present with you some DD.\n\nIf the above holds true, fund managers, large pension funds and ETF's will need to rebalance portfolios this coming quarter. If you look at the top holdings of SPY. We can see the following top stock holdiings:\n\n**Microsoft Corporation** 6.01%\n\n**Apple Inc.** 5.74%\n\n**Amazon.com, Inc.** 4.67%\n\n**Facebook, Inc. Class A**  2.21%\n\n**Alphabet Inc. Class A**1.67%\n\n**Alphabet Inc. Class C**1.63%\n\n**Johnson &amp; Johnson**1.43%\n\n**Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Class B**1.34%\n\n**Visa Inc. Class A**1.26%\n\n**Procter &amp; Gamble Company**1.15%\n\n[https://www.ssga.com/us/en/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy)\n\nYes, I know SPY mirrors SPX, same principle applies, just using SPY because it was easier to pull historical's. SPY holds 257 Billion. If this fund decides to move just .5% out of Microsoft they would be redistributing 1 billion amongst the lower tier stocks. Will they do this? why not? They do it regularly, the question is if enough funds and ETF's do it at once, will it boost some stock and suppress others?\n\nBack to microsoft. SPY had 81 million shares as of yesterday. What did they have last september? 84 million.  [https://www.ssga.com/library-content/products/fund-docs/etfs/us/ps/SPDR\\_500-TRUST\\_PROSPECTUS.pdf](https://www.ssga.com/library-content/products/fund-docs/etfs/us/ps/SPDR_500-TRUST_PROSPECTUS.pdf)\n\nSPY has actually REDUCED microsoft holdings over the last year. Would they boost top holdings right now having such a massive run? if your mandate is to have a diverse portfolio, I doubt it.\n\nThis trend in the SPY ETF reducing holdings over the last year is also true of Apple, and Facebook but not Amazon.\n\nComapnies I like with low weights barring that something crazy with the virus doesn't happen and JPow's printer doesn't get jammed:\n\nCalls on :KO, PFE, INTC,  MMM, RTX",

I thought this would be useful if and when things return to normal to know how they were doing before COVID. I compared their debt situation in 2019 to how things changed in the first Q of 2020. You can actually see how their equity and debt has changed already from just the first Q. I also looked at the cash flow statement of all three to see how much debt they've reported financing and if they can cover their capital expenditures.

        "selftext": "TLDR: Is this a good time to start a retirement fund for my parents or should I wait till after election (around January) once the cloud clears? I will max their traditional IRA into 2 etfs (SPY and QQQ) and 3 stocks (MSFT, COST, JNJ).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSituation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheyre in their mid 50s and I will help them manage it.  Jointly, they make about 54k net per year (after taxes, insurance etc) but they dont have any sort of retirement fund/emergency fund currently. They just starting now since we are immigrants and was able to settle down just recently. They have a monthly expense of about $2600 (this includes a mortgage of 30 more years and a car payment of 4 years). They love to work, so they will probably retire in their 70s. Overall, they will have about 1900 per month in saving. My sibling and I are done with college and have our own jobs now. We are still with them but we're financially independent and plan to settle on our once their retirement fund is smooth sailing which will probably increase their monthly expenses to 3000$ since we will be contributing less (we are willing to help them as much as we could so it could stay as it is or hopefully even less depending on our future financial situation). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlan:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth their 401k does not match so I am thinking of starting traditional IRA with schwab. My plan is to max out their traditional IRA (14k combined per year) and focus it into two ETFs (SPY and QQQ) and 3 stocks (MSFT, COST, JNJ). I will DCA equally into 5 on their red days. Overall, they will have 700$ per month left over (after retirement contribution with this plan and expenses) which they can use for leisure...or should I have them contribute some to 401k and/or roth?.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy rationale of starting now is I can have their retirement fund ride the recovery from the pandemic drop (roughly about 1/4 more left to V shape recovery). We can argue that there is another drop (which is very likely) but I am not worried since I am DCAing anyway and I dont think this \"2nd drop\" will be as bad as the first one (especially this election, i dont think the current admin will let this happen). Election aftermath is a different story. I dont know what to expect after election hence this post. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy investment choices rationale: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSPY - Diversified basket\n\nQQQ- Tech heavy growth basket (pandemic proof)\n\nMSFT - Tech growth (pandemic proof)\n\nCOST - retail growth (pandemic proof, arguably)\n\nJNJ - healthcare growth especially post pandemic (I am thinking of omitting this since I also feel this might be a risky choice for a late retirement account). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother route: Have their retirement fund professionally managed. If so where?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am thinking of asking this in other financial sub but my really concern here is my investment choices and timing (which i believe this sub has the best point of view/opinion on); time in the market is better than timing the market but I feel like timing for a late retirement account in this situation is especially important. I dont have much experience with the market (just recently started myself) but my educational background is enough to understand it and its caveats. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

        "selftext": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-02/deutsche-bank-considers-financial-support-for-wirecard-bank-kc4tsbnd\n\nDeutsche Bank AG is weighing the acquisition of all or part of disgraced Wirecard AG\u2019s bank, potentially throwing the business a lifeline after one of the biggest corporate scandals in recent years.\n\nThe Frankfurt-based lender is in touch with regulator BaFin, Wirecard Bank\u2019s management board and administrators on possible further steps to help Wirecard\u2019s finance unit, a Deutsche Bank spokesman said by e-mail, without elaborating. Options include taking on pieces of Wirecard Bank or the unit in its entirety, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the lender is still debating other ways to help Wirecard Bank and hasn\u2019t made a final decision.\n\nDeutsche Bank had informal tie-up talks with the scandal-hit fintech last Spring, though it quickly broke off the preliminary discussions. Wirecard Bank -- which sat at the heart of the firm -- could be valuable to a potential acquirer because of its relationship with credit card companies Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and JCB International, which are also key to other parts of Wirecard.\n\nDeutsche Bank may also be hit if Wirecard Bank were to file for insolvency. Germany\u2019s deposit insurance scheme for private banks would have to make depositors whole if the lender didn\u2019t have enough funds of its own to repay them. That could lead to higher contributions from the scheme members, of which Deutsche Bank is the biggest and highest paying.\n\nWirecard filed for insolvency last week after saying that almost 2 billion euros ($2.25 billion) it previously reported as cash probably never existed, throwing the future of its banking and others businesses into doubt. The company faces a potential avalanche of lawsuits and former Chief Executive Officer Markus Braun was arrested, though he is now out on bail.\n\nWhile Wirecard Bank isn\u2019t part of the bankruptcy proceedings, the parent ceded control of funds last week after the financial regulator stepped in to prevent the money from being deployed elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe are currently reviewing the possibility of providing Wirecard Bank AG with financial support,\u201d Deutsche Bank said. \u201cWe are in principle prepared to provide this support in the context of a continuation of business operations, if such assistance should become necessary.\u201d\n\nInsolvency administrator Michael Jaffe said on Wednesday that the assets he\u2019s trying to sell are attracting interest from numerous investors. He didn\u2019t say whether he intends to sell Wirecard Bank as well, though said the lender remains solvent.\n\nTo fuel its growth, Wirecard had been paying depositors attractive interest at a time when traditional banks increasingly started to pass on negative rates. This year, it began offering a 0.75% interest rate via its Boon app, betting that more deposits will translate into more payments via its systems and lucrative contracts with stores and online merchants.\n\nIn addition to the earlier talks on a possible tie-up, the two financial firms had others links. Deutsche Bank is part of a lending group of 15 banks that together are owed about 1.6 billion euros, Bloomberg has reported. CEO Christian Sewing has been trying to shift the lender away from its reliance on trading income toward a focus on processing payments for companies, and he\u2019s made the division responsible for the business -- known as Corporate Bank -- the centerpiece of his large restructuring plan.\n\nSewing has focused tech investment on the Corporate Bank but he has also said that the division is being challenged by the low interest-rate environment it\u2019s operating in.\n\nThe collapse of Wirecard has prompted criticism of regulators and soul-searching among Germany\u2019s elite grappling for answers over the failure of what was once one of its most lauded companies. BaFin President Felix Hufeld has acknowledged that his institution is among those to blame for not catching the irregularities, which he referred to as \u201cmassive fraud\u201d on Thursday in Frankfurt.",

They closed today $2.81.  We also added a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .7\n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a decent start and rallied to a high of +210 by 9:45 but didn\u2019t hold it and was back down on the day by 11:00 but wouldn\u2019t give up, and spent all day between + / - 100 until the close when it sold off in the last 15 minutes and finished -77.91 (.30%).  The DJIA was the outcast with the NASDAQ +95.86 (.95%) at another new high, S&amp;P +15.57 (.50%), the Russell -14.05 (.97%), and the DJ Transports -19.71 (.21%) even though FDX and UPS had added 120 DJT points to the average.  Market internals were even on the NYSE while the NASDAQ was actually 9:7 Down, regardless of its new high close.  The DJIA was 20:9 down and WMT unchanged with no winners or losers moving over 20 DP\u2019s. Volume on NYSE was average but on the NAZ it was about 20% higher than yesterday.  Hong Kong and Covid-19 were the big negatives today and it was the ISM gains to 52.6, well over the 50 break-point, and the excitement of the PFE vaccine news were the big positives that helps us higher.\n \n \n \n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/dr95ohxzdjo\n\nOur Discord forum link is in the video description..\n\n\nSECTORS: The transports were the sector in the spotlight with FDX earnings (a loss) sending the stock higher by $16.44, although it closed just over its low of the day with a gain of 11.7% after being up over 14% for the biggest one-day gain since coming public in 1978.  UPS also gained 2.9% and between them they added 120 point to the average but still couldn\u2019t keep the average in positive territory.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN -.53, BGS -.08, FLO -.11, CPB -.32, CAG +.50, MDLZ -.05, KHC -.21, CALM -.54, JJSF -2.80, SAFM -3.21, HRL -.83, SJM -.59, PPC -.15, KR -.20, and PBJ $31.06 -.17 (.54%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB -3.44, ABBV +1.22, REGN -15.55, ISRG +5.71, GILD -.94, MYL -.23, TEVA -.82, VRTX -3.31, BHC +.13, INCY -1.32, ICPT -1.41, LABU +.59, and IBB $137.80 +1.11 (.81%).\n \nCANNABIS: was HIGHER with TLRY -.06, CGC +.25, CRON +.05, GWPH +3.53, ACB -.18, CURLF +.06, KERN -.16, and MJ $12.98 +.11 (.85%).\n\n \nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -3.92, GD -.86, TXT -.77, NOC +.70, BWXT -.18, TDY -6.76, RTX -.01, and ITA $163.19 -1.53 (.93%)\n \n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M -.26, JWN -.29, KSS -.63, DDS -.94, WMT -.23, TGT -.93, TJX +.64, RL -1.85, UAA -.12, LULU -2.82, TPR -.33, CPRI -.37, and XRT $43.06 +.18 (.42%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +23.95, AMZN +122.28 (4.43%), AAPL -.69, FB +10.03, NFLX +31.96, NVDA +1.49, TSLA +58.18 (5.39%), BABA +.60, BIDU +.91, CMG +17.52, CAT +.07, BA -1.85, DIS +1.45, and XLK $104.66 +.17 (.16%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -.12, JPM -.64, BAC -.44, MS -.74, C -.70, PNC -2.38, AIG -1.55, TRV -1.65, AXP -.84, V +.50, and XLF $22.94 -.20 (.86%).\n \n \nOIL, $39.82 +.55. Oil was lower in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied midday. I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. The stocks were higher with XLE $36.93 -.92 (2.43%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,779.30 -20.60. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said \u201cwe\u2019ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.\u201d  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 yesterday and we closed $2.81 - .49 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,325 + 140. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.77 + .17 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "Hello, Redditors,\n\nI have started investing a couple of years back. I had my fair share of gambling with penny stocks and other FOMO stocks. Finally settled on investing only in MSFT, APPL, GOOG, V, AMZN. Other stocks of interest are TSM, BABA, LUV, DIS. I have around 10k to invest, and I have been waiting on the sidelines watching stocks hit bottom in March and back to all-time highs again. And, I have decided to get into the market with the DCA approach. I am planning to buy $500 worth of stocks (fractional stocks - a mix of MSFT, APPL, GOOG, V, AMZN, TSM, LUV) on a weekly basis to hedge against volatility. So, my question is, is there a way to automate the process? Let's say if I want to buy 5 shares (fraction of each MSFT, APPL, GOOG, V, AMZN) I have to make 5 different orders.\n\nAlso, any suggestions my stock picks and DCA, in general, will be highly appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

AYRO builds ev work vehicles that are made for college campuses (used at Penn State and Princeton), cities, parks, sporting venues, etc..

The overarching theme behind these picks is **American Innovation &amp; Mexican Development.**\n\nI'm a 26 year old fintech engineer in the US and an avocado farmer in Mexico and I hold a strong conviction that investing in Mexican development will reward me well in the decades to come.\n\n**In a nutshell, the USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring and my strategy favors the Texas-Nuevo Leon economy and overall Mexican-American trade.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is Monterrey, Nuevo Leon\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png))\n\nI'm from a rural village south of Jalisco which produces far more agricultural goods like avocados alongside Michoacan.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very aware of the problems that Mexico faces but I also view Mexico as a sleeping giant that the US utilizes for capital efficiency in global trade.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

No other significant economic news this week for USA. Focus will be on virus numbers. New information regarding fatality rates will be HUGE imo. If the recent new cases result in more deaths (this week is when those numbers should come out) expect a drop in the market. HOWEVER, if the new cases DONT equal an increase in corona deaths this week, I expect markets to further downplay the total number of corona cases and for markets to rise further. \n\n3. Don\u2019t set too ambitious of price targets this week. Prices tend to bounce off support and resistance more during sentiment focused weeks. \n\n4. Make tendies\n\n\n\n**\nWhat is non manufacturing PMI?\n\n\nThe Non-Manufacturing ISM Report On Business\u00ae is based on data compiled from purchasing and supply executives nationwide. Survey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month. For each of the indicators measured (Business Activity, New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Inventory Change, Inventory Sentiment, Imports, Prices, Employment and Supplier Deliveries) this report shows the percentage reporting each response, and the diffusion index. An index reading above 50 percent indicates that the non-manufacturing economy in that index is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally declining. Orders to the service producers make up about 90 percent of the US economy.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been managing my stock portfolio kinda randomly, some options some stocks buying on a whim and selling. I\u2019m bummed that I didn\u2019t hold any stock long term even though I was an early adopter of AMZN, NFLX etc. and being in tech I knew they were going to be big, even NVDA or SHOP couple years ago. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t want to lose the next 10-15 years. I want to invest in a disciplined way, buy around 20 stocks and then add on dips, So I\u2019ll keep around $100K cash. My big confusion is which 20 stocks to pick? I\u2019ve been reading here, checking TipRanks, have Motley fool advisor and the list I come up with is huge. I\u2019m pasting the symbols that have creeped into my planning spreadsheet below. Also I\u2019m confused whether to buy fewer stocks at higher investment or many at lower. Also whether more investment into the stable large names (MSFT, AMZN, AAPL) or more in relatively newer names (SE, DOCU, NET etc.) I\u2019ve searched many posts on the \u201c20 stock portfolio\u201d or such but my confusion will not go away. Hence I\u2019m posting here to hear from you directly. I\u2019m 42 years old, good stable job, will have $50K more to add to the portfolio every year. I\u2019m open to moderate risk. Help me with a 15-20 stock investment portfolio that I can hold long term and add on dips. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on my spreadsheet right now:\n\nNewer stars 2 yrs: SE, NET, CRWD, CHWY, FSLY, DDOG, TTD, ZS, TWLO, TEAM, SPLK, MDB, WORK, SHOP\n\nETFs: ARKK, ARKW, WCLD, QQQ\n\nPayments or Banks: SQ, PYPL, V, JPM, BAC \n\nBetting: GAN, DKNG, PENN\n\nChips: NVDA, AMD, MU\n\nEnergy: ENPH, NEE, PCG, FANG\n\nHealthcare: LVGO, TDOC, UNH, MOH, DHR, CATS, VEEV, MODN\n\nCovid: HOLX, NVAX, MRNA, INO, IBIO, AYTU, VBIV , TTOO\n\nEVs: TSLA, NIO, WKHS, FUV, GRAF, PLUG\n\nFANG stocks: MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, FB\n\nSocial/Entertain: PINS, NFLX, ROKU\n\nCyber: PANW, ZS, CRWD, NET, PING, FNET, FEYE\n\nBeaten down (1 year recovery): WYNN, LVS, DAL, LUV, STWD, SPG, CAR, MAR, RCL\n\nMy Options are:\n1) Invest $10K into 50 stocks since I can\u2019t choose with all the confusion\n2) Choose 15 stocks and invest $30K each or so \n3) Invest more % in couple categories above like the FANG stocks, ETFs, EVs, and less in others \n4) Buy 100 shares of 15 or so from the above list and sell covered calls getting ~$4K per week (but with the limited upside of covered calls, downside will be the same as holding) \n5) Stay 50% or more cash since the market could crash given the high valuations, pandemic and election year \n6) Something else that you\u2019d do in my shoes",

The overarching theme behind these picks is **American Innovation &amp; Mexican Development.** \n\nI'm a 26 year old fintech engineer in the US and an avocado farmer in Mexico and I hold a strong conviction that investing in Mexican development will reward me well in the decades to come.  \n\n**In a nutshell, the USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring and my strategy favors the Texas-Nuevo Leon economy and overall Mexican-American trade.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is Monterrey, Nuevo Leon\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png))\n\n \n\nI'm from a rural village south of Jalisco which produces far more agricultural goods like avocados alongside Michoacan.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very aware of the problems that Mexico faces but I also view Mexico as a sleeping giant that the US utilizes for capital efficiency in global trade. Mexico is part of a puzzle that fits in a large scope that involves other bulwark nations like Germany, Japan, Brazil, and India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[Bulwark Trading Nations\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[The North American Trade Block\\]([https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40](https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, Mexico is a nation in crisis. The economic damage narcotrafficking has delivered has resulted in:\n\n\\- \\[An increasing black market integration into the global money supply, in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars, resulting in a growing vacuum of theft AKA the Drug War &amp; Economics of Peace\\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\\_Secrecy\\_Act#Sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Secrecy_Act#Sanctions))\n\n\\- North American suppressed wage suppression\n\n\\- refugee style illegal immigration\n\n\\- NA workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- Mexican workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- A Mexican workforce and brain drain, as skilled and motivated laborers leave for opportunity and better pay who are loyal to both nations\n\n\\- Multiple events of civil unrest or civil disasters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- National cyncism against the current administration\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see this as a complex problem where most people's perspective is not complete or clouded by one of the reasons above. I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy. It is certainly in a golden era of sorts, and Mexico reflects as a nation in decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# The Economic Framework\n\nI am selecting industries that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Empower the US and have a rippling effect on Mexico\n\n\\- Will fundamentally continue to build and grow the future global supply\n\n\\- Are friendly to primarily German/Euro and Japanese/Asian trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# My Portfolio Structure\n\nThere are two systems at play at the same time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Primary Asset Collection - these are stocks I regularly invest in.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Competitor Arenas (Cloud Infrastructure Group) - these are stocks that are competing for Primary Asset Allocation each quarter and receive less allocation.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I own 12 primary companies.

The overarching theme behind these picks is **American Innovation &amp; Mexican Development.** \n\nI'm a 26 year old fintech engineer in the US and an avocado farmer in Mexico and I hold a strong conviction that investing in Mexican development will reward me well in the decades to come.  \n\n**In a nutshell, the USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring and my strategy favors the Texas-Nuevo Leon economy and overall Mexican-American trade.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is Monterrey, Nuevo Leon\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png))\n\n \n\nI'm from a rural village south of Jalisco which produces far more agricultural goods like avocados alongside Michoacan.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very aware of the problems that Mexico faces but I also view Mexico as a sleeping giant that the US utilizes for capital efficiency in global trade.

The economic damage narcotrafficking has delivered has resulted in:\n\n\\- \\[An increasing black market integration into the global money supply, in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars, resulting in a growing vacuum of theft AKA the Drug War &amp; Economics of Peace\\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\\_Secrecy\\_Act#Sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Secrecy_Act#Sanctions))\n\n\\- North American suppressed wage suppression\n\n\\- refugee style illegal immigration\n\n\\- NA workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- Mexican workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- A Mexican workforce and brain drain, as skilled and motivated laborers leave for opportunity and better pay who are loyal to both nations\n\n\\- Multiple events of civil unrest or civil disasters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- National cyncism against the current administration\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see this as a complex problem where most people's perspective is not complete or clouded by one of the reasons above. I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy. It is certainly in a golden era of sorts, and Mexico reflects as a nation in decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# The Economic Framework\n\nI am selecting industries that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Empower the US and have a rippling effect on Mexico\n\n\\- Will fundamentally continue to build and grow the future global supply\n\n\\- Are friendly to primarily German/Euro and Japanese/Asian trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# My Portfolio Structure\n\nThere are two systems at play at the same time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Primary Asset Collection - these are stocks I regularly invest in.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Competitor Arenas (Cloud Infrastructure Group) - these are stocks that are competing for Primary Asset Allocation each quarter and receive less allocation.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I own 12 primary companies.

I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy. It is certainly in a golden era of sorts, and Mexico reflects as a nation in decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# The Economic Framework\n\nI am selecting industries that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Empower the US and have a rippling effect on Mexico\n\n\\- Will fundamentally continue to build and grow the future global supply\n\n\\- Are friendly to primarily German/Euro and Japanese/Asian trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# My Portfolio Structure\n\nThere are two systems at play at the same time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Primary Asset Collection - these are stocks I regularly invest in.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Competitor Arenas (Cloud Infrastructure Group) - these are stocks that are competing for Primary Asset Allocation each quarter and receive less allocation.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I own 12 primary companies.

I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

Thanks to its fintech, the company enables these same businesses to obtain trade finance and engage in global trade, treading where at least 60% of banks and trading companies won\u2019t in a $40 trillion industry.  This first mover aims to address the $1.5 trillion gap in SME trade finance.\n\nBetter yet, this industry disruptor has not only survived the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has thrived.  [Not least because it is based in Singapore, a solid financial hub with robust disease control measures.]\n\nTrade and trade finance will only migrate more and more to the online platform of this [\u201cmost innovative fintech company\u201d in Asia-Pacific](https://d2tyltutevw8th.cloudfront.net/media/document/press-release-the-innovators-2020-regional-winn-1588769601.pdf) (*Global Finance*).\n\nLater this very month, Triterras will enter into a definitive merger agreement with the 7th-ranking special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) on Robinhood\u2019s list of Blank Check Companies: Netfin Acquisition Corp ($NFIN).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8omJ_Hzz08M\n\n**TRANSACTION VALUES**\n\nPublished transaction values are as follows:\n\nPre-money equity value is approximately $670 million.\n\nPost money equity value is approximately $939 million.\n\nProposed enterprise value is approximately $995 million.\n\nTo put things into a conservative perspective:\n\nPre-money equity value to NFIN market cap ratio (7/02): 1.92\n\nPost-money equity value to NFIN market cap ratio (7/02): 2.69\n\nProposed enterprise value to NFIN market cap ratio (7/02): 2.85\n\n**GROWTH PROSPECTS**\n\nWhile already profitable at $87 million EBITDA and $46 million consolidated net income, Triterras is aiming to more than double these two performance measures by the end of their next fiscal year.  Of the $1.5 trillion gap in SME trade finance, it has addressed $4.1 billion, and aims to more than double this by the end of fiscal 2021.  That the company has three modules for its Kratos platform, [two more than the end of calendar 2019](https://www.gtreview.com/news/fintech/blockchain-fintech-triterras-goes-live-with-trade-finance-product-for-smes/), indicates its commitment to developing that platform further as part of its business growth story.\n\nSomething suggests that $NFIN\u2019s proposed enterprise value may be a discount on a growth company.  Its valuation seems to be based on a multiple of fiscal 2019 EBITDA, rather than on a multiple of sales.  It is definitely not based on a multiple of fiscal 2021 sales.\n\nOh, well.  Let that proposed enterprise value stand before the merger.  It just might go noticeably past that in the short term, even after all the equity dilution is said and done.\n\n*Disclosure: Long on $NFIN.*",

SPY holds 257 Billion. If this fund decides to move just .5% out of Microsoft they would be redistributing 1 billion amongst the lower tier stocks. Will they do this? why not? They do it regularly, the question is if enough funds and ETF's do it at once, will it boost some stock and suppress others?\n\nBack to microsoft. SPY had 81 million shares as of yesterday.

Would they boost top holdings right now having such a massive run? if your mandate is to have a diverse portfolio, I doubt it.\n\nThis trend in the SPY ETF reducing holdings over the last year is also true of Apple, and Facebook but not Amazon.\n\nComapnies I like with low weights barring that something crazy with the virus doesn't happen and JPow's printer doesn't get jammed:\n\nCalls on :KO, PFE, INTC,  MMM, RTX",

        "selftext": "TLDR: Is this a good time to start a retirement fund for my parents or should I wait till after election (around January) once the cloud clears? I will max their traditional IRA into 2 etfs (SPY and QQQ) and 3 stocks (MSFT, COST, JNJ).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSituation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheyre in their mid 50s and I will help them manage it.  Jointly, they make about 54k net per year (after taxes, insurance etc) but they dont have any sort of retirement fund/emergency fund currently. They just starting now since we are immigrants and was able to settle down just recently. They have a monthly expense of about $2600 (this includes a mortgage of 30 more years and a car payment of 4 years). They love to work, so they will probably retire in their 70s. Overall, they will have about 1900 per month in saving. My sibling and I are done with college and have our own jobs now. We are still with them but we're financially independent and plan to settle on our once their retirement fund is smooth sailing which will probably increase their monthly expenses to 3000$ since we will be contributing less (we are willing to help them as much as we could so it could stay as it is or hopefully even less depending on our future financial situation). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlan:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth their 401k does not match so I am thinking of starting traditional IRA with schwab. My plan is to max out their traditional IRA (14k combined per year) and focus it into two ETFs (SPY and QQQ) and 3 stocks (MSFT, COST, JNJ). I will DCA equally into 5 on their red days. Overall, they will have 700$ per month left over (after retirement contribution with this plan and expenses) which they can use for leisure...or should I have them contribute some to 401k and/or roth?.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy rationale of starting now is I can have their retirement fund ride the recovery from the pandemic drop (roughly about 1/4 more left to V shape recovery). We can argue that there is another drop (which is very likely) but I am not worried since I am DCAing anyway and I dont think this \"2nd drop\" will be as bad as the first one (especially this election, i dont think the current admin will let this happen). Election aftermath is a different story. I dont know what to expect after election hence this post. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy investment choices rationale: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSPY - Diversified basket\n\nQQQ- Tech heavy growth basket (pandemic proof)\n\nMSFT - Tech growth (pandemic proof)\n\nCOST - retail growth (pandemic proof, arguably)\n\nJNJ - healthcare growth especially post pandemic (I am thinking of omitting this since I also feel this might be a risky choice for a late retirement account). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother route: Have their retirement fund professionally managed. If so where?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am thinking of asking this in other financial sub but my really concern here is my investment choices and timing (which i believe this sub has the best point of view/opinion on); time in the market is better than timing the market but I feel like timing for a late retirement account in this situation is especially important. I dont have much experience with the market (just recently started myself) but my educational background is enough to understand it and its caveats. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

        "selftext": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-02/deutsche-bank-considers-financial-support-for-wirecard-bank-kc4tsbnd\n\nDeutsche Bank AG is weighing the acquisition of all or part of disgraced Wirecard AG\u2019s bank, potentially throwing the business a lifeline after one of the biggest corporate scandals in recent years.\n\nThe Frankfurt-based lender is in touch with regulator BaFin, Wirecard Bank\u2019s management board and administrators on possible further steps to help Wirecard\u2019s finance unit, a Deutsche Bank spokesman said by e-mail, without elaborating. Options include taking on pieces of Wirecard Bank or the unit in its entirety, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the lender is still debating other ways to help Wirecard Bank and hasn\u2019t made a final decision.\n\nDeutsche Bank had informal tie-up talks with the scandal-hit fintech last Spring, though it quickly broke off the preliminary discussions. Wirecard Bank -- which sat at the heart of the firm -- could be valuable to a potential acquirer because of its relationship with credit card companies Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and JCB International, which are also key to other parts of Wirecard.\n\nDeutsche Bank may also be hit if Wirecard Bank were to file for insolvency. Germany\u2019s deposit insurance scheme for private banks would have to make depositors whole if the lender didn\u2019t have enough funds of its own to repay them. That could lead to higher contributions from the scheme members, of which Deutsche Bank is the biggest and highest paying.\n\nWirecard filed for insolvency last week after saying that almost 2 billion euros ($2.25 billion) it previously reported as cash probably never existed, throwing the future of its banking and others businesses into doubt. The company faces a potential avalanche of lawsuits and former Chief Executive Officer Markus Braun was arrested, though he is now out on bail.\n\nWhile Wirecard Bank isn\u2019t part of the bankruptcy proceedings, the parent ceded control of funds last week after the financial regulator stepped in to prevent the money from being deployed elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe are currently reviewing the possibility of providing Wirecard Bank AG with financial support,\u201d Deutsche Bank said. \u201cWe are in principle prepared to provide this support in the context of a continuation of business operations, if such assistance should become necessary.\u201d\n\nInsolvency administrator Michael Jaffe said on Wednesday that the assets he\u2019s trying to sell are attracting interest from numerous investors. He didn\u2019t say whether he intends to sell Wirecard Bank as well, though said the lender remains solvent.\n\nTo fuel its growth, Wirecard had been paying depositors attractive interest at a time when traditional banks increasingly started to pass on negative rates. This year, it began offering a 0.75% interest rate via its Boon app, betting that more deposits will translate into more payments via its systems and lucrative contracts with stores and online merchants.\n\nIn addition to the earlier talks on a possible tie-up, the two financial firms had others links. Deutsche Bank is part of a lending group of 15 banks that together are owed about 1.6 billion euros, Bloomberg has reported. CEO Christian Sewing has been trying to shift the lender away from its reliance on trading income toward a focus on processing payments for companies, and he\u2019s made the division responsible for the business -- known as Corporate Bank -- the centerpiece of his large restructuring plan.\n\nSewing has focused tech investment on the Corporate Bank but he has also said that the division is being challenged by the low interest-rate environment it\u2019s operating in.\n\nThe collapse of Wirecard has prompted criticism of regulators and soul-searching among Germany\u2019s elite grappling for answers over the failure of what was once one of its most lauded companies. BaFin President Felix Hufeld has acknowledged that his institution is among those to blame for not catching the irregularities, which he referred to as \u201cmassive fraud\u201d on Thursday in Frankfurt.",

We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 yesterday and we closed $2.81 - .49 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,325 + 140. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.77 + .17 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "Hello, Redditors,\n\nI have started investing a couple of years back. I had my fair share of gambling with penny stocks and other FOMO stocks. Finally settled on investing only in MSFT, APPL, GOOG, V, AMZN. Other stocks of interest are TSM, BABA, LUV, DIS. I have around 10k to invest, and I have been waiting on the sidelines watching stocks hit bottom in March and back to all-time highs again. And, I have decided to get into the market with the DCA approach. I am planning to buy $500 worth of stocks (fractional stocks - a mix of MSFT, APPL, GOOG, V, AMZN, TSM, LUV) on a weekly basis to hedge against volatility. So, my question is, is there a way to automate the process? Let's say if I want to buy 5 shares (fraction of each MSFT, APPL, GOOG, V, AMZN) I have to make 5 different orders.\n\nAlso, any suggestions my stock picks and DCA, in general, will be highly appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I\u2019m bummed that I didn\u2019t hold any stock long term even though I was an early adopter of AMZN, NFLX etc. and being in tech I knew they were going to be big, even NVDA or SHOP couple years ago. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t want to lose the next 10-15 years. I want to invest in a disciplined way, buy around 20 stocks and then add on dips, So I\u2019ll keep around $100K cash. My big confusion is which 20 stocks to pick? I\u2019ve been reading here, checking TipRanks, have Motley fool advisor and the list I come up with is huge. I\u2019m pasting the symbols that have creeped into my planning spreadsheet below. Also I\u2019m confused whether to buy fewer stocks at higher investment or many at lower. Also whether more investment into the stable large names (MSFT, AMZN, AAPL) or more in relatively newer names (SE, DOCU, NET etc.) I\u2019ve searched many posts on the \u201c20 stock portfolio\u201d or such but my confusion will not go away. Hence I\u2019m posting here to hear from you directly. I\u2019m 42 years old, good stable job, will have $50K more to add to the portfolio every year. I\u2019m open to moderate risk. Help me with a 15-20 stock investment portfolio that I can hold long term and add on dips. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on my spreadsheet right now:\n\nNewer stars 2 yrs: SE, NET, CRWD, CHWY, FSLY, DDOG, TTD, ZS, TWLO, TEAM, SPLK, MDB, WORK, SHOP\n\nETFs: ARKK, ARKW, WCLD, QQQ\n\nPayments or Banks: SQ, PYPL, V, JPM, BAC \n\nBetting: GAN, DKNG, PENN\n\nChips: NVDA, AMD, MU\n\nEnergy: ENPH, NEE, PCG, FANG\n\nHealthcare: LVGO, TDOC, UNH, MOH, DHR, CATS, VEEV, MODN\n\nCovid: HOLX, NVAX, MRNA, INO, IBIO, AYTU, VBIV , TTOO\n\nEVs: TSLA, NIO, WKHS, FUV, GRAF, PLUG\n\nFANG stocks: MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, FB\n\nSocial/Entertain: PINS, NFLX, ROKU\n\nCyber: PANW, ZS, CRWD, NET, PING, FNET, FEYE\n\nBeaten down (1 year recovery): WYNN, LVS, DAL, LUV, STWD, SPG, CAR, MAR, RCL\n\nMy Options are:\n1) Invest $10K into 50 stocks since I can\u2019t choose with all the confusion\n2) Choose 15 stocks and invest $30K each or so \n3) Invest more % in couple categories above like the FANG stocks, ETFs, EVs, and less in others \n4) Buy 100 shares of 15 or so from the above list and sell covered calls getting ~$4K per week (but with the limited upside of covered calls, downside will be the same as holding) \n5) Stay 50% or more cash since the market could crash given the high valuations, pandemic and election year \n6) Something else that you\u2019d do in my shoes",

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy. It is certainly in a golden era of sorts, and Mexico reflects as a nation in decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# The Economic Framework\n\nI am selecting industries that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Empower the US and have a rippling effect on Mexico\n\n\\- Will fundamentally continue to build and grow the future global supply\n\n\\- Are friendly to primarily German/Euro and Japanese/Asian trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# My Portfolio Structure\n\nThere are two systems at play at the same time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Primary Asset Collection - these are stocks I regularly invest in.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Competitor Arenas (Cloud Infrastructure Group) - these are stocks that are competing for Primary Asset Allocation each quarter and receive less allocation.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I own 12 primary companies.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.
