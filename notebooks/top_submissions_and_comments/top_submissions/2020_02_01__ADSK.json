        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](an12mdnw2ee41)\n\nMy start was back in July; I had heard of options from my autistic friends at a summer camp, considered the potential upside they described, then gave one of them my paycheck to Yolo into DAL calls several days before the earnings report came out.  I made $16 from investing $80, which the easiest money I had ever made. \n\nJump to August when I open an account and pour $700 into a single ADSK call day before earnings. LOL dumbass to the stars over here lost $600 because ADSK fell 10 f\\*\\*king percent post-market. Died a little. Irrationally &amp; with little research began yoloing in hopes to gain back what I had lost. Come to it 2 months later down -$1100 relentless mocking red every time I opened the app. \n\nDown to the last $1800 to my name (being that I'm a high school student.) Finally do research, self teach. Take a week to figure shit out and jump back on the wagon. At this point, I am a walking (options basics) Investopedia page ready to find a company and hit it big. Lost another $1100 three weeks. Crippling regret brings me to yolo the last of it into calls for SNAP a company I had been following and doing DD on. MFW it actually works and hit a gap up in the following week. From $700 to $1200, then $2300. By this time it's mid-December and I'm 100% in SNAP calls every week. December 30th and I'm finally at a net positive, $4,600 (give or take.) I invest it all 31st before the new year and market open on Jan 2nd mark my first huge profit and the beginning of (probably the most lucrative month of my life) my tendies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kept in SNAP calls until about JAN 14th when news broke of the novel coronavirus. At this point, I'm at +$52,000. The Friday before the 24th I go bearish (hey, tendies are tendies no matter how you get them) 17k into SPY puts. The market opens &amp; HELLO SIX FIGURES!! Continue to short the market and brings me to my current situation. \n\nI hope this story gives you hope in these tough times. Forgive my Bearish sins :(",
