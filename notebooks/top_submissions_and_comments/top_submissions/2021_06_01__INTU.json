        "selftext": "Wassup shitheads,\n\nThis isn't financial advice or investing advice at all.\n\nIt's time to grab some freeze-dried bananas cause we are about to go to the fucking moon and you can't have conventional bananas up there.\n\nSoFi is an all-in-one digital banking app. What started as a student loan financer has developed quickly into a one-stop-shop for your financial needs. Want to invest in stocks? SoFi's app allows you to do that. Need a personal loan because you YOLO'd your life savings and just got margin called? Okay, you degenerate. SoFi's got you covered. Debit Cards? Credit Cards? Yep. Yep. \n\nOkay so now that we got through what the app is, let's get into the nitty-gritty of their performance.\n\n**The Good**\n\nNet Revenue saw 151% YoY growth\n\nMember growth is seeing it's 7th consecutive quarters of accelerating YoY Growth. \nCurrently, they are at 2.2 Million users **with a 110% YoY growth**\n\nTotal Products saw a **121% YoY growth, their financial service products saw a 273% YoY growth.**\n\nIf you're too smooth-brained to understand so far, they are gaining a shit ton of people and those people are using their products and printing their money. \n\nGalileo Accounts saw a **130% YoY growth**\nWhat are Galileo accounts? I'm so fucking happy you asked you beautiful smooth brain\n\nSoFi acquired Galileo, which is a really fucking nerdy SaaS that handles transactions. They handle direct deposits, transfers, bill paying, checking balances, etc. \nMeaning not only is SoFi acting as a fintech for consumers, but they are also a SaaS for businesses. Fuck Robinhood, but they are one of Galileo's customers. \n\nThey are EBITDA positive!?\n\n**The Leadership Team**\nI would be remiss to not mention the leadership team.\nCEO - Anthony \"motherfuckin\" Noto\nA quick breakdown of that guys life.\nGoldman Sachs associate turned partner because of his understanding of the internet industry.\nInterim CFO of the NFL.\nCOO of Twitter.\nCEO of SoFi.\nThink about it, the COO of twitter is now the CEO of a fintech that has the EXACT SAME DEMOGRAPHICS AS TWITTER.\nTHIS GUY FUCKS.\n\nChief Marketing Officer - Lauren Webb\nPreviously the Marketing VP at Intuit - Intuit owns TurboTax, Mint, and Quickbooks \nBefore that she was the Senior Brand Manager for COVERGIRL\n\nHead of Brand Strategy previously worked at a brand strategy firm, where he was the lead brand strategist for taco bell and PlayStation.\n\n**Previous Valuations**\n2015 - 1B Valuation from Softbank\n2019 - 4.6B Valuation from Qatar Investments\n2021 - 8.6B Valuation from Social Capital. Yes, I know about Chammath and we will talk about that.\n\n**The Bad**\nWith every bull there is as bear that wants to take your lunch money. In this case, there are actually a bunch of bears.\n\nThere are currently no short shares available because of how much this stock is shorted. It's fucking nuts so proceed with extreme caution. I'm not stupid though so I am not going to tell you a short squeeze, even though last Friday there was a 260% short interest rate. There won't be a short squeeze tho cause dilution and all that shit.\n\nChamath - Look I hate this guy as much as the next but think about it. CLOV was a company that needed to go public through a SPAC. I honestly think that SoFi didn't need to go through a SPAC. and honestly SPCE is cool but this is the only actual investment worth investing in with Chamath's portfolio. Again this is not investing advice.\n\nTL;DR\nThe short bus is leaving, get in while you can. SoFi is legit\nPositions \n34 Shares\n20c 6/4\n22.5 c 7/16\n20c 1/21/22",
