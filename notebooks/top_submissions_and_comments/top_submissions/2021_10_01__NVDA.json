        "selftext": "Do you know about AAPL, the original cult stock?\n\nWell, it\u2019s now the largest company in the world.\n\nThe AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. \n\nDIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant.\n\nLet's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to r/pcmasterrace or other similar places, the cult vibe is relentless and unending. Their only position being: INTC and Epic(private company) bad. AMD, NVDA, Valve daddies good.\n\nAnd look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult!\n\nOf course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE.\n\nCult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical.\n\nI am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC.\n\nAMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.\ud83d\ude02\nINTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction.\n\nBut does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals.\n\nIt\u2019s supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think).\n\nAlso, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevator valuation is highly likely.\n\n\nNow, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything?\nIf the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. \n(I am not saying you shouldn\u2019t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult)\n\nAs long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely.\n\nWith all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter.\n\nTL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults.",

        "selftext": "Intel Reaffirms: Our Discrete GPUs Will Be On Shelves in Q1 2022\n\n&gt;there\u2019s one little tidbit in the earnings presentation about its upcoming new discrete GPU offerings. The earnings are usually a chance to wave the flag of innovation about what\u2019s to come, and this time around Intel is confirming that its first-generation discrete graphics with the Xe-HPG architecture will be on shelves in Q1 2022.\n\n&gt;The fundamental building block of Alchemist is the Xe Core. For manufacturing, Intel is turning to TSMC\u2019s N6 process to do it. Given Intel\u2019s Q1\u201922 release timeframe, Intel\u2019s Alchemist GPUs will almost certainly be the most advanced consumer GPUs on the market with respect to manufacturing technology. Alchemist will be going up against AMD\u2019s Navi 2x chips built on N7, and NVIDIA\u2019s Ampere GA10x chips built on Samsung 8LPP. That said, as AMD can attest to, there\u2019s more to being competitive in the consumer GPU market than just having a better process node. In conjunction with the use of TSMC\u2019s N6 process, Intel is reporting that they\u2019ve improved both their power efficiency (performance-per-watt) and their clockspeeds at a given voltage by 50% compared to Xe-LP. Note that this is the sum total of all of their improvements \u2013 process, logic, circuit, and architecture \u2013 so it\u2019s not clear how much of this comes from the jump to TSMC N6 from Intel 10SF, and how much comes from other optimizations.\n\n&gt;The Q1 launch window puts CES (held the first week of January) as a good spot to say something more.\n\n\n Source:\n\nhttps://www.anandtech.com/show/17026/intel-reaffirms-our-discrete-gpus-will-be-on-shelves-in-q1-2022",

        "selftext": " Question for you all - Do you think it\u2019s worth investing in AI stocks right now? I know the \u201cship has already sailed\u201d for big ones like Nvidia or Google, but since coming across [this article](https://frontierresearch.com/artificial-intelligence), I feel like maybe the biggest returns are still ahead of us, especially for certain smaller cap companies?\n\nFrankly speaking, it\u2019s frightening how far we\u2019ve gone from doing things manually to relying on AI in almost every industry. So while a bunch of AI related stocks blew up over the past 5-ish years (NVDA, TSLA, etc.), it feels like there are some emerging markets that will use AI even more.\n\nFor example, the article talks about collaborative robots (think: Amazon\u2019s warehouse robots), self-driving cars, drones, smart cities, etc. all seeing substantial growth. I\u2019m skeptical that all of those technologies will play out, but surely if even one of them does, that\u2019s another $trillion+ TAM?\n\nAnyways, my question is, should I be investing in AI stocks right? I want to hear more feedback since I haven\u2019t seen the other side of the coin yet. Personally, I\u2019m leaning towards yes because I feel like AI\u2019s possibilities are just getting started.",

        "selftext": " The **Semiconductor Sector** has generated more than just solid gains so far this year, chip shortage has helped accelerate sales of semiconductors, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing.  \nIn the last couple of weeks, I thought about adding a Semiconductor company to my portfolio, I decided to focus on AMD, NVIDIA, and INTEL, but because it might be a long post I decided to post in parts, the next post will be bot AMD so stay tuned.\n\n**If you think there is a company in this sector more worthwhile looking into, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions.**\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: youtube - cha cha video](https://preview.redd.it/avit8vg2dgr71.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a7f6bd2f815eaffa877381a845b1f0061e66ccb)\n\n#  Nvidia ~ $NVDA\n\n&gt;\"Nvidia is a platform story. We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today\" - Wells Fargo analyst\n\nNvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021.\n\n# Q2 Earnings\n\nAlmost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue \u2014 all those RTX 30 series graphics cards \u2014 hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates.\n\n# Crypto Market dependence\n\nWhen of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company\u2019s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs.\n\nFor Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell **$400 million** worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just **$266 million.**\n\n# Future Growth In the Gaming Segment\n\nNVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates\u00a0that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. \n\n# Arm Deal\n\nNvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it.\n\n# Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD\n\nAMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record\u00a050% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech](https://preview.redd.it/faswa7u5dgr71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99fdf6382da174aa1c34fff4ffb72dab7abaa7f2)\n\n#  Q2 Earnings And Growth\n\nOn July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform \"Steam\" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded\u00a030%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market.\n\n[ AMD website - q2 Financial results](https://preview.redd.it/jjeh28b8dgr71.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1194ec52ebd44ff97c9ae9686ff69f63d4787d4b)\n\n#  Video Games Potential Growth\n\nVideo game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from\u00a0last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected\u00a0to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected\u00a0to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024.\n\n**AMD** supplies\u00a0semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for **Nintendo**'s Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell\u00a025.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022.\n\n# Xilinx Acquisition\n\nAMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx\u00a0is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly.\n\n# Intel ~ $INTC\n\nIntel\u2019s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It\u2019s struggled with R&amp;D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%.\n\nIntel fell behind **TSMC** in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to **AMD** in PC and data center CPU markets.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL](https://preview.redd.it/sxqjttladgr71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b541cb7bc838e7c7ddb580196ebc1e085bedce22)\n\n#  New CEO = New Future?\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia.\n\nIf Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again.\n\n# GPUs War\n\nIntel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from **Nvidia** and **AMD**, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.\n\n# Financial Comparisons\n\n[Market Size](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Market%20Cap?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit)\n\n1.

Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***Personal note:*** *Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.*\n\n**Sources:**  \n[Jika.io](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Revenue?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit) \\- Companies comparisons  \n[Motleyfool.com](https://motleyfool.com/) \\- stocks news  \n[nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com/) \\- news and information  \n[amd.com](https://amd.com/) \\- investor relations  \n[investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/) \\- investor relations",

Cant just endlessly say Intel is terrible.\n\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-core-i5-12600k-cpu-faster-than-ryzen-5-5600x-blows-away-rocket-lake-core-i9-11900k-leaked-benchmarks/\n\n&gt;The performance benchmarks show the Intel Core i5-12600K blasting up the single-core test with a score of 773 points and the multi-core test with 7220 points. This puts the Core i5 Alder Lake at a massive 50% lead over the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and even faster than AMD's 8 core and 16 thread Ryzen 7 5800X which is very impressive. Versus the leaked Core i5-12400 benchmarks, the Core i5-12600K offers a 45% increase in multi-threaded performance which means that those E-cores are being used properly plus the higher clock speeds really push the performance even further. Even Intel's Rocket Lake flagship couldn't keep up with the new Core i5 chip which ends up 13% faster in single and 10% faster in the multi-core tests.\n\n&gt;Now think about it this way, you are essentially getting slightly better performance than the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, a $400 US+ chip, in a processor that costs $30 US lower than the Ryzen 5 5600X. It sounds like an absolutely phenomenal deal. Obviously, there are a few drawbacks which include investing in a brand new platform and migrating to a new OS platform (Windows 11 in this case) which would raise the cost and effort but if you set your mind aside from these short-term concerns, the Core i5-12600K could end up serving you far better performance at an insane value proposition. Furthermore, it is also stated that owing to the 12600K being segmented in the Core i5 lineup, its power consumption and thermals won't be as rampant as the high-end models.",

        "selftext": "Below is a list of what I consider possible bullish sectors/industries in the next 3-12 months. We all know of the supply chain issues, the semiconductor shortages, worker shortages, &amp; inflation issues. As a result I'm considering these sectors/industries as possible bullish options in the next 3-12 Months. Please understand that I know that I did not get all stocks in each category. So if you're favored stock isn't listed, don't get angry, post it in the comments below. And if you feel I missed a sector, please let me know. \n\n.\n\n**1)** **Inelastic &amp; Fairly inelastic Industries:** (*Meaning people usually pay for the good or service no matter what the price \"insensitive to changes in price or income\"*) \n\n* Pharmaceuticals (With highly used patented meds for diseases &amp; illnesses)\n* Oil/Gas/Natural Gas (No matter how scarce it gets, people will buy it)\n* Energy (Be careful, many producers of electricity are heavily regulated)\n\n**2) Agriculture/Farm Equipment/Fertilizers/Farm Chemicals:** People got to eat ... and have you seen the price of softs futures? This will incentivize farmers to produce more which in turn will require more farm equipment, farm construction, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, seeds, chemicals etc. It does not help that food is rotting on the docks right now &amp; people are panic buying.\n\n* **Examples:** YTEN, TITN, NTR, SANW, DE, DOLE, ANDE, CLXT, ADM, CLXT, AGRO, AGCO, ADM, LMNR, TWI, ADM, BG, CALM, GRWG, HYFM, FMC, MEOH, \n\n**3) Semiconductors, Passive Semiconductors, &amp; Electronic Components:** Semiconductors are suffering due to worker shortages &amp; supply chain issues. However demand is seriously backed up. As soon as the supply chain situation gets straightened out expect semiconductors to explode.\n\n* **Examples:** NVDA, INTC, ARCB, AMKR, MU AMD, TXN, VSH, STM, ASYS, WOLF, TSM, QCOM, ON, ASML, NXP, AMAT, AVGO, LRCX, SWKS, MRVL, KLAC, MCHP, QRVO, SSNLF, DIOD\n\n**4) Shipping/Bulk Transportation/Freight/Transportation Services:** Shipping / Bulk Transportation / Freight / Transportation Services / are more in demand now than ever before in US history. In fact these services are in so much demand that they're clogging up the ports. And while ships sitting off the coast are likely loosing money as the supply chain issues worsen, you can bet they'll explode with business for pint up demand as the situation unwinds. \n\n* **Examples:** ZIM, JBHT, NSC, TNK, TGP, CNI, CMRE, REVG, DAC, SB, HTZZ, GRIN, ODFL, ASC, EDRY, XPO, SBLK, FWRD, BEST, CPLP, MATX, SAIA, INSW, GASS, PATI, PSHG, NETI, PXS, ULH, USDP, TFII, KNOP, KNX, CHRW, GLOP, EDRY, CVLG, PAC, HUBG, EDRY, MRTN, GLNG, NMM, HMLP, BEST, CPLP, DESP, HTLD, PWFL, GOGL, EGLE, SHIP, ZTO, LSTR, WERN, USAK, ESEA, GNK, CICOY, OROVY, PCFBY, CSX, DSX, MMLP,  PANL, KEX, NAT, UNP, WJRYY\n\n**5)** **Chemicals:** Agriculture chemicals, industrial chemicals, construction chemicals, drilling chemicals, textile chemicals, take your pick. The worlds manufacturers do not run without chemicals of some sort. And once supply chain issues are put behind us &amp; workers start to fill these empty job seats, you can bet that increased production will ramp up the demand for industrial chemicals. \n\n* **EXAMPLES:** HUN, OLN, DOW, LYB, EMN, GLTC, KRO, UNVR, CBT, MEOH, APD, OEC, VHI, ODC, TREC, TROX, IOSP, DD, KOP, ALB, LAC, PPG\n\n**6) Staffing Firms:** There's a massive worker shortage &amp; those positions will need to be filled. You can bet staffing firms are in high demand.\n\n* **EXAMPLES:** DLHC, CCRN, KFY, CBRE, HQI, RHI, WDAY, NSP, HSII, RGP, TBI, KFRC, \n\n**7) Inferior goods:** Ever notice how demand for some products go up when prices rise? These are generally inferior goods. Ramen Noodles &amp; Mac&amp;Cheese are a few examples. Dollar Stores are filled with inferior goods. \n\n* DG, DLTR, WMT, ROST, KHC",

Update 3 post available here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Before I start the actual post: A VERY BIG TIP to anyone who is just now reading this, please take the time to go over the previous posts by reading the actual post along with all comments if possible. Most questions you may have will most likely have been answered already in some kind of form.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6q5g5wb9ivq71.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=673cf9abb57424f7b312b3f8265a3a5c3e303227\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to focus more on this post by sharing my own trading rules, and give a little more guidance on how to approach trading (or at least the way I personally like to scalp trade).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDown to the formalities first: As you can see, I took a few trades since my last update. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother proof for those who aren't as strong and need \"validation\" for their own trading performance. You can always blame other people or other factors in your life, but UNTIL THE MOMENT YOU REALIZE and UNDERSTAND/ACCEPT that it's all on you, you won't make it far in what we all like to call \"trading\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI intentionally used \"BLEW UP\" in the post title. Hehe. I mean, I did literally blow up the account, on a positive note :) . I just gotta have some fun with trading or making these types of reddit posts online sometimes. I also did take a few losing trades and some days even ended in the red. Small red days do not personally bother me. I view trading as a game that has no actual end goal. The ultimate reason or motivation is to be in this game forever, growing your profits AND experience over time. \n\nYes, I admit it would have been nice to boast with a 90+ win rate accuracy for a little bit longer, but on a grand scheme of things, the important part is to be able to illustrate consistence and to be overall profitable over a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm up approx. $3,121 on my (rounded up) $2,500 account. That means I'm up 124.8% on the account 6 weeks into this publicly shared journey. On average you can say I basically made somewhere around $520 per week from scalp trading. I've provided plenty of screenshots (Tradersync - journaling system) to give you a better idea of my personal trading style.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill this continue? I don't know the answer to that. \n\nWhat I do know is that I love this style of trading. I also know that I don't have a problem taking losing trades, let alone stop trading after a small losing trade only to \"close\" the day in the red. \n\nEgo, overconfidence and most importantly wrong mindset can and will cause you to lose in this game. Any trader, who can understand that, can be in this game forever. I view this as part of having a trading edge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reaction I received from the community, especially after POST 3, was very overwhelming. I have tried my best to keep up with questions, answering, and spending some additional extra time on reddit chat requests where possible. Some asked about my OWN trading rules, so I thought I'd take the time with this update to share them and hope that you can make all, some or none part of your own or refine based on your own needs. I repeat these rules to myself every day, especially before entering my first trade of the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Trade small and accumulate experience/profits over time**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Pay yourself frequently**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- When realizing losing trade, ask yourself if you truly want to continue trading for the day**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- If you feel the need to continue trading, scale back to 1-lot trades (see rule #1 if you will)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Trade what you see, not what can or will be**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's it. Simple right? Just like trading should be. Takes very little time to go over these rules each day in the morning. They keep me sharp with having a proper mindset. They make me not enter the market with a directional bias. I don't know if these rules will help you in any way. I just know they help me. Each and every day pretty much. The rest comes from trading experience and having a large number of completed trades in your reservoir.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have traded the past 6 weeks, you probably know how easy or difficult it was. Trading in itself is actually easy, the mechanics that is. The difficult part is to follow your trading plan. If you cannot follow it you may as well take time working on those things while trading small to continue your learning curve/experience. That learning curve that you start to acquire by having plenty of screen time, should mirror the consistency and profitability over time. It should steadily be in an up-trend. There is nothing wrong with taking your time. I mean it. You don't need to rush or aim for home-run trades. They will happen every so often. You need to focus on sticking to that plan (accept losing trades when they do occur) and live to trade another day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am including some screenshots of my NFLX, NVDA and as a bonus AAPL chart. Look at all three of them and honestly ask yourself what you see (these same thoughts I do have when I glance at each of these charts for a split second before deciding if there is a trading opportunity or not). I added AAPL to the list eventhough I didn't trade it today because I feel I missed out on it. It's no big deal, I still made plenty off NFLX and NVDA for the time spent in my trades, but I thought it might serve you greatly as another example.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it up trending?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it down trending?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow small or large are the candles?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf a strong candle is taken out on the next candle (learn engulfing candles if you want), do I want to be part of a potential trading opportunity? If so, how large of a position/risk do I want to enter on this trade?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan I be wrong? \n\nHow can I be wrong? Candle immediately canceling each other out would be confirmation for you to BAIL on the trade for instance. There is no need to hold and pray for reversal. You have the power to enter a trade, and you have the power to exit a trade. This is what's great for retail traders. Large institutions have a little bit more trouble moving large amounts of capital around on their positions. You just, as a retail trader, simply want to be part of a larger move and be on the right side. BUT remember, if price action tells you you're wrong, you follow your trading plan and exit and wait for another opportunity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis week alone confirmed my trading style again to me on a personal level. I can have losing trades as long as I accept them in a proper way. I can still end up profitable for the week which is my ultimate goal. Looking back at all the trades in the past 6 weeks on this account, the losing trades DO not matter or bother me. You need to view trading as a long-term game. You want to boost your trading confidence by gaining that trading experience (both winning trades AND losing trades alike) so you can look forward to the next months and years of trading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nu5b858civq71.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39720b3b52db73d42036abebc4410f9579870e92\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/csxl570divq71.png?width=1145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5b327cd06201fc204c54ddc689939a71f2c7846\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvhxvtudivq71.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eac522ef2b6c937e7acc3123416883dd8f5dab96",

        "selftext": "**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation AND Analysis (Q3 Week 3) - $AAPL, $FB, $AMD, $MSFT, $SHOP, $AMZN, $GOOG and More**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' bull gang, hope you\u2019re all doing well! Our free money glitch remained unpatched for another update, allowing many of us to pull clean double baggers across the board. God bless $SNAP. With all of big tech set to report this week, it could prove to be more lucrative than the last. We\u2019ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We\u2019ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let\u2019s get into it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Jetblue is inefficiently priced.** Historically Jetblue moves roughly **4%** post earnings (inline with all the other American airlines),  yet this quarter, the options are pricing in a move of roughly **10%**. If we sell straddles or strangles, we can collect this extremely inflated premium with very little risk on our end. I looked into the entire sector as a whole since I planned on trading it last week, and I came across nothing that would\u2019ve fundamentally caused this spike in volatility in airlines, or Jetblue specifically. The odds are awesome on this trade, and I plan or robbing some gamblers next week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Twitter is inefficiently priced. Avoid it.** Historical move of **6.5%**, priced move of **11%** - on paper, this trade gives us insane edge, but I\u2019m still not touching it, as we saw what happened with $SNAP on Thursday. Although Twitter dropped 5% as the market tried to price $AAPL\u2019s privacy policy in, I don\u2019t feel like taking on additional risk because the fundamentals have shifted right before its\u2019 earnings. Normally I would take this trade 10/10 times simply from a pure numbers standpoint, but I\u2019m not as confident anymore because of the added volatility created by $SNAP. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Oil stocks tend to experience Post Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD).** PEAD is the phenomenon where a stocks price will drift in the direction of an earnings surprise for several weeks following an earnings announcement. If a stock beats, it will continue to grind up for weeks following the ER report, and vice versa if it misses. This is especially true among oil stocks - check the charts if you don\u2019t believe me. The best way to play oil this quarter would be to capitalize on this effect, and do **monthly** call or put debit spreads based on the results that come out Friday. To those curious, standard weekly options provide no edge at the time of writing, so it\u2019s best not to gamble this time round.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** If you\u2019re bullish on big tech, look to long $QQQ this week to alter your risk exposure and bag some safer gains. If you\u2019re bearish on oil, look to short $XLE instead of any of the individual companies for an added safety net. If you think $AMD is gonna knock it out of the park, look to play $NVDA or $SOXL instead. There\u2019s lot\u2019s of opportunities for collateral plays this week, and I\u2019ve just barely scratched the surface. If you wish to learn more about collateral plays, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!  If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",

The other side of the spectrum is the number jobs and steel balls of wsb. How do you make money in the stock market as another source of income.

Is it wrong to be buying and selling short term stocks and ETFs to make additional income. I g t the sense the only way to make money is sticking it in something safe and not touching it until you're 65 because taxes work out better or putting everything into some crazy stock and hoping it doubles and you make crwzyoneu and simply pay the taxes and not worry about it.\n\nMy job and future job life wages won't ever help me live a comfortable life so how do you make additional income in the stock market?\n\nI'm always tempted to put a couple Gran in stuff like Nvidia, tech, etc but with the stock market being basically unpredictable and over valued??

        "selftext": "**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Q3 Week 2) - $TSLA, $NFLX, $SNAP, $INTC, $CLF, $AAL, $VZ, $NUE and More**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' bull gang, hope you're ready for week two of earnings! This week is jam packed with companies reporting within highly volatile sectors, the most notable being steel and airlines, so keep an eye out for those! Alongside those, we've got a handful of boomer blue-chips pulling through, as well as the Netflix, who got relegated from FAANG in favour of Nvidia. There's a lot of money to be made this week, especially with [*collateral plays*](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays), so make sure you've brushed up on those concepts if you haven't already! Let's get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Snapchat is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $SNAP has had an average post earnings move of **17%**. At the time of writing, the options chain is pricing in a move of only **10%**. This priced move will ***shrink*** as we progress through the week since theta will decay the contracts, meaning we\u2019ll likely have a priced move closer to **8%** the day before the ER. Snapchat has ***never*** moved less than 6% post earnings since IPO, meaning that If you're gambling on this one, the odds are really in your favour. 6% minimum historical move, 17% average move, 8% priced move - The risk reward profile of this trade almost seems too good to be true. We ran this exact trade last quarter and made a huge bag, so I\u2019m really hoping we get to abuse this free money glitch again come Thursday. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Netflix is inefficiently priced.** Same deal as $SNAP, just not as good. Netflix usually moves 8%, but options are only pricing in 5%. I don\u2019t like this play as much as $SNAP since a straddle will run you over three grand, and that\u2019s not exactly gambling money. Regardless, those with huge accounts and even bigger balls may opt to run this trade.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Airline stocks aren\u2019t priced properly (yet).** Delta Airlines tanked 5% post ER last week, resulting in the rest of the airlines also tanking 5%. $DAL closed the week down 6%, while the rest of the airlines recovered, ultimately closing out the week flat / slightly negative. This indicates to me that airlines aren\u2019t priced properly at all - Delta had an amazing ER and put out some banger numbers, but tanked despite that due to the concerns in rising fuel prices. Rising fuel prices will end up plaguing ***all airlines***, not just $DAL exclusively, meaning that unless the airlines put up mind-blowing numbers (which are also better than the insane numbers $DAL put up), **a downward move is likely imminent.** I\u2019m genuinely shocked that the other airline stocks recovered throughout the week despite the headwinds they\u2019ll all inevitably face during their ERs this week. Keep in mind, I could be entirely wrong about this move - we\u2019ve seen time and time again that the market is extremely irrational.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** As displayed by the airlines last week (and hopefully later this week), stocks within the same sector tend to move together. If we\u2019re bullish or bearish on airlines, we can look to long or short $JETS, as almost all of its holding report earnings this week. The IV on $JETS is half that of the reporting tickers, meaning we\u2019ll get huge gains on a relatively small move. Most of the steel sector also reports this week! We can look to long or short the entirety of steel earnings by playing $X or $MT since we\u2019ll see a comparable move in those tickers as well, but won\u2019t get IV crushed. More information on these types of plays can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them this week, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",

        "selftext": "Over the past couple of months I\u2019ve been hearing a lot about the metaverse. It\u2019s a new concept to me, but from what I understand it\u2019s used to refer to the next level virtual environments. It\u2019s mostly used in the context of full virtual reality and replicating real life virtually. It\u2019s a fascinating concept for me, but there aren't really many first hand sources on the topic. \n\nI did some digging and found this [post](https://fincredibletranscripts.substack.com/p/fincredible-macrotalk-august-25-the) by Fincredible regarding the topic. It basically sums up what Mark Zuckerberg and other CEO\u2019s have said about the metaverse, including their own definition, use cases, monetization, etc. It\u2019s really interesting. \n\nHere\u2019s three quotes I consider most relevant:\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO: \u201cSo what is the metaverse? It's a virtual environment. We can be present with people in digital spaces. And you can kind of think about this as an embodied Internet that you're inside of rather than just looking at. And we believe that this is going to be the successor to the mobile Internet\u2026.  Within the metaverse, you're going to be able to hang out, play games with friends, work, create and more\u2026. The defining quality of the metaverse is presence, which is this feeling that you're really there with another person or in another place.\u201d \n\nJen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA CEO: \u201cThe Omniverse is essentially an overlay of the Internet and overlay of the physical world is going to fuse all these different worlds together long term\u2026 And so I'm fairly sure that at this point, that Omniverse or the metaverse is going to be a new economy that is larger than our current economy.\u201d\n\nJohn S. Riccitiello, Unity CEO: \u201cJust as digital replaced analog, HD replaced standard definition, in the coming year, 5G will place 3G or 4G, and real-time 3D will replace linear and flat 2D digital content\u2026 We don't think that one company will represent the metaverse as, say, for example, it was imagined in Ready Player One. We believe there's going to be hundreds of thousands of destinations in the metaverse.\n\nThis is a fascinating topic for me, but I have my doubts about how it will work out. \n\nThoughts?",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 5, 2021**\n\nVolatility in the stock market continues, with the three major indexes, particularly the Nasdaq (QQQ), reversing hard after suffering one of its worst days all year, with Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) leading the charge. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington and wait for upcoming economic and earnings data to gauge concerns over supply chain disruptions and inflation. Tech stocks once again came under pressure as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continues to rise. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.04% higher, the Nasdaq closed 1.35% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closing 0.92% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed, closing just 0.35% higher.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen previous episodes of rising rates, both earlier this year as well as when the Fed first announced intentions to begin tapering quantitative easing in the not too distant future. Each of these episodes caused a hiccup but didn\u2019t derail the broader bull market. According to Edward Jones, yields went from below 1% to 1.75% during the first three months of this year, a period that included pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500 of 3.7% for four days and 4.2% for 12 days. However, during that entire three-month stretch in which rates were rising, the stock market rose more than 7%.  In this current spate, 10-year rates have jumped from 1.30% on September 15 to as high as 1.54% last week, reflecting a renewed concern over inflation pressures and reduced Fed stimulus expectations\n\nStocks are struggling to regain their footing after the September selloff, given that many of the concerns that sparked last month\u2019s drop remain. Congressional lawmakers have yet to come to an agreement on a solution to raise the debt limit to prevent a potential government default sometime mid-October. Failure to do so would be catastrophic for the US economy.  As a reminder, Congress successfully averted a government shutdown last week. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it as early as this week Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown.\n\nLooking ahead, the September Jobs Report will be released later this week. Market participants are hoping to see payroll gains accelerate after a shockingly disappointing August report, which shoed just 235,000 new payrolls gains versus more than 700,000 expected. Consensus economists anticipate that 475,000 payrolls returned in September, and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.1% or the lowest since March 2020.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* According to Facebook (FB), yesterday\u2019s nearly six-hour outage was caused by a mistake during a routine maintenance on how internet data routed through its network. Here is a blog by the company [https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/)\n* Despite broad weakness in tech in recent weeks, shares of Netflix (NFLX) have been on fire, with the company breaking previous ATH twice in the last five days. Perhaps, could be attributed to the immense popularity of \u201cSquid Game\u201d, which has become the company\u2019s most popular show in less than a month. I watched it, it lives up to the hype.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) unveiled a new version of its flagship operating system today, with the company debuting Windows 11. Here is a WSJ article about the features [https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-released-windows-11-but-should-you-upgrade-11633453762?mod=wsj\\_RHF](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-released-windows-11-but-should-you-upgrade-11633453762?mod=wsj_RHF)\n* Today, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen gave testimony before the Senate exposing FB\u2019s business practices and calling for more stringent regulation of the company.\n* The price of ... topped $50k again and up 25% this week\n* Three top US hedge funds, Man Group, Elliot Management, Marshall Wace, and Soros Fund Management, who combined manage roughly $200b in assets, have warned that Chinese businesses have become \u201cuninvestable\u201d amid the anti-monopoly scandal, power shortages and Evergrande situation.

        "selftext": "Below is a list of what I consider possible bullish sectors/industries in the next 3-12 months. We all know of the supply chain issues, the semiconductor shortages, worker shortages, &amp; inflation issues. As a result I'm considering these sectors/industries as possible bullish options in the next 3-12 Months. Please understand that I know that I did not get all stocks in each category. So if you're favored stock isn't listed, don't get angry, post it in the comments below. And if you feel I missed a sector, please let me know.\n\n.\n\n**1)** **Inelastic &amp; Fairly inelastic Industries:** (*Meaning people usually pay for the good or service no matter what the price \"insensitive to changes in price or income\"*)\n\n* Pharmaceuticals (With highly used patented meds for diseases &amp; illnesses)\n* Oil/Gas/Natural Gas (No matter how scarce it gets, people will buy it)\n* Energy (Be careful, many producers of electricity are heavily regulated)\n\n**2) Agriculture/Farm Equipment/Fertilizers/Farm Chemicals:** People got to eat ... and have you seen the price of softs futures? This will incentivize farmers to produce more which in turn will require more farm equipment, farm construction, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, seeds, chemicals etc. It does not help that food is rotting on the docks right now &amp; people are panic buying.\n\n* **Examples:** YTEN, TITN, NTR, SANW, DE, DOLE, ANDE, CLXT, ADM, CLXT, AGRO, AGCO, ADM, LMNR, TWI, ADM, BG, CALM, GRWG, HYFM, FMC, MEOH,\n\n**3) Semiconductors, Passive Semiconductors, &amp; Electronic Components:** Semiconductors are suffering due to worker shortages &amp; supply chain issues. However demand is seriously backed up. As soon as the supply chain situation gets straightened out expect semiconductors to explode.\n\n* **Examples:** NVDA, INTC, ARCB, AMKR, MU AMD, TXN, VSH, STM, ASYS, WOLF, TSM, QCOM, ON, ASML, NXP, AMAT, AVGO, LRCX, SWKS, MRVL, KLAC, MCHP, QRVO, SSNLF, DIOD\n\n**4) Shipping/Bulk Transportation/Freight/Transportation Services:** Shipping / Bulk Transportation / Freight / Transportation Services / are more in demand now than ever before in US history. In fact these services are in so much demand that they're clogging up the ports. And while ships sitting off the coast are likely loosing money as the supply chain issues worsen, you can bet they'll explode with business for pint up demand as the situation unwinds.\n\n* **Examples:** ZIM, JBHT, NSC, TNK, TGP, CNI, CMRE, REVG, DAC, SB, HTZZ, GRIN, ODFL, ASC, EDRY, XPO, SBLK, FWRD, BEST, CPLP, MATX, SAIA, INSW, GASS, PATI, PSHG, NETI, PXS, ULH, USDP, TFII, KNOP, KNX, CHRW, GLOP, EDRY, CVLG, PAC, HUBG, EDRY, MRTN, GLNG, NMM, HMLP, BEST, CPLP, DESP, HTLD, PWFL, GOGL, EGLE, SHIP, ZTO, LSTR, WERN, USAK, ESEA, GNK, CICOY, OROVY, PCFBY, CSX, DSX, MMLP,  PANL, KEX, NAT, UNP, WJRYY\n\n**5)** **Chemicals:** Agriculture chemicals, industrial chemicals, construction chemicals, drilling chemicals, textile chemicals, take your pick. The worlds manufacturers do not run without chemicals of some sort. And once supply chain issues are put behind us &amp; workers start to fill these empty job seats, you can bet that increased production will ramp up the demand for industrial chemicals.\n\n* **EXAMPLES:** HUN, OLN, DOW, LYB, EMN, GLTC, KRO, UNVR, CBT, MEOH, APD, OEC, VHI, ODC, TREC, TROX, IOSP, DD, KOP, ALB, LAC, PPG\n\n**6) Staffing Firms:** There's a massive worker shortage &amp; those positions will need to be filled. You can bet staffing firms are in high demand.\n\n* **EXAMPLES:** DLHC, CCRN, KFY, CBRE, HQI, RHI, WDAY, NSP, HSII, RGP, TBI, KFRC,\n\n**7) Inferior goods:** Ever notice how demand for some products go up when prices rise? These are generally inferior goods. Ramen Noodles &amp; Mac&amp;Cheese are a few examples. Dollar Stores are filled with inferior goods.\n\n* DG, DLTR, WMT, ROST, KHC",

        "selftext": "There is a lot of debate in the investing world about the relevance of valuation metrics like the PS ratio, especially in the current climate where valuations across the board have become inflated relative to history. Some people go as far as to say that PS is irrelevant as long as the company is growing strongly. But I've started paying much closer attention to the PS ratio for the following reasons.\n\n1) I came across this article: [http://www.sionna.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dont-be-Fooled-by-the-PS-Insight-Piece.pdf](http://www.sionna.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dont-be-Fooled-by-the-PS-Insight-Piece.pdf). It's just over 2 pages including charts so I'm not going to bother with the tl/dr. It's worth a read.\n\n2) I conducted my own little analysis of stock performance during the 2010-2020 decade, which covers a large chunk of the longest bull market in history. I made a list of all the best performing stocks over that period, added a few notable IPOs from earlier in the decade, and then looked up their highest PS ratios. Here's the list in descending order of highest PS ratio:\n\nDXCM: 123.25 (which it hit on its IPO and then dropped sharply immediately after)  \nOLED: 58.35 (which it hit early, then dropped)  \nWDAY: 32.8 (hit early, then dropped)  \nMKTX: 31.45 (hit recently)  \nABMD: 29.98 (temporary spike, then dropped sharply)  \nTWLO: 27.82 (hit recently)  \nSPLK: 26.65 (hit early, then dropped)  \nNVDA: 25.65 (hit recently)  \nNOW: 25.53 (hit recently)  \nMA: 23.37 (hit recently)  \nREGN: 20.99 (hit on IPO, then dropped sharply)  \nFB: 18.40 (hit early and has been on a long decline since)  \nFTNT: 17.77 (hit recently)  \nEXR: 17.27 (hit recently)  \nZEN: 15.97 (hit recently)  \nNFLX: 12.67  \nFICO: 11.66  \nGOOG: 9.37  \nTTWO: 8.81  \nAVGO: 8.01  \nTDG: 7.89  \nAAPL: 7.80  \nTRU: 7.59  \nSTZ: 6.28  \nCTAS: 6.15  \nZNGA: 5.75  \nAMZN: 4.51  \nDPZ: 4.35  \n\n\n**Observations**\n\n1) From the entire list only 4 stocks hit a PS ratio over 30 at the highest. And almost all the stocks on this list are the best performing stocks of the past decade.\n\n2) In every single case of a PS ratio over 20, that level was only reached temporarily - either early in the decade, a brief spike somewhere along the line, or very recently. THERE ISN'T A SINGLE CASE IN THE SAMPLE OF A STOCK TRADING AT A PS RATIO OVER 20 FOR ANY SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME.\n\n3) The biggest and most successful tech stocks of the last 10 years (the FAANGs) don't even appear anywhere near the top. Facebook's had the highest PS ratio of 18.40, which it hit very early. AMZN's PS ratio has never even hit 5!  \n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe numbers don't lie. The simple truth is that stocks can't trade at high PS ratios for very long because their growth rates can't justify a high PS ratio over the long term. Eventually the stock will a correct, either through price (by selling off) or through time (by trading flat for a long period of time). What this means is that the upside potential for high PS stocks is very limited. The holy grail is to find companies trading at a low PS ratio while also exhibiting strong revenue growth and solid margins. If I find a stock I really like but is trading at a very high PS ratio, I will put it on my watch list and wait for the valuation to come down. The best opportunity is when the stock sells off on a disappointing earnings report. This does mean I might miss the occasional exception to the rule, but history shows those exceptions virtually don't exist.",

        "selftext": "Hi r/options! I was thinking of buying [**LEAP**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leaps.asp) call options on some top tech stocks that I'm generally bullish on (**MSFT, FB, NVDA, AMD, FB, SNAP** etc.) but wasn't sure if the macroeconomic factors at this point would support this investment. More specifically:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Fed taper**: News reports suggest that the Fed taper will begin sometime [before the end of 2021 ](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/feds-clarida-employment-test-begin-bond-taper-all-met-2021-10-12/) and conclude sometime in the [middle of 2022](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/22/federal-reserve-holds-interest-rates-steady-says-tapering-of-bond-buying-coming-soon.html). Some articles do however suggest that the [impact of this on the market won't be too high](https://www.thebalance.com/fed-tapering-impact-on-markets-416859) and that the \"[tantrum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp)\" from 2013 was more fear than actual impact on the market.   \n\n2. **Fed interest rate hikes**: News report suggest that with inflation and/or stagflation, interest rates would have to be [hiked either in 2022 or early 2023](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/federal-reserve-releases-minutes-from-its-september-policy-meeting.html)  \n\"*In the \u201cdot plot\u201d of individual members\u2019 expectations for interest rates, the committee indicated it could begin raising interest rates as soon as 2022. Markets currently are pricing in the first rate hike for next September, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Following the release of the minutes, traders increased the likelihood of a September hike to 65% from 62%.\"*  \n\n\nWhat would the impact of these factors be on tech stocks like the ones I mentioned above? Is it still a prudent decision for me to buy LEAPs on these stocks that expire in say Jan 2023 / June 2023?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m just putting in someone else\u2019s research on here.  I\u2019m not a huge fan of all of Motley Fool picks but they have some decent analysts that have made me money over the years.  I got into Upstart, Nvidia, Hubspot, and Axon because of their recommendations.  I happen to agree this one so I\u2019m sharing their info.\n\n\u201cThe case for Paysafe\n\nOnline gambling is a growing industry in the U.S. as more states continue to legalize the practice. Paysafe is a key facilitator for online casinos and bookmakers, providing secure payment processing services and digital wallets.\n\nThe company's flagship brands, Skrill and Neteller, are in high demand from some of the largest online gambling providers in the world. Paysafe has a decade-long relationship with European giant Flutter Entertainment, which owns popular platform Pokerstars, and the two companies are now working together in the U.S. through Flutter's Fox Bet sportsbook subsidiary. \n\nPaysafe is active in 15 of the 17 U.S. states where online gambling is legal, and with seven more states set to open up in late 2021 and 2022, the company's market opportunity continues to expand. In Canada, it's No. 1 in the online gambling industry, processing almost 100% of payments across the country. That's only a $2.5 billion market right now, so there's big upside as laws are slowly easing there, too.\n\nThe company's North American iGaming (online gambling) segment grew payment volumes by 72% in the most recent second quarter, far outpacing the rest of its business at 41%. But that's not to say the rest of the business isn't worth talking about.\n\nIn addition to gambling, Paysafe has a growing presence in the online gaming industry. Its partnership with Microsoft now spans 22 countries where it processes payments for in-game purchases made through the Xbox platform. And of course, no payments powerhouse is complete without a cryptocurrency segment -- Paysafe's Skrill digital wallet is used with 30 cryptocurrency exchanges, and offers 37 different tokens for trading.\n\nThe result is $1.54 billion in estimated revenue for fiscal 2021, and with a recent market capitalization of $5.7 billion, Paysafe stock trades at a price-to-sales multiple of 3.7 times.\n\nPaysafe's public listing was met with enthusiasm as it was caught up in the special purpose acquisition company craze of early 2021. Its recent stock price around $8 is a hefty discount to its $19.20 all-time high, and with the company operating in all the right growth areas, this might be a great long-term opportunity. \u201c\n\nI\u2019m really curious what you all think of this one.  They do have some debt but not an unmanageable amount.  I own shares and options.  I\u2019m up over 100% on the options so already sold enough to cover my costs and playing with house money now but I can see this in the $10-$12 range by the end of the year.",

Let's get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Snapchat is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $SNAP has had an average post earnings move of **17%**. At the time of writing, the options chain is pricing in a move of only **10%**. This priced move will ***shrink*** as we progress through the week since theta will decay the contracts, meaning we\u2019ll likely have a priced move closer to **8%** the day before the ER. Snapchat has ***never*** moved less than 6% post earnings since IPO, meaning that If you're gambling on this one, the odds are really in your favour. 6% minimum historical move, 17% average move, 8% priced move - The risk reward profile of this trade almost seems too good to be true. We ran this exact trade last quarter and made a huge bag, so I\u2019m really hoping we get to abuse this free money glitch again come Thursday. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Netflix is inefficiently priced.** Same deal as $SNAP, just not as good. Netflix usually moves 8%, but options are only pricing in 5%. I don\u2019t like this play as much as $SNAP since a straddle will run you over three grand, and that\u2019s not exactly gambling money. Regardless, those with huge accounts and even bigger balls may opt to run this trade.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Airline stocks aren\u2019t priced properly (yet).** Delta Airlines tanked 5% post ER last week, resulting in the rest of the airlines also tanking 5%. $DAL closed the week down 6%, while the rest of the airlines recovered, ultimately closing out the week flat / slightly negative. This indicates to me that airlines aren\u2019t priced properly at all - Delta had an amazing ER and put out some banger numbers, but tanked despite that due to the concerns in rising fuel prices. Rising fuel prices will end up plaguing ***all airlines***, not just $DAL exclusively, meaning that unless the airlines put up mind-blowing numbers (which are also better than the insane numbers $DAL put up), **a downward move is likely imminent.** I\u2019m genuinely shocked that the other airline stocks recovered throughout the week despite the headwinds they\u2019ll all inevitably face during their ERs this week. Keep in mind, I could be entirely wrong about this move - we\u2019ve seen time and time again that the market is extremely irrational.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** As displayed by the airlines last week (and hopefully later this week), stocks within the same sector tend to move together. If we\u2019re bullish or bearish on airlines, we can look to long or short $JETS, as almost all of its holding report earnings this week. The IV on $JETS is half that of the reporting tickers, meaning we\u2019ll get huge gains on a relatively small move. Most of the steel sector also reports this week! We can look to long or short the entirety of steel earnings by playing $X or $MT since we\u2019ll see a comparable move in those tickers as well, but won\u2019t get IV crushed. More information on these types of plays can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them this week, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",

        "selftext": "Over the past couple of months I\u2019ve been hearing a lot about the metaverse. It\u2019s a new concept to me, but from what I understand it\u2019s used to refer to the next level virtual environments. It\u2019s mostly used in the context of full virtual reality and replicating real life virtually. It\u2019s a fascinating concept for me, but there aren't really many first hand sources on the topic.\n\nI did some digging and found this [post](https://fincredibletranscripts.substack.com/p/fincredible-macrotalk-august-25-the) by Fincredible regarding the topic. It basically sums up what Mark Zuckerberg and other CEO\u2019s have said about the metaverse, including their own definition, use cases, monetization, etc. It\u2019s really interesting.\n\nHere\u2019s three quotes I consider most relevant:\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO: \u201cSo what is the metaverse? It's a virtual environment. We can be present with people in digital spaces. And you can kind of think about this as an embodied Internet that you're inside of rather than just looking at. And we believe that this is going to be the successor to the mobile Internet\u2026. Within the metaverse, you're going to be able to hang out, play games with friends, work, create and more\u2026. The defining quality of the metaverse is presence, which is this feeling that you're really there with another person or in another place.\u201d\n\nJen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA CEO: \u201cThe Omniverse is essentially an overlay of the Internet and overlay of the physical world is going to fuse all these different worlds together long term\u2026 And so I'm fairly sure that at this point, that Omniverse or the metaverse is going to be a new economy that is larger than our current economy.\u201d\n\nJohn S. Riccitiello, Unity CEO: \u201cJust as digital replaced analog, HD replaced standard definition, in the coming year, 5G will place 3G or 4G, and real-time 3D will replace linear and flat 2D digital content\u2026 We don't think that one company will represent the metaverse as, say, for example, it was imagined in Ready Player One. We believe there's going to be hundreds of thousands of destinations in the metaverse.\n\nThis is a fascinating topic for me and I am wondering which stocks in your opinion are undervalued when it comes to metaverse possibilities.",

The 3080-performance memberships cost $99.99 for six months, while 2080-performance memberships are available for $49.99 for six months. Preorders for the 3080-platform start on Oct. 21 and will be available sometime in November, Nvidia said.\n\nSounds like there will be some latency issues:\n\n&gt;The 3080-service is directed at \u201ccore or mainstream gamers,\u201d not so much for professional gamers who rely on the fastest possible performance to make a living due to \u201clatency,\u201d or delays due to internet connectivity. Latency for the cloud-platform service is about 56 milliseconds, while the latency for a physical 3080-card installed directly on a gamer\u2019s rig is about half of that, an Nvidia representative said.\n\nNVDA is up 2% today, although it's been very volatile lost few days so it's not clear it is related to this news. Some questions:\n\n* Is opening up a subscription-based revenue stream a game changer?\n* Would you use this service, why or why not? What's your gaming profile like?\n* Generally speaking, why isn't NVDA's stock cooling off a bit with the BABA news that it is also getting into the cloud chips market?\n* What's your long term take on this stock? Is the ARM acquisition ever going to happen? Is it priced in?",

        "selftext": " \n\n \n\n**GFS - The Sisyphean AMD child**\n\n**Who is GFS:**\n\nGlobalFoundries Inc. (GF or GloFo) is a multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company incorporated in the Cayman Islands and headquartered in Malta, New York. Created by the divestiture of the manufacturing arm of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), the company is privately owned by Mubadala Investment Company, the sovereign wealth fund of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe company manufactures chips designed for markets such as mobility, automotive, computing and wired connectivity, consumer internet of things (IoT) and industrial.\n\nAs of 2021, GlobalFoundries is the fourth-largest semiconductor manufacturer; it produces chips for more than 7% of the $86 billion semiconductor manufacturing services industry. It is the only one with operations in Singapore, the European Union, and the United States: one 200 mm and one 300 mm fabrication plant in Singapore; one 300 mm plant in Dresden, Germany; one 200 mm plant in Burlington, Vermont (where it is the largest private employer) and two 300 mm plants in the State of New York: one in East Fishkill and one in Malta.\n\nIn 2019, Thomas Caulfield, the chief executive officer (CEO), said GlobalFoundries plans to become a publicly traded company in 2022. In 2021, the company submitted an initial public offering (IPO) filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\n**AMD Spin Off:**\n\n* In 2008, AMD decided to spin off its fabrication division in a move to leverage its competitive advantage in the microprocessing side of the Chip industry. This would give AMD a much needed cash infusion and freedom to solely focus on the side of the business that was actually working, a situation that was necessary for the struggling stock at the time. \n* After the spin off, AMD would own 34% of the manufacturing company with 66% belonging to Advanced Technology Investment Company (ATIC), a subsidiary of the Mubadala Investment Company. \n* AMD would hold the right and plan to taper off the ownership of the company over time.\n* AMD would also be transferring 1.2Billion in debt to the newly formed company. \n* By 2012, AMD was fully divested from Global Foundries.\n\n**Global Foundries:**\n\n* On March 4, 2009 Global Foundries(GFS) was officially announced. \n* GFS primary business is its Foundry business. Understanding the Foundry side of the semiconductor industry is important as it will give an important insight to its position in the market. If we think of chip manufacturing like photography, AMD/Intel/NVidia would be the photographers and GFS would be the print shop. These companies design the chips and GFS manufactures them.\n* GFS has tried to compete in the designing of chips on many occasions and has failed every time. \n* As of 2015, the firm owned ten fabrication plants. fabrication 1 is in Dresden, Germany. Fabs 2 through 7 are in Singapore. Fabs 8 through 10 are in the northeast United States. These sites are supported by a global network of R&amp;D, design enablement, and customer support in Singapore, China, Taiwan, Japan, India, the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In February 2017, the company announced a new 300 fabrication \\[fabrication 11\\] in China for growing semiconductor market in China.\n* In 2016, GlobalFoundries licensed the 14 nm 14LPP FinFET process from Samsung Electronics. In 2018, GlobalFoundries developed the 12 nm 12LP node based on Samsung's 14 nm 14LPP process.\n* On August 27, 2018, GlobalFoundries announced it had cancelled their 7nm process due to a strategy shift to focus on specialized processes instead of leading edge performance.\n* On January 29, 2019, AMD announced an amended wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries. AMD now has full flexibility for wafer purchases from any foundry at 7 nm or beyond. AMD and GlobalFoundries agreed to commitments and pricing at 12 nm for 2019 through 2021.\n* On May 20, 2019, Marvell Technology Group announced it would acquire Avera Semi from GlobalFoundries for $650 million and potentially an additional $90 million. Avera Semi was GlobalFoundries' ASIC Solutions division, which had been a part of IBM's semiconductor manufacturing business. On February 1, 2019, GlobalFoundries announced the $236 million sale of its fabrication 3E in Tampines, Singapore, to Vanguard International Semiconductor (VIS) as part of their plan to exit the MEMS business by December 31, 2019. on April 22, 2019, GlobalFoundries announced the $430 million sale of their fabrication 10 in East Fishkill, New York, to ON Semiconductor. \n* In May 2020, GlobalFoundries stated it was fully abandoning its plans of opening fabrication 11 in Chengdu, China due to reported rivalry between the latter and the US.\\[30\\] This was three years after the manufacturer announced it would invest $10 billion to open the new fab; the fabrication was never brought online.\\[31\\]\n\n**Bear Case:**\n\n* GFS IPO is an exit strategy for the majority shareholder ATIC, which has proved to be a Sysphean for the fund. (https://semianalysis.com/globalfoundries-gfs-ipo-mubadala-lost-over-22-4b-now-they-are-hoping-public-markets-bail-them-out/)\n* GFS has wasted billions on failed ventures(fabrication 11, 7nm) while its competitors have had no issues in their ventures in the same field. \n* AMD is and was their largest customer, but they have been rapidly declining.\n* TSM, MU and NXP all are taking a large stake in the fabrication industry.\n* The timing of the IPO is to capitalize on inflated market, inflated semi conductor reliance, and looming self-confidence in GFS.   \n* Gross profit of the last three years have been a net loss, and has increased negatively by 58% (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001709048/000119312521290644/d192411df1.htm)\n\n**Subjective Bear Case:**\n\n* A bit of context, I worked as an intern at GFS at their HQ. \n* They had 3 MULTI million $ accidents while I was there. One caused by a hardware technician accidentally pressing an emergency stop button during an etching process. When these processes are stopped for ANY reason, the wafers being processed are as good as garbage. Semiconductor manufacturing is incredibly expensive, time consuming, and if a wafer is not PERFECT on a nano scale, the wafer is rendered useless. \n* The building was beautiful, this might sound like a pro but let me explain why it is a con. GFS has never been in a financial situation where they are able to spend the amount of money that they spent on their office. There were at least 60-80 meeting rooms JUST for engineers and in every single room there were 82inch flat screen HD monitors. There were \u201cto go\u201d chrome books on every corner where if you needed an extra laptop for any reason, you could just grab it. Everyone, even the janitors, were given company laptops, phones, backpacks, etc that were updated every year. \n* Because of the international importance of semiconductors and limited pool of talent, diversity among engineers is an understatement. The amount of engineers I would be in contact with on a daily basis that didn\u2019t speak english/spoke really broken english was quite literally counterproductive. There were times I had to have people from my team come with me to someone else\u2019s desk so they could translate for me.\n* They had a soccer field in the back of the site where they would PAY the employees to partake in - again, definitely a pro but a con in regards to finances. \n* All of this spending while being in a financially rough spot screams to me money hemorrhaging at the management level. \n\n**Bull Case:**\n\n* The IPO will give GFS a needed cash infusion to leverage itself as a top contender in the fabrication industry.\n* Deepening relationships(straight from SEC prospectus) could mean long term contracts with their clients which would mean more stable revenue for the following years. \n* Inflated market, semiconductor prices, and needs of chips means higher revenue and profits for GFS. Due to an increase in need also means customers will be much more willing to work with GFS if they can compete with TSM, MU etc or their competitors don\u2019t have the bandwidth to meet customer demand. \n* Loss from operations has decreased over the last three years(delta of 34%) and compared to last year is a fraction of what it was. \n* Loss per share is almost 14% of what it was compared to 2018(-4.7 vs -.6) \n\n**Conclusion and Summary:**\n\nI wish I could\u2019ve had a more quantitative approach to this post but almost all of the data can be seen at the SEC filing so I will let you guys do the calculations you want to know. I also believe that the qualitative information surrounding GFS is far more interesting than the numbers currently. These are incredibly dynamic times for the semiconductor industry, so the numbers used in the SEC filing are not fully representative of the future of the company. I am interested to see what happens AFTER IPO. Overall, I am net bearish on GFS but I do hold a part of me that believes they could leverage this cash infusion in their benefit. The semiconductor industry will/has seen a massive explosion that will keep exploding for some time.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 29, 2021**\n\nThe remarkable rally in equities continued, with stocks jumping despite two of the largest companies, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), posting disappointing earnings results in an otherwise solid earnings season. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) both closed the week at record closing levels.\n\nComing into Q3 earnings season, market participants were worried the persistent supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances would hamper corporate profits, so it is very encouraging to see companies holding up better than expected. Recent economic data has also contributed to the bounce in equities. \n\nAfter suffering its first -5% dip in September, the SPY has come back with a vengeance, advancing more than 7% from the October 4 bottom. In this same time period, the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped a staggering 10% and the Dow Jones (DIA) gained 5%. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I publicly remained bullish during September volatility and consistently encouraged dip-buying via this recap. Happy to say the strategy, as it has all year, worked great and personally resulted in my most profitable month all year. Hope some of y'all took advantage. Never try to fight market trends, much easier to ride them until you can\u2019t anymore. As I have said for like six months at this point, I think the trend will change once the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes. When that happens, I\u2019ll reassess my position. Until then I see any and all dips as buying opportunities. \n\nAmazon (AMZN) shares dropped after the e-commerce juggernaut missed third-quarter expectations and forecasted a jump in expenses in the fourth quarter due to supply chain disruptions and rising costs for labor, materials and freight. These factors are expected to generate \"several billion dollars of additional costs\" to Amazon in the current quarter, the company said in its earnings statement. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Earnings:** $6.12 vs $8.92 per share expected\n* **Revenue:** $110.81 billion vs $111.6 billion expected\n* Q4 Guidance: Amazon forecast sales between $130 billion and $140 billion\n* **Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime Subs:** $55.9 billion\n* **Net product sales:** $54.9 billion\n\nApple (AAPL) also disappointed Wall Street in its fiscal first-quarter results, with key iPhone sales missing expectations, with the launch of the iPhone 13 hampered by the global shortage in semiconductors that forced Apple to massively cut down on production, new rules that allow third-party payment systems in the App store, and supply chain issues, which Tim Cook says cost the company more than $6 billion. Key Apple suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM) fell on the miss. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **EPS:** $1.24 vs. $1.24 estimated \n* **Revenue:** $83.36 billion  vs. $84.85 billion estimated, up 29% year-over-year \n* **iPhone revenue:** $38.87 billion vs. $41.51 billion estimated, up 47% year-over-year \n* **Services revenue:** $18.28 billion vs. $17.64 billion estimated, up 25.6% year-over-year \n* **Other Products revenue:** $8.79 billion vs. $9.33 billion estimated, up 11.5% year-over-year \n* **Mac revenue:** $9.18 billion vs. $9.23 billion estimated, up 1.6% year-over-year \n* **iPad revenue:** $8.25 billion vs. $7.23 billion estimated, up 21.4% year-over-year \n\nEarlier in the week, a report showed US GDP decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) announced it will be rebranding under new name \u201cMeta\u201d and the ticker will change to MVRS starting December 1. This is to reflect the company\u2019s emphasis into investing in the metaverse, a 3D shared virtual space accessible via VR.\n* Following the post-earning surge, Microsoft (MSFT) unseated Apple (AAPL) as the world\u2019s most valuable company by market cap. \n* Tesla (TSLA) shares continued their monster run, closing above $1100 for a new all-time high. Congrats bulls, we getting paid!\n* Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) disclosed plans to expand drilling in the top US shale basin in West Texas after posting biggest quarterly profits in years amid elevated energy prices.\n* Squid Game Director Hwang Dong-hyuk confirmed there will be a season 2 but said he is \u201cnot a priority\u201d right now. Netflix (NFLX) stock was up 2.5% today to reach a new ATH. After lagging other tech companies in the last year or so, Netflix stocks has been on absolute fire following the release of Squid Game, the most popular show ever on the platform. It is reported Netflix made roughly $900 billion from the show. \n* Shares of Starbucks (SBUX) plummeted 6% after reporting earnings miss amid slowing sales in China.\n* The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation into NVIDIA (NVDA) plpanned $54 billion bid for semiconductor designer ARM. Very basically, the problem is that tons of companies, including Apple\u2019s new M1 chip are designed using ARM architecture, other chip companies are worried that NVDA\u2019s takeover could damage competition. In response NVDA has insisted it would maintain ARM as a \u201ctech neutral\u201d supplier.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Oppenheimer from $165 to $170 at Outperform.

Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Marvell Technology Inc (MRVL.O) have similar but slightly different offerings.\n\nThere's speed and security benefits:\n\n&gt;For cloud providers, tasks like setting up the virtual machines and getting customer data to the right place are essentially overhead costs. The Mount Evans chip, which Google and Intel have dubbed an \"infrastructure processing unit\" (IPU), separates those tasks out from the main computing tasks and speeds them up. Doing so also helps ensure the safety of those functions against hackers and adds flexibility to the data center.\n\nBut this part is interesting:\n\n&gt;But Intel and Google are working together on a set of software tools that will be released for free in hopes of making Intel's version of the chip a broader industry standard used beyond Google's data centers.\n\nThe server market is what's going to determine the stock price for AMD and Intel. Some questions:\n\n* What kind of impact will this have on AMD's growth in the server space? Is AMD working on something similar?\n* How significant is it that Google picked Intel to partner up with on this project?",

This week will be a massive one for earnings, with tech mega-caps Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG), among many other very important companies, reporting earnings.\n\nLast Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed that the Fed is \u201con track: to begin slowing the pace of quantitative easing, signaling that the US economy has recovered enough to sustain reduced Fed stimulus starting as soon as next month. I have been saying for months that I expected tapering to begin either November or December or this year. He said, \u201cI do think it\u2019s time to taper, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to raise rates.\u201d This is music to my ears, I have also been saying for months that I remain bullish until the Fed begins discussing the possibility of raising interest rates.\n\nIn the September meeting minutes, the Fed noted that \u201cParticipants generally assessed that, provided that the economic recovery remained broadly on track, a gradual tapering process that concluded around the middle of next year would likely be appropriate. \n\nMarket participants are encouraged that despite persistent supply-side disruptions, which have only intensified as the holiday season kicks off, and labor market imbalances stemming from the pandemic. Participants noted that if a decision to begin tapering purchases occurred at the next meeting, the process of tapering could commence with the monthly purchase calendars beginning in either mid-November or mid-December.\"\n\nAs of Friday, about 23% of S&amp;P 500 companies had reported actual results for the third quarter, and of these, 84% topped Wall Street's expectations for earnings per share (EPS), according to data from FactSet. The estimated earnings growth rate for the S&amp;P 500 was 32.7%, based on actual results and expectations for companies still yet to report as of last week. If maintained through the end of Q3 earnings season, that would mark the third-highest earnings growth rate posted for the index since 2010. \n\n[https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-22-2021](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-22-2021)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) reported earnings and the stock is gapping up at the time of writing.

This comes after car-rental company Hertz announced it was buying 100,000, mostly Model 3, for their fleet and a price target upgrade by Morgan Stanley to $1200\n* Shares of Pinterest (PINS) gapped down after PayPal (PYPL) said it was not pursuing an acquisition of the company. On the other hand, shares of PYPL gapped up on the announcement.\n* Sierra Space, Blue Origin, and Boeing (BA) are all reportedly working together to develop and build a commercial space station dubbed \u201cOrbital Reef\u201d. Blue Origin and Sierra Space said Orbital Reef will be operated as a \"mixed use business park\", and plans to provide the infrastructure needed to scale economic activity and open new markets in space.\n* NVIDIA (NVDA) announced its annual GPU Technology day will take place virtually between Nov 8-11, where the company is expected to unveil new plans regarding the metaverse.\n* Starbucks (SBUX) aims to hasten its India expansion with smaller stores and drive-through outlets, the CEO of its local partner said on Monday\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Airbnb (ABNB) target raised by JMP Securities from $180 to $190 at Outperform.

        "selftext": "For my full breakdown check the link [here.](https://greencandleinvestments.substack.com/p/nvidia-corporation-ticker-nvda-brief?r=ksa6f&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompany Description  \nNvidia Corporation is a visual computing company that designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive markets. The GPU segment offers processors, which include GeForce for PC gaming and mainstream PCs; GeForce NOW for cloud-based gaming; Quadro for design professionals working in computer-aided design, video editing, special effects, Tesla for artificial intelligence (AI) utilizing deep learning, accelerated computing, general purpose computing, and much more. NVIDIA sells their products directly to manufacturers and system builders and is one of the leaders in the chip manufacturing industry.  \n\n\nQuantitative Analysis  \nAt the time of this writing (10/10/2021), NVDA is trading at $208.31 with a 52 week range of $115.66 - $230.43 and a market cap of $519.11B. In Q2 of their fiscal year 2022, NVDA\u2019s revenue was $6.51 billion, up 68% year over year. NVIDIA\u2019s gaming revenue grew 85% year over year to $3.06 billion. The data center revenue grew 35% year over year to $2.37 billion. Return of equity (ROE: Net Income / Total Equity \\*100) of NVDA is 39.25% and net margin (net income / revenue) is 32.33%. The price to earnings (price per share / earnings per share) ratio was 74.61 and the debt to equities ratio (total liabilities / total equity) is 0.83.  \n\n\nQualitative Analysis  \nNvidia is a global leader in the growing industry of computer chip manufacturers and supplies major companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The COVID pandemic brought a massive increase in demand for computer chips and supply simply could not keep up, leading to the ongoing chip shortage around the world. The impact of the chip shortage is particularly evident in the automotive industry, where new car manufacturing has fallen dramatically and prices of both new and used vehicles continue to hit all time highs month after month. Outside of traditional computing usages, Nvidia has a unique opportunity to integrate into the emerging cryptocurrency industry.\u00a0 In order to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, computers and mining processors need chips similar to what Nvidia creates. There are countless other uses for chips and potentially other uses of chips that have yet to be discovered. With the increasing need and the backing of a large investment from Nancy Pelosi, there\u2019s positive momentum behind one of the global leaders in chip manufacturing.  \n\n\nBullish Thesis  \n1. Backing of Nancy Pelosi Investment: \u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u2019s investment activity has gained a lot of traction and attention, a Twitter account has even been created that now has over 114k followers to track her investments. As mentioned above, Pelosi has a significant investment of $6.5 million in Nvidia. As outlined in the article, Pelosi has had extreme success and retail traders who have shadowed Pelosi have also seen incredible returns. Although this isn\u2019t a bullish point based on the fundamentals of the company, you cannot ignore the success of Pelosi\u2019s investments.  \n\n\n2. Increasing Demand: There are more and more products in need of chips. With increasing artificial intelligence in \u00a0vehicles and chips being placed in everyday products, the need for Nvidia\u2019s products will continue to increase.  \n\n\n3. Major Suppliers: Nvidia supplies chips to major companies such as Amazon, NIO the automated car manufacturer, Facebook, Google, and Tesla currently use Nvidia\u2019s graphics chips. With major companies using their chips, it provides a safety net for sales of Nvidia\u2019s products.  \n\n\nBearish Thesis  \n1. Competition: There are a number of other major chip manufacturing companies that offer NVDA stiff competition. Although Nvidia holds a strong position in chip market share, investors should keep a close eye on several other chip manufacturers. Competitors include: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM), and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM).  \n\n\n2. Short-term supply chain issues for semiconductors: The demand for semiconductor chips skyrocketed during the pandemic, leaving many manufacturers unable to keep up. This has been particularly evident in the automotive market, where the chip shortage is estimated to cost auto makers \\~210B dollars. Worse still, some have estimated that the chip shortage could continue into 2022 and even 2023. It\u2019s apparent that chip manufacturing companies have had a hard time scaling production, likely due to a number of supply-chain and other COVID-related issues. With demand likely to remain steady, NVDA will be pressured to scale up production and increase supply - time will tell how successful they are in doing so.  \n\n\n3. Automakers designing their own chips: The chip shortage has caused new car production - and thus supply and sales - to plummet over the last year. Because of the low supply, both new and used car prices have skyrocketed to record highs. Rather than simply wait for chip manufacturing companies to catch up, some automakers have started to consider designing and manufacturing chips internally. For example, Tesla has already begun making their own chips and one of GM\u2019s China joint ventures announced in September that they would begin designing their own chips. If chip manufacturing companies are unable to meet demand, expect more large companies with R&amp;D funds to follow Tesla and GM.\u00a0 \u00a0",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 18, 2021**\n\nThe market carried on its incredible momentum, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) bouncing for the fourth straight day to add to gains after experiencing the first -5% decline all year. Technology stocks, which have recently been pressured by a rising Treasury yield, came back with a vengeance, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) jumping roughly 6% from October 4 lows. Market participants are encouraged by an unexpected uptick in retail sales despite a new report showing inflation rose once again in September amid widespread supply-chain disruptions. Looking ahead, market participants continue to digest corporate earnings report, with many notable companies like Tesla (TSLA), Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), Netflix (NFLX), and Intel (INTC) among many others reporting later this week. \n\nNot to toot my own horn, but as I have continuously said, I continue to see any dips in the markets as buying opportunities, including this latest dip and the recent bounce highlights why. While I acknowledge current risk factors that exist in the market (China, inflation, supply-chain issues, etc), these are all issues that have been known about and have been affecting the market for months. Just because we see a sudden uptick in \u201cdoomsaying\u201d headlines from mass media, doesn\u2019t mean the fundamentals of the bull market in US equities have shifted (remember they are paid for you to engage with the content). Until something fundamentally changes (like inflation forcing the Fed to suddenly hike the interest rate), I continue to stick to my plan. Just be sure to be prepared for any eventuality, I do this by having zero-margin in my long-term account and adhering to stop losses in trades.\n\nA strong start to earnings season, with big banks handily beating estimates last week, helped fuel optimism that corporate profits held up better than anticipated despite widespread supply-related disruptions. Big banks from Morgan Stanley (MS) to Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) handily topped estimates in their third quarter results last week. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. \n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPCERE1Q156NBEA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPCERE1Q156NBEA)\n\nVictoria Fernandez, Chief Market Strategist at Crossmark Global Investments said, \u201cWe started off this week really strong. The banks have done great ... That started to relieve a few people's concerns, especially when you had the CEOs of the bank saying the consumer looks strong. And that, I think, is going to be the key for the market going forward. If the consumer is there and they're willing to spend \u2014 which we've seen in the month of September \\[when\\] retail sales started to come back a little bit \u2014 then I think that gives a little more optimism to the market that as we continue to reopen, as earnings are strong, the consumer will be there, and the equity markets will continue to trend higher.\"\n\nLast week, The Department of Commerce released their monthly report on retail sales, which showed an unexpected rise in consumer spending in September despite supply-chain constraints. Retail sales for the month increased by 0.7%, against the Dow Jones estimate for a decline of 0.2%. Compared with a year ago, sales were up 13.9%. Still despite robust consumer spending, economists warn that supply bottlenecks will increase heading into the holiday season, as demand increases. Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets said,  \u201cThe solid retail sales report reflects both consumer resilience and escalating prices. The main concern now is that supply-chain disruption and micro-chip shortages appear to be spreading, limiting selection and tamping down goods demand.\u201d \n\nAs of Friday, the expected earnings growth rate for the S&amp;P 500 was 30%, according to FactSet. That figure \u2014 based on both actual earnings from companies that have reported so far and expectations for future results \u2014 represented an increase from the prior week, when the anticipated earnings growth rate for the third quarter stood at about 27.6%.\n\n[https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight\\_101521.pdf](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_101521.pdf)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Apple (AAPL) unveiled new versions of its Macbook Pro laptops that use their proprietary M1 chip, making them more powerful than the predecessors that used Intel (INTC) chips.\n* Optimism among U.S. homebuilders posted a surprise jump in October, with strong demand for homes helping offset ongoing supply chain and labor issues in the housing market. The National Association of Home Builders' October Housing Market Index jumped to 80 in October from 76 in September. This index, which tracks confidence among domestic homebuilders, was expected to fall to 75 in the latest reading, according to Bloomberg consensus data.\n* Alibaba (BABA) is reportedly planning to build its own in-house chip using a 5nm wafer designed using Arm architecture in a bid to strengthen its position in the cloud computing market.\n* Arm, which is the midst of a potential $54 billion take over by NVIDIA (NVDA) announced new tools aim at cutting the development time of connected devices by up to 40%. Arm on Monday released tools that it hopes will let makers of \"internet of things\" devices, from connected traffic control lights to smart home appliances, develop their chips and code at the same time, shaving two years off the typical five-year timeline to create a device. Arm is one of the most important tech companies, I recommend everyone read up on them. \n* Amazon (AMZN) hired 150,000 seasonal workers as the holiday season, the busiest of the year, kicks off.\n* Facebook (FB) plan to hire 10,000 employees in EU to develop the \u201cmetaverse\u201d, a virtual, 3-D, collective, integrated space where users can interact online using VR. \n* Ford Motors (F) plans to invest $300 million to build an electric vehicle plant in the UK.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) target raised by JP Morgan from $237 to $276 at Overweight.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 5, 2021**\n\nVolatility in the stock market continues, with the three major indexes, particularly the Nasdaq (QQQ), reversing hard after suffering one of its worst days all year, with Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) leading the charge. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington and wait for upcoming economic and earnings data to gauge concerns over supply chain disruptions and inflation. Tech stocks once again came under pressure as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continues to rise. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.04% higher, the Nasdaq closed 1.35% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closing 0.92% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed, closing just 0.35% higher. \n\nWe\u2019ve seen previous episodes of rising rates, both earlier this year as well as when the Fed first announced intentions to begin tapering quantitative easing in the not too distant future. Each of these episodes caused a hiccup but didn\u2019t derail the broader bull market. According to Edward Jones, yields went from below 1% to 1.75% during the first three months of this year, a period that included pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500 of 3.7% for four days and 4.2% for 12 days. However, during that entire three-month stretch in which rates were rising, the stock market rose more than 7%.  In this current spate, 10-year rates have jumped from 1.30% on September 15 to as high as 1.54% last week, reflecting a renewed concern over inflation pressures and reduced Fed stimulus expectations\n\nStocks are struggling to regain their footing after the September selloff, given that many of the concerns that sparked last month\u2019s drop remain. Congressional lawmakers have yet to come to an agreement on a solution to raise the debt limit to prevent a potential government default sometime mid-October. Failure to do so would be catastrophic for the US economy.  As a reminder, Congress successfully averted a government shutdown last week. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it as early as this week Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown. \n\nLooking ahead, the September Jobs Report will be released later this week. Market participants are hoping to see payroll gains accelerate after a shockingly disappointing August report, which shoed just 235,000 new payrolls gains versus more than 700,000 expected. Consensus economists anticipate that 475,000 payrolls returned in September, and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.1% or the lowest since March 2020.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* According to Facebook (FB), yesterday\u2019s nearly six-hour outage was caused by a mistake during a routine maintenance on how internet data routed through its network. Here is a blog by the company [https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/)\n* The price of ... topped $50k again and up 25% this week\n* Despite broad weakness in tech in recent weeks, shares of Netflix (NFLX) have been on fire, with the company breaking previous ATH twice in the last five days. Perhaps, could be attributed to the immense popularity of \u201cSquid Game\u201d, which has become the company\u2019s most popular show in less than a month. I watched it, it lives up to the hype.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) unveiled a new version of its flagship operating system today, with the company debuting Windows 11. Here is a WSJ article about the features [https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-released-windows-11-but-should-you-upgrade-11633453762?mod=wsj\\_RHF](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-released-windows-11-but-should-you-upgrade-11633453762?mod=wsj_RHF)\n* Today, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen gave testimony before the Senate exposing FB\u2019s business practices and calling for more stringent regulation of the company. \n* Three top US hedge funds, Man Group, Elliot Management, Marshall Wace, and Soros Fund Management, who combined manage roughly $200b in assets, have warned that Chinese businesses have become \u201cuninvestable\u201d amid the anti-monopoly scandal, power shortages and Evergrande situation. I agree and personally divested all my holdings in Chinese stocks months ago, some at a loss. Just my opinion.\n* National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), South Africa\u2019s largest metalworkers union with over 155,000 members, said it was launching an indefinite strike to press for wage increases. This action could block critical supplies for car manufacturing, threatening to further strain a supply chain already stretched thin. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Chipotle (CMG) target raised by Stephens from $1850 to $200 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "Hello, I'm here to ask the opinion of the people here on whether or not CVS stock is a good long term buy. My portfolio is relatively small to some of the other portfolios I have come across on this subreddit. I have 900$ in so far and is built up of SPY, Tesla, Apple, and Snapchat. I have 3 goals in mind that I want to achieve. My first is to invest more in SPY, my second is to invest more in the well known companies such as Facebook, Nvidia, Amazon etc. (Aka I want to diversity my portfolio). And lastly, I want to center my portfolio around dividends. I really like the sound of getting paid essentially free money that isn't taxed. As of so far, I only get paid about 3$ tops from everything I have invested in. That is some background about my portfolio. With all this in mind, I wanted to get multiple takes and opinions on whether or not investing into cvs is a good long term Choice. I actually work at CVS, and so whenever I log onto the website to see my paycheck, I always see the stock price. And these last few months it has went up. I also see that they pay dividends so that's a plus, however my personal experience with cvs has been horrible, from management to the people and also taking into consideration how much more popular online shopping is becoming so I am truly torn on whether or not to invest. I would love feedback, any tips, any advice on everything I mentioned. Thank you for your time.",

Xpeng is a leading EV producer in China. [Here is the launch link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/24/xpeng-launches-xpilot-3point5-semi-autonomous-driving-features.html)\n\nThis is big news because it shows the power of Blackberry QNX and QNX Hypervisor. The Real Time Operating System enables quick development of ADAS functions because it's already ASIL D Safety and Security Certified, something Linux/Msft/IoS/Android can't achieve. The QNX out of box comes with useful software features for car companies to use like camera feed, lidar feed, etc. The first Xpeng car with Auto-pilot is coming in first half 2023(launches in later 2022). \n\nBlackberry is already in 24/25 top EV cars. Analyst that work for Candian banks have tried to knock down the stock price for 8 years claiming it's going bankrupt or whatever. I believe they don't understand what the future is and how Blackberry plays a critical role in enabling it. Connected future and cities require high security and safety and that's what blackberry provides. \n\n&gt;\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt; As the central processing unit for the vehicle\u2019s autonomous driving function, the IPU-03 meets the automotive industry\u2019s most stringent requirements. On the software side, QNX OS for Safety is an AUTOSAR-compliant real-time operating system (RTOS) containing safety components running on the MCU. On the hardware front, backup redundancy design methodology has been adopted. The IPU-03 fulfills ISO 26262 Functional Safety ASIL Level D and forms the backbone for Xpeng\u2019s intelligent driving system. In addition, the NVIDIA Xavier platform has a computing capacity of up to 30 trillion operations per second (TOPS), making it capable of processing massive data input from the vehicle\u2019s various sensors, including radars, cameras, lidar and ultrasonic systems, in real time and running algorithms such as perception, positioning, planning, and control without delay.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 29, 2021**\n\nThe remarkable rally in equities continued, with stocks jumping despite two of the largest companies, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), posting disappointing earnings results in an otherwise solid earnings season. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) both closed the week at record closing levels.\n\nComing into Q3 earnings season, market participants were worried the persistent supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances would hamper corporate profits, so it is very encouraging to see companies holding up better than expected. Recent economic data has also contributed to the bounce in equities. \n\nAfter suffering its first -5% dip in September, the SPY has come back with a vengeance, advancing more than 7% from the October 4 bottom. In this same time period, the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped a staggering 10% and the Dow Jones (DIA) gained 5%. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I publicly remained bullish during September volatility and consistently encouraged dip-buying via this recap. Happy to say the strategy, as it has all year, worked great and personally resulted in my most profitable month all year. Hope some of y'all took advantage. Never try to fight market trends, much easier to ride them until you can\u2019t anymore. As I have said for like six months at this point, I think the trend will change once the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes. When that happens, I\u2019ll reassess my position. Until then I see any and all dips as buying opportunities. \n\nAmazon (AMZN) shares dropped after the e-commerce juggernaut missed third-quarter expectations and forecasted a jump in expenses in the fourth quarter due to supply chain disruptions and rising costs for labor, materials and freight. These factors are expected to generate \"several billion dollars of additional costs\" to Amazon in the current quarter, the company said in its earnings statement. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Earnings:** $6.12 vs $8.92 per share expected\n* **Revenue:** $110.81 billion vs $111.6 billion expected\n* Q4 Guidance: Amazon forecast sales between $130 billion and $140 billion\n* **Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime Subs:** $55.9 billion\n* **Net product sales:** $54.9 billion\n\nApple (AAPL) also disappointed Wall Street in its fiscal first-quarter results, with key iPhone sales missing expectations, with the launch of the iPhone 13 hampered by the global shortage in semiconductors that forced Apple to massively cut down on production, new rules that allow third-party payment systems in the App store, and supply chain issues, which Tim Cook says cost the company more than $6 billion. Key Apple suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM) fell on the miss. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **EPS:** $1.24 vs. $1.24 estimated \n* **Revenue:** $83.36 billion  vs. $84.85 billion estimated, up 29% year-over-year \n* **iPhone revenue:** $38.87 billion vs. $41.51 billion estimated, up 47% year-over-year \n* **Services revenue:** $18.28 billion vs. $17.64 billion estimated, up 25.6% year-over-year \n* **Other Products revenue:** $8.79 billion vs. $9.33 billion estimated, up 11.5% year-over-year \n* **Mac revenue:** $9.18 billion vs. $9.23 billion estimated, up 1.6% year-over-year \n* **iPad revenue:** $8.25 billion vs. $7.23 billion estimated, up 21.4% year-over-year \n\nEarlier in the week, a report showed US GDP decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) announced it will be rebranding under new name \u201cMeta\u201d and the ticker will change to MVRS starting December 1. This is to reflect the company\u2019s emphasis into investing in the metaverse, a 3D shared virtual space accessible via VR.\n* Following the post-earning surge, Microsoft (MSFT) unseated Apple (AAPL) as the world\u2019s most valuable company by market cap. \n* Tesla (TSLA) shares continued their monster run, closing above $1100 for a new all-time high. Congrats bulls, we getting paid!\n* Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) disclosed plans to expand drilling in the top US shale basin in West Texas after posting biggest quarterly profits in years amid elevated energy prices.\n* Squid Game Director Hwang Dong-hyuk confirmed there will be a season 2 but said he is \u201cnot a priority\u201d right now. Netflix (NFLX) stock was up 2.5% today to reach a new ATH. After lagging other tech companies in the last year or so, Netflix stocks has been on absolute fire following the release of Squid Game, the most popular show ever on the platform. It is reported Netflix made roughly $900 billion from the show. \n* Shares of Starbucks (SBUX) plummeted 6% after reporting earnings miss amid slowing sales in China.\n* The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation into NVIDIA (NVDA) plpanned $54 billion bid for semiconductor designer ARM. Very basically, the problem is that tons of companies, including Apple\u2019s new M1 chip are designed using ARM architecture, other chip companies are worried that NVDA\u2019s takeover could damage competition. In response NVDA has insisted it would maintain ARM as a \u201ctech neutral\u201d supplier.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Oppenheimer from $165 to $170 at Outperform.

        "selftext": "Hello, I am new to this and I need a bit of help.\nI started to be pretty passionate about investing in the past month so, even if I know the risk, I decided to grab my money collected for a new PC into Trading212, in hope to get even more.\nAfter I studied some about how investing works, what link to go, indicators, decided to spend my money on Nvidia. Worked well, gained +10 dollars, but after this I was naive enough and listened to someone to invest my money in a meme stock, luckily I lost only 15 dollars and now I've just spent them on Microsoft.\nMicrosoft seems safe so most probably I'll get my 5 dollars back pretty quickly.\nNow what I wanted to ask you: I decided I don't want to risk my hard-worked money like this\ud83d\ude05 so it's wise to just spend them on safer places for noobs like me(at least until I get more experienced with stocks).\nI've seen people recommending ETFs for beginners, I think it's a good idea and the most profitable I've seen is  TQQQ but I understood it's a dangerous one.\nIs it safe to put my money in TQQQ(considering that I'm gonna take them all back after 1 year)?

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 11, 2021**\n\nStocks reversed coursed and ended lower today as investors continue to digest the September Jobs report, ongoing supply-side disruptions and wait for the beginning of earnings season to kick off later this week. The benchmark Treasury yield rose to 1.61%, its highest level since June, which puts pressure on technology stocks, and the price of crude oil continued its staggering rise, with Brent crude topping $84 a barrel, the highest price since 2018. \n\nIn recent weeks, amid elevated global demand and persistent supply-side disruptions, the price of commodities, from oil and natural gas to cotton and coal, has exploded, with many currently at multi-year highs or record levels. A similar dynamic happened earlier in the year with the price of lumber, which eventually come back down to reasonable levels. I expect the price of commodities to recede once again as labor market imbalances are met and supply-side disruptions caused by the pandemic smooth over.\n\nLast week, the Labor Department released its monthly jobs report, which showed non-farm payrolls rose by only 194,000 in September versus the 500,000 expected. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 4.8%, though this positive development came alongside a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate to 61.6%, versus 61.7% in August. And the size of the civilian labor force actually contracted in September, with the gap between the size of the labor force in February 2020 and last month topping 3 million. \n\nThough employers added just 194,000 jobs in September, the economy has now regained half of the jobs deficit it faced in December, compared with pre-pandemic employment levels. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that he'd only need to see a \"decent\" September U.S. jobs report to be ready to begin to taper in November. It is very likely the tapering of quantitative easing will be announced this month and commence in November. \n\nLooking ahead, market participants will receive the Bureau of Labor Statistics latest Consumer and Producer price indexes for September. Increases in core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, are expected to remain elevated. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said \u201cStagflation' was the most common word in client conversations this week as equity market volatility remained elevated. Stagflation is not our economists' base case expectation, but the weak historical performance of equities in stagflationary environments helps explain why investors are concerned.\" As a reminder, stagflation refers to an environment in which economic growth is slow but inflation high. As Kostin said, I do not see this scenario moving forward as expectations for economic growth moving forward remain high. \n\nEarnings season, which is typically a very volatile time in equity markets, is set to kick off later this week, with big US banks reporting. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The bounce in Chinese stocks was stopped in its tracks after the government announced it was investigating and seeking to curb ties between state financial institutions and private companies.\n* China, the largest car market on Earth, also announced new regulations to limit and regulate the data sent abroad by vehicles, a blow to Western companies looking to expand in China.\n* Longtime Disney (DIS) studio head Alan Horn will retire from the company. \n* Despite recent choppiness, the IPO market remains red-hot, with More than 2,000 IPOs raising a combined $421 billion globally by the end of September, a record high. That was more than double the proceeds raised during the same period last year, according to Refinitiv data.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA (NVDA) today announced that they trained what they claim is the largest and most capable AI-powered language model to date: Megatron-Turing Natural Language Generation. Love to see it, like I have said multiple times before, NVIDIA is my single favorite stock, I think they will play a huge role in powering future technologies. \n* Elon Musk announced that Tesla (TSLA) was moving headquarters from California to Austin, Texas. As a reminder, Musk\u2019s SpaceX is already headquartered near there. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Social Finance Technologies (SOFI) target raised by Morgan Stanley to $25 at Overweight. Stock gapped up 13% on the news and is now trading around $18.50\n* Aptiv (APTV) target raised by Barclays from $174 to $186 at Overweight. Stock currently around $160\n* Citigroup target raised by Jefferies from $81 to $87 at Buy. Stock currently around $72\n* HubSpot (HUBS) target raised by Wells Fargo from $675 to $750 at Overweight. Stock currently around $682\n* JP Morgan (JPM) target raised by Jefferies from $177 to $198 at Buy. Stock currently around $167\n* Netflix (NFLX) with two target raises. Stock currently around $627\n   * Credit Suisse from $643 to $740 at Outperform\n   * KeyCorp from $645 to $670 at Overweight.\n* Palo Alto Networks (PANW) target raised by Wedbush from $470 to $600 at Positive.

        "selftext": "Over the past couple of months I\u2019ve been hearing a lot about the metaverse. It\u2019s a new concept to me, but from what I understand it\u2019s used to refer to the next level virtual environments. It\u2019s mostly used in the context of full virtual reality and replicating real life virtually. It\u2019s a fascinating concept for me, but there aren't really many first hand sources on the topic.\n\nI did some digging and found this [post](https://fincredibletranscripts.substack.com/p/fincredible-macrotalk-august-25-the) by Fincredible regarding the topic. It basically sums up what Mark Zuckerberg and other CEO\u2019s have said about the metaverse, including their own definition, use cases, monetization, etc. It\u2019s really interesting.\n\nHere\u2019s three quotes I consider most relevant:\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO: \u201cSo what is the metaverse? It's a virtual environment. We can be present with people in digital spaces. And you can kind of think about this as an embodied Internet that you're inside of rather than just looking at. And we believe that this is going to be the successor to the mobile Internet\u2026. Within the metaverse, you're going to be able to hang out, play games with friends, work, create and more\u2026. The defining quality of the metaverse is presence, which is this feeling that you're really there with another person or in another place.\u201d\n\nJen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA CEO: \u201cThe Omniverse is essentially an overlay of the Internet and overlay of the physical world is going to fuse all these different worlds together long term\u2026 And so I'm fairly sure that at this point, that Omniverse or the metaverse is going to be a new economy that is larger than our current economy.\u201d\n\nJohn S. Riccitiello, Unity CEO: \u201cJust as digital replaced analog, HD replaced standard definition, in the coming year, 5G will place 3G or 4G, and real-time 3D will replace linear and flat 2D digital content\u2026 We don't think that one company will represent the metaverse as, say, for example, it was imagined in Ready Player One. We believe there's going to be hundreds of thousands of destinations in the metaverse.\n\nThis is a fascinating topic for me, but I have my doubts about how it will work out.",

        "selftext": "Stocks closed slightly on the red, with the three major indexes fluctuating between small gains and losses in another choppy session. Market participants continue to digest elevated commodity prices, the September job report, new upcoming economic data, and earnings season, which is set to kick off later this week.\n\nIn recent weeks, amid elevated global demand and persistent supply-side disruptions, the price of commodities, from oil and natural gas to cotton and coal, has exploded, with many currently at multi-year highs or record levels. The broad rise in prices threatens to further pressure corporate margins, with companies already dealing with a host of supply-side disruptions, including port congestion, ongoing power shortages in China, and labor market imbalances. Rising treasury yields also raise the specter of higher borrowing costs, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury hovering at the highest levels since June.\n\nDavid Bailin, Chief Investment Officer at Citi Private Bank (a subsidiary of Citigroup), said, \u201cWe\u2019re definitely freaked out about crude oil prices ... \\[and\\] about slightly higher interest rates. But we have to put all of this in context. First of all, interest rates have been abnormally low. Energy prices are high due to excessive demand right now and delivery shortages across Europe and now in China ... These things will abate. We think it'll take somewhere between three and nine months for energy supplies and for the shipping issues to abate.\" I agree.\n\nLooking ahead, market participants will receive the Bureau of Labor Statistics latest Consumer and Producer price indexes for September. Increases in core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, are expected to remain elevated. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said \u201cStagflation' was the most common word in client conversations this week as equity market volatility remained elevated. Stagflation is not our economists' base case expectation, but the weak historical performance of equities in stagflationary environments helps explain why investors are concerned.\" As a reminder, stagflation refers to an environment in which economic growth is slow but inflation high. As Kostin said, I do not see this scenario moving forward as expectations for economic growth moving forward remain high. \n\nEarnings season, which is typically a very volatile time in equity markets, is set to kick off later this week, with big US banks reporting. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The IMF's new forecast is for global economic activity to expand at a 5.9% rate this year, down from the 6.0% pace seen in July. However, the IMF maintained its outlook for 4.9% growth next year. To put this into context, global growth rates in 2019 were 3.2%, so the IMF thinks we are poised for at least another year of nice gains.\n* Coinbase (COIN) is launching a marketplace to exchange non-fungible tokens. \n* Twitter (TWTR) on Tuesday rolled out new ad features and revamped the algorithm that decides which ads users see, as part of an effort to lay the groundwork to launch future eCommerce features, the social networking company told Reuters.\n* EU antitrust regulators are set to open a full-scale investigation into NVIDIA's (NVDA) $54 bln bid for British chip designer Arm because concessions it offered are not sufficient to address competition concerns, people familiar with the matter said.\n* Investment firm Blackstone revealed its plans to invest $1 billion in acquiring music rights and managing catalogs, a move they say will benefit from the rapid growth of online streaming. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Airbnb (ABNB) target raised by Cowen from $160 to $220 at Outperform. Stock currently around $173\n* Booking (BKNG) target raised by Cowen from $2700 to $2950 at Outperform. Stock currently around $2475\n* Cummins (CMI) target raised by Citigroup from $280 to $300 at Buy. Stock currently around $230\n* Eaton (ETN) target raised by Citigroup from $180 to $185 at Positive. Stock currently around $152\n* Gilead (GILD) target raised by Morgan Stnaley from $83 to $84 at Overweight. Stock currently around $67\n* Merck (MRK) target raised by Morgan Sntlaye from $85 to $88 at Equal-Weight. Stock currently around $79\n* Netflix (NFLX) with three target raises. Stock currently around $625\n   * Truist from $600 to $690 at Buy. \n   * Jefferies from $620 to $737 at Buy\n   * Robert W Baird from $650 to $680 at Outperform\n\n\u201cLife is what happens when you're busy making other plans.\u201d *-*John Lennon",

        "selftext": "**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation AND Analysis (Q3 Week 3) - $AAPL, $FB, $AMD, $MSFT, $SHOP, $AMZN, $GOOG and More**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' bull gang, hope you\u2019re all doing well! Our free money glitch remained unpatched for another update, allowing many of us to pull clean double baggers across the board. God bless $SNAP. With all of big tech set to report this week, it could prove to be more lucrative than the last. We\u2019ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We\u2019ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let\u2019s get into it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Jetblue is inefficiently priced.** Historically Jetblue moves roughly **4%** post earnings (inline with all the other American airlines),  yet this quarter, the options are pricing in a move of roughly **10%**. If we sell straddles or strangles, we can collect this extremely inflated premium with very little risk on our end. I looked into the entire sector as a whole since I planned on trading it last week, and I came across nothing that would\u2019ve fundamentally caused this spike in volatility in airlines, or Jetblue specifically. The odds are awesome on this trade, and I plan or robbing some gamblers next week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Twitter is inefficiently priced. Avoid it.** Historical move of **6.5%**, priced move of **11%** - on paper, this trade gives us insane edge, but I\u2019m still not touching it, as we saw what happened with $SNAP on Thursday. Although Twitter dropped 5% as the market tried to price $AAPL\u2019s privacy policy in, I don\u2019t feel like taking on additional risk because the fundamentals have shifted right before its\u2019 earnings. Normally I would take this trade 10/10 times simply from a pure numbers standpoint, but I\u2019m not as confident anymore because of the added volatility created by $SNAP. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Oil stocks tend to experience Post Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD).** PEAD is the phenomenon where a stocks price will drift in the direction of an earnings surprise for several weeks following an earnings announcement. If a stock beats, it will continue to grind up for weeks following the ER report, and vice versa if it misses. This is especially true among oil stocks - check the charts if you don\u2019t believe me. The best way to play oil this quarter would be to capitalize on this effect, and do **monthly** call or put debit spreads based on the results that come out Friday. To those curious, standard weekly options provide no edge at the time of writing, so it\u2019s best not to gamble this time round.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** If you\u2019re bullish on big tech, look to long $QQQ this week to alter your risk exposure and bag some safer gains. If you\u2019re bearish on oil, look to short $XLE instead of any of the individual companies for an added safety net. If you think $AMD is gonna knock it out of the park, look to play $NVDA or $SOXL instead. There\u2019s lot\u2019s of opportunities for collateral plays this week, and I\u2019ve just barely scratched the surface. If you wish to learn more about collateral plays, refer to [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nw-EaMcOUIY52zJtre6tYAYTw5YLKswl97Nkez_WQBA/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!  If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",

I tried to learn them but I still find it hard to catch the sell moment and I failed today(kind of) by selling my stock at 250\u20ac just to buy it again at 247\u20ac thinking it will raise again but it was a trap(didn't really lose money tho, I actually think I've won 2\u20ac if I also remove the 0.4\u20ac fees).\nI was also advised to not do that buy-sell spam since it's ineffective on the long run but doing simple math I actually lose dozens of \u20ac by letting my stocks through the fluctuations.\nWhen is the right time to re-buy/sell? Should I do it at least once per week?",

        "selftext": "Harmonychain AS went on sale on Euronext Growth Oslo on 19 May this year and was traded on courses in the range of NOK 1.77 to NOK 2.4 on the first day. In the first month, more than NOK 40 million was traded between NOK 1.51 and 2.4 per share. In March, a private placement was issued, which issued 61 million new shares at NOK 1.80 per share. This with the intention of using to develop operations and technology in the two wholly owned company\u2019s Artic Core AS and Lokotech AS.\n\n**Disclaimer: I have no economic or financial education, and the content of the case must not be considered financial advice in any way. As always, you must do your own research.**\n\nArtic Core AS's business area is the operation of standard High Computing Power centers and Blockchain Validation Centers. This is an industry that has good growth conditions in politically stable Norway, with access to cheap, stable and environmentally friendly power. We know of companies that already have great success within HPC (Green Mountain, Doomsday Vault Svalbard, Bahnhof Sweden, Basefarm etc etc\u2026). When you look at the accounts of publicly traded companies, you realize that it is quickly traded for billions and that there are often hundreds of millions left in profit. For Artic Core's part, it requires some investment before you get there, but the road can be short and especially since the demand is huge. When it comes to centers for crypto validation, there are still few in the Nordic region. After this industry has experienced a lot of adversity in China, the need is at a record level in the Nordic region. As cryptocurrency continues to gain acceptance and prove that it can act as a currency and value reference, it is not unlikely that Artic Core can also make very profitable operations against blockchain technology. Artic Core will take over the first data center on 16 November this year. This should facilitate both HPC and Blockchain validation.\n\nLokotech AS is probably best known by the Harmonychain company\\`s, this because it was most visible during the listing. Lokotech works with nothing less than ASIC computers that have the specific work area to validate crypto transactions. More specifically, they work against the SHA-256 algorithm (Bitcoin mining) and the Scrypth algorithm (Litecoin and Doge). An ASIC costs between $ 3,000 and $ 20,000, depending on efficiency and Hash performance. Harmonychain claims to have LOI orders of \\~ 45,000 units for Scrypt mining by Litecoin / Doge already. This has attracted attention and been questioned as it is a question of seriously high amounts. This represents approximately NOK 4 billion if an ASIC (Bulldozer as Lokotech calls it) costs $ 10,000. Locotech's product is potentially far more energy efficient than its competitors. When Lokotech simulates its design, it is 4 times more efficient than the competitor's best model. Earlier this summer, this simulation was not as promising as now.\n\nThat was a short intro to what Harmonychain is. When you look at the chart for harmonychain, you see that the stock received a sharp correction down in June. This correction came on the news that Bitmain, which is the world's largest producer of ASICs for block chain validation, has a competing ASIC for Litecoin and Doge they will deliver in November with 2.77 MH / Joule energy efficiency. At this point, Lokotech's Bulldozer could deliver 5 MH / Joule, but the market still reacted very negatively to this. Furthermore, Harmonychain further corrected down on June 28 when it was communicated to the market that they struggled to get performance (number of MH / s) on the chip itself which could mean that they had to use a high number of chips which can be expensive. This will typically increase production costs significantly. This sent Harmonychain down to NOK 0,50 per share, which amounts to a market cap of approximately NOK 85 million. It was a value that was below Harmonychain's cash balance in the account.\n\nNow Harmonychain have fixed these problems. They announced on 16 August that they have succeeded in drastically improving performance per chip so that Bulldozer is again commercially competitive. Harmonychain could also report that their chip currently manages without manual place and route over 10 MH / Joule (this will probably be further improved in the future). This is almost 4 times more energy efficient than Bitmains L7. This is something that will significantly contribute to reducing operating expenses on Blockchain validation farms. With ever-increasing pressure on energy prices (140 EUR / MWh in Europe compared to 55 EUR / MWh a couple of years ago) that follows as a result of the world converting and removing polluting and cheap power from coal and oil, it is now assumed that Harmonychain's product is considered very competitive and necessary into the future. This is both for environmental reasons and due to operational costs. As an investor, I think then that there is a good chance that the order books will be full and that Harmonychain can take the liberty of good margins.\n\nThe Q2 result shows that Harmonychain burns only NOK 3 million in the quarter and still has more than NOK 83 million in the account. I'm unsure of all the factors that contribute to this, but I expects that their approved tax discovery application from the Research Council (19% refund of research) contributes to this as well. Harmonychain can keep going as it does now for 6 years without revenue.\n\n**Assessment of Harmonychain from a Lokotech perspective:**\n\nWhile harmonychain was traded at prices 2 times higher than now (&gt; 40 million shares), Multi Project Wafer was placed 4 to 5 months ahead in time on the Gant chart. But it is important to remember that this chip had significantly lower performance. Now Multi Project Wafer is on the agenda 5 to 6 months ahead while the performance of the chip is significantly improved and significantly better than Bitmain's L7. The operating costs of Lokotech's chip in Blockchain validation should be up to 4 times cheaper. That will make a big difference. Not only this, the importance of an energy efficient chip has increased in a beneficial direction. This at the same time as miners have been thrown out of China and therefore do not have access to cheap coal power or other shady shortcuts there. Based on this alone, one might think that Harmonychain is now relatively cheaply priced compared to before. The company incorporates at least as competitive technology as before, in an environment that required Harmonychain's technology to a much greater extent than 1/2 year ago. Should one believe that they have an order of 45,000 Bulldozers (sales price in scale billions)? Other Relative Comparisons one can make is looking at the marketcap of the competitors. All these companies they compete with like Bitmain and Nvidia have market caps of many hundreds of NOK billions. Harmonychain has a market cap of NOK 140 million. The comparison is a bit silly as Bitmain and NVIDIA have many products in large markets, but it still tells a bit about what Harmonychain can reach for if they succeed in an international market. If Harmonychain succeeds in making a competitive ASIC Scrypt miner, for example, they can clearly have the potential to be priced at NOK 10 billion. This is one of the things that makes Harmonychain a very exciting company.\n\n**Assessment of Harmonychain from an Artic Core perspective:**\n\nHow much does a data center earn. There are probably many in the industry who can say a good deal about this. But I as a user of calculation clusters from the oil industry know that these cost a lot and there are many factors to consider. The data center that Harmonychain is starting now is 1000 m2. Basefarm has rapidly growing revenues in Norway and had sales of NOK 768 million in 2020 with an operating profit of NOK 131 million. There are several such examples and all show good margins. Now Harmonychain is not up and running yet, but they will take over the first building on November 16 and I reckon that they will soon be up and running with revenue-generating activity. If they were to manage NOK 40 million turnover from the data center in 2022, it alone would easily take Harmonychain to positive operation. There are great opportunities for growth for Artic Core in HPC and Blockchain validation. The synergies are extra large the day Artic Core can have Lokotech's ASICs to offer as collocated Blockchain validation. If payment is according to the Royalty model, this could be lucrative as long as the crypto market remains relevant.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nWhen you look back at Lokotech and Artic Core, it is clearly Lokotech that has the most to say in the short term, but Artic Core can and does develop to become important. Both because the company will make money for Harmonychain while in early development but also because companies that run data centers can consider themselves very important in the data-intensive world of the future. And there is a lot of money to be made here. If you look at the companies mentioned above, they are all like a billion companies with steady growth from year to year. There are great opportunities in Norway due to political stability, clean and cheap power. Harmonychains two companies are thus helping to create security at the same time as there is an insane upside through Locotech's tech.\n\n**In summary, I think that Harmonychain is cheaper now and makes a much better bet now than before in 2021.**\n\nThe company Artic Core had little going on this spring, but now they actually have a data hall under construction in November and something going on. I think it will be especially nice to follow as news of new contracts in the data center comes in while you can follow the further development of Lokotech's Multi project Wafer which is now planned for March 2022. Lokotech's product significantly improved and also has become more relevant as power prices go up drastically while energy efficiency and sustainability have come even higher on the agenda. Last but not least, crypto has consolidated its position as a means of payment in the world after Bitcoin has now begun to see acceptance among Fiat countries as well as larger institutional investors and hedge funds continuing their exposure.\n\n**Triggers:**\n\n\u00b7  Update on Locotech's chip. Manual place and route is expected to provide further improved performance. Updates typically come in the middle of each month.\n\n\u00b7  Advance sale of Bulldozer or new LOI to order Bulldozer. Be aware that this can begin as early as 9 months before the product hits the market.\n\n\u00b7  New contracts for Arctic Core.\n\n\u00b7  Interest for the purchase of Harmonychain. \n\n\u00b7  Bitcoin rally.\n\nI have looked over several cases on the stock exchange and find few cases where mcap is a little over NOK 100 million while success can bring us to mcap in scale several NOK billion within a little more than a year if they succeed. I had the pleasure of finding other stocks that went more than + 1000% in 2020. They started at a few hundred million mcap and several of these are now priced at billions and are waiting for more. In other words, it can happen and it is up to us to seize these opportunities when one sees them. Among the Top 20 shareholders, I am probably the one with the cheapest entry now and I think I have been lucky as harmonychain can quickly cost as much at the end of the year as when listing. I can of course be overly positive to the company also because of my position, but it is up to you to consider that. Of course, it can also turn out that all the crypto experts will suddenly turn out to be wrong. But I think that buying harmonychain now 5 months after the last crypto rally at the place we are now in crypto bullrun should be a good crypto exposure if you are looking for something like that.",
