In addition, he hasn't sold any of his shares.\n\nGoogle and $ATVI announced a deal Friday worth millions. For anyone saying the date in the article is wrong here, on Twitter Oracle stated \"Google struck secret deals worth \"hundreds of millions\" of dollars with developers like Activision\" at 1:05 PM EST. By doing a simple Google search of the Google and Activision deal, you will notice Business Insider changed the date to make it look hidden, but the original article below has the time stamp on Friday.\n\n9/3 87C has had an open interest of 10K+ since 8/23\n\nMorgan Stanley came out with an article recently seeing a $120 price target.\n\nThe legal stuff is priced in. The stock has consolidated and started an upward trend. In the World of Warcraft Shadowlands 9.1.5 update, the company addressed the issue the lawsuit was covering and suggests they are going in the correct direction. The update comes out the same week of 9/3.\n\nIf we open $85 Monday, I can easily see this stock hitting $87-$90 easily. The main catalyst here is the Google deal which the media hasn't publicized enough. The fact that someone bought 10K calls on 8/23 and hasn't sold them is the biggest indicator here for me along with the Google deal. The IV on calls Friday jumped and $ATVI held its gains. \n\n\n\nGoogle and $ATVI deal source: https://www.businessinsider.com/epic-google-project-hug-play-store-secret-deal-velocity-program-2021-8\n\nPeter Nolan purchasing shares source: http://openinsider.com/insider/Nolan-Peter-J/1243589\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718877/000135202721000068/xslF345X03/wf-form4_162855019169820.xml\n\nMorgan Stanley Source:https://daily2dailynews.com/morgan-stanley-sees-45-upside-in-activision-blizzard-time-to-buy-atvi-shares-invezz/\n\nOracle Twitter Source: https://ibb.co/vwYV3bv",

        "selftext": "In spite of the \"SPACs are dead\" zeitgeist, thanks to the SPAC frenzy during the bubble SPAC teams in general undoubtedly have more high quality sponsors now than ever before. Bad price action, pessimistic sentiment and the arb trap are what they are, but more legit unicorn list companies have DA'd since the crash than the entire history of SPACs prior to that, and quality companies continue to DA at competitive multiples to competition. Many of these SPAC teams have significant reputations on the line and are expected to deliver high quality long term investments, regardless of short term trading action.\n\nSince I am predominantly a pre-DA warrants investor, when vetting SPAC teams I like to look for: \n\na.) past successful SPAC experience; \n\nb.) high level of specialized experience in the sector of focus (for example, FTPA/FTVI/HERA/SCLE's Betsy Cohen and ACQR's Steven McLaughlin are specialized experts at fintech and know the field like the back of their hand). This is one of the highest indicators of long-term success.\n\nc.) past C-suite experience at high level companies. Below is a list of Fortune 200 companies' former C-Suite execs, Chairmen of the Board and/or Presidents currently on or advising SPAC teams. *I included Directors for Fortune 15 only, but many SPACs have Fortune 200 Directors.

        "selftext": "Boilerplate Company Description:\n&gt;Digerati Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: DTGI) is a provider of cloud services specializing in UCaaS (Unified Communications as a Service) solutions for the business market. Through its operating subsidiaries T3 Communications (T3com.com) and Nexogy (Nexogy.com), the Company is meeting the global needs of businesses seeking simple, flexible, reliable, and cost-effective communication and network solutions including cloud PBX, cloud telephony, cloud WAN, cloud call center, cloud mobile, and the delivery of digital oxygen on its broadband network. Digerati has developed a robust integration platform to fuel mergers and acquisitions in a highly fragmented market as it delivers business solutions on its carrier-grade network and Only in the Cloud\u2122.\n\n\nDTGI is a stock I\u2019ve been collecting since they acquired Nexogy and ActivePBX last Fall and posted a massive 140% revenue increase on their last earnings. The company has been steadily turning itself around with a new strategy that it began implementing a few years ago. The company has grown from around $200k in annual revenue to $15 million and growing. Much of this is thanks to the aforementioned acquisitions, each of which continue to grow as part of DTGI. \n\nLast year the company hired Maxim Group to help it manage a transition to getting listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Obviously this is a big hurdle for a small company who's stock is trading for pennies. Yesterday the company filed an S-1 to raise at least $11.5 million while also signaling an imminent RS. This is a painful but necessary step to raise the working capital and minimum share price necessary to be listed on the Nasdaq. As the filing states, \"We will not proceed with this offering in the event the Common Stock and Warrants are not approved for listing on Nasdaq.\"\nhttps://www.otcmarkets.com/filing/html?id=15154709&amp;guid=PkO1kndLS8w6N3h \n\nZack's SCR recently initiated some coverage on this stock and gave a price target of 0.21 (currently trading for approximately 0.12 to 0.13). https://scr.zacks.com/news/news-details/2021/DTGI-A-Roll-Up-Play-in-the-Fast-Growing-Fragmented-UCaaS-Market-article/default.aspx\n\nHere are some highlights from the Zack's Report:\n&gt;*Digerati sells Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) to SMBs primarily in Texas and Florida. UCaaS brings VoIP, video conferencing, instant messaging, and collaboration tools together on one platform that is hosted in the cloud. As well as being more cost effective and flexible in the office, it allows workers to enjoy all the features of an office-based system remotely and gives businesses more choices in the applications it chooses. Digerati\u2019s UCaaS solution also integrates with systems like Microsoft Teams and Oracle NetSuite, becoming the cloud telco engine behind these popular systems.  \n*UCaaS solutions primarily replace premised- based systems making maintenance and upgrades easier and cheaper for the client. Digerati specializes in providing service with superior customer service to the large telcos that are the usual providers to these businesses.  \n*Digerati is in the early stages of its roll up strategy funded by its new financing partnership with Post Road Group. In November 2020, it bought Nexogy and ActivePBX for approximately $12 million, the two of which are expected to add at least $8 million in annual sales and $1.5 million in EBITDA. It plans to continue to buy companies opportunistically and accretively.  \n*Seasoned management that successfully has built and sold other public telecom and software companies and created solid returns for investors runs the company.  \n*The UCaaS industry is highly fragmented and growing rapidly. Fifty percent of the US market is served by local and regional providers. The global UCaaS market is currently $38.7 billion and expected to be $169 billion by 2027, or a CAGR of 23.5%.  \n*The company trades at a fully diluted (using 273 million shares) enterprise value of $44 million or 2.9 times its calendar 2021 estimated sales of $15.3 million versus its peers who trade at 7.1 times. As its growth strategy, improved margins, and positive cash flow are evidenced in the future, we believe it could trade closer to the peer group. \n\nI'm not necessarily encouraging anyone to rush out and buy this stock immediately, but I think it should be on everyone's watch list. Obviously dilution and an imminent RS is going to be strong headwinds for the near term, but here is what you should be watching:\n*Offering and RS is dependent on acceptance into Nasdaq. Uplisting, along with so many other improving metrics, will help bring a lot of non-retail interest back to the stock. \n*Earnings Report is due late this month or early Sept. Last report was amazing, and this one should be good and show further progress.\n*DTGI's subsidiary Nexogy is partnered with Sandler Partners, which will help grow it's sales. \n*Further acquisitions are expected. As the CEO stated in an article from April: \"I can\u2019t currently disclose specifics, but we\u2019re looking at [further acquisition] opportunities here in Texas and in Florida.\"\n\nFurther info on the growth of this company is outlined in this video with the CEO: https://digerati-inc.com/proactive-interview-140-growth/",

(It may be because of my bad English\ud83d\ude02)\n\n  \nI have no idea what to do so I post this issue on Reddit.\n\nIt would be great to tell me where can I query Sun Microsystems stock issue.  \nThank you for reading this.",
