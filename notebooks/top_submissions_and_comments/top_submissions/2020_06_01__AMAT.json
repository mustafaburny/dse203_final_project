I did a Double calendar yesterday on AMAT with the following Legs C: 57.5 P: 52.5 expy 6/12 7/17 for 310 debit price.\n\nAMAT went up to 57.94 today and currently the strategy is -14$. I ran the strategy through paperMoney but I\u2019m not clear on one thing.\n\nMy question is, if my short with an expy 6/12 of C57.5 gets exercised, will RH close out my long to settle and I just take the current loss?\n\nI\u2019m pretty new to this strategy so if I need to clarify anything please ask.\n\nThanks in advance!",
