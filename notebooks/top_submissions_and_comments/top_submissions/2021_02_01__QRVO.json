        "selftext": "This will be long....Sorry in advance. I decided I'd like to research Michael Burry since I've seen so many people talking about him on here and this is just what I've discovered about him and his methods.\n\n**Quick Facts:**\n\n* Founder of hedge fund Scion Capital 2000-2008. Closed to focus on personal investments\n* Best known for seeing the subprime mortgage crisis (2007-2010) and profiting from it\n* Investment style is built upon Benjamin Graham and David Dodd\u2019s 1934 book Security Analysis: \"All my stock picking is 100% based on the concept of a margin of safety.\"\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n* Michael Burry's strategy as he states is not very complex. He tries to buy shares of unpopular companies when the look like roadkill, and sell them when they've been cleaned up a bit. Lets take a look at his Q2 2020 Positions, top buys, and top sells. There are a few that are not big surprises but check it out.\n\n|Stock|Shares|Market Value|% of Portfolio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|GOOG / Alphabet Inc Class C (CALL)|80,000\t| $113,089,000 | 35.87 |\n| FB / Facebook Inc (CALL) | 93,200 | $21,163,000 | 6.71 |\n| BKNG / Booking Holdings Inc (CALL) | 11,600 | $18,471,000 | 5.86 |\n| GS / Goldman Sachs Group (CALL) | 73,600 | $14,545,000 | 4.61 |\n| GME / Gamestop Corp | 2,750,000 | $11,935,000 | 3.79 |\n| WDC / Western Digital Inc (CALL) | 270,000 | $11,921,000 | 3.78 |\n| BBBY / Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc | 1,000,000 | $10,600,000 | 3.36 |\n| DISCA / Discovery Inc | 500,000 | $10,550,000 | 3.35 |\n| TCOM / Trip.com Inc | 325,000 | $8,424,000 | 2.67 |\n| QRVO / Qorvo Inc | 75,000 | $8,290,000 | 2.63 |\n\n* **Top Buys**\n   * GOOG / Alphabet Inc Class C (CALL)\n   * FB / Facebook Inc (CALL)\n   * BKNG / Booking Holdings Inc (CALL)\n   * GS / Goldman Sachs Group (CALL)\n   * WDC / Western Digital Inc (CALL)\n* **Top Sells**\n   * Jack / Jack In The Box Inc\n   * FB / Facebook Inc\n   * BA / Boeing Inc\n   * MAXR / Maxar Technologies Ltd\n   * QRVO / Qorvo Inc\n\nMr. Burry's weapon of choice is his **research** and that it's critical for him to understand a company's value before laying down a dime and that 100% of his stock picking is based on the concept of margin of safety introduced in the book \"Security Analysis\" which I am reading through right now and dang is it huge lol. He also states that he has his own version of their technique, but that the net is that he wants to protect his downside to prevent permanent loss of capital. Specific, known catalyst are not necessary. Sheer, outrageous value is enough.\n\nHe cares little about the level of the general market and puts few restrictions on potential investments. They can be large-cap stocks, small cap, mid cap, micro cap, tech or non-tech and finds out-of-favor industries a particularly fertile ground for best-of-breed shares at **steep discounts**.\n\n**How does he determine the discount?**\n\n* Focuses on free cash flow and enterprise value (Market capitalization less cash plus debt)\n* Screen companies by look at enterprise value/EBITDA ratio. Accepted ratio varies with the industry and it position in the economic cycle\n* If stock passes loose screen, looks harder to determine specific price and value of a company\n   * Takes into account off-balance sheet items and true free cash flow\n   * Ignores price-earning ratios\n   * Return of equity is deceptive and dangerous\n   * Prefers minimal debt\n   * Adjust book value to a realistic number\n* Invest in rare birds - asset plays, and to a lesser extent, arbitrage opportunities and companies selling at less than two-thirds of net value\n* Will mix in with companies favored by Warren Buffet **IF** they become available at good prices. Deserving of longer holding periods.\n\n**How many Stocks does he hold?**\n\n* Likes to hold 12 to 18 stocks diversified among various depressed industries, and tends to be fully invested. Provides enough room for his best ideas and helps with volatility.\n* Feels volatility is no relation to risk.\n\n**Tax Implications**\n\n* Not concerned much about tax. Know his portfolio turnover will generally exceed 50% annually, and at 20% the long-term tax benefits of low-turnover pretty much disappear.\n\n**When he buys**\n\n* He mixes barebones technical analysis into his strategy. \n* Prefers to buy within 10% to 15% of a 52-week low that has shown itself to offer some price support. If a stock other than a rare bird breaks a new low, in most cases he cuts the loss.\n   * Balances the fact that he is turning his back on potentially greater value with the fact that since implementing this rule he hasn't had a single misfortunate blow up his entire portfolio\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In the end, investing is neither a science nor an art - it is a scientific art.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Works Cited**\n\n[https://acquirersmultiple.com/2020/08/michael-burrys-top-10-holdings-q2-2020-plus-top-buys-sells/](https://acquirersmultiple.com/2020/08/michael-burrys-top-10-holdings-q2-2020-plus-top-buys-sells/)\n\n[https://acquirersmultiple.com/2017/11/michael-burry-search-for-unpopular-companies-that-look-like-road-kill/](https://acquirersmultiple.com/2017/11/michael-burry-search-for-unpopular-companies-that-look-like-road-kill/)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael\\_Burry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry)",

        "selftext": "Friday 26 February 2021\n\n*Live Updates*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background:**\n\n* My discount bot to help Reddit. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/\"boomer\" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.\n\n**Key:**\n\n* Penny stocks are very risky.\n* Pharma companies are very risky.\n* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.\n* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.\n* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).\n* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.\n* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.\n* Take the \"Calls\" as very discounted, and \"Potentially A Call\" as somewhat discounted.\n* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.\n* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.\n* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**At Close of Thursday**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Batch 1:**\n\n* BA\tBoeing Co\t216.45\n* UAL\tUnited Airlines Holdings Inc\t51.78\n* ADBE\tAdobe Inc\t459.16\n* ANSS\tANSYS, Inc.\t338.46\n* ADSK\tAutodesk, Inc.\t284.03\n* PAYC\tPaycom Software Inc\t368.31\n* CRM\t[salesforce.com](https://salesforce.com), inc.\t231.08\n* SNPS\tSynopsys, Inc.\t244.09\n* TSLA\tTesla Inc\t682.22\n* FBHS\tFortune Brands Home &amp; Security Inc\t83.48\n* BBY\tBest Buy Co Inc\t102.94\n* PYPL\tPaypal Holdings Inc\t253.94\n* CTAS\tCintas Corporation\t328.05\n* CPRT\tCopart, Inc.\t106.92\n* HSIC\tHenry Schein, Inc.\t61.89\n* RMD\tResMed Inc.\t194.98\n* WELL\tWelltower Inc\t70.28\n* DHI\tD.

        "selftext": "Hi! I've been getting into investing a lot recently, and I'm doing this mainly for my own experience. I'll take any feedback or comments y'all have. Let me know what you think of my first list!\n\nTo start off, I want to disclose how I picked this list. I used Morgan Stanley's stock screener to find tickers with their \"overweight\" rating and a price below their given price target (if applicable). Next, I would cross-reference that with RH and Zack's stock analysis. Finally, I would search for each ticker on Reddit in order to see what the sentiment towards the stock was. After compiling the list, I went through each stock individually again and assigned it a ranking of 1-5 (1 being safe, 5 being more speculative/risky), as well as providing a hypothetical dollar amount that I would invest in at the current price.\n\nThe goal of this list was to pick a balanced portfolio between aggressive growth and long term consistency. I have a huge bias towards semiconductors, biomedical, tech, and industrial/material.\n\nI'll start with the stocks I gave a 1 rating\n\n1. MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, FB, AAPL ($8k in each)\n\nI believe these will be here for a loooong time as well as continue to grow. These seem pretty safe to me and make up the foundation of this portfolio\n\nNow we get to stocks with a 2 rating. These are my favorites, as I see them having high growth potential and staying power (still riskier than 1s, however)\n\n2. NVDA, AMD, TXG, AMAT, MT, VALE, RTX, TDG, QRVO, NIO, TSLA ($5k in each)\n\n Now we get on to the 3s! These will follow a similar pattern of higher risk, less amount invested.\n\n3. TER, LRCX, ON, MCHP, FSLY, CRSR, RDSB, DOCU ($3k in each)\n\nNow we get to the 4s. These are mostly speculative\n\n4. SPCE, ANTM, NET, ACAD, ABCL ($2k in each)\n\nThat list was pretty short. The 5s will be the most risky/most speculative. They will have the lowest amount invested in them.\n\n5. TGH, SEDG, HUM, AMKR.\n\nOh and positions: 20 VOO, 62 QQQ, 28 LIT, and 54 PLTR. If you made it to the end of this post, thank you!",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, February 4, 2021**\n\nStocks rose again today, extending this week\u2019s remarkable rally further. The market\u2019s quick recovery is encouraging given last week was the market\u2019s worst since October. Market participants largely shook off concerns over heightened volatility following last week\u2019s historic, Reddit-fueled rally in stocks like Gamestop (GME) and AMC and turned their attention back to corporate earnings reports and positive news on the vaccine and stimulus fronts coming out of Washington. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.12% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.18% up, and the Dow (DIA) closed 1.10% up.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled Senate voted to move forward with a process to fast track approval of President Biden\u2019s new coronavirus stimulus package. The Senate opened debates on budget resolutions for the fiscal year of 2021, with the intention of including parts of Biden\u2019s stimulus package with a simple majority.  In Congress, budget resolutions only need a simply 50+1 majority rather than the 60-vote supermajority required to pass major bills. In this manner, Democrats would be able to pass the stimulus without Republican support. The House of Representatives is expected to adopt a similar move soon. \"With this budget resolution, the Democratic Congress is paving the way for the landmark Biden-Harris coronavirus package that will crush the virus and deliver real relief to families and communities in need,\" Pelosi and Schumer said in a joint statement. As a reminder, in the Senate, there remains a 50/50 split between Democrats and Republicans, but Kamala Harris, as the Vice President, has the power to cast a tie-breaking vote if need be.\n\nToday, the White House announced a plan to ship coronavirus vaccines directly to retail pharmacies like CVS in an effort to boost the pace of vaccinations. The move is expected to raise the [weekly supply of shots by 1 million to 11.5 million.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-increased-vaccine-supply-initial-launch-of-the-federal-retail-pharmacy-program-and-expansion-of-fema-reimbursement-to-states/)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Some notable earnings after the bell are: Snap (SNAP), Gilead (GILD), Pinterest (PINS) and Peloton (PTON) after market close.\n* Weekly Unemployment claims came in at 779,000, below the 830,000 estimate.\n* Ford (F) said it will cut its output of F-150 pickups due to a shortage in the semiconductors needed.\n* Gamestop (GME) and other \u201cmeme stocks\u201d continue to be under heavy pressure. Gamestop pulled back another 42% today, with the stock around $53 at the time of writing.\n* Apple (AAPL) is close to a deal with Hyundai-Kia to make an Apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at a Kia plant in Georgia, CNBC reported late Wednesday, citing \u201cmultiple\u201d sources who briefed CNBC on the plan. This is a developing story we will keep track of\n* AbbVie (ABBV) with 3 price target raises.

        "selftext": "This will be long....Sorry in advance. I decided I'd like to research Michael Burry since I've seen so many people talking about him on here and this is just what I've discovered about him and his methods.\n\n**Quick Facts:**\n\n* Founder of hedge fund Scion Capital 2000-2008. Closed to focus on personal investments\n* Best known for seeing the subprime mortgage crisis (2007-2010) and profiting from it\n* Investment style is built upon Benjamin Graham and David Dodd\u2019s 1934 book Security Analysis: \"All my stock picking is 100% based on the concept of a margin of safety.\"\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n* Michael Burry's strategy as he states is not very complex. He tries to buy shares of unpopular companies when the look like roadkill, and sell them when they've been cleaned up a bit. Lets take a look at his Q2 2020 Positions, top buys, and top sells. There are a few that are not big surprises but check it out.\n\n|Stock|Shares|Market Value|% of Portfolio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|GOOG / Alphabet Inc Class C (CALL)|80,000\t| $113,089,000 | 35.87 |\n| FB / Facebook Inc (CALL) | 93,200 | $21,163,000 | 6.71 |\n| BKNG / Booking Holdings Inc (CALL) | 11,600 | $18,471,000 | 5.86 |\n| GS / Goldman Sachs Group (CALL) | 73,600 | $14,545,000 | 4.61 |\n| GME / Gamestop Corp | 2,750,000 | $11,935,000 | 3.79 |\n| WDC / Western Digital Inc (CALL) | 270,000 | $11,921,000 | 3.78 |\n| BBBY / Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc | 1,000,000 | $10,600,000 | 3.36 |\n| DISCA / Discovery Inc | 500,000 | $10,550,000 | 3.35 |\n| TCOM / Trip.com Inc | 325,000 | $8,424,000 | 2.67 |\n| QRVO / Qorvo Inc | 75,000 | $8,290,000 | 2.63 |\n\n* **Top Buys**\n   * GOOG / Alphabet Inc Class C (CALL)\n   * FB / Facebook Inc (CALL)\n   * BKNG / Booking Holdings Inc (CALL)\n   * GS / Goldman Sachs Group (CALL)\n   * WDC / Western Digital Inc (CALL)\n* **Top Sells**\n   * Jack / Jack In The Box Inc\n   * FB / Facebook Inc\n   * BA / Boeing Inc\n   * MAXR / Maxar Technologies Ltd\n   * QRVO / Qorvo Inc\n\nMr. Burry's weapon of choice is his **research** and that it's critical for him to understand a company's value before laying down a dime and that 100% of his stock picking is based on the concept of margin of safety introduced in the book \"Security Analysis\" which I am reading through right now and dang is it huge lol. He also states that he has his own version of their technique, but that the net is that he wants to protect his downside to prevent permanent loss of capital. Specific, known catalyst are not necessary. Sheer, outrageous value is enough.\n\nHe cares little about the level of the general market and puts few restrictions on potential investments. They can be large-cap stocks, small cap, mid cap, micro cap, tech or non-tech and finds out-of-favor industries a particularly fertile ground for best-of-breed shares at **steep discounts**.\n\n**How does he determine the discount?**\n\n* Focuses on free cash flow and enterprise value (Market capitalization less cash plus debt)\n* Screen companies by look at enterprise value/EBITDA ratio. Accepted ratio varies with the industry and it position in the economic cycle\n* If stock passes loose screen, looks harder to determine specific price and value of a company\n   * Takes into account off-balance sheet items and true free cash flow\n   * Ignores price-earning ratios\n   * Return of equity is deceptive and dangerous\n   * Prefers minimal debt\n   * Adjust book value to a realistic number\n* Invest in rare birds - asset plays, and to a lesser extent, arbitrage opportunities and companies selling at less than two-thirds of net value\n* Will mix in with companies favored by Warren Buffet **IF** they become available at good prices. Deserving of longer holding periods.\n\n**How many Stocks does he hold?**\n\n* Likes to hold 12 to 18 stocks diversified among various depressed industries, and tends to be fully invested. Provides enough room for his best ideas and helps with volatility.\n* Feels volatility is no relation to risk.\n\n**Tax Implications**\n\n* Not concerned much about tax. Know his portfolio turnover will generally exceed 50% annually, and at 20% the long-term tax benefits of low-turnover pretty much disappear.\n\n**When he buys**\n\n* He mixes barebones technical analysis into his strategy. \n* Prefers to buy within 10% to 15% of a 52-week low that has shown itself to offer some price support. If a stock other than a rare bird breaks a new low, in most cases he cuts the loss.\n   * Balances the fact that he is turning his back on potentially greater value with the fact that since implementing this rule he hasn't had a single misfortunate blow up his entire portfolio\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In the end, investing is neither a science nor an art - it is a scientific art.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Works Cited**\n\n[https://acquirersmultiple.com/2020/08/michael-burrys-top-10-holdings-q2-2020-plus-top-buys-sells/](https://acquirersmultiple.com/2020/08/michael-burrys-top-10-holdings-q2-2020-plus-top-buys-sells/)\n\n[https://acquirersmultiple.com/2017/11/michael-burry-search-for-unpopular-companies-that-look-like-road-kill/](https://acquirersmultiple.com/2017/11/michael-burry-search-for-unpopular-companies-that-look-like-road-kill/)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael\\_Burry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry)",

        "selftext": "Hi! I've been getting into investing a lot recently, and I'm doing this mainly for my own experience. I'll take any feedback or comments y'all have. Let me know what you think of my first list!\n\nTo start off, I want to disclose how I picked this list. I used Morgan Stanley's stock screener to find tickers with their \"overweight\" rating and a price below their given price target (if applicable). Next, I would cross-reference that with RH and Zack's stock analysis. Finally, I would search for each ticker on Reddit in order to see what the sentiment towards the stock was. After compiling the list, I went through each stock individually again and assigned it a ranking of 1-5 (1 being safe, 5 being more speculative/risky), as well as providing a hypothetical dollar amount that I would invest in at the current price.\n\nThe goal of this list was to pick a balanced portfolio between aggressive growth and long term consistency. I have a huge bias towards semiconductors, biomedical, tech, and industrial/material.\n\nI'll start with the stocks I gave a 1 rating\n\n1. MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, FB, AAPL ($8k in each)\n\nI believe these will be here for a loooong time as well as continue to grow. These seem pretty safe to me and make up the foundation of this portfolio\n\nNow we get to stocks with a 2 rating. These are my favorites, as I see them having high growth potential and staying power (still riskier than 1s, however)\n\n2. NVDA, AMD, TXG, AMAT, MT, VALE, RTX, TDG, QRVO, NIO, TSLA ($5k in each)\n\n Now we get on to the 3s! These will follow a similar pattern of higher risk, less amount invested.\n\n3. TER, LRCX, ON, MCHP, FSLY, CRSR, RDSB, DOCU ($3k in each)\n\nNow we get to the 4s. These are mostly speculative\n\n4. SPCE, ANTM, NET, ACAD, ABCL ($2k in each)\n\nThat list was pretty short. The 5s will be the most risky/most speculative. They will have the lowest amount invested in them.\n\n5. TGH, SEDG, HUM, AMKR.\n\nOh and positions: 20 VOO, 62 QQQ, 28 LIT, and 54 PLTR. If you made it to the end of this post, thank you!",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, February 4, 2021**\n\nStocks rose again today, extending this week\u2019s remarkable rally further. The market\u2019s quick recovery is encouraging given last week was the market\u2019s worst since October. Market participants largely shook off concerns over heightened volatility following last week\u2019s historic, Reddit-fueled rally in stocks like Gamestop (GME) and AMC and turned their attention back to corporate earnings reports and positive news on the vaccine and stimulus fronts coming out of Washington. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.12% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.18% up, and the Dow (DIA) closed 1.10% up.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled Senate voted to move forward with a process to fast track approval of President Biden\u2019s new coronavirus stimulus package. The Senate opened debates on budget resolutions for the fiscal year of 2021, with the intention of including parts of Biden\u2019s stimulus package with a simple majority.  In Congress, budget resolutions only need a simply 50+1 majority rather than the 60-vote supermajority required to pass major bills. In this manner, Democrats would be able to pass the stimulus without Republican support. The House of Representatives is expected to adopt a similar move soon. \"With this budget resolution, the Democratic Congress is paving the way for the landmark Biden-Harris coronavirus package that will crush the virus and deliver real relief to families and communities in need,\" Pelosi and Schumer said in a joint statement. As a reminder, in the Senate, there remains a 50/50 split between Democrats and Republicans, but Kamala Harris, as the Vice President, has the power to cast a tie-breaking vote if need be.\n\nToday, the White House announced a plan to ship coronavirus vaccines directly to retail pharmacies like CVS in an effort to boost the pace of vaccinations. The move is expected to raise the [weekly supply of shots by 1 million to 11.5 million.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-increased-vaccine-supply-initial-launch-of-the-federal-retail-pharmacy-program-and-expansion-of-fema-reimbursement-to-states/)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Some notable earnings after the bell are: Snap (SNAP), Gilead (GILD), Pinterest (PINS) and Peloton (PTON) after market close.\n* Weekly Unemployment claims came in at 779,000, below the 830,000 estimate.\n* Ford (F) said it will cut its output of F-150 pickups due to a shortage in the semiconductors needed.\n* Gamestop (GME) and other \u201cmeme stocks\u201d continue to be under heavy pressure. Gamestop pulled back another 42% today, with the stock around $53 at the time of writing.\n* Apple (AAPL) is close to a deal with Hyundai-Kia to make an Apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at a Kia plant in Georgia, CNBC reported late Wednesday, citing \u201cmultiple\u201d sources who briefed CNBC on the plan. This is a developing story we will keep track of\n* AbbVie (ABBV) with 3 price target raises.

        "selftext": "This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or \"counterfeit\" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split('|');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':\n                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res['volume']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you

Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",

        "selftext": "I need a little input from those of you that have more experience in investing than I do.\n\nThe past week or so has really started the wheels moving in my brain to start investing for real instead of playing with virtual stock trading apps.  I got swept up a little in the frenzy as of late but luckily I didn't put too much money into it, so in the grand scheme of things I didnt lose out too badly.  The one thing this whole fiasco did was make me pull the trigger and start investing for real.  \n\nNow that I got the FOMO out of my head, I decided I need to sit down and draw up an investment plan and see what I want to do.  So with all things built, I decided to build a foundation.\n\nMy main objective is to build my foundation out of a well diversified collective of main body stocks across the board.  I figured I would start off with primary stocks that are long term then have subcategories of those primary stocks that are traded more frequently than the primary stocks.\n\nWith me being rather new to actually doing this for real, I want to make sure my train of thought is on the right track.  Here is what I came up with.\n\nThe foundation stocks are in-\n\n\nAutomotive- Ford (F)\n\n\nEnergy- Williams Cos. (WMB)\n\n\nGreen energy- NextEra Energy (NEE)\n\n\nIndustry- Teradyne (TER)\n\n\nMedical- Pfizer (PFE)\n\n\nRestaurant- Yum! (YUM)\n\n\nBank/Financial- Bank of America (BOA) \n\n\nEntertainment- Sony (SNE)\n\nThen the subcategory stocks would be in more in the realm or automotive parts, biotech or medical manufacturers, food production, construction companies, so on and so on.\n\n\nWith what I have come up with, is this a good foundation as far as solid and diversified stocks or do I need to shuffle things around?  Or am I way off the mark as far as dividing stuff into primary -&gt; subcategory?\n\nAny I would be glad to hear what you guys say.",

        "selftext": "This will be long....Sorry in advance. I decided I'd like to research Michael Burry since I've seen so many people talking about him on here and this is just what I've discovered about him and his methods.\n\n**Quick Facts:**\n\n* Founder of hedge fund Scion Capital 2000-2008. Closed to focus on personal investments\n* Best known for seeing the subprime mortgage crisis (2007-2010) and profiting from it\n* Investment style is built upon Benjamin Graham and David Dodd\u2019s 1934 book Security Analysis: \"All my stock picking is 100% based on the concept of a margin of safety.\"\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n* Michael Burry's strategy as he states is not very complex. He tries to buy shares of unpopular companies when the look like roadkill, and sell them when they've been cleaned up a bit. Lets take a look at his Q2 2020 Positions, top buys, and top sells. There are a few that are not big surprises but check it out.\n\n|Stock|Shares|Market Value|% of Portfolio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|GOOG / Alphabet Inc Class C (CALL)|80,000\t| $113,089,000 | 35.87 |\n| FB / Facebook Inc (CALL) | 93,200 | $21,163,000 | 6.71 |\n| BKNG / Booking Holdings Inc (CALL) | 11,600 | $18,471,000 | 5.86 |\n| GS / Goldman Sachs Group (CALL) | 73,600 | $14,545,000 | 4.61 |\n| GME / Gamestop Corp | 2,750,000 | $11,935,000 | 3.79 |\n| WDC / Western Digital Inc (CALL) | 270,000 | $11,921,000 | 3.78 |\n| BBBY / Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc | 1,000,000 | $10,600,000 | 3.36 |\n| DISCA / Discovery Inc | 500,000 | $10,550,000 | 3.35 |\n| TCOM / Trip.com Inc | 325,000 | $8,424,000 | 2.67 |\n| QRVO / Qorvo Inc | 75,000 | $8,290,000 | 2.63 |\n\n* **Top Buys**\n   * GOOG / Alphabet Inc Class C (CALL)\n   * FB / Facebook Inc (CALL)\n   * BKNG / Booking Holdings Inc (CALL)\n   * GS / Goldman Sachs Group (CALL)\n   * WDC / Western Digital Inc (CALL)\n* **Top Sells**\n   * Jack / Jack In The Box Inc\n   * FB / Facebook Inc\n   * BA / Boeing Inc\n   * MAXR / Maxar Technologies Ltd\n   * QRVO / Qorvo Inc\n\nMr. Burry's weapon of choice is his **research** and that it's critical for him to understand a company's value before laying down a dime and that 100% of his stock picking is based on the concept of margin of safety introduced in the book \"Security Analysis\" which I am reading through right now and dang is it huge lol. He also states that he has his own version of their technique, but that the net is that he wants to protect his downside to prevent permanent loss of capital. Specific, known catalyst are not necessary. Sheer, outrageous value is enough.\n\nHe cares little about the level of the general market and puts few restrictions on potential investments. They can be large-cap stocks, small cap, mid cap, micro cap, tech or non-tech and finds out-of-favor industries a particularly fertile ground for best-of-breed shares at **steep discounts**.\n\n**How does he determine the discount?**\n\n* Focuses on free cash flow and enterprise value (Market capitalization less cash plus debt)\n* Screen companies by look at enterprise value/EBITDA ratio. Accepted ratio varies with the industry and it position in the economic cycle\n* If stock passes loose screen, looks harder to determine specific price and value of a company\n   * Takes into account off-balance sheet items and true free cash flow\n   * Ignores price-earning ratios\n   * Return of equity is deceptive and dangerous\n   * Prefers minimal debt\n   * Adjust book value to a realistic number\n* Invest in rare birds - asset plays, and to a lesser extent, arbitrage opportunities and companies selling at less than two-thirds of net value\n* Will mix in with companies favored by Warren Buffet **IF** they become available at good prices. Deserving of longer holding periods.\n\n**How many Stocks does he hold?**\n\n* Likes to hold 12 to 18 stocks diversified among various depressed industries, and tends to be fully invested.

So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably won\u2019t see a squeeze of GME\u2019s magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call \u201casymmetric upside\u201d (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons I\u2019ll describe below.\n\n**So what\u2019s the target?** ***Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)***. You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (can\u2019t make this up)\u2026now they\u2019re going to make us some Tendies\u2122 as well.\n\nFor some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public via a SPAC in 2016 (before SPAC's were as cool as they are today). The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and there\u2019s no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.\n\nThe company also has warrants from the SPAC (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $11.50 per one full share and expire in November 2021.\n\n**So what\u2019s the thesis?** We think there\u2019s an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.\n\n# Technical Thesis\n\n1. **High short interest = squeeze opportunity** \u2013 Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that we\u2019re aware of (can\u2019t really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds.\n2. **Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover** \u2013 Average 3-month daily trading volume of 1.4mm shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about *13+ DAYS* for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the WSB pool of capital (especially since many of us have our tendies tied up in GME right now). If you\u2019re looking for a bit of tendie diversification, this is the name.\n3. **The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside** \u2013 There\u2019s actually been option activity picking up on this company. ***On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for 2.6mm of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)****.* See [this report](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-friday-option-activity%3A-twnk-wdc-nvcr-2021-01-29). Most of those options were sold OTM at the $17.50 strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.\n\n# Fundamental Thesis\n\n1. **Snacking continues to be king.** Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of U.S. adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \\~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one.\n2. **Strong organic growth story**. Organic sales have grown \\~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing \u2013 and likely gaining share.\n3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***\n4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells cr\u00e8me wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess\u2019 existing distribution footprint.\n5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company\u2019s primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.\n\n# Potential Risks\n\n1. **Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.** The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend.\n2. **Pretty high leverage for a public company.** They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \\~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \\~4.5x in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \\~3.4x before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \\~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage.\n3. **Customer concentration.** The Company\u2019s largest customer is Walmart, which was \\~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \\~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I don\u2019t think retail stores will do anything irrational.\n4. **Rebound of COVID-19.** Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.\n\n# Appendix\n\n* **TWNK Q3'20 investor presentation**: [Q3'20 Investor Presentation (November 2020)](https://www.hostessbrands.com/static-files/2a95b8c5-1127-4d0c-867b-d9437adc9036)\n* TWNK acquisition of Voortman Cookies investor presentation: [Acquisition of Voortman Cookies (December 2019)](https://www.hostessbrands.com/static-files/27c9ebfa-9448-4987-ae0f-b6b23c794ee6)\n* **Reference for TWNK short interest:** [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWNK/key-statistics?p=TWNK)\n* **Reference for AMC short interest of 10-15%:** [S3 Partners Tweet (1/29/21)](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355987915105566721) and [AMC Short Interest Calculation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l9cjuc/amc_short_interest_is_often_overstated_and/)\n* ***Disclaimer: I own a position in the Stock (TWNK); Warrants (TWNKW); August 20, 2021 $17.50 Call Options (TWNK210820C17.5); and August 20, 2021 $20.00 Call Options (TWNK210820C20)***\n* ***Disclaimer: This is not financial advice and is purely written for entertainment purposes.

Hostess Brands is growing \u2013 and likely gaining share.\n3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***\n4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells cr\u00e8me wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess\u2019 existing distribution footprint.\n5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company\u2019s primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.\n\n# Potential Risks\n\n1. **Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.** The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend.\n2. **Pretty high leverage for a public company.** They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \\~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \\~4.5x in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \\~3.4x before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \\~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage.\n3. **Customer concentration.** The Company\u2019s largest customer is Walmart, which was \\~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \\~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I don\u2019t think retail stores will do anything irrational.\n4. **Rebound of COVID-19.** Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.\n\n# Appendix\n\n* **TWNK Q3'20 investor presentation**: [Q3'20 Investor Presentation (November 2020)](https://www.hostessbrands.com/static-files/2a95b8c5-1127-4d0c-867b-d9437adc9036)\n* TWNK acquisition of Voortman Cookies investor presentation: [Acquisition of Voortman Cookies (December 2019)](https://www.hostessbrands.com/static-files/27c9ebfa-9448-4987-ae0f-b6b23c794ee6)\n* **Reference for TWNK short interest:** [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWNK/key-statistics?p=TWNK)\n* **Reference for AMC short interest of 10-15%:** [S3 Partners Tweet (1/29/21)](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355987915105566721) and [AMC Short Interest Calculation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l9cjuc/amc_short_interest_is_often_overstated_and/)\n* ***Disclaimer: I own a position in the Stock (TWNK); Warrants (TWNKW); August 20, 2021 $17.50 Call Options (TWNK210820C17.5); and August 20, 2021 $20.00 Call Options (TWNK210820C20)*** \n* ***Disclaimer: This is not financial advice and is purely written for entertainment purposes.

        "selftext": "I posted this TWNK long thesis in r/stocks, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lafmq2/long_thesis_on_hostess_brands_twnk_owner_of/), but think it has a home in r/options as well given the 15% short interest, low IV, cheap options, and potential for gamma squeeze. Appreciate any and all thoughts.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n**Hostess Brands (TWNK)** has high (\\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is an iconic brand, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation. ***Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.***\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/sUYpaue](https://imgur.com/a/sUYpaue)\n\n\n# Intro\n\nSup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably won\u2019t see a squeeze of GME\u2019s magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call \u201casymmetric upside\u201d (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons I\u2019ll describe below.\n\n**So what\u2019s the target?** ***Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)***. You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (can\u2019t make this up)\u2026\n\nFor some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public in 2016. The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and there\u2019s no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.\n\nThe company also has warrants from the their IPO (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $11.50 per one full share and expire in November 2021.\n\n**So what\u2019s the thesis?** We think there\u2019s an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.\n\n# Technical Thesis\n\n1. **High short interest = squeeze opportunity** \u2013 Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that we\u2019re aware of (can\u2019t really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds.\n2. **Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover** \u2013 Average 3-month daily trading volume of 1.4mm shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about *13+ DAYS* for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the retail pool of capital. If you\u2019re looking for a bit of diversification, this is the name.\n3. **The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside** \u2013 There\u2019s actually been option activity picking up on this company. ***On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for 2.6mm of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)****.* See [this report](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-friday-option-activity%3A-twnk-wdc-nvcr-2021-01-29). Most of those options were sold OTM at the $17.50 strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.\n\n# Fundamental Thesis\n\n1. **Snacking continues to be king.** Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of U.S. adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \\~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one.\n2. **Strong organic growth story**. Organic sales have grown \\~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing \u2013 and likely gaining share.\n3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***\n4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells cr\u00e8me wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess\u2019 existing distribution footprint.\n5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company\u2019s primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens.

So I've been looking around for more near NAV SPACs which might target an ESG or sustainability focused company and I found these four.

        "selftext": "In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term\n\n\\~Very Long Post\\~ \\[Do NOT Read if you don't like comprehensive analysis\\]\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation.\n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also working with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with Xilinx , which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. Xilinx has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would create synergies. They are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they expect an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA.\n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach.\n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high demand the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax.\n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\n\nI think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, these are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.\n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology.\n\nThe company also has very good financials, with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once Intel also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all.\n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Lisa SU has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the company has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

AMD, yeah remember the company everyone seemingly forgot about despite posting huge growth consistently in 2020? Well they recently had earnings and suffered bigly along with most tech. Some highlights from their earnings:\n\n* Record revenue for the year with $9.76 billion in revenue\n* Q4 Revenue up 53% to $3.244 billion (also record quaterly revenue)\n* Gross profit up 53% to $1.451 billion\n* Net income up to $1.78 billion compared to $170 million a year ago\n* EPS up 867% (yes that is right) to $1.45 per share\n* Cash flow up to $554 million YoY\n* Q1 2021 guidance: 3.2B in revenue (79% YoY) and 46% gross margin\n* FY'2021 guidance: 37% increase in revenue YoY\n* Lets not forget their recent acquisition of Xilinx that will put them in a great position for the future\n\nSu bae has been delivering hard on her promises, and I see no reason for this momentum to not carry forward into 2021. They have gone on sale after earnings, and I can't wait to see what AMD has in store for 2021.",

        "selftext": "In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term\n\n\\~Very Long Post\\~ \\[Do NOT Read if you don't like comprehensive analysis\\]\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation.\n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also working with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with Xilinx , which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. Xilinx has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would create synergies. They are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they expect an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA.\n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach.\n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high demand the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax.\n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\n\nI think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, these are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.\n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology.\n\nThe company also has very good financials, with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once Intel also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all.\n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Lisa SU has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the company has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

AMD, yeah remember the company everyone seemingly forgot about despite posting huge growth consistently in 2020? Well they recently had earnings and suffered bigly along with most tech. Some highlights from their earnings:\n\n* Record revenue for the year with $9.76 billion in revenue\n* Q4 Revenue up 53% to $3.244 billion (also record quaterly revenue)\n* Gross profit up 53% to $1.451 billion\n* Net income up to $1.78 billion compared to $170 million a year ago\n* EPS up 867% (yes that is right) to $1.45 per share\n* Cash flow up to $554 million YoY\n* Q1 2021 guidance: 3.2B in revenue (79% YoY) and 46% gross margin\n* FY'2021 guidance: 37% increase in revenue YoY\n* Lets not forget their recent acquisition of Xilinx that will put them in a great position for the future\n\nSu bae has been delivering hard on her promises, and I see no reason for this momentum to not carry forward into 2021. They have gone on sale after earnings, and I can't wait to see what AMD has in store for 2021.",

Why??? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet\u2019s see - AMD is heavily invested in by big funds. AMD announces a record quarter, the stock begins to sell off!? Many people on r/amd_stock theorise this is institutional money trying to liquidate cash and take profits after getting hit by GME. \n\nBut wait, AMD short interest just rose from [52m to 107m.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l7uw06/short_interest_on_amd_has_doubled_from_52_million/ ) Up over 50% in 2 and a half weeks after the company grows 50% and produces record results..\n\n\n\nThen Robinhood adds AMD to the list of stocks you can only buy a limited amount of and limit it to ONE share. Wtf? \n\n\nAMD isn\u2019t part of any of the massive shorting going on in the market and is a pretty stable company. So why would they do this?

So while it\u2019s at a discount they want to stop you buying in so their buddies with the short positions can load up and get their money back after getting wrecked by GME, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening:**\n\nFunds with large positions in AMD are shorting the stock before selling off stock they previously held. This drops the price and they collect a nice bonus on the way out. \nThe short interest in the stock has increase drastically by over 50%, and of course between earnings and RH limiting trading we saw a number of hit piece articles with false information about AMD.

That\u2019s right, [MELVIN CAPITAL.](https://fintel.io/so/us/amd)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut here\u2019s one thing RH didn\u2019t think about. \nXilinx is about to be acquired by AMD in an all stock deal, this means both stocks move in unison with each other. And more importantly, the daily average trade volume of Xilinx is only 3m compared to AMDs 45.15m\n\nThis means if a number of people decide they like Xilinx stock, AMD will follow far faster than if they decided to simply like AMD stock. And since there\u2019s no limits on Xilinx people can currently like the stock as much as they want.\n\nSide note - If you *really* like Xilinx and hold until the deal is complete, you will be given 1.734 shares in AMD for every Xilinx share you own. If this deal happened right now at current prices, this means you would make around 10% on your investment compared to just holding the same amount in AMD.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Please note:** I am not a financial advisor, just some long term WSB member here to explain that if everyone jumped into Xilinx instead of AMD the shorts would get pretty screwed.
