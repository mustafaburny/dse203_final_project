        "selftext": "* The market opened slightly red but quickly reversed because JPow realized this was no way to start a New Year, with Chadsdaq and S&amp;P being propelled to green status thanks to Tim Apple and gang. DOW got further lifted by action from BA, GS, CVX, and INTC (who's really only being carried by MU). Small caps eclipsed SPX and IXIC today with RUT/IWM up as high as almost 2% during intraday high as value play starts looking more appealing. RUT closed up 1.7% and IWM closed up 1.61%.\n\n* \"I'm totes not dead.\" Says Jack Ma, according to a person familiar with the situation who's relaying the info to a CNBC  reporter on Ma's whereabouts. The beleaguered CEO who's in the crosshair of the CCP is keeping it easy and out of the limelight after running afoul of his overlords by talking up CCP's heavy handed action towards Ant Group. Who knew if your fucking financial empire touches the livelihood of 90% of the country there may be consequences if you don't toe the line. BABA closed the day up 5.51% to $240. Meanwhile, PDD touches new ATH and closed the day up 12.24% to $187 while JD is up 10.61% to $95.\n\n* The Chinese ADR/ADS sector gets a lift today partly thanks to NYSE's overnight about-face on delisting Chinese Telecoms. BILI hits new ATH and closed up 8.15% to $102.46 thanks to favorable reception from their secondary listing on the Heng Sheng\n\n* Semi sector is on a run today thanks to MU, with Citi upping, NAND and DRAM manufacturer from Sell all the way up to Buy with a PT of freaking $100 as we enter another cyclical season. RBC Capital also raised PT from $57 to $83, Deutsche Bank from $75 to $83. Will MU $90 be back in favor and no longer a meme strike? Find out later this week. F in the chat for MartyMoho. If only he bought fooking shares and ride through two more additional cyclical season and a global pandemic. Ez dub. MU closed up 4.33% to $77, LRCX closed up 3.46% to $494, and AMAT closed up 3% to $89. MU reports earnings this Thursday after market close.\n\n* GM pop 2% when news broke at 10:29 on positive US sales number from Q4, while shares were fading slightly as the market digest the news, eventually the positive momentum took over and shares closed the day up 2.84% to $41.66. ROKU pop to close up 5.44%, closing at $335 thanks to WFC analyst raising PT from $275 to $414 (yep) and keeping his overweight rating. \n\n* Today's big movers: FUBO was up as high as 21%, M-A-R-A was up as high 23% while B-N-G-O drilled more than -30% during intraday lows after an initial halt in the early mornings. FUBO closed up 12.83% to $27.35, M-A-R-A closed up 23.43% to $13.59, and B-N-G-O closed down -31.25% to $4.95.\n\n* The GA run-off election is on the market mindset as voters are heading to the polls. Meanwhile, Congress is set to confirm Biden's win over Trump, a procedural formality that generally receives little news coverage but not in the current timeline. Expect POTUS to rage over Pence on Twitter later tonight if the latter confirms Biden's Electoral College win. Look to weed and clean energy sector for pops if the Dems somehow wins both seat. No doubt many WSBer have already loaded up on FDs to showcase the sick gains porn tomorrow if the magic happens.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR is up more than 5% but those with OTM Jan 15 calls are likely having their ass handed to them by the greeks, while a similar story exist over at GME as the stock fades away morning gain to close the day up 0.70% as theta rampage $20c, $22c, and $23c (if your strike is even further out then RIP to you). MT and steel gang are faring better, with the stock retaking yesterday's high and closed up 2.84% to 24.63. Steel prices continues to rip and earnings will be early next month on Feb 11th.\n\n* The DOW closed up 167 pts to 0.55%, Nasdaq up 120 pts to 0.95%, S&amp;P up 26 pts to 0.71%, and RUT closed up 33 pts to 1.71%. Notable numbers tomorrow: ADP employment report at 8:15 AM ET, factory orders at 10 AM ET, EIA draw at 10:30 AM, and FOMC minutes at 2PM ET. \n\n(Yesterday's [recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqi8e8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_and_recent_market_driving/)).",

        "selftext": "(*Editor's note: It's a wild day for the market and the country, and I will try to be as neutral as possible despite the fuckery afoot)*.\n\n* Dems clinched the GA Senate run-off election as Warnock defeats Loeffler while Ossoff defeats Perdue (the first millennial Senator). As the results became more clear last night, futures took a deep dive particularly for NQ, while conversely small caps enjoys a favorable bump. The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. \n\n* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.\n\n* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.\n\n* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).\n\n* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.\n\n* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.\n\n* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.\n\n* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):\n\n    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. \n\n    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. \n\n    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.\n\n* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&amp;P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts. Stay in school kids and avoid storming federal buildings or Twitter will start banning your fucking account. (TWTR locks POTUS account for 12 hrs and is down -1.99% AH).\n\n(Yesterday's [recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr7ze8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_market_driving_news_jan_5/)).",

        "selftext": "**Stocks go bonkers while the Dems take Georgia. The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot &amp; Industrial stocks? Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news** \n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn\u2019t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.\n\nYesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Financials, Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small &amp; mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which show how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Financials, Green Energy &amp; [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new &amp; improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.\n\nYesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.\n\nIn some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.\n\nWhile in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business. \n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.\n\nSo, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, &amp; SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.\n\nWe also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.\n\nWe also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney &amp; Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.\n\nAnd on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would benefit them. \n\n[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs &amp; EVs.\n\nOn the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba &amp; Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continuing to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.\n\nMy opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn\u2019t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way, though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished higher and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn\u2019t base your investment on this.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market! \n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way, though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished higher and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn\u2019t base your investment on this.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**What is the impact of the Georgia Election on the Stock market? Is Alibaba going to recover or is it going down? GM outperforms in 2020, let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market recovering a good part of the losses from the first trading day of 2021, as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P4FW6dK) gained almost 1%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Jd46zGb) rose by .71% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cs47MP1) finished 167 points higher. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kH2gz8v) dropping by more than 6% after the huge spike on Monday as more than 70% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/59qrWLY) on average volume with 109 new highs. We saw 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hFqx3Gg) finish the day in the green, lead by Energy up over 4% and Materials up over 2%, while Consumer staples finished flat and Utilities &amp; Real Estate just finished in the red.\n\nMost small &amp; mid-cap value &amp; core companies were outperforming [yesterday](https://ibb.co/dWszjdG), as large-caps did finish mostly flat.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gDLn3Bc) from yesterday which revels plenty of gains in most of the areas of the stock market, with Big Tech companies advancing moderately, while most of the Oil&amp; Gas industry finished up significantly higher alongside companies from China.\n\nThe economic data that we received yesterday was mostly positive, starting with bankruptcy fillings falling to the lowest monthly number since early 2006, continuing the trend of this year, as this number, is the [lowest](https://ibb.co/26hzbrN) we have seen since 1986, as companies have been hugely supported by fiscal and monetary policies with record-breaking capital injections.\n\nWe also saw the December ISM Manufacturing [INDEX](https://ibb.co/q73Fj2m) coming at 60.6, higher than the 56.6 expected and the 57.5 in the previous month. This was led by a growth in new orders, productions, prices index &amp; supplier deliveries, while the employment index changed direction and was in expansion territory again this month, standing at 51.5. This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020, with December being the 7th straight month of [expansion](https://ibb.co/12gpyy2) and the biggest one of this year, with this PMI corresponding to a 5.2% increase in GDP on an annualized basis, as we also saw a 5.5% increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store [SALES](https://ibb.co/qWjH5dJ).\n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/2n4jcFm) we continue to get auto sales numbers, MBA mortgage applications, ADP jobs numbers, factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite, as we also await the Georgia Runoff [ELECTION](https://ibb.co/zXyZWmR) final results, as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call.\n\nIf the Dems to sweep, this could cause an increased volatility in the markets, especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off. This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion, as I believe it\u2019s very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes, which is very unlikely on big &amp; important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects, they wouldn\u2019t do that when things are still very bad in the economy, and the future still looks uncertain. Things should get better before any \u201cbig tax changes\u201d or any other \u201cbig regulation changes\u201d. So, if the Dems win the other seat, expect volatility, that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers. So, I just wouldn\u2019t bet against the bull market that we are in right now.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that Alibaba is [planning](https://ibb.co/s2vb2L8) to raise $5B through bonds again, following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation, with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell [rating](https://ibb.co/QbJwG53) while also cutting their PT from $280 to $210. I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction, but after all of this will pass, Alibaba is still a great company, even [without](https://ibb.co/m4x7CCs) Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese [APPS](https://ibb.co/X8xr9Cs), with the latest big ones being Alipay &amp; WeChat Pay. In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long-term investing goes. Yeah, maybe in the short-term the company can go either way depending on what restrictions they get, but I really don\u2019t think Alibaba will go bust in the long-run.\n\nYesterday we also receive auto sales number from a couple of manufacturers, with [GM](https://ibb.co/6HhqwZr) stealing the show, with Q4 sales up almost 5% year/year, as the company estimated they gained market share in both retail and fleet deliveries in 2020, while NISSAN\u2019s [sales](https://ibb.co/gFhYd60) continued to drop, as they sold 19% less vehicles in Q4 over the last quarter, as the total sales in 2020 dropped by more than 33%, as the automaker has fallen out of flavor with outdated models and no innovative developments.\n\nMeanwhile [VW](https://ibb.co/st5S7fh) did slightly worse overall in 2020, but saw a 11% increase in sales in Q4, as this was led by a 22% increase in the total SUVs sold. The SUV trend continues to keep on getting more &amp; more meaningful and most automakers must try and compete in this highly demanded market if they do want to survive. If you do want to invest in this industry, I suggest you take a look at the product development &amp; future outlook for the company before. I think both GM &amp; Ford are going in the right direction, but you should do your own research.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [world](https://ibb.co/55PMcBq) stock markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bN3RK87) seem to be pointing to a mixed open, with the Dow leading the way, while the tech heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1.3% on panic selling &amp; portfolio rebalancing happening due to the possible Democratic sweep in Georgia.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news** \n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn\u2019t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.\n\nYesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Financials, Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small &amp; mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which show how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Financials, Green Energy &amp; [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new &amp; improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.\n\nYesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.\n\nIn some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.\n\nWhile in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business. \n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.\n\nSo, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, &amp; SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.\n\nWe also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.\n\nWe also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney &amp; Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.\n\nAnd on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would benefit them. \n\n[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs &amp; EVs.\n\nOn the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba &amp; Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continuing to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.\n\nMy opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn\u2019t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way, though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished higher and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn\u2019t base your investment on this.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.\n\nSo, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, &amp; SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.\n\nWe also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.\n\nWe also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney &amp; Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.\n\nAnd on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would benefit them. \n\n[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs &amp; EVs.\n\nOn the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba &amp; Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continuing to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.\n\nMy opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn\u2019t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way, though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished higher and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn\u2019t base your investment on this.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**What is the impact of the Georgia Election on the Stock market? Is Alibaba going to recover or is it going down? GM outperforms in 2020, let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market recovering a good part of the losses from the first trading day of 2021, as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P4FW6dK) gained almost 1%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Jd46zGb) rose by .71% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cs47MP1) finished 167 points higher. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kH2gz8v) dropping by more than 6% after the huge spike on Monday as more than 70% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/59qrWLY) on average volume with 109 new highs. We saw 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hFqx3Gg) finish the day in the green, lead by Energy up over 4% and Materials up over 2%, while Consumer staples finished flat and Utilities &amp; Real Estate just finished in the red.\n\nMost small &amp; mid-cap value &amp; core companies were outperforming [yesterday](https://ibb.co/dWszjdG), as large-caps did finish mostly flat.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gDLn3Bc) from yesterday which revels plenty of gains in most of the areas of the stock market, with Big Tech companies advancing moderately, while most of the Oil&amp; Gas industry finished up significantly higher alongside companies from China.\n\nThe economic data that we received yesterday was mostly positive, starting with bankruptcy fillings falling to the lowest monthly number since early 2006, continuing the trend of this year, as this number, is the [lowest](https://ibb.co/26hzbrN) we have seen since 1986, as companies have been hugely supported by fiscal and monetary policies with record-breaking capital injections.\n\nWe also saw the December ISM Manufacturing [INDEX](https://ibb.co/q73Fj2m) coming at 60.6, higher than the 56.6 expected and the 57.5 in the previous month. This was led by a growth in new orders, productions, prices index &amp; supplier deliveries, while the employment index changed direction and was in expansion territory again this month, standing at 51.5. This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020, with December being the 7th straight month of [expansion](https://ibb.co/12gpyy2) and the biggest one of this year, with this PMI corresponding to a 5.2% increase in GDP on an annualized basis, as we also saw a 5.5% increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store [SALES](https://ibb.co/qWjH5dJ).\n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/2n4jcFm) we continue to get auto sales numbers, MBA mortgage applications, ADP jobs numbers, factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite, as we also await the Georgia Runoff [ELECTION](https://ibb.co/zXyZWmR) final results, as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call.\n\nIf the Dems to sweep, this could cause an increased volatility in the markets, especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off. This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion, as I believe it\u2019s very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes, which is very unlikely on big &amp; important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects, they wouldn\u2019t do that when things are still very bad in the economy, and the future still looks uncertain. Things should get better before any \u201cbig tax changes\u201d or any other \u201cbig regulation changes\u201d. So, if the Dems win the other seat, expect volatility, that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers. So, I just wouldn\u2019t bet against the bull market that we are in right now.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that Alibaba is [planning](https://ibb.co/s2vb2L8) to raise $5B through bonds again, following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation, with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell [rating](https://ibb.co/QbJwG53) while also cutting their PT from $280 to $210. I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction, but after all of this will pass, Alibaba is still a great company, even [without](https://ibb.co/m4x7CCs) Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese [APPS](https://ibb.co/X8xr9Cs), with the latest big ones being Alipay &amp; WeChat Pay. In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long-term investing goes. Yeah, maybe in the short-term the company can go either way depending on what restrictions they get, but I really don\u2019t think Alibaba will go bust in the long-run.\n\nYesterday we also receive auto sales number from a couple of manufacturers, with [GM](https://ibb.co/6HhqwZr) stealing the show, with Q4 sales up almost 5% year/year, as the company estimated they gained market share in both retail and fleet deliveries in 2020, while NISSAN\u2019s [sales](https://ibb.co/gFhYd60) continued to drop, as they sold 19% less vehicles in Q4 over the last quarter, as the total sales in 2020 dropped by more than 33%, as the automaker has fallen out of flavor with outdated models and no innovative developments.\n\nMeanwhile [VW](https://ibb.co/st5S7fh) did slightly worse overall in 2020, but saw a 11% increase in sales in Q4, as this was led by a 22% increase in the total SUVs sold. The SUV trend continues to keep on getting more &amp; more meaningful and most automakers must try and compete in this highly demanded market if they do want to survive. If you do want to invest in this industry, I suggest you take a look at the product development &amp; future outlook for the company before. I think both GM &amp; Ford are going in the right direction, but you should do your own research.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [world](https://ibb.co/55PMcBq) stock markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bN3RK87) seem to be pointing to a mixed open, with the Dow leading the way, while the tech heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1.3% on panic selling &amp; portfolio rebalancing happening due to the possible Democratic sweep in Georgia.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!
