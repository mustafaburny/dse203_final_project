Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, is carrying legislation that could make the utility subsidiary Pacific Gas and Electric Co. owned by a new nonprofit public benefit corporation called Golden State Energy. But it would only happen if the PG&amp;E\u2019s bankruptcy implodes or state regulators take the drastic step of revoking the company\u2019s operating license.\n\nWhile the bar for such a revocation is high, it is an option that the California Public Utilities Commission enshrined in a new enforcement process when it [approved PG&amp;E\u2019s bankruptcy reorganization plan Thursday.](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Regulators-OK-PG-E-s-bankruptcy-plan-despite-15301790.php) Regulators at the commission could reconsider the license if the company causes more disasters and other enforcement measures prove insufficient.\"\n\nNow, I'm no expert, but this doesn't sound like it's very encouraging to shareholders, and even less encouraging to options addicted autists.

        "selftext": "After reading a previous post about $ITCI, I decided to dive into all of the data and break down all the technical jargon in an attempt to better understand the opportunity here. This is my first attempt at writing up my DD.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n**$ITCI Stock**\n\nPotential options:\n\n**$ITCI 6/19 $25c**\n\n**$ITCI 7/17 $25c**\n\n**Also a TL;DR at the bottom**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT is $ITCI?**\n\n$ITCI is Intra-Cellular Therapies, a biopharmaceutical company based in New York most known for its recently FDA-approved drug lumateperone (CAPLYTA), offering a unique take on schizophrenia treatment with very minimal side effects.\n\n**WHY are we looking at $ITCI?**\n\nThey have imminent data releases regarding large clinical trials that are expected to show positive results. One data release set for Q2, another set for mid-year 2020.\n\n**HOW do we profit from this?**\n\nHistorically, $ITCI has had large price spikes when positive data is released. Data release is imminent, likely beginning in June. Longer term outlook, if trial data is positive, further FDA approval and marketable drugs will provide ITCI with a much larger market in which to make money.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\nITCI has just recently had their drug, lumateperone (labeled CAPLYTA), approved by FDA for use at the end of 2019 after very positive clinical trials. This drug is used to treat schizophrenia, and compared to existing treatments, is novel in that the side effects are much more minimal. CAPLYTA sales/marketing began at the end of March, reporting \\~$880,000 in sales in just the last one or two weeks of Q1 (mainly to supply wholesalers). It's still early, but results from the clinical trials and the initial physician and patient reception has been positive.\n\nHowever, what we're looking at for the price spike is not the success of CAPLYTA, but rather the results of not one, but two upcoming data releases.\n\nThe first data release is regarding a clinical trial using lumateperone for treatment in bipolar disorder, which if successful, would greatly expand the market for ITCI's drug. This data release date per the most recent earnings call is \u201cmid-year 2020\u201d, however, another autist [makes the case for a June release here](https://medium.com/@codyenexile/another-itci-spike-incoming-diligence-done-8d625ff29754). The results of this trial are assumed to be positive because similar results were found in previous trials, [mentioned here](https://ir.intracellulartherapies.com/news-releases/news-release-details/intra-cellular-therapies-announces-positive-top-line-results-0).  This trial is Phase 3, which is the last step before FDA approval is granted.\n\nThe second release is regarding ITI-214, a separate treatment targeting patients with chronic systolic heart failure. This treatment acts as a PDE-1 inhibitor, which has shown positive results in heart treatment [example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5513860/)\n\n[example 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6023290/).\n\nTI-214 has completed Phase 1-2 clinical trials and is awaiting results data \u201clater this quarter\u201d per the Q1 2020 earnings call this May (so, June 2020 release). Positive data from this trial would be very bullish for ITCI, as it could potentially open a whole new market for them - cardiac treatment in addition to psychoactive treatment.\n\n**ADDITIONAL PROS AND CONS:**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. Per the earnings call, the recent COVID events have not impeded the clinical trials. The launch of the CAPLYTA drug has also been successful in spite of COVID, thanks to telemedicine and online capability. In addition, patients have not stopped seeking treatment for mental conditions and physicians have not stopped providing care.\n2. Some large institutional investors, including BlackRock, have recently [increased their stake in ITCI](https://www.tickerreport.com/banking-finance/5649746/blackrock-inc-buys-527274-shares-of-intra-cellular-therapies-inc-nasdaqitci.html)\n3. In general, institutions have put in [$156M in Q2 2020 alone](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ITCI/institutional-ownership/), largest being Fidelity and BlackRock. This is much much larger than any other quarter so far\n4. Recent analyst price targets for ITCI have been positive, ranging from $26, to $35, to $50+.\n5. A competitor in schizophrenia treatment, Minerva Neurosciences ($NERV), recently reported disappointing Phase 3 trial results of their own, easing pressure on upcoming competitive threats.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. Despite reporting \\~$450 million in cash/cash equivalents and investment on the last earnings call, ITCI continues to burn money and is not yet in a position to reap big profits from CAPLYTA. Will need to keep an eye on financials if taking a long position.\n2. Although approved by the FDA and showing positive clinical trial results, CAPLYTA is very early and there are little real-world results to show for it as of now. Success of this drug is necessary for ITCI to stay relevant.\n3. Insider selling may be [a concern](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ITCI/insider). There has also been very recent [insider buying though](https://newsfilter.io/articles/4-form-ac9be466332a794a156140ff7d3f1e06),I don't know enough about this shit to form an opinion so I'm putting it in Cons because brainlet.\n\n**//--TL;DR--//**\n\n**The Good:** history of price spikes on positive data, drug recently approved by FDA, next data releases imminent and likely to be positive based on past results\n\n**The Bad:** company has $450 mil cash but isn't making money yet; drug released and approved only recently, little data available on sales outlook and patient reception. Questionable insider buys/sells?\n\n**The Ugly:** look in the mirror\n\n**Positions: $ITCI Stock** (for the longer hold)\n\n**$ITCI 6/19 $25c** (banking on June data releases)\n\n**$ITCI 7/17 $25c** (coverage in case data is released late June or early July)",

        "selftext": "You often see this classic example- You buy 100 stocks at $10. $1000. You get a 10% gain over the year. You now have $1100. The next year you gain %10 but now the 10% is applied to 1100 not 1000. And so on.\n\nHow does this actually work though? That's not really compounding. That is just a stock going up 10% per year. For it to compound you would need to reinvest your gains. Using the example you would take the $100 in gains and buy 10 more stocks. That wouldn't actually work though because the stock would now cost $11 so you wouldn't gain anything by selling off your gains and rebuying the stock.\n\nIm confused. How does this work?",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow autists,\n\nAs we all know there are riots going on throughout the country at the moment, and over the long-term this will cause the devaluation of the market as a whole.\n\nI will begin by stating that the majority of these rioters are liberals, who are notorious for having no money of their own and living at home with their parents. \n\nIf you've watched any videos of these riots you've noticed that there are large amounts of said liberals congregating while neither practicing social distancing nor wearing PPE which means that the virus is bound to spread faster than your wife's pussy for her boyfriend.\n\nWhen they go back to their homes, they will indubitably infect their boomer parents, causing a significant rise in cases, and certain amount of them to die, giving their inheritance to their liberal children.\n\nNow, how this ties all together: What do we know about boomers? They love keeping their retirement money in \"safe\" investments, SPY to be particular. And what do we know about liberals? They're stupid.\n\nHence, these liberals will take their parents money out of SPY, and bet it all on SPY calls because stonks only go up, but because so many people are withdrawing their deceased parents' 401(k)'s across the country, money will be leaving the market faster than JPow can print it.\n\ntl;dr SPY $225P 11/20",

        "selftext": " [https://oracledispatch.com/2020/06/01/gearing-up-for-the-pot-stock-election-run-mjna-crlbf-mctc-curlf/](https://oracledispatch.com/2020/06/01/gearing-up-for-the-pot-stock-election-run-mjna-crlbf-mctc-curlf/) \n\n \n\nThe 2016 general election November vote was one of the biggest catalysts for the cannabis space. 2020 is shaping as potentially another similar situation, with 4 states already on the ballot for legalization (2 for recreational) and another 6 states pushing to get on the ballot (5 for recreational), making it potentially even more explosive for the overall legalization movement than we saw in the historic 2016 process.\n\nThe rationalization for this last claim is about percentage change: the ultimate shift would be to get cannabis legalized on a recreational basis in the majority of the US, thereby putting pressure on the federal government to accept the verdict by states and start removing federal statutes around cannabis, which would likely accelerate the dominoes as a \u201ctipping point\u201d phenomenon.\n\nIn percentage terms, if all states seeking to get on the ballot for recreational \u201cadult use\u201d legalization are successful in doing so, then 2020 will be a bigger shift (provided they all pass) than the movement in 2016.\n\nIn other words, start getting your pot stock portfolio picks together ASAP. Below you will find our thoughts and analysis on some of the more widely discussed names in the space, including: Medical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA), CRLBF, MCTC Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:MCTC) aka Cannabis Global Inc. (OTCMKTS:MCTC), and CURLF\n\n**Medical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA)** isn\u2019t what we would consider a \u201cprime investment pick\u201d in this space. The company has remained on the pink sheets, offering up unaudited financials only for all of its tenure as a publicly traded stock (and we\u2019re talking about years here), despite claiming tens of millions in revenues. In case you\u2019re wondering, this is not remotely typical. As far as we can tell, MJNA is the only stock in the history of the world that fits this description. And it\u2019s certainly not a reassuring idea. Why would you hide on the pink sheets and avoid producing audited financial reports if you are seeing such success?\n\nTo underscore this, the stock has done nothing but slide lower despite the company\u2019s proclamations of ever-growing revenues. Smoke equals fire. We would simply be careful with any company that seems to overpromise and overhype, and then claim the opaque lack of transparency afforded to companies trading on the pink sheets. While we have seen a recent spike following news that Aurora bought out a CBD name (CBD is the main focus of MJNA), we would remain skeptical that the long history here of underperformance in MJNA is likely to change on a sustained basis anytime soon.\n\nMedical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA) bills itself as an investment holding company that operates in the medical marijuana and industrial hemp markets. Its products range from patented and proprietary based cannabinoid products to seed and stalk or isolated high value extracts manufactured and formulated for the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmeceutical industries. The company licenses its proprietary testing, genetics, labeling and packaging, tracking, production, and standardization methods for the medicinal cannabinoid industry.\n\nIt engages in the research and development of cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals; and marketing and distribution of cannabidiol hemp oil-based products. In addition, the company provides management support and services to cooperatives, collectives, health and wellness facilities, and medical clinics; and consulting and securities services to businesses and individuals in the legal cannabis industry.\n\nIt\u2019s subsidiary, Kannaway, is a network sales and marketing company specializing in the sales and marketing of hemp-based botanical products. Kannaway currently hosts weekly online sales meetings and conferences across the United States, offering unique insight and opportunity to sales professionals who are desirous of becoming successful leaders in the sale and marketing of hemp-based botanical products.\n\nMJNA has been acting well over recent days, up something like 30% in that time. Shares of the stock have powered higher over the past month, rallying roughly 75% in that time on strong overall action.\n\nMedical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA) managed to rope in revenues totaling $16.9M in overall sales during the company\u2019s most recently reported quarterly financial data \u2014 a figure that represents a rate of top line growth of -4.2%, as compared to year-ago data in comparable terms. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($6.2M against $11M, respectively).\n\n**Cresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF)** continues to act like a new leader in the making, with an expanding footprint in terms of market density and geographic range.\n\nMoreover, this is a company very much tied to the process of gradual legalization in the US marketplace, with a widely known brand and a growing scale in terms of distribution relationships.\n\nCresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF) trumpets itself as a company that manufactures and sells medical cannabis products in the United States. It offers cannabis dry flower; vaporizer forms of cannabis; cannabis oil in capsule, oral and sublingual solutions; cannabis in topical; and other cannabis products.\n\nThe company also provides cannabis infused edibles, including chocolate and toffee confections, fruit-forward gummies, and hard sweet and chews. Cresco Labs Inc. sells its products under the Cresco brand. In addition, it operators a Hope Heal Health dispensary in Fall River, Bristol County, Massachusetts.\n\nIf you\u2019re long this stock, then you\u2019re liking how the stock has responded to the announcement. CRLBF shares have been moving higher over the past week overall, pushing about 8% to the upside on above average trading volume. Shares of the stock have powered higher over the past month, rallying roughly 24% in that time on strong overall action.\n\nCresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF) generated sales of $54.6M, according to information released in the company\u2019s most recent quarterly financial report. That adds up to a sequential quarter-over-quarter growth rate of 14.2% on the top line. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($70.2M against $194.7M, respectively).\n\n**MCTC Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:MCTC)**, now doing business as Cannabis Global, Inc. (MCTC), has started to emerge as a new focus point for cannabis stock traders in the past few weeks. The company has been an IP leader, with a number of major patents related primarily to infusion technology for CBD, THC, CBG, and THC-V in the works. It\u2019s rare to see substantive IP as a factor in the pot stock space \u2013 most of these names are basically commodity plays \u2013 but MCTC appears to be the genuine item on that note.\n\nTo help reinforce that idea, the company just announced it has completed product development and has begun distribution of its unique tetrahydrocannabivarin (THC-V) coffee and tea products to product beta testers. This comes on the heels of news that the company has been approved as an Amazon.com platform seller for its Hemp You Can Feel branded line of CBD products.\n\nAccording to the release, \u201cCannabis Global has integrated three internally developed technologies into the unique manufacturing process for the industry\u2019s first THC-V beverages. The first of these is the process developed by the Company to produce 70%+ loaded THC-V, controlled release, nanoparticles utilizing laboratory-based, pharmaceutical-grade production equipment. The Company is also utilizing both its internally developed powerization and one step dosing system, ensuring precise dosing and significantly faster production. The Company has filed provisional patents on all three technologies.\u201d\n\nAs noted, Cannabis Global (OTCMKTS:MCTC) has recently filed six patents on cannabinoid extraction technologies and delivery systems. Management is currently working with patent counsel to protect various other technologies it has developed or is currently developing, including its programs pertaining to cannabinoid glycosides, polymeric cannabinoid nanoparticles and nanofibers, and its hemp extract-based alcohol replacement technologies.\n\n\u201cOur unique infusion and production technologies provide Cannabis Global with a product purity advantage as well as a clear path to low cost leadership,\u201d commented CEO Arman Tabatabaei. \u201cThe THC-V cannabinoids are synthesized and entirely free of impurities. While there were some upfront technology development and intellectual property protection costs, we expect our ongoing variable production costs to be less than half of any potential competitor. Via our technologies, we turn one of the cannabis industry\u2019s most expensive items \u2013 pure THC-V cannabinoids \u2013 into a cost-effective solution that sets a new standard for product purity in the cannabinoid-based products marketplace.\u201d\n\nMCTC Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:MCTC) had no reported sales in its last quarterly financial data. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($157K against $1.5M, respectively).\n\n**Curaleaf Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:CURLF)** shares have been moving steadily higher as the company continues to expand and solidify itself as one of the primary leaders in the space, particularly in the US market.\n\nCURLF shares pushed above their key 200-day simple moving average line two weeks ago, and have held up above that key technical marker on a closing basis since, with two critical tests, both passed nicely thus far. At this point, all of the stock\u2019s major MA\u2019s are curving into a bullish posture on a long-term basis.\n\nCuraleaf Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:CURLF) promulgates itself as a company that operates as an integrated medical and wellness cannabis operator in the United States. The Company is the parent of Curaleaf, Inc., a leading vertically integrated cannabis operator in the United States. Headquartered in Wakefield, Massachusetts, Curaleaf, Inc. has a presence in 12 states.\n\nCuraleaf, Inc. operates 30 dispensaries, 12 cultivation sites and 9 processing sites with a focus on highly populated, limited license states, including Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. Curaleaf, Inc. leverages its extensive research and development capabilities to distribute cannabis products in multiple formats with the highest standard for safety, effectiveness, consistent quality and customer care. Curaleaf is committed to being the industry\u2019s leading resource in education and advancement through research and advocacy.\n\nCuraleaf Inc.\u2019s Florida operations were the first in the cannabis industry to receive the Safe Quality Food certification under the Global Food Safety Initiative, setting a new standard of excellence. It cultivates, processes, markets, and/or dispenses a range of cannabis products in various operating markets, including flower, pre-rolls and flower pods, dry-herb vaporizer cartridges, concentrates for vaporizing, concentrates for dabbing, tinctures, lozenges, capsules, and edibles.\n\nShares of the stock have powered higher over the past month, rallying roughly 26% in that time on strong overall action.\n\nCuraleaf Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:CURLF) generated sales of $129.8M, according to information released in the company\u2019s most recent quarterly financial report. That adds up to a sequential quarter-over-quarter growth rate of 30.3% on the top line. In addition, the company has a strong balance sheet, with cash levels far exceeding current liabilities ($251M against $177.1M).",
