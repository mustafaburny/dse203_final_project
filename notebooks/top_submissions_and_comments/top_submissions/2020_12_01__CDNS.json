        "selftext": "The market crash always comes eventually.\n\nBear markets\u2014where the stock market value drops by 20% or more from its previous high\u2014have occurred 12 times since 1929.     \n\nThe market ebbs and flows, oscillating between \u201cunsustainable optimism and unjustified pessimism.\u201d If we believe the assumption that stock prices are current unsustainably optimistic, then it\u2019s believable that a serious bear market could happen in the next few years.    \n\nBut lesser corrections\u2014typically defined as at least a 10% drawdown\u2014occur even more frequently. Since 1950, there have been **37 corrections** of 10% or more. That\u2019s more frequent than one every two years.    \n\n### \u201cIf the market crash is coming\u2026why not sell now and wait to re-invest after the prices drop?\u201d\n\nBefore I answer the question above, let\u2019s consult Peter Lynch\u2014who is considered one of the most successful investors of all-time.\n\n&gt;Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections than has been lost in corrections themselves.  \n*Peter Lynch*\n\nWhat exactly is Lynch saying? How do people lose money by \u201cpreparing\u201d for corrections?\n\nPeople lose money \u201cpreparing\u201d for corrections because they **sell too soon** and then **don\u2019t know when to buy back in**. It\u2019s that simple. Both actions\u2014selling too soon and not buying back in soon enough\u2014can cause investors to miss out of years of growth and years of dividends.\n\nThat\u2019s why Peter Lynch\u2019s quote rings so true. Timing the market is *hard*.\n\nSo we don\u2019t sell in preparation for a crash. But what about saving up cash and waiting to buy? Why not hold cash, wait for the 10% drop (that we know happens every 2 years, or so) and buy in then?\n\nWell, I looked at that too. Back in March \u201920, my \u201cViral Stock Market Strategies\u201d article (get it? ***viral*****?!**) looked at an assortment of supposed strategies that involved holding onto cash while waiting for the market to drop. I back-tested these strategies against the historical S&amp;P 500 data, and **simple dollar-cost averaging beats** ***all*** **the \u201cwait for a drop\u201d strategies**.\n\nYou think there\u2019s a market crash coming? I know, me too (eventually). There\u2019s certainly a chance that holding onto cash and waiting for the crash is correct *right now*. But if you try that tactic over time, it\u2019s a losing strategy.\n\nDon\u2019t sell. And don\u2019t wait to buy. Carry on with your normal investing cadence.\n\n&gt;Don\u2019t do something. Just sit there.  \n*Jack Bogle*\n\n[**Source**](https://bestinterest.blog/market-crash/)",

        "selftext": "Note: I am in general an apple fanboy, love their products, and have owned the stock periodically since 2013. However, the valuation of Apple is just getting absurd and no one seems to acknowledge it.\n\nSince 2016, Apple's revenue has grown from $216b to $274b in FY 2020. Over that same timeframe Apple's stock has increased from \\~ $25 to $122. The end result is a company growing at 5% a year and with 40 times earnings. This valuation is equal to \\~ $6k for every American citizen. At a 20% profit margin (which is Apple's actual profit margin) that means Apple needs $30k in sales for every American to recognize a profit equal to its current market cap.\n\nIn general, people are buying Apple's products at a less frequent cadence than before (e.g., instead of a new iPhone every year, it seems people are moving towards buying a new iPhone every 5 years).\n\nI get it, it's all about the services revenue. I agree, that is definitely an avenue for Apple's future. However, that seems more than priced in. There are 380m iPhones in use worldwide according to Statista. Let's just say that Apple can increase market share and cap out at 500 million users. At $10 a month, that implies $60 billion a year in annual services revenue. At a 50% margin (generous) and with that $10 a month revenue per user (very generous), that would imply $30 billion a year in services profit. At 20 time earnings (generous, considering this is high price point and high market share) that would imply $600 billion in value.\n\nTLDR: Apple's current market cap is $2 trillion. This is a company growing at 5% a year with significant supply chain, demand, taxation, innovation, and disruption risks. Priced beyond perfection.",
