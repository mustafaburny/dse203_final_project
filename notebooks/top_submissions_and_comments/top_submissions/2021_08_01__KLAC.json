        "selftext": "I've put together a shortlist of all the companies that have experienced significant revenue and net profit growth both in a 4 year time span as well as a 1 year time span, with respect to similar companies in their sector. My theory is that showing consistent results over this time period is indicative of strong fundamentals and will be a good investment over a period of at least one year. You'll see some common companies in here, as well as some not so common ones. But all of these are worth looking into. \n\nFull disclaimer: I am invested in some of these. \n\n|Symbol|Name|Last Sale|Net Change|% Change|Market Cap|Country|IPO Year|Volume|Sector|Industry|\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|:--|--:|--:|:--|:--|\n|TGS|Transportadora de Gas del Sur SA TGS Common Stock|$4.40|0.08|1.85%|6.62E+08|Argentina| |104423|Public Utilities|Natural Gas Distribution|\n|YPF|YPF Sociedad Anonima Common Stock|$4.47|0.27|6.43%|1.76E+09|Argentina|1993|2828944|Energy|Integrated oil Companies|\n|LOMA|Loma Negra Compania Industrial Argentina Sociedad Anonima ADS|$5.92|-0.13|-2.15%|7.06E+08|Argentina|2017|203231|Capital Goods|Building Materials|\n|INFO|IHS Markit Ltd.
