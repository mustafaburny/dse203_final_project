        "selftext": "I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -&gt; Aug. \n\nI beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180-&gt;300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)\n\nI did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. \n\nI did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. \n\n#High level advice:\n=========================================\n\nhttps://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/37-top-10-pieces-of-investment-advice-from-warren-buffett\n\nI picked the 7 I agree with.\n\n1. Invest in what you know\u2026and nothing more.\n2. Never compromise on business quality\n3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever\n4. Diversification can be dangerous\n5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)\n8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)\n10. Only listen to those you know and trust \n\nI firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  \n\n#General mindset:\n================\n- Keep emotions out of the market\n- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.\n- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. \n- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. \n- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)\n- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. \n\n#Application:\n==================================================================\nI was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. \n\nAs a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. \n\nBased on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good \"feel\" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). \n\nI tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. \n\nPost COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.\n\nMy hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. \n\n1. eCommerce + AdTech \n2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)\n3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)\n\nThese are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:\n\n1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?\n2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?\n3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? \n4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?\n5. Who are their customers and target demographic?\n6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.\n\nIn March, I took what I believe to be an \"educated gamble\". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.\n\nI have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.\n\nHere are the non FAANGs I chose.\n\n1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&amp;M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. \n\n2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.\n\n3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. \n\n4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.\n\n5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. \n\n6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.\n\n7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. \"Zoom parties\" and \"Zoom dates\" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.\n\n8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. \n\n10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.\n\n11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. \n\n12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. \n\n13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say \"Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?\" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.\n\n14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.\n\nMutual funds/ETFs\n1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. \n\n2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. \n\n3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... \n\nTitanvest:\nI was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.\n\n#Some things I do that that are against the grain:\n\n- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.\n\n- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.\n\n- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. \n\nOne example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. \n\nLastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. \n\nAlso, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",

        "selftext": "Is Microsoft the best stock of all-time? Back in the 90s, it used to be  known as the millionaire stock with how many Microsoft investors and  employees saw their wealth rise on the back of the company\u2019s fortunes. The shares have split 9 times. And the company is currently the second most valuable in the world. If you invested $1,000 in the Microsoft IPO  in 1986, today it\u2019d be worth $2,130,200 \u2013 that\u2019s a total return of  212,920%, or 25% annualized returns *every year for the past 34 years*. By comparison, $1,000 invested in the Apple IPO would be worth $1,262,380 today.\u00a0\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s  dominance in PC software was so absolute by the late 1990s that the US  Government opened antitrust proceedings in 2001 and tried to break up  the company. Yet only a decade later, Microsoft had largely been  surpassed by Apple and Google. No longer did tech executives and  business schools point to IBM as the poster child for corporate  stagnation and loss of commanding market share. It was now Microsoft.\u00a0\n\n7  years ago, Microsoft was such an afterthought that the now-famous FAANG  moniker conspicuously excludes the Redmond giant despite Microsoft  outperforming both Google and Facebook in the time since (and until  Apple\u2019s near-30% rise the past month, Apple as well). So how did we get  here?\u00a0\n\nThe [journey](https://blackjacketco.com/f/featured-flashback-how-microsoft-rose-and-fell-then-rose-again) \u2013 summarized below \u2013 revisits the mania surrounding the launch of Windows 95, an  investment that saved Apple from bankruptcy, a series of failed  acquisitions and product launches, and the rebirth of Microsoft under  current CEO Satya Nadella.\u00a0\n\n **BASIC beginnings to PC Powerhouse (1980s to 2001)** \n\n* In 1980, IBM \u2013 the world\u2019s largest computer manufacturer at the time \u2013  approached Microsoft with an offer to license an operating system for  their soon-to-be-released IBM PC. When Microsoft received the contract,  they hadn\u2019t yet built the operating system. They actually had to  purchase a Seattle-based company called QDOS to help build the original  MS-DOS system that Microsoft eventually licensed to IBM.\n* As part of the deal, Microsoft insisted that MS-DOS be non-exclusive to  IBM. IBM thought the future of the PC was hardware. Not anticipating  companies like Compaq would be able to legally reverse-engineer their  PC, Big Blue agreed to the terms. And it was the ability of Microsoft to  bundle MS-DOS with the various competing PCs that transformed the  company into the go-to operating system provider for nearly every PC on  the market. By the close of the decade, Microsoft\u2019s stock had already  risen over 500% since its IPO.\u00a0\n* MS-DOS was only a text-based system though, and Microsoft soon began to  work on a fully graphical interface, including desktop navigation and  icons, as part of a new operating system that would come to be known as  Windows. Windows completely changed the game for the PC, making it much  more user friendly and accessible for everyday consumers. By 1995,  Windows was so synonymous with the PC that customers lined up around the  block at midnight to try and get their hands on the Windows 95 release.  The Empire State Building was even lit up in Microsoft colors to mark  the occasion.\u00a0\n* In 1997,  Windows 95 and the Microsoft family of operating systems held a  commanding 86.3% PC market share. In contrast to Microsoft, Apple was on  the verge of bankruptcy that year. Following an emergency investment of  $150mn from Microsoft, Bill Gates appeared live-on screen at an Apple  event with Steven Jobs to announce the agreement. He was promptly  booed.\u00a0\n\n**Complacency, Stagnation, and Decline (2001-2014)**\n\n* While it\u2019s hard to point to a single factor that caused Microsoft to  lose its way, the company became obsessed with propping up Windows as it  was the company\u2019s major cash cow. New products were only deemed viable  if they augmented Windows or were backward-compatible. Ultimately, this  narrow focus on Windows left Microsoft over-exposed to the PC market at a  time when new trends were starting to emerge in computing and digital  services.\u00a0\n* On December 29,  1999, Microsoft hit a split-adjusted all-time high of nearly $120 per  share. A little over two weeks later, Bill Gates stepped down as CEO and  Steven Ballmer ascended to lead the company. Under Ballmer, Microsoft  employees repeatedly identified promising technologies, like e-readers  and mobile software, only to see those projects pushed aside because  they didn't revolve around Windows. Microsoft had an e-reader prototype  as early as 1998, developed a mobile operating system called Windows CE,  and worked on a smartphone-type device all the way back in 2000.  Despite a multi-year head start in these areas, Microsoft never found  success.\u00a0\n* Apple released the  first iPod in 2001, but it took until 2006 for Microsoft to release the  rival Zune. And in a sign of how far ahead Apple now was at that point,  only two months later Steve Jobs revealed an integrated music player and  internet-capable phone called the iPhone. The Zune was a complete  disaster, and in 2009, Apple had a 71% share of the MP3 player market.\u00a0\n* Microsoft also completely missed the mark on search. In 2004, an  upstart Google had been poaching talented developers \u2013 as well as some  senior executives \u2013 from Microsoft for a couple years. In response,  Ballmer ordered the company to start prioritizing search. Although  Microsoft had several previous iterations of a search platform, the  company didn\u2019t launch Bing until May 2009. Over the next 3 years Bing  lost $6bn, and a failed acquisition of advertising company aQuantive in  an attempt to jump-start search led to a $6.2bn write-down and the  company\u2019s first-ever quarterly loss in 2012.\u00a0\n* After the introduction of the iPhone, Ballmer famously said: \u201cNo chance  that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.\u201d Yet as  PC sales plateaued then declined and the mobile market was quickly  becoming the future, Microsoft\u2019s inability to develop a mobile strategy  or a competing product became the embodiment of the company\u2019s failure to  perceive market trends and remain relevant beyond the PC. Although  Ballmer tried to get Microsoft into the game by purchasing Nokia\u2019s  mobile phone division in 2013, the company never got above 3.6% market  share. And in 2015, Microsoft wrote off the whole acquisition for  $7.5bn. \u00a0\n\n**Nadella and the Rise of Azure (2014-Present)**\n\n* One of Nadella\u2019s first and most important moves after taking the helm  was to finally recognize that Windows could no longer drive the future  of Microsoft. Instead, he made it a corporate priority to go all-in on  the cloud at the exact time when enterprise IT spend was starting to  show a real demand for cloud computing capabilities.\u00a0\n* He also greatly changed the culture. Under Gates and Ballmer, Microsoft  was the epitome of anti-competitive. Rather than work with other  companies in the PC and software businesses, they used Microsoft\u2019s  dominant position in both operating system and web browsing to squeeze  rivals or eliminate them altogether. Nadella forced Microsoft to open,  to seek out partnerships, and to even prioritize its iOS or Android  mobile software offerings to the detriment of the now defunct Windows  phone.\u00a0\n* Today, Linux is about  as widely used on Azure as Windows is. And this corporate strategy has  led companies to seek out Microsoft\u2019s cloud offerings as Amazon  increasingly expands into more and more industries to disrupt. Microsoft  also repackaged its enterprise and productivity tools into  subscription-based products rather than costly one-time downloads or  annual license fees.\u00a0\n* The new  Microsoft strategy has empowered developers and engineers to pursue  innovation in the exact opposite way that occurred under Ballmer. And  the company has developed a more customer-centric approach to developing  software that has resulted in a suite of bundled enterprise resource  products, such as Dynamics 365, that have made the entire Office 365  SaaS offering that much more compelling for large corporations.\u00a0\n* The most crucial driver in the Microsoft turnaround has been the  hyper-growth of the company\u2019s Iaas and PaaS platform Azure. As much  credit as Azure receives now, back in 2015 and 2016, Amazon AWS was  largely considered the undisputed king of the cloud. Articles would  frequently cite how AWS was bigger than Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and  Google combined. Following years of 75-100% growth rates, however, Azure  is now firmly in peer status alongside AWS. This is no better evidenced  than by Microsoft\u2019s $10bn contract win over Amazon for the DoD JEDI  contract last year.\u00a0\n* Although  Azure growth is slowing, as of July 2020 AWS has 31% market share versus  20% for Azure \u2013 an amazing turnaround. And despite the disproportionate  attention given to the AWS/Azure as the \u201ccloud\u201d, Microsoft\u2019s place as  the leader of enterprise SaaS means that the company actually generates  more quarterly revenues ($14.3bn) from the cloud relative to Amazon  ($10.8bn).\u00a0\n\nWhen Nadella first took over, Microsoft\u2019s market cap sat around $300bn. Today, it\u2019s $1.6tn.\u00a0\n\n*You can find me on Twitter* [@BlackjacketCo](https://twitter.com/BlackjacketCo) *where I write about emerging technologies and long-term market trends.

        "selftext": "\nI've posted bits and pieces of this in some comments since some form of the question has come up on this subreddit. I want to list out a list of reasons why today is like the dot com times and ALSO what is different about today. I am not a financial professional, but I have been working in the tech industry for over 20 years. It is mostly tech stock focused.\n\nI'm going to also add (fact) or (anecdotal) or (opinion) to my bullet points, so take those bullet points with the appropriate grain of salt.\n\nReasons we are NOT like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance):\n\n* (fact) Interest rates are much lower now and long term expectations on yield is also low. In 1999, the 10 year treasury was at around 5% and rose to over 6.5% in 2000. The P/E of the S&amp;P 500 in 2000 was around 30. Which means that the 10 year treasury yielded MORE than the S&amp;P 500 earnings. This is absolutely not true today with the 10 year treasury yield being around 0.6% and P/Es being around 25-30. This single point is extremely important to understand.\n* (fact) Late stage VCs are more of a thing now than they were in dot com. Thus you have fewer IPOs and the companies that do are more mature and less speculative (of course there are outliers, see below).\n* (fact) The NASDAQ P/E in 2000 was really quite ridiculous (I can't find a chart for some reason, i think it was around 80). S&amp;P 500 was more comparable between 2000 and now.\n* (anecdotes) You can no longer get a job at a startup / real tech firm just because you know HTML or can write \"hello world\" in Perl. A lot of firms back in the late 90's were trying to fatten up the employee count and race to IPO to cash out. This doesn't happen today.\n* (fact) There was no pandemic in 2000 and it makes comparisons hard.\n\nReasons we are like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance)\n\n* (anecdotes) Sentiment on the ground is very similar to what you hear during the dot com boom. We make fun of the people who invest in stupid shit like NKLA, HTZ, etc. But a lot of people are creaming their pants still on the big tech (FAMANG) saying they are forever-holds / they can't go down, etc. You also now are starting to see intelligent, rational people putting money in things **precisely** because other people will and assume they can get out before it all falls apart.\n* (fact) In the late 90s, internet brokers were a new thing and made trading easier for people who didn't know anything -- and we see that today with COVID stay-at-homers and an influx of users into robinhood (I wish I could get hard numbers on the comparison). (opinion) Because of this, I'm fairly certain pricing is out of whack for a large number of companies.\n* (fact) The P/E ratios of the big techs today are higher than a lot of the big techs during 2000. Nasdaq P/E in 2000 was off the chart, but if you just look at the big profitable companies like INTC, ORCL, AAPL, HPQ, IBM, which were the equivalent of FAMANG today, they had P/Es mostly under 30s. FAMANG are around 35 except for Netflix and Amazon which are much higher (see huge caveat on interest rates above). CSCO and MSFT in 2000 were the outliers having P/Es of well over 60.\n* (anecdotes) In tech companies, a common business plan for new firms in the last ~8 years is to get market share at any cost and figure out profitability later. This is really no different from dot com when firms were valued by number of \"eyeballs\".\n* (opinion) \"this time is different\". At least in terms of technology, it's not. The internet itself was a bigger \"paradigm shift\" than what we are seeing today. I used \"paradigm shift\", because was a common buzzword that turned into a joke back in the late 90s and used to justify crazy valuations. Machine Learning is amazing, but not on par with connecting everyone on the globe. And the cloud is just a fancy name for running something on someone else's computer (even though its quite nice how easy and seamless it is today vs. 20 years ago).\n* (anecdotes) While it is harder to IPO today without profitability or clear path to profitability, it clearly still happens (UBER, LYFT, SNAP). And others are using backdoor IPOs (NKLA, SPCE).\n* (fact) In 2000, the IT sector along with Media stocks and the Telecommunications Services sector approached 40% of the S&amp;P market cap. The categories have changed but if you combine IT and Communication Services sectors, you get a 38% of S&amp;P market cap today. If you add Amazon which is not included in IT/Communication, you get over 40%. Does this mean anything, especially since we are in a pandemic and more stuff runs on IT? Not sure.\n\nYou can definitely pick apart some of the individual points, I just wanted to lay them all out and see what people thought and if anyone has other valid comparisons. I personally think we ARE in some kind of tech bubble, but I'm not going to make a fool of myself in predictions on when and how it will burst. And fuck it, while I do have more in cash than typical, I'm still in VTI/VXUS and a bunch of individual tech names since I have the background to do some analysis on the business.\n\nI'll end with a few random thoughts:\n\n* In August 1999, a lot of people were looking at the craziness of the dot com boom and how people were throwing money at stupid shit. I don't care what people say, it was pretty obvious something was wrong. If you shorted the NASDAQ then, you will watch the NASDAQ more than double in 7 months time and have your face ripped off.\n* Taking what I've posted as a whole, the one thing to be terrified about is if long term interest rates rise and the fed is either powerless or does not step in for whatever reason. This will completely destroy the stock and bond market. I don't see the catalyst for it, but I'm no economic genius. You might be able to make an argument that gold is a hedge for this unlikely scenario. There is also the worry of a slump in earnings due to general economic malaise, but that is a garden variety concern that everyone is watching for and usually pretty temporary. Rise in interest rates would be real bad.",

        "selftext": "**The Case for Nutanix**\n\n**Tl;dr NTNX will recover from financial instability soon so get 2022/2021 LEAPs** \n\nNutanix is a company that provides enterprise solutions via SaaS and PaaS to integrate data, computing, networking, and security using hyper converged infrastructure. Nutanix\u2019s Acropolis HCI runs all enterprise applications such from Oracle, SAP, Microsoft, Citrix, Splunk, and SQL, just to give you an idea of what type of league it\u2019s running with. Nutanix makes running IT solutions integrated, efficient and secure.\n\nNutanix\u2019s solutions are unique for the industry and are great at locking in customers, a trait that Warren Buffett looks out for on all of his investments. Nutanix has dug up a niche in terms of being one of the only companies to integrate enterprise software seamlessly for so many businesses, and its new subscription-based business plan is bound to lock in more customers. Nutanix also runs ML-based automation of workload management, ticketing integration, and output date forecasting. A senior director at Home Depot (HD) had to say this about NTNX: \u201cPrism Pro makes it extremely easy to watch all of the clusters in our environment and quickly reconfigure things as needed. It provides very clear metrics on oversubscription and utilization, giving us a powerful, proactive capacity management function that we never had before...Since Prism Pro is so easy to use, we told the database engineers they could quickly learn to manage their own environments and monitor capacity utilization\u201d. Prism Pro has just been one software product of many to remove complication and coding out of everyday business use cases. Nutanix also offers services similar to VMWare in its VM management solutions, but the highlight of Nutanix is the integration of public and private cloud into one software. Their innovation on multiple fronts and in multiple industries is just one reason why the vision for them is limitless, but now it\u2019s time to get into the numbers. \n\nNutanix also has Xi IoT solutions, another developing branch of their services which is involved in manufacturing, oil and gas, and smart city infrastructure (Xi IoT helps improve traffic flows, guides emergency vehicles, and more!). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinancials are the biggest insight into a company\u2019s stability and growth prospectuses, and although I love the business structure and the innovative drive, the financials look somewhat concerning, but the surprise ER today clears up plenty of doubts I had held previously.\n\nFinancially, 2018 appeared to be by far the best year for Nutanix, as these next metrics will show: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lf664ifqmj51.png?width=562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=296cbfa5b6489205893ade30b32cd73bde18fbe8\n\nAs you can see, in 2018 the interest expense to gross profit ratio was the lowest\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nR&amp;D to Gross profit was the lowest\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7i43rckiqmj51.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=755a74355b1b43dbbf69040505f8492f5289094a\n\nSG&amp;A Expenses were far lower as well\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/crzzuekoqmj51.png?width=614&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc3a3c34833ee7f3e0b1185cd0c28a619656fe3f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04uyzkntqmj51.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56bcf12f2d6240db0524000e3391ab873cbbfd24\n\nAs you can see, NTNX had heavily levered itself in 2018, so a lot of the decline in price after 2018 was due to the over leveraging (I\u2019ll explain why this was bad later) and led to negative free cash flow : \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w6t2k2kvqmj51.png?width=365&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95c145fca89dbfa2b0af3e0a5aaeaed148fd34a5\n\nAnd the simple reason why this happened to their financials is because of a change in business model to a subscription-based platform ([https://www](https://www/). fool.com/investing/2019/06/03/nutanix-stumbles-on-sales-execution-and-subscripti.aspx). Basically a transformation in financing structure led to massive increases in SGA and R&amp;D expenses, which will, in my opinion be great for the long run as software sales had increased in 2019 while hardware sales went down, which shows the company\u2019s transition to digitizing. So Nutanix felt that there were lots of sharks in the water, and were quick to transition to a more sustainable model for the long term as profit margins continued to increase and so did liquidity. CEO Dheeraj Pandey had this to say about the transition during the financial reporting year of 2019, and all this obviously factored into the stock price as forecasted cash flows were heavily damaged \n\n*\u201cDuring Q3, we executed well on the strong plan to ramp lead generation and thus improved sales execution. As we noted in both our Q2 earnings call and at our Investor Day in March, we continue to believe our actions to address this will drive improved business into FY '20 as these changes take a couple of quarters to show results. We will be watchful and conservative in the near term as we give New Americas sales leadership time to effect change as we understand the top line impact of even higher subscriptions.\u201d*\n\nHere were some immediately positive effects of this change: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y85xkq2yqmj51.png?width=536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=187a33377137a649282191e65756e68980b6c31a\n\nCash conversion was pushed back into negative (good liquidity)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bs5lq1uzqmj51.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97ef577b4562a47079f20aaaa8ec8ad126404a2a\n\nLower Debt/Ebitda\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5sxgaid1rmj51.png?width=621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d20911a3355b8a5425526555c69e93558c91d487\n\nLower Capex/Ebitda\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3itievv2rmj51.png?width=558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22188c80a30c0e24c89dc2c9a82f6fee188b3cf1\n\nHigher net profit margins\n\nAnd if you compare the current ratio to its much larger competitor, VMWare, you\u2019ll see that although NTNX has more solutions, it has maintained a higher asset/debt ratio (2.13 vs 0.98). And so although current growth and value may be concerning, know it\u2019s because of a change in business structure that\u2019s causing this and not incompetence. \n\nAs today\u2019s surprise ER came out, NTNX shares jumped 17% after hours, meeting my expectations that this company was digging its way out. I had good expectations, but Nutanix handily surpassed them: \u201c**Reached 88 Percent of Billings from Subscription:** Nutanix continued its transition to a subscription-based business model, with subscription billings up 29% year-over-year to $341 million, representing 88% of total billings, and subscription revenue up 46% year-over-year to $285 million, representing 87% of total revenue.\u201d [Nutanix Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2020 Financial Results](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nutanix-reports-fourth-quarter-fiscal-200600203.html)\n\nNow that the financial report has come out and we know this new structure will be taking it in the right direction, \n\n\u201cIn conjunction with its move to a subscription-based business model, the Company is shifting its guidance to Annual Contract Value (ACV) billings instead of Total Contract Value (TCV) billings and revenue. Management will resume providing quarterly guidance with Q1 Fiscal 2021 during its earnings conference call today in order to provide context to this shift.\u201d\n\n*This just means that Nutanix\u2019s financials will be far more consistent and bolstered now. Nutanix was also able to add far more customers to its HCI product this quarter and was recognized as a Forrester Analyst leader in this sector: \u201c****Recognized as a Leader:*** *Nutanix was* [*named a Leader*](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nutanix.com%2Fpress-releases%2F2020%2Fnutanix-named-a-leader-in-hyperconverged-infrastructure-by-prominent-independent-research-firm&amp;esheet=52273899&amp;newsitemid=20200827005684&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=named+a+Leader&amp;index=7&amp;md5=ba30cfc91de704bbf0227854577029f9) *in The Forrester Wave\u2122: Hyper Converged Infrastructure, Q3 2020 report, published by Forrester Research, Inc. Nutanix believes this is consistent with additional independent market research, all of which conclude that Nutanix software is an undisputed leader in the fast-growing HCI market.\u201d NTNX also reduced the use of cash flows by 66% this quarter \u201c****Free Cash Flow:*** *Use of $13.8 million, compared to use of $33.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019\u201d*\n\n*and had a 30% increase in deferred revenue since the 4th quarter of 2019.* \n\nNutanix\u2019s new leadership and financial restructuring will lead to a much better financial outlook for the company, and if it doesn\u2019t as soon as we expect their innovation, outreach, and compatibility will be more than enough to lift the share\u2019s prices. On top of that, NTNX has stayed aggressive in terms of offering the most they can, they have become a conglomerate of SaaS, devouring smaller startups and similar SaaS companies: \n\nAll in all, Nutanix has a bright and storied future ahead of it, and that is even more apparent after these earnings. Now my only concern is the possible change in leadership, but the market is seeing it as good news for the future of the company. \n\nTl:dr NTNX LEAPs for 2021 and 2022, I like the Jan 2022 35 call",

Wake up and smell the roses.\n\nWorkday's Human Capital Management software is not sexy and curvy like most other cloud company offerings. But that's exactly why this stock is a steal right now.\n\n**FINANCIALS**\n\nThe market capitalization of \\~$50B is confoundingly rational and grounded. This is criminally low for a cloud software company with: \n\n* Over $1B in quarterly earnings\n* A track record of stellar quarterly earnings growth (&gt;=20% the past two years)\n* A SaaS business model\n* Widespread adoption among the S&amp;P 500\n* **A quarterly loss of only $16.8M compared to $122.5M in the same quarter last year.** Holy shit, these guys CFO\n* Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $2.75B (!!!!!!)\n\n**THE REAL JUICY DD FROM AN INDUSTRY INSIDER**\n\nYes, I am an industry insider.\n\n* [Look at their top executives.](https://www.workday.com/en-gb/company/about-workday/leadership.html) The vast majority of them are Ex-Oracle. Most of the rest are ex-SAP/Salesforce. These are not tech upstarts, they are industry veterans executing on a meticulous plan. They had excruciating familiarity with how shitty the Oracle HCM (PeopleSoft) was, and built the perfect product\n* Which brings me to my second point. HR insiders are unanimous in viewing Workday HCM as an upgrade over PeopleSoft and SAP. Because it is an upgrade. Whether the majority of employees are white collar or blue collar - it is a fucking upgrade. Oracle and SAP products are dying cash cows with Stone Age capabilities. Essentially, Workday's only competition is resistance to change and lack of resources on the behalf of HR leaders\n* This bullet point is what made me buy shares last year. **Workday's sales and distribution channels are fucking insane.** For example, all the major HR consulting firms sell Workday to their clients. Because it's a fucking upgrade. That's right, THERE ARE WHOLE OTHER COMPANIES THAT SELL WORKDAY TO CLIENTS. On top of that, Workday's own Sales and Marketing staff are overwhelmingly Ex-Oracle, so they leverage their connections to convert past clients\n\nIT STILL HAS ROOM TO RUN.

A familiar company so I won't dive to deep in the TLDR here.

(Saved you a click into Wikipedia)**\n\nLOW is one of the larger retail providers in the home improvement space (very similar to Home Depot). Due to Covid-19 they have seen an extremely high increase in traffic based on their previous earnings reports and have now started to invest further into their e-commerce/delivery capabilities.\n\n**Financials**\n\n* Their earnings have seen a nice and steady year over year growth with the latest ones climbing into the $70B/yr Revenue.\n* Short term assets of $21.9B cover their short term liabilities of $18.33B\n* Dividend ranging around 1.4% has been steady over the last few years \n* Their President just bought another 10K shares at $103.86 in March\n\n**Play**\n\n**LOW $160c 8/21 &amp; LOW $160c 9/18**\n\n**Exit Strategy**\n\nAs this is very uncommon for me (I usually get in 2 weeks before or more), I am going to see where the market goes.

        "selftext": "Position:\n\nWMT 140C 9/11 \n\nMSFT 230C 9/18\n\nI bought those calls on Friday, it's now down 40%, I had a chance to walk away today with a 20% loss (2k) but I decided to hold, I still think the deal will go through, here is my analysis:\n\n* From the point of view of POTUS, banning Tiktok or forcing Tiktok to be sold to American are both viable options. It will most likely draw him more support in the election since Tiktok users are probably going to vote against him anyway \n\n* It is very unlikely that Tiktok can win its lawsuit, and everyone is well aware of that\n\n* Banning Tiktok will not hurt US's interests to any extend (unlike huaiwei and zte, where you can see multiple extensions were given to them, and there were much more resistances), after Tiktok is banned, their marketshare will be gobbled up by other companies like facebook\n\n* Tiktok has no bargaining power because of what is said above, and it is running out of time\n\n* Tiktok has a good algorithm to provide personalized feed, this is part that China require a license to export. Many people thinks that without this algorithm, Tiktok is just an empty shell. I disagree with that, this algorithm is most likely just one micro service from the entire cloud infrastructure. Their data, users (existing market share)  are more valuable assets.\n\n* If facebook can create a Tiktok rip off, microsoft should not have much difficulty with integration  \n\n* $30 billion is a lot of money for any company, if Tiktok is outright banned, there is nothing that could be recovered, I do not believe Bytedance and its investors will allow it to die like this when there are better options\n\n* Believe it or not, the Chinese government is here to serve the interest of Chinese companies. In my opinion, the announcement on Aug 28th is to help Tiktok to gain more bargaining power, since they are most likely facing pressure to sell off their AI algorithms as well. \n\n* If I was the CEO of ByteDance, I would want this to be over sooner rather than later, as time approaches the deadline, they have more to lose than Microsoft/Oracle. And if Tiktok is banned for a few days, they will lose a large portion if not all of their market share, since there is no royalty in this sort of business\n\n* Oracle is less likely to win due to a couple of reasons, 1. WMT decided to partner with MSFT not ORCL. 2. ByteDance is facing pressure from the Chinese market as well, selling the company with close relationship with the POTUS can have negative affects to the domestic market\n\nOf course, there are a lot of risks and uncertainties as well, notably:\n\n* Somehow Oracle won the bid, the I would probably lose all my money\n\n* I don't know what is a likelihood that an extension would be given to Tiktok, since their strategy can be to drag this on, this is probably the highest risk that would mess up with my calls. However, a few days ago, Tiktok reassured their employees more \"clarity\" for their future (https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/tiktok-executives-reassure-employees-after-ceo-exit-1.1485955)\n\n* ByteDance is criticized for begin too soft (when in reality they really have no control over the situation), and Chinese consumers threaten to boycott Douyin (chinese TikTok) if Tiktok was sold to an American company",

In some ways I was privileged because I got to work with my dad in factories during an era where manufacturing technology started to change in drastic ways. It inspired me as a young pup which eventually lead me down the road of online mathematics-related education. Lucky for you, this includes game theory and finances.\n\nI write these DD's because I believe I have an enormous advantage in the current climate. I love to distribute knowledge, love the process of learning and I consider it one of my hobbies.\n\nI self-taught myself serverless and cloud computing technologies while I was in school and moved to California to pursue building my dream company in education technology. It also appears that the US is shifting toward increased Mexican trade, which I understand quite closely and have written about before.\n\nI love education and I love teaching - it is my passion. The intent here is to spur imagination and debate on the subject. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # Dropbox as an Education Company\n\n[Compliance is king](https://preview.redd.it/mil0bshb4qe51.png?width=2782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b42c5173e74ab83bd9cc38b115796a772c6d5b43)\n\nDropbox has a wonderful history introducing the masses to cloud computing applications. It solved a real file problem at the time - Apple and Microsoft files were not intuitive and there was a split in adoption. Academics of various ages needed an elegant solution and that was Dropbox. Think about that; users looked to solve a File Operating System problem using cloud computing in 2007. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDropbox is an education company. The best education technology companies are those that support the flow of education with high quality tooling rather than trying to replace it. Under this framework, I regularly invest in things like Autodesk, Adobe, and Dropbox as the companies have created an environment where IT school administrators will offer Creative Cloud, Autodesk, and Dropbox services under their student email.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are familiar with the American education system, you know that this is an absurdly slow dinosaur when it comes to getting changes in motion. Technology, as a result, has to execute in rather phenomenal way to even have a chance in the education space. This is why you'll see awfully accessible and robust technology exist in the space - Windows, Macs, Chromebooks, Khan Academy, Symbolab, Dropbox, Adobe, Autodesk, Oracle, Blackboard, Canvas, etc. They are convenient tools that pay a lot of attention to things like ADA (disabilities) compliance and the like.\n\nThere is a revolution occurring in education in the form of disabilities pedagogy (the study of how to teach). Unlocking a lot of understanding in children with non-verbal autism, PTSD, and other serious learning challenges is an enormous frontier in teaching, learning, and understanding human development. \\*\\*These technologies do not get in the way and exist to assist.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # Dropbox as a Technical Product\n\nThe File &amp; Storage system in any given operating system will always be critically important to a user and the need will always be larger than you can anticipate. It extends from IT safety, banking, education, supercomputing, and so on. Can you evaluate the amount of storage and data needed after Machine Learning tools have grown for 10 years? It can not be determined, but it can be anticipated. Organizations that have built their own distributed infrastructure are advantaged. One can reasonably assume that these companies will distribute the building blocks to their products. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xu67kf179qe51.png?width=2953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16a1ce179420a08750c5df246064f6eebdad30cc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note: the CEO is currently in the Board of Directors of Facebook - who is also looking into workspace applications \\*\\*SPECIFICALLY TO SOLVE LONG TERM WORK-FROM-HOME COMMUNICATIONS\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Workplace @ Facebook](https://preview.redd.it/vpcnvvru4qe51.png?width=3382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46b3f6da6502c53102a73047c4b13977f3d498b1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Workspace @ Dropbox](https://preview.redd.it/rr462ns25qe51.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb2ba0e8e4fcc2bc24e82129bd0e209bee2d55d8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is an enormous list of high-quality features that Dropbox offer due to its integration and infrastructure approach across multiple platforms:\n\n* \\- File security\n\n[banned by xi](https://preview.redd.it/mtg94ntd8qe51.png?width=1411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e62965952b2e9b876860beede13c106b59115f6)\n\n* \\- Signatures\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ewaxdbdl8qe51.png?width=2791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce09ff54bad22b1920a33326478f69e11171a81d\n\n* \\- Computer vision document scanning\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[OCR](https://preview.redd.it/0551mtwz8qe51.png?width=2413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22ec6a63fe1fe5935dea0d7c743ea4a202f7a393)\n\n* \\- Workspace expectations (file syncing, large file transfers, organization,IT controls)\n* \\- Link generators to leak those sweet unreleased albums through zoom [https://www.dropbox.com/s/36pz554f6ds5eyu/Uzi%20Wheezy%20Zoom.wav.m4a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/36pz554f6ds5eyu/Uzi%20Wheezy%20Zoom.wav.m4a?dl=0)\n* \\- File embedding \n* \\- Self-built storage infrastructure\n* \\- Deep industry wide integrations ranging from Zoom to Adobe\n* \\- Deep relationships in the education sector\n* \\- An unholy amount of other file solutions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hicx44ptdqe51.png?width=2547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc087db00260d31a49e3c33a32020848f9d91e05\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Compliance Advantage\n\nCloud computing is no longer a mystery, nor is it an open secret. It's a necessary supply chain tool, demanded, and growing faster than imaginations can keep up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work in the fintech industry. Let me tell you, compliance is everything. There is no Square, Paypal, Dropbox, Cloudflare, or any of your favorite important apps without various degrees of compliance. It would be much more helpful to view Square as an organization that distributes compliance to it's small businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \\- For Banking it's the Bank Secrecy Act and PATRIOT Act\n* \\- For Education it's FERPA\n* \\- For Healthcare it's HIPAA\n* \\- The list goes on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean? It's means that mature cloud companies like Cloudflare, Dropbox, and the like are in an excellent positions to \\*\\*satisfy the legal means to continue to grow at scale\\*\\*. This is an extremely important factor to consider in the next 5 years. **Dropbox is not something people \"get\" -  it's something that they're \"given\".** For example, when I signed my name to accept my first career job - I was given Dropbox's HelloSign to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cloud Computing Hierarchy of needs](https://preview.redd.it/s3hfokxg5qe51.png?width=2981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ff1c87c8db5802df55d7f4156ee9b9f2e4f23c4)\n\n[Compliance advantage in education](https://preview.redd.it/s1qhcdxj5qe51.png?width=3821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34678980f20b163d47ec041add6defae67720038)\n\n[Another example of compliance-focused approaches](https://preview.redd.it/6nhym58n5qe51.png?width=3821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bc8101854eaa2a29f643f630024be629b23b9de)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Monopoly Problem &amp; Integrations Competitors\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1d1vs3oy5qe51.png?width=1835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81db898c8bd65364d7b2162ede4daecd5455547e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverybody knows it. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple is a monopoly cluster on data. Breaking them up is not a complex equation. Much like the death of a drug or religious cartel; there are many other viable candidates eager to steer the wheel in another direction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is possible to compete against them, as evidence by organizations like Dropbox, Cloudflare, TikTok, Zoom, and the like. These smaller companies combining is what I consider the Unicorn Operating System. There opportunity is by distributing infrastructure to overwhelm larger companies that depend on acquisitions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is already happening. Zoom &amp; Dropbox distribute infrastructure.\n\n[Cloud Infrastructure is critical.](https://preview.redd.it/2entdn446qe51.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f486402438fd28382c109b7e3cc6c62483f99a1a)\n\n[Dropbox executing like a pioneer, similar to Paypal](https://preview.redd.it/wfli2evh6qe51.png?width=1834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7e0ac53777e81ff94736208493a873475eed8ef)\n\n# # Dropbox Financially\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7s08qzcdqe51.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9ad76618cd785e924f3e2203480903a9e681e0d\n\nThis part easy.

Under their restructuring plan, Microsoft or Oracle could receive a minority stake in the assets, the sources added.\n\nThe TikTok assets for sale could be worth between $25 billion and $30 billion, the sources said. To help fund their bid, the ByteDance investors are discussing exchanging some or all of their stakes in the Chinese company with equity in the TikTok assets, according to the sources.\n\nMicrosoft remains the lead bidder for the TikTok assets because of its deep pockets and technical capacity to design new algorithms for TikTok that will be separate from ByteDance and its Chinese short video app Douyin, according to the sources.",

        "selftext": "Swaggy is back with his Sunday morning read of Unusual Options Activity. I get a lot of DMs asking about the activity, so if you want to read a bit about option flow, I made [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) describing how it works.\n\nIn addition, if you would like to check out the option flow tool and scan for yourself, here is the [option flow tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow).\n\nAs for unusual trades, it\u2019s been pretty quiet the last two weeks. Most flow is coming into big tech stocks and pumping them higher. I caught a few other smaller plays that I\u2019ll get into the details of here.\n\n**MSFT \u2013 Microsoft Corporation**\n\nMicrosoft has been a repeat name for some bullish flow in the last months. Looks like players have been opening bull call spreads with relatively medium-term expirations (end of the year) expecting the stock to continue it\u2019s slow rise up. The range of strike prices has been $215-$240. MSFT has been one of the companies looking to acquire TikTok in the latest rumors. Other names that have seen some similar flow last week were AMZN, FB, ADBE, and of course, AAPL.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tmrkvz3e4ri51.png?width=2150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5128bc760d4ad4905cf479242fa4be52c7dfcd5\n\n**NVDA \u2013 NVIDIA Corporation**\n\nNVDA reported earnings last week and although they blew estimates out of the water, the stock remained flat post-earnings. NVDA demonstrated some high growth in their server market and overall they have been one of the best performing tech stonks. Flow has been mixed, but leaning on the bullish side. Overall activity has picked up greatly since last week as traders could be expecting another move up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1klzg6ze4ri51.png?width=2430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d91676e3f077ecd17e9a2f2d604de2ac8b64563\n\n**QCOM \u2013 QUALCOMM Incorporated**\n\nQCOM is another semi-conductor company that has seen a good run over the last several months. Players placed bets that the company would continue it\u2019s steady rise up as demand for chips in a more data-driven world are becoming the new norm. A lot of calls were traded with strikes in the $105-$120 range. These mostly have expirations from November to January 2021, so they are mid-term in the timeframes and expectations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rv6wpktf4ri51.png?width=1610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f5f1ed70da42174709714410765d64535b69f56\n\n**ORCL \u2013 Oracle Corporation**\n\nORCL has seen an uptick in activity on the bullish side. Rumors are they are making a bid for the TikTok acquisition as well. ORCL\u2019s stock price has been somewhat stagnant over the last several months and they didn\u2019t rally as hard as the rest of big tech from the March lows. The option flow might indicate a bullish move in the future for this stock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6njzexg4ri51.png?width=2420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fcb092d4b6735bb223c38bedc6fff892e0e33f7\n\n**LYFT \u2013 Lyft Inc**\n\nLYFT and UBER have shut down service in California due to a new ruling that would require them to treat independent contractors as employees with benefits moving forward. Their rebuttal was to simply shut-down service and put the pressure back on the government to make their next move. Soon it will show that these ride-sharing companies have become a staple in our societal culture as they have made our lives so much easier. A whole slew of some pretty large calls were opened last week that was caught as bullish flow. I\u2019m not sure what the catalyst would be here, maybe it\u2019s because the stock is near the lows and shutting down service actually induces less losses on the company. Who knows.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pxz92li4ri51.png?width=2020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5eed0add829b6b63c17a73322ccab635ca8d309\n\n**DLTR \u2013 Dollar Tree Inc**\n\nDollar Tree caught some unusual call volume last week. Looks like players are betting on a 10% gain in the stock price with the October strike. These bets weren\u2019t unusually large in size, but for a company like DLTR they were pretty significant. The plays were sweeps at the $108 strike in Sept 25/Oct 02 expirations. The stock has had a decent run over the last several months and the players are expecting another leg up soon. We\u2019ll see about this one.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k3dkhbkj4ri51.png?width=1902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1de6a827de4fd6572df1600de3f839783271624\n\n**CRM \u2013 Salesforce**\n\nCRM/Salesforce has been a hot stock recently. There was some bullish flow earlier this month and again into last week. My scanner picked up two long position, although in my opinion it looks like a spread was opened (still bullish). The spread was actually opened when the stock was trading at $197, and it is currently $10 higher at $207. The player bought to open 11,000 calls at the $200 strike and sold 11,000 calls at the $220 strike, paying $9 million for the position. They are already profitable on their position, but if CRM closes above $220 by February, they will have a net profit of $22 million.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qkw6lpok4ri51.png?width=1612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cf3112c70a994a5724707e18b3376cb6490b43d\n\n**CZR \u2013 Caesars Entertainment Inc**\n\nCZR caught some bullish activity last week when players opened January and March 2021 calls. The stock has already had an unbelievable recovery from the March lows, but is still nowhere near the highs. Looks like as the country opens back up again (if it stays that way), they expect the company to continue it\u2019s good performance. Some of the bullish flow was put-selling, which suggests the stock will have already reached it\u2019s long-term bottom.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzkpssol4ri51.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7978edf9012a3334d7978075da93bac94215fd1",

        "selftext": "**Context -**\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 increased 0.2% on Tuesday, setting new closing and intraday highs for the first time since February in the process. The Nasdaq Composite also set new highs with a 0.7% gain, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.2%) and Russell 2000 (-1.0%) finished in negative territory. \n\nThe new highs were reached shortly after the open on the heels of blowout earnings reports from Walmart (WMT 134.71, -0.89, -0.7%) and Home Depot (HD 285.00, -3.24, -1.1%), better-than-expected housing starts and building permits data for July, and continued upwards momentum in mega-cap stocks like Amazon (AMZN 3312.49, +130.08, +4.1%). \n\nIn sell-the-news fashion, the S&amp;P 500, including WMT and HD, quickly descended into negative territory. An intraday rebound, however, did give the S&amp;P 500 an incremental new high in the afternoon as investors gravitated toward mega-cap stocks within the consumer discretionary (+1.5%), communication services (+1.1%), and information technology (+0.4%) sectors.\n\nConversely, investors generally avoided small-caps and value-oriented stocks within the energy (-1.7%), financials (-0.7%), utilities (-0.5%), and industrials (-0.5%) sectors. Interestingly, the Dow (-0.2%) was a better representation of today's action, as declining issues did outnumber advancing issues at the NYSE and Nasdaq. \n\nSeparately, Politico reported that Senate Republicans are aiming to introduce a smaller stimulus package that will provide $300/week in enhanced unemployment, money for the USPS, and more money for small businesses. Additional fiscal support would provide investors some confidence in the large retailers sustaining their strong performances. \n\nIn other corporate news, Oracle (ORCL 55.18, +1.19, +2.2%) reportedly joined the list of companies trying to acquire TikTok US. Kohl's (KSS 20.01, -3.44, -14.7%) said it experienced a softer back-to-school selling season. Teva Pharma (TEVA 10.48, -1.11, -9.6%) is reportedly being sued by the U.S. government over alleged kickbacks violating the False Claims Act.\n\nU.S. Treasuries finished the session slightly higher. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell another 0.6% to 92.30, which benefited gold futures ($2013.2/ozt, +14.50, +0.7%). WTI crude futures declined 0.2%, or $0.09, to $42.80/bbl.\n\nLooking ahead, investors will receive the FOMC Minutes from the July 28-29 meeting and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday. \n\n**Index Summary -**\n\nS&amp;P 500 +0.22%;  Nasdaq +0.96%;\n\nDOW  -0.27%; Russell 2000  -0.96% \n\nVIX:  21.51 0.16,( +0.75%)\n\n**Sector Summary** \\-\n\n*The three highest sectors for today were :*\n\n Communication Services +0.9%;  Consumer Discretionary +0.62%;  Consumer Staples +0.4%;\n\n*The three lowest sectors for today were :*\n\n Energy  -1.26%;  Financials  -0.65%;  Industrials  -0.54%;\n\n**Commodities -**\n\nGold -  2013.5,( +0.02%);  Crude -  42.7,(  -0.44%) \n\n*Today\u2019s Option Activity Fast Facts -*\n\n **CBOE Put/Call Ratio -**  0.46\n\n ***Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -*** CPRI with 13 x the ADV of 3042.

        "selftext": "Do you guys look at buybacks when you buy a stock? Do you prefer dividends?\n\n...\n\nFor those who don't know:\n\n**Buybacks** are less straightforward than dividends but a more powerful way to pay stockholders due to its favorable tax implications. Buyback happens when a company buys its own shares (a company can spend $1M to pay dividends OR spend $1M to buy its own shares). As the number of shares decreases, the price per share goes up, profiting the stockholder. Top companies practicing buybacks were lead by **ORCL**, **EBAY**, and **SBUX** in their most recent filing.",

        "selftext": "**The Case for Nutanix**\n\n**Tl;dr NTNX will recover from financial instability soon so get 2022/2021 LEAPs**\n\nNutanix is a company that provides enterprise solutions via SaaS and PaaS to integrate data, computing, networking, and security using hyper converged infrastructure. Nutanix\u2019s Acropolis HCI runs all enterprise applications such from Oracle, SAP, Microsoft, Citrix, Splunk, and SQL, just to give you an idea of what type of league it\u2019s running with. Nutanix makes running IT solutions integrated, efficient and secure.\n\nNutanix\u2019s solutions are unique for the industry and are great at locking in customers, a trait that Warren Buffett looks out for on all of his investments. Nutanix has dug up a niche in terms of being one of the only companies to integrate enterprise software seamlessly for so many businesses, and its new subscription-based business plan is bound to lock in more customers. Nutanix also runs ML-based automation of workload management, ticketing integration, and output date forecasting. A senior director at Home Depot (HD) had to say this about NTNX: \u201cPrism Pro makes it extremely easy to watch all of the clusters in our environment and quickly reconfigure things as needed. It provides very clear metrics on oversubscription and utilization, giving us a powerful, proactive capacity management function that we never had before...Since Prism Pro is so easy to use, we told the database engineers they could quickly learn to manage their own environments and monitor capacity utilization\u201d. Prism Pro has just been one software product of many to remove complication and coding out of everyday business use cases. Nutanix also offers services similar to VMWare in its VM management solutions, but the highlight of Nutanix is the integration of public and private cloud into one software. Their innovation on multiple fronts and in multiple industries is just one reason why the vision for them is limitless, but now it\u2019s time to get into the numbers.\n\nNutanix also has Xi IoT solutions, another developing branch of their services which is involved in manufacturing, oil and gas, and smart city infrastructure (Xi IoT helps improve traffic flows, guides emergency vehicles, and more!).\n\nFinancials are the biggest insight into a company\u2019s stability and growth prospectuses, and although I love the business structure and the innovative drive, the financials look somewhat concerning, but the surprise ER today clears up plenty of doubts I had held previously.\n\nFinancially, 2018 appeared to be by far the best year for Nutanix, as these next metrics will show:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4iaqf4sntmj51.png?width=562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=313b257e2ec65a61205e5bb73e0f12498fa3a3e0\n\nAs you can see, in 2018 the interest expense to gross profit ratio was the lowest\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7ss71tptmj51.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b4bad6abecc41bb12a8bd55678bef4f0985c917\n\nR&amp;D to Gross profit was the lowest\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xwfjl1mqtmj51.png?width=614&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2abec84fd95d1ef223f6fb340548867dca80b2f3\n\nSG&amp;A Expenses were far lower as well\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fhbkzatstmj51.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aa2c2badb6824c6bc6eb97c0c92ff73913c76a5\n\nAs you can see, NTNX had heavily levered itself in 2018, so a lot of the decline in price after 2018 was due to the over leveraging (I\u2019ll explain why this was bad later) and led to negative free cash flow :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lg57d9uutmj51.png?width=365&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1cf9fdeacdd8fe1cd87df24ca2ba49cc8124b48\n\nAnd the simple reason why this happened to their financials is because of a change in business model to a subscription-based platform ([https://www](https://www/). fool.com/investing/2019/06/03/nutanix-stumbles-on-sales-execution-and-subscripti.aspx). Basically a transformation in financing structure led to massive increases in SGA and R&amp;D expenses, which will, in my opinion be great for the long run as software sales had increased in 2019 while hardware sales went down, which shows the company\u2019s transition to digitizing. So Nutanix felt that there were lots of sharks in the water, and were quick to transition to a more sustainable model for the long term as profit margins continued to increase and so did liquidity. CEO Dheeraj Pandey had this to say about the transition during the financial reporting year of 2019, and all this obviously factored into the stock price as forecasted cash flows were heavily damaged\n\n*\u201cDuring Q3, we executed well on the strong plan to ramp lead generation and thus improved sales execution. As we noted in both our Q2 earnings call and at our Investor Day in March, we continue to believe our actions to address this will drive improved business into FY '20 as these changes take a couple of quarters to show results. We will be watchful and conservative in the near term as we give New Americas sales leadership time to effect change as we understand the top line impact of even higher subscriptions.\u201d*\n\nHere were some immediately positive effects of this change:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sel7ywlwtmj51.png?width=536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24c56863abd3d37427a14204e1987f85929de63d\n\nCash conversion was pushed back into negative (good liquidity)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o0zm2psxtmj51.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8178a09bb3eb6e5fee9464e86561139269c000d8\n\nLower Debt/Ebitda\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jrooiuytmj51.png?width=621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1beb4c392e9744feacffd09add600cac55086616\n\nLower Capex/Ebitda\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/80hsj900umj51.png?width=558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6b77c0974f5f434d86cd0ea130a9144e06f6c00\n\nHigher net profit margins\n\nAnd if you compare the current ratio to its much larger competitor, VMWare, you\u2019ll see that although NTNX has more solutions, it has maintained a higher asset/debt ratio (2.13 vs 0.98). And so although current growth and value may be concerning, know it\u2019s because of a change in business structure that\u2019s causing this and not incompetence.\n\nAs today\u2019s surprise ER came out, NTNX shares jumped 17% after hours, meeting my expectations that this company was digging its way out. I had good expectations, but Nutanix handily surpassed them: \u201c**Reached 88 Percent of Billings from Subscription:** Nutanix continued its transition to a subscription-based business model, with subscription billings up 29% year-over-year to $341 million, representing 88% of total billings, and subscription revenue up 46% year-over-year to $285 million, representing 87% of total revenue.\u201d [Nutanix Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2020 Financial Results](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nutanix-reports-fourth-quarter-fiscal-200600203.html)\n\nNow that the financial report has come out and we know this new structure will be taking it in the right direction,\n\n\u201cIn conjunction with its move to a subscription-based business model, the Company is shifting its guidance to Annual Contract Value (ACV) billings instead of Total Contract Value (TCV) billings and revenue. Management will resume providing quarterly guidance with Q1 Fiscal 2021 during its earnings conference call today in order to provide context to this shift.\u201d\n\n\\*This just means that Nutanix\u2019s financials will be far more consistent and bolstered now. Nutanix was also able to add far more customers to its HCI product this quarter and was recognized as a Forrester Analyst leader in this sector: \u201c\\****Recognized as a Leader:*** *Nutanix was* [*named a Leader*](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nutanix.com%2Fpress-releases%2F2020%2Fnutanix-named-a-leader-in-hyperconverged-infrastructure-by-prominent-independent-research-firm&amp;esheet=52273899&amp;newsitemid=20200827005684&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=named+a+Leader&amp;index=7&amp;md5=ba30cfc91de704bbf0227854577029f9) \\*in The Forrester Wave\u2122: Hyper Converged Infrastructure, Q3 2020 report, published by Forrester Research, Inc. Nutanix believes this is consistent with additional independent market research, all of which conclude that Nutanix software is an undisputed leader in the fast-growing HCI market.\u201d NTNX also reduced the use of cash flows by 66% this quarter \u201c\\****Free Cash Flow:*** *Use of $13.8 million, compared to use of $33.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019\u201d*\n\n*and had a 30% increase in deferred revenue since the 4th quarter of 2019.*\n\nNutanix\u2019s new leadership and financial restructuring will lead to a much better financial outlook for the company, and if it doesn\u2019t as soon as we expect their innovation, outreach, and compatibility will be more than enough to lift the share\u2019s prices. On top of that, NTNX has stayed aggressive in terms of offering the most they can, they have become a conglomerate of SaaS, devouring smaller startups and similar SaaS companies:\n\nAll in all, Nutanix has a bright and storied future ahead of it, and that is even more apparent after these earnings. Now my only concern is the possible change in leadership, but the market is seeing it as good news for the future of the company.\n\nTl:dr NTNX LEAPs for 2021 and 2022, I like the Jan 2022 35 call\n\nbonus: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/korea-western-power-deploys-nutanix-130000609.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/korea-western-power-deploys-nutanix-130000609.html)\n\nGovt's using them for infrastructure help during covid",

Seem a little strange?\n\nFor those of you that know your letters in your tickers and nothing about the companies you invest in, Workday, Inc. is an American on\u2011demand (cloud-based) financial management and human capital management software vendor.\n\nThrough the COVID crises, one thing is certain. Payroll, and HR has been a logistical nightmare. With companies learning how EFMLA and PPP loans work on the fly, why would they want to spend even more time analyzing human capitol when there are services like Workday and Oracle that can do it for them?\n\nWDAY has certainly been busy. I\u2019m not saying that there is no reason for a reasonable boost in their valuation, and for investors to have interest. What I am saying is people aren\u2019t looking at the full picture.\n\nIn order for WDAY to continue to serve their previous customers as well as their incoming customers, WDAY has a lot of hiring to do. Why would they announce their upcoming expenditure on hiring before Q2 earning? They wouldn\u2019t. They will show a huge quarter and take any price upgrade they can get, then draw your hard earned dollars for expansion.\n\nI get it. Realistically being in the same market, serving similar customers as Oracle, you can imagine a slight boost (kind of like Oracle just received). What is unwarranted is a run of 25%+ in the matter of a few days, for reporting decent earnings.\n\nTL;DR - WDAY\u2019s run was unbacked and will stabilize lower than it is right now very quickly.\n\nBuy puts at the top. 250p 9/11.",

The S&amp;P 500 set an intraday record high but declined 0.2% amid relative weakness in the broader market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, and the Russell 2000 fell 1.0%.\n* There was an absence of new macro developments, so the same tech-related stocks continued to set the winning pace at the expense of the cyclical stocks within the energy (-2.2%), materials (-1.5%), financials (-1.2%), and industrials (-1.2%) sectors. Declining issues outpaced advancing issues by more than a 2:1 margin at the NYSE. \n* Apple (AAPL 129.04, +4.23, +3.4%) and Tesla (TSLA 498.32, +55.64, +12.6%) rose 3% and 12%, respectively, as investors continued to bid shares higher following their stock splits today. Amazon (AMZN 3450.96, +49.16, +1.5%) gained 1.5% after its drone delivery unit received FAA certification.\n* AAPL and AMZN carried the S&amp;P 500 information technology (+0.4%) and consumer discretionary (+0.2%) sectors into the green, but the health care (+0.3%) and utilities (+0.3%) sectors also put in a positive performance.\n* Interestingly, the CBOE Volatility Index climbed 15.0% to 26.41, as investors assumed some protection against a possible downturn in equities. The popular view is that a modest correction could come in September after a strong two-month performance in the S&amp;P 500. The benchmark index ended August with an impressive 7.0% gain. \n* Separately, CNBC reported that a TikTok deal could be announced as soon as tomorrow. Front-runners Microsoft (MSFT 225.53, -3.38, -1.5%), Walmart (WMT 138.85, -1.45, -1.0%), and Oracle (ORCL 57.22, -0.66, -1.1%) declined at least 1.0% today. \n* U.S. Treasuries saw modest gains amid the underlying weakness in the stock market. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield declined four basis points to 0.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.2% to 92.19.

        "selftext": "There appear to be at least four potential outcomes in the unfolding drama around TikTok.\n\nThis is a fluid situation, and other avenues could emerge. But with the Trump administration threatening to ban the popular short-video app in the U.S. unless ByteDance, the company\u2019s China-based parent, to sell TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to an American buyer, the situation is likely to reach a decision point soon.\n\nLet\u2019s review where we are:\n\nOption One: The status quo. In this scenario, ByteDance continues to operate the business in the U.S. That\u2019s not as crazy as it sounds. While President Trump has issued an executive order that will shut the service down in the U.S. unless an American company buys it, TikTok sued in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Monday, asserting that Trump\u2019s order is a violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In the lawsuit, the company also denies there is any security risk associated with the app. The company is asking the court to invalidate the executive order.\n\nIf nothing else, the lawsuit has the potential to give ByteDance more time to work out a deal with a potential buyer. \u201cWe do not take suing the government lightly, however we feel we have no choice but to take action to protect our rights, and the rights of our community and employees,\u201d the company said in a statement about the lawsuit. \u201cIn our complaint we make clear that we believe the administration ignored our extensive efforts to address its concerns, which we conducted fully and in good faith even as we disagreed with the concerns themselves.\"\n\nOption Two: Microsoft \ufffc (ticker: MSFT) buys TikTok\u2019s operations in the U.S. and perhaps several other countries. The TikTok lawsuit discloses that Microsoft and ByteDance have already signed a nonbinding letter of intent for a deal, although no terms or details have been disclosed. Microsoft has previously confirmed discussions with ByteDance on buying TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations. As Barron\u2019s laid out in this week\u2019s Tech Trader column, Microsoft is a logical bidder for TikTok, given an ample cash pile and experience with consumer and advertising-driven businesses. The Wall Street Journal reports that ByteDance founder and CEO Zhang Yiming favors a Microsoft transaction, citing \u201cpeople familiar with his thinking.\u201d The Journal notes that he briefly worked at Microsoft and has a good relationship with Microsoft CEO Satuya Nadella.\n\nOption Three: Oracle \ufffc (ORCL) buys TikTok\u2019s operations in the U.S., in league with ByteDance investors General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the two investment firms favor an Oracle bid and that they were concerned they would not get to participate in a Microsoft deal. Microsoft has said it might include outside investors, however, and the Journal notes that the firms could participate as minority investors in a Microsoft bid as well. The Journal points out that Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison and CEO Safra Catz have been financial supporters of the Trump re-election campaign, as has Sequoia partner Doug Leone, who according to the Journal is leading the firm\u2019s push to be involved in any deal for TikTok U.S. The political connections could give an Oracle bit an edge given the White House role in the situation, although Oracle has no experience in consumer or ad-supported businesses.\n\nOption Four: Another bidder emerges. There have been reports that Twitter \ufffc (TWTR) has explored a deal, but its relatively small size would make it difficult to engineer a Twitter/TikTok combination. The Journal reports that Twitter remains interested, but that it has not made much progress.\n\nMicrosoft still seems like the most logical buyer, but a win here is by no means assured. And some investors think the company would be better off using the $30 billion or more than it might take to complete the deal to invest in software businesses more synergistic with its core cloud computing operations.\n\nSource: Barron's",

        "selftext": "Having good risk management practices is fundamental to any trading or investing strategy, as it will help to keep potential losses in our pockets. As the Oracle of Omaha always puts it \u201cRule #1 is not to lose any money, and rule #2 is never to forget rule #1\u201d. At the end of the game, long term success will only be achieved if we live to fight enough days and get the necessary experience.\n\nWith this in mind, here are five simple Risk Management tips that any trader or investor should take into account when navigating the markets.\n\n1. Asset Allocation: This one applies more to an entire portfolio than a single trade. Essentially this means to diversify across the types of trade you hold at any given moment. The diversification can apply to different companies within an industry, different industries in general, even trades with different time horizons, or using puts and shorts to hedge positions.\n2. Position Sizing: Position sizing refers to the portion of your complete account that you are using to buy an asset. If you are looking at the screen every second and twitching with every tick, then probably you have not developed the mindset to handle that amount of money. The good part is that if you are serious in becoming a trader, with every trade you make your tolerance goes up which allows you to keep placing bigger bets.\n3. Buying in tranches: Basically this means not buying the full position in one go. You could buy in halves or thirds. This will allow you more time to manage a trade and make sure you are feeling comfortable, especially in tricky markets.\n4. Use stop Losses: For traders we must keep in mind to take small losses quickly, for investors this is a bit less so. Depending on the strategy you can use different type of stops such as trailing stop losses either with percentages or absolute values. Hard stop losses which is an order at a specific price. Or closing day stops where you sell the next morning if a stock closes the day below a certain price.\n5. Review your time horizon: there are many different strategies that are played in different time horizons. For example, day trading is extremely fast making multiple trades per day. Momentum and swing trading you hold either a day to a couple of weeks. Value investing you can hold anywhere from a couple of months to years. And finally things like dividend investing you would hold to forever.\n\nThoughts of a Psycho Trader...",

I think we may see a spike tomorrow premarket (in a few hours), but remember went MSFT went 202-214 in the trading day because of tiktok? It looks like that ORCL actually may buy TikTok instead.\n\nAs a result, there are two ways to play it. Sell puts on MSFT (hey, you get the shares if they go down, which ain't bad), or calls right at open on ORCL. I noticed [a huge bunch of call volume](https://unusualwhales.com/alerts/637fd3d1-a6e7-4c53-bcf3-6f37c53963b4) on ORCL expirying in sept.

        "selftext": " \n\nBetween today and yesterday I bought impulsive calls on ORCL, MSFT, and PGEN. I bought them on my phone VIA robinhood. When I got home later in the day I looked at what I did via TOS and Webull. It was overwhelmingly obvious how poor my decision making was. Just throwing this up here to show my thought process as I looked back and analyzed my (horrible) trades.\n\n**ORCL**\n\n8/18 ORCL - 56.50 call 8/21. At the time of purchase, 09:48, ORCL was at 56.41. The premium was .79. \n\nFindings\n\n* @ 9:48 the daily SMA was above the 180 SMA and trending down. \n* Was on the right side of a positive TT\\_SQUEEZE. In the dark blue almost to the zero line.\n* It was coming down from overbought. Was at 55% RSI.\n\nBetter Play\n\n* There was a fake out dip at 10:30, but the daily never crossed below the 180. \n* Daily Finally dropped below 180 and did not cross back until the following day. There was a small squeeze at 10:00ish on the 19th that ran up from 55.76 to 56.76. \n\nConclusion \n\n* This was a bad call. I should not have bought it on the 18th. There were no indicating factors that showed a good sign of buy. \n\n**MSFT**\n\n8/19 MSFT - 212.50 call 8/21. At the time of purchase, 09:38, MSFT was at 211.68. The premium was 1.34.\n\nFindings\n\n* daily SMA was sitting on the 180 line at purchase. \n* RSI was 62, coming down from overbought. \n* TTSQ was light blue but choppy with dark blue.\n* @ 9:44 (6 minutes later!!!) there was clear indication that daily was diving below 180 MA and the TTSQ was in the red trending down.\n* 10:00 TTSQ is Yellow rending up with indication of squeeze play (stacking red dots). \n* 10:16 @ 210.18 - possible buy (would have made money) but daily is still below 180\n* 11:22 @ 211.90 - Daily crosses 180 with confirmation. TTSQ is choppy but trending up. \n* 13:23 @ 211.90 - TTSQ red dots stacking. TTSQ is dark blue possible indicating end of run. Daily dives at 14:09. \n\nBetter Play\n\n* I bought at the completely wrong time. There was no indicators supporting a buy. If I had waited 6 minutes then I would have seen the downward daily SMA and known to hold off.  At 100 when the TTSQ was strong yellow and moving towards blue I should have been paying attention and then bought when the daily crossed teh 180. \n\nConclusion \n\n* Again I bought at the wrong time not paying attention to indicators. This should have been a win, but I did not pay attention. \n\n**PGEN**\n\n8/19 PGEN - 7.50 call 09/18. At the time of purchase, 11:27, PGEN was at 5.39. The premium was .30. \n\nFindings\n\n* The daily SMA was way above the 180. Crossover occurred at 9:41 @ $4.98. \n* RSI was overbought at 75%\n* TTSQ was dark blue coming down. \n\nBetter Play\n\n* SHould have bought shortly after 9:41 when crossover and confirmation occurred. \n\nConclusion \n\n* I bought at the peak of the day.

Active in the UK and Canada, FANS has been pursuing M&amp;A activities and is utilizing the benefits of blockchain technology. FANS is taking advantage of the current COVID crisis to cement itself as a major player in the e-sports betting market. A relatively new phenomenon that has seen tremendous growth in recent years and has untapped potential as it\u2019s popularity continues to grow worldwide. \n\nFounder and CEO Darius Eghdami has surrounded himself with all-stars in the field, something I respect immensely and shows he has his ego in check and recognizes the value and importance of one\u2019s entourage. FANS has added two industry veterans, Saxon Shadforth and Harish Narayanan Ramachandran, to its board of directors. \n\nSaxon Shadforth has \u201cover 25 years of global leadership expertise and 15 years\u2019 experience as an online gambling executive. With a background in commercialization, consumer hardware/software, enterprise software, product strategy and delivery; Saxon has extensive experience managing complex ecosystems required to operate and scale gaming brands in many categories and jurisdictions.\u201d He provides the experience the company needs to continue expanding into various international gaming markets. \n\nHarish Narayanan Ramachandran is the former president of PaddyPower Betfair, one of the world's largest gaming companies. As an experienced gaming executive, he brings a wealth of experience and will be an integral part of FANS aggressive international mergers and acquisitions growth strategy.\n\nFANS has acquired McBookie Ltd. a leading provider of regulated betting services in the United Kingdom. Total consideration for the acquisition of McBookie was $2.2M CAD. McBookie had no long term debt at the time of the acquisition. The recent acquisition of McBookie provides a strong foundation for the future of FansUnite as the Company continues to look to consolidate assets in leading regulated gaming jurisdictions such as the U.K.\n\nFANS also acquired Askott, a Vancouver based software development company with a team that has been building award-winning online gambling software since 2013. Askott has produced a one of a kind complete iGaming platform, Chameleon Gaming Platform, with an esports first focus geared for the next generation of online bettors and casino players. The B2B Chameleon Platform will now offer partners additional revenue streams through The Ear's Casino Aggregator hub by giving them access to over 6,000 casino games through a single integration. This will enhance Askott partners' offering and more importantly provide bettors with more entertainment options to choose from.\n\n\u201cThe amalgamation with Askott is a significant milestone and transforms us into one of Canada's premier iGaming companies. Combining with Askott provides us with a fully integrated gaming asset that offers multiple B2C platforms for users in a variety of betting offerings, B2B technology that can be licensed to all types of sportsbooks, and a seasoned team of executives that have led and grown multiple organizations on a global scale. This combination creates a leading online iGaming company, and positions us strongly for significant growth with new offerings and market opportunities.\" - Darius Eghdami\n\nSports betting is widely regarded as a vertical that will be disrupted by blockchain technology, with its inherent properties of transparency, security and immutably stored data providing a compelling use-case for both bettors and operators. Ethereum has established itself as the preeminent public blockchain in terms of developer mindshare, number of unique addresses, and transactions processed \u2014 surpassing 52% of all cryptocurrency transactions last year. The FansUnite Protocol provides the first viable solution for sports betting applications to accept transactions in any token on the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nFansUnite\u2019s key assets are:\n\nFansUnite Protocol: Free and shared infrastructure decentralized applications (\u201cDApps\u201d) will be able to build atop of and leverage FansUnite\u2019s Oracle network for bet resolution while still accepting wagers in any Ethereum-based token. The FansUnite Protocol will consist of a public library of smart contracts, standardized data structures, and a token economy designed to incentivize the provisioning of fast and accurate sports data by a decentralized network of oracles. The investor-backed blockchain solution eliminates pain-points that plague the existing wagering market, allowing for near-zero margins, together with trustless and equitable ecosystem.\n\nFansUnite Sportsbook: The FansUnite core team will develop the first DApp, the FansUnite Sportsbook, to leverage the FansUnite Protocol. The FansUnite Sportsbook will feature a 1% margin and social elements designed to allow collaboration amongst bettors. The social sportsbook concept described below highlights just one possible implementation of a DApp on this protocol. We anticipate a whole ecosystem of DApps leveraging the FansUnite Protocol and Oracle network, limited only by the ingenuity of developers and Community Members.\n\nFansUnite Media Inc.: FansUnite Media Inc., a subsidiary of FansUnite Entertainment Inc., is the interest owner of FansUnite.com. FansUnite.com is a social sports betting community started by three sports fans who wanted to take sports back to the people that fuel the industry, the fans! With FansUnite\u2019s free virtual currency, users are able to place fantasy wagers with absolutely zero monetary risk, track their bets with FansUnite\u2019s proprietary PickTracker and get a full-unedited look into their own history.\n\nThe online sports betting market in the US has drastically changed after the landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2018, as any state got the option to pursue legalization. In total, sports betting became legal in some form in 24 states. There is still huge untapped potential in states like California, where sports betting in not officially legal yet. Nevertheless, despite the legal challenges, interest in the industry is high. If FANS can cement itself in the US market, it\u2019s growth prospects become even more enticing.

        "selftext": "Hey canadianinvestor redditors,   \nSo first, I will just say I am grateful for the upvotes and one award for my [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/iarbcf/search_canadian_etf_holdings_is_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\\- wasn't sure what would come of it, but very encouraging. \n\nI realized early last week after posting things that what I thought was a free tier on Caspio would actually cost 2500$ to maintain! (due to using pivot tables, go figure - for those interested).   \n\n\nAnyways, since I like a challenge (and boy is it hard), I decided to try and find another way to share this with you \n\nThanks to ORACLE APEX   \n\n\n[HERE IT IS](https://u1uvlvsn399omtt-dbetfholdings2.adb.ca-montreal-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/r/andrew/etfholdings-ca/go?session=111888870439962)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those of you who bookmarked the other link - sorry... please save this one which I will be using/maintaining for now.  The free trial for Capio ends next weekend.\n\nI did collect slightly more recent data so the results you now see could differ slightly. Unfortunately, this time the ETF names got lost (so only search by symbol) - but now the companies and Symbols are together! I will try to get this right in the next update. I think some names may have been lost, but again will work on this.  \n\n\nOh and for those who wanted it this link has an *ADVANCED SEARCH* \\- I hope you like it.   \nFeel free to comment using the feedback tool, or DM or comments below. For now it is a little passion project - but eventually I'd welcome trying to grow it a bit.  Anyone with more experience designing similar things who may have inspiration or wisdom to share - please speak up.",

        "selftext": "Having good risk management practices is fundamental to any trading or investing strategy, as it will help to keep potential losses in our pockets. As the Oracle of Omaha always puts it \u201cRule #1 is not to lose any money, and rule #2 is never to forget rule #1\u201d. At the end of the game, long term success will only be achieved if we live to fight enough days and get the necessary experience.\n\nWith this in mind, here are five simple Risk Management tips that any trader or investor should take into account when navigating the markets.\n\n1. Asset Allocation: This one applies more to an entire portfolio than a single trade. Essentially this means to diversify across the types of trade you hold at any given moment. The diversification can apply to different companies within an industry, different industries in general, even trades with different time horizons, or using puts and shorts to hedge positions.\n2. Position Sizing: Position sizing refers to the portion of your complete account that you are using to buy an asset. If you are looking at the screen every second and twitching with every tick, then probably you have not developed the mindset to handle that amount of money. The good part is that if you are serious in becoming a trader, with every trade you make your tolerance goes up which allows you to keep placing bigger bets.\n3. Buying in tranches: Basically this means not buying the full position in one go. You could buy in halves or thirds. This will allow you more time to manage a trade and make sure you are feeling comfortable, especially in tricky markets.\n4. Use stop Losses: For traders we must keep in mind to take small losses quickly, for investors this is a bit less so. Depending on the strategy you can use different type of stops such as trailing stop losses either with percentages or absolute values. Hard stop losses which is an order at a specific price. Or closing day stops where you sell the next morning if a stock closes the day below a certain price.\n5. Review your time horizon: there are many different strategies that are played in different time horizons. For example, day trading is extremely fast making multiple trades per day. Momentum and swing trading you hold either a day to a couple of weeks. Value investing you can hold anywhere from a couple of months to years. And finally things like dividend investing you would hold to forever.\n\nThoughts of a Psycho Trader...",

The person asked not to be named because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nOracle has proposed a deal of $20 billion in cash and stock, according to a report in Hollywood publication The Wrap. Oracle\u2019s offer would be made up of $10 billion in cash and $10 billion in Oracle stock plus 50% of annual TikTok profit would flow back to ByteDance for two years, one unidentified person told The Wrap.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Microsoft versus Oracle, the one thing that separates the two companies with respect to national security is that Microsoft has a large footprint in China,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cOracle on the other hand has a strong reputation of really putting a great firewall between its operations and China and that\u2019s an important thing.\u201d",

He's been getting all his trades wrong recently, thus doing the opposite of him is a good strategy. \n\nTherefore, I say we take down this boomer and show him that we're here to get him to retire in complete confusion over the market - and make him realize that he's old, out of touch and is no longer fit to participate in this market. Let's make the Oracle of Omaha feel foolish and sad and end his trading life in the red. \n\nThis is not in spite of him, this is to honor grandpapa buffett as a wsb legend - let's face it, we only honor the truly great losers here.

If you look at the 1 year chart it is an absolute disaster, CEO was fired in Nov '19, they projected soft growth in Q1 and withdrew guidance completely in Q2.

In some ways I was privileged because I got to work with my dad in factories during an era where manufacturing technology started to change in drastic ways. It inspired me as a young pup which eventually lead me down the road of online mathematics-related education. Lucky for you, this includes game theory and finances.\n\nI write these DD's because I believe I have an enormous advantage in the current climate. I love to distribute knowledge, love the process of learning and I consider it one of my hobbies.\n\nI self-taught myself serverless and cloud computing technologies while I was in school and moved to California to pursue building my dream company in education technology. It also appears that the US is shifting toward increased Mexican trade, which I understand quite closely and have written about before.\n\nI love education and I love teaching - it is my passion. The intent here is to spur imagination and debate on the subject. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # Dropbox as an Education Company\n\n[Compliance is king](https://preview.redd.it/mil0bshb4qe51.png?width=2782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b42c5173e74ab83bd9cc38b115796a772c6d5b43)\n\nDropbox has a wonderful history introducing the masses to cloud computing applications. It solved a real file problem at the time - Apple and Microsoft files were not intuitive and there was a split in adoption. Academics of various ages needed an elegant solution and that was Dropbox. Think about that; users looked to solve a File Operating System problem using cloud computing in 2007. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDropbox is an education company. The best education technology companies are those that support the flow of education with high quality tooling rather than trying to replace it. Under this framework, I regularly invest in things like Autodesk, Adobe, and Dropbox as the companies have created an environment where IT school administrators will offer Creative Cloud, Autodesk, and Dropbox services under their student email.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are familiar with the American education system, you know that this is an absurdly slow dinosaur when it comes to getting changes in motion. Technology, as a result, has to execute in rather phenomenal way to even have a chance in the education space. This is why you'll see awfully accessible and robust technology exist in the space - Windows, Macs, Chromebooks, Khan Academy, Symbolab, Dropbox, Adobe, Autodesk, Oracle, Blackboard, Canvas, etc. They are convenient tools that pay a lot of attention to things like ADA (disabilities) compliance and the like.\n\nThere is a revolution occurring in education in the form of disabilities pedagogy (the study of how to teach). Unlocking a lot of understanding in children with non-verbal autism, PTSD, and other serious learning challenges is an enormous frontier in teaching, learning, and understanding human development. \\*\\*These technologies do not get in the way and exist to assist.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # Dropbox as a Technical Product\n\nThe File &amp; Storage system in any given operating system will always be critically important to a user and the need will always be larger than you can anticipate. It extends from IT safety, banking, education, supercomputing, and so on. Can you evaluate the amount of storage and data needed after Machine Learning tools have grown for 10 years? It can not be determined, but it can be anticipated. Organizations that have built their own distributed infrastructure are advantaged. One can reasonably assume that these companies will distribute the building blocks to their products. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xu67kf179qe51.png?width=2953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16a1ce179420a08750c5df246064f6eebdad30cc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note: the CEO is currently in the Board of Directors of Facebook - who is also looking into workspace applications \\*\\*SPECIFICALLY TO SOLVE LONG TERM WORK-FROM-HOME COMMUNICATIONS\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Workplace @ Facebook](https://preview.redd.it/vpcnvvru4qe51.png?width=3382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46b3f6da6502c53102a73047c4b13977f3d498b1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Workspace @ Dropbox](https://preview.redd.it/rr462ns25qe51.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb2ba0e8e4fcc2bc24e82129bd0e209bee2d55d8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is an enormous list of high-quality features that Dropbox offer due to its integration and infrastructure approach across multiple platforms:\n\n* \\- File security\n\n[banned by xi](https://preview.redd.it/mtg94ntd8qe51.png?width=1411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e62965952b2e9b876860beede13c106b59115f6)\n\n* \\- Signatures\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ewaxdbdl8qe51.png?width=2791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce09ff54bad22b1920a33326478f69e11171a81d\n\n* \\- Computer vision document scanning\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[OCR](https://preview.redd.it/0551mtwz8qe51.png?width=2413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22ec6a63fe1fe5935dea0d7c743ea4a202f7a393)\n\n* \\- Workspace expectations (file syncing, large file transfers, organization,IT controls)\n* \\- Link generators to leak those sweet unreleased albums through zoom [https://www.dropbox.com/s/36pz554f6ds5eyu/Uzi%20Wheezy%20Zoom.wav.m4a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/36pz554f6ds5eyu/Uzi%20Wheezy%20Zoom.wav.m4a?dl=0)\n* \\- File embedding \n* \\- Self-built storage infrastructure\n* \\- Deep industry wide integrations ranging from Zoom to Adobe\n* \\- Deep relationships in the education sector\n* \\- An unholy amount of other file solutions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hicx44ptdqe51.png?width=2547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc087db00260d31a49e3c33a32020848f9d91e05\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Compliance Advantage\n\nCloud computing is no longer a mystery, nor is it an open secret. It's a necessary supply chain tool, demanded, and growing faster than imaginations can keep up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work in the fintech industry. Let me tell you, compliance is everything. There is no Square, Paypal, Dropbox, Cloudflare, or any of your favorite important apps without various degrees of compliance. It would be much more helpful to view Square as an organization that distributes compliance to it's small businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \\- For Banking it's the Bank Secrecy Act and PATRIOT Act\n* \\- For Education it's FERPA\n* \\- For Healthcare it's HIPAA\n* \\- The list goes on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean? It's means that mature cloud companies like Cloudflare, Dropbox, and the like are in an excellent positions to \\*\\*satisfy the legal means to continue to grow at scale\\*\\*. This is an extremely important factor to consider in the next 5 years. **Dropbox is not something people \"get\" -  it's something that they're \"given\".** For example, when I signed my name to accept my first career job - I was given Dropbox's HelloSign to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cloud Computing Hierarchy of needs](https://preview.redd.it/s3hfokxg5qe51.png?width=2981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ff1c87c8db5802df55d7f4156ee9b9f2e4f23c4)\n\n[Compliance advantage in education](https://preview.redd.it/s1qhcdxj5qe51.png?width=3821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34678980f20b163d47ec041add6defae67720038)\n\n[Another example of compliance-focused approaches](https://preview.redd.it/6nhym58n5qe51.png?width=3821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bc8101854eaa2a29f643f630024be629b23b9de)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Monopoly Problem &amp; Integrations Competitors\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1d1vs3oy5qe51.png?width=1835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81db898c8bd65364d7b2162ede4daecd5455547e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverybody knows it. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple is a monopoly cluster on data. Breaking them up is not a complex equation. Much like the death of a drug or religious cartel; there are many other viable candidates eager to steer the wheel in another direction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is possible to compete against them, as evidence by organizations like Dropbox, Cloudflare, TikTok, Zoom, and the like. These smaller companies combining is what I consider the Unicorn Operating System. There opportunity is by distributing infrastructure to overwhelm larger companies that depend on acquisitions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is already happening. Zoom &amp; Dropbox distribute infrastructure.\n\n[Cloud Infrastructure is critical.](https://preview.redd.it/2entdn446qe51.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f486402438fd28382c109b7e3cc6c62483f99a1a)\n\n[Dropbox executing like a pioneer, similar to Paypal](https://preview.redd.it/wfli2evh6qe51.png?width=1834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7e0ac53777e81ff94736208493a873475eed8ef)\n\n# # Dropbox Financially\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7s08qzcdqe51.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9ad76618cd785e924f3e2203480903a9e681e0d\n\nThis part easy. They are not built on empty promises. They want to grow at a steady rate and any increased used is always welcome. Gained users has a profound affect on their financial outcomes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7h5ce7teqe51.png?width=926&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6404a7ca65a1e5e61559c023951199cf5221c31d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/89148257-237eea80-d50e-11ea-8d26-501b49ca28cc.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/89148257-237eea80-d50e-11ea-8d26-501b49ca28cc.png))\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/89148125-c7b46180-d50d-11ea-9f31-707baeeb282b.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/89148125-c7b46180-d50d-11ea-9f31-707baeeb282b.png))\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/89148177-ef0b2e80-d50d-11ea-9e97-5d24393efeaa.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/89148177-ef0b2e80-d50d-11ea-9e97-5d24393efeaa.png))\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/89148202-02b69500-d50e-11ea-8d67-f61702bb99b4.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/89148202-02b69500-d50e-11ea-8d67-f61702bb99b4.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/89129403-1502e580-d4b2-11ea-86c8-4a20d4e56fe8.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/89129403-1502e580-d4b2-11ea-86c8-4a20d4e56fe8.png))",
