        "selftext": "I hold 200 shares of BB, first bought in ~$8.50 and another at ~$9.50. I tend to feel that whenever it dips below $10 it starts looking very attractive. \n\nI have mixed feelings on the stock since the company has struggled to actually make money and cement a solid business direction for profitable growth. I was also a little out off by the meme status and wild, seemingly random price spikes. But now I feel like the meme effect has cooled down and it continues to trade fairly consistently in the mid $9-$10 range. From the patent sales and continued partnerships I feel the company is moving in a good direction and while still risky at this points presents some pretty attractive prospects for future growth. I just saw the news about the Google and Qcom partnership and once again thought that the future seems somewhat promising and the prices fairly attractive currently \n\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-google-and-qualcomm-join-forces-to-drive-advancements-in-next-generation-automotive-cockpits-301398715.html",

        "selftext": "As you know, BB moved up 5% (50 cents) today on news that they have partnered with Google and Qualcomm. You're probably surprised it went up because it always goes down on news.\n\nThis news is different. This news is huge.\n\nEveryone was quick to jump to the conclusion that Ford had dropped BB entirely from their cars in favour of Google: [https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google](https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google)\n\nWell, the Google and Qualcomm news pretty much puts that assumption to bed. Not only will BB still be in Ford cars, any car that is built using Android's infotainment and Qualcomm's chips, will require BB tech.\n\nWe have Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Baidu, etc. etc. on our side. We have a patent sale that could be worth 1 billion+ coming no longer than 2 months from now. And we have Blackberry IVY slated to release this month.\n\nPlease stop throwing current revenue numbers at me when this thing is going to pump revenue out like crazy in the future. Stop focusing so much on their past. Stop focusing on how paperhands rule this stock. I don't see a company out there that has this many positive things going for it with a 5 billion dollar market cap.\n\nIf the stock market is forward thinking, why not BB? \n\nPosition: 16k+ shares, $10-12 avg.",

So if you're favored stock isn't listed, don't get angry, post it in the comments below. And if you feel I missed a sector, please let me know. \n\n.\n\n**1)** **Inelastic &amp; Fairly inelastic Industries:** (*Meaning people usually pay for the good or service no matter what the price \"insensitive to changes in price or income\"*) \n\n* Pharmaceuticals (With highly used patented meds for diseases &amp; illnesses)\n* Oil/Gas/Natural Gas (No matter how scarce it gets, people will buy it)\n* Energy (Be careful, many producers of electricity are heavily regulated)\n\n**2) Agriculture/Farm Equipment/Fertilizers/Farm Chemicals:** People got to eat ... and have you seen the price of softs futures? This will incentivize farmers to produce more which in turn will require more farm equipment, farm construction, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, seeds, chemicals etc. It does not help that food is rotting on the docks right now &amp; people are panic buying.\n\n* **Examples:** YTEN, TITN, NTR, SANW, DE, DOLE, ANDE, CLXT, ADM, CLXT, AGRO, AGCO, ADM, LMNR, TWI, ADM, BG, CALM, GRWG, HYFM, FMC, MEOH, \n\n**3) Semiconductors, Passive Semiconductors, &amp; Electronic Components:** Semiconductors are suffering due to worker shortages &amp; supply chain issues.

        "selftext": "### The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week \u2013** **SPY** was higher by about 1.6% (or $7.40) last week, more than the 1% move options were pricing.\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are again pricing about a 1% move (or just less than $5 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY just under **$460** that corresponds to just above **$464** on the upside and around **$455** on the downside.\n\n**Implied Volatility** \u2013 The VIX ended Friday around 16.20, up slightly from the week before. The VIX remains below its historical average entering this week.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\nOptions are pricing similar market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs:\n\n* SPY **1%**\n* QQQ **1.5%**\n* IWM **1.7%**\n* DIA **1.1%**\n\nAs an example of how the 1% expected move translates into strike selections, here\u2019s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $455 and $464 to see Max Gain:\n\n## In the News\n\nThe FDA gave to go-ahead for a lower dose Covid vaccine from Pfizer (PFE) for ages 5-12. Moderna (MRNA) announced that the FDA needed more time to review its vaccine for the same age group. Both companies report earnings this week. Options are pricing about a 7% move this week and roughly a 13% move for the next month in Moderna.\n\n### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings\n\nThe *expected moves* below are for this Friday and link to the Options AI Calendar which is free to use. *Recent moves* on prior earnings start with the most recent quarter. The expected move is extremely useful for strike selection on debit and credit spreads and a gut check on existing positions. Stocks tend to stay at or within their expected move around 70% of the time and implied vol goes lower following earnings, in most cases. Therefore the expected move gives a general sense of what options are pricing for moves needed for debit options and what a stock needs to stay within for credit options trades. In other words, if the stock moves less than the EM, options were overpriced, and if more, options were underpriced.\n\nTuesday\n\n**AMC** AMC / [Expected Move: **10.2%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/AMC) / Recent moves: -6%, +6%, +4%\n\n**Zillow** Z / [Expected Move: **8.5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/Z) / Recent moves: -8%, -6%, +18%\n\n**Activision Blizzard** ATVI / [Expected Move: **4.8%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ATVI) / Recent moves: +2%, +2%, +10%\n\nWednesday\n\n**Roku** ROKU / [Expected Move: **7.7%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ROKU) / Recent moves: -4%, +12%, +3%\n\n**Qualcomm** QCOM / [Expected Move: **4.5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/QCOM) / Recent moves: +6%, +5%, -9%\n\n**Fastly** FSLY / [Expected Move: **11.7%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/FSLY) / Recent moves: -10%, -27%, -15%\n\n**Etsy** ETSY / [Expected Move: **8.5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ETSY) / Recent moves: -10%, -15%, +12%\n\nThursday\n\n**Moderna**\u00a0MRNA / [Expected Move: **6.7%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/MRNA) / Recent moves: -1%, -1%, +2%\n\n**Square** SQ / [Expected Move: **4.5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/SQ) / Recent moves: -2%, +4%, -8%\n\n**Pinterest** PINS / [Expected Move: **9.1%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/PINS) / Recent moves: -18%, -15%, +5%\n\n**Uber**\u00a0UBER / [Expected Move: **7%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/UBER) / Recent moves: +3%, -9%, -4%\n\n**AirBNB** ABNB / [Expected Move: **6.2%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ABNB) / Recent moves: +1%, +4%, +13%\n\n**Peloton**\u00a0PTON / [Expected Move: **8.2%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/PTON) / Recent moves: -9%, 0%, -6%\n\n**Cloudfare** NET / [Expected Move: **9.8%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/NET) / Recent moves: -2%, +4%, -6%\n\nFriday\n\n**DraftKings** DKNG / [Expected Move: **6.4%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/DKNG) / Recent moves: +6%, +4%",

This data was all collected from their earning conference call transcripts located [here](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/investors). so far total they have 249 companies signed up to use Blackberry QNX IoT software. This is INSANE!! This ranges from connected cars to drones to medical devices to robots to assembly lines to DoD drones to planes!!!

This means the chip will have QNX embedded capability that will allow Android to run on top of it for infotainment. This is bigger than sliced bread!!

        "selftext": "A lot of naysayes in here with Appl. Their phones are becoming commodities with negligible upgrades, the prices are comming down, their eco system is under threat with a recent court ruling regarding monopolistic pricing with apps on their closed eco system. Their long awaited ventue into into cars is too late to the party and still to far away, if they even get it off the ground.\n\nThe Pipes vs. the Hardware. By pipes, I mean verizon, at&amp;t, and t-mobile.  They spend billions at auction to buy spectrum from the federal gov to send gsm, Lte, and cdma signals to your phone and now moving into the 5th generation. Appl provides the hardware, the carriers provide the pipes that bring it to the hardware.\n\nThe pipe carriers pay full price for Appl phones. Again, the carrier pays full price to appl for the phone.  Those prices you pay are subsidized by the carriers in the form of your 2yr contract. The carrier makes its money off the contract minus the amount it subsidizes to you the buyer. Thats why you get the subsidized price on your phone every 2ys on your contract with trade in. This is very lucrative  to both the carrier and to appl. A revolving 2yr annuity for the carrier, and short new purchase cycle for appl.\n\nWhat if I told you appl is working on bypassing the carriers. Well, they are. They have already embedded in the 13 a qcom gx chip in addition to the development of the m1 that uses mvno tech to use multiple carriers at the same time. Goggle is already using this with google-fi in their own eco system.  Appl is already beta testing it's own version with the 13 in europe. This is just the first step. Appl is investing heavly in new satellite technologies to beam directly to your appl phone. There are those who say the speed is too slow and this can only be used in rual area's and in emergencies with no coverage.Tell that to Musk and his new venture into satellites.This technology is comming sooner than you think.I believe this is comming. The money that verizon, att, and t-mobile make, prints into the 100's of billions. Imagine if appl takes even a quarter of this away from each of them. Will appl control it's own pipe, and be it's own carrier. I think it will or a least on a quasi level 8n the not too distant future,  and it's printing gobs of money now while I wait. That's why I'm long. Thanks for reading. Good luck with your trades and investments.",

        "selftext": "**TL/DR**\n\n* AST SpaceMobile is first mover on direct to cellular phone Low Earth Orbit constellations. It is a very profitable enterprise when they succeed. But first they need regulatory clearance / permission, in the form of licenses. These are important hurdles, and as such will act as major catalysts once cleared. Looking into the state of these applications we find that there will be multiple such catalysts in the next months. You might want to skip to the very last section: Catalyst timeframes. This is a deSPAC.\n\n**DISCLAIMER**\n\n* This is not financial advice. This is regulatory analysis.\n* The company covered in this writeup is a first mover in uncharted territory. They aim to do what no one has done before. They are pre-revenue. This is a risky business/investment. The writeup covers only one single aspect in depth. You should gain a broader understanding of the funding, technical concept of a business model etc before investing and not do it from reading of a single aspect.\n* *Comprehensive*, as in you will comprehend things and I should also say *exhaustive*, as in you will be exhausted from reading this long writeup. The subject is complex, and as such I might not have understood all things correctly. What is said below is to the best of my knowledge. I added pictures to make the reading less tedious.\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\n* In a previous wallstreetbets writeup I outline the company and what makes it unique. This post is recommended background reading if you are not familiar with the company. [AST SpaceMobile. The Black Swan of Low Earth Orbit satellite communication constellations. \ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2 \ud83e\udd85 Why is it so different?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pvciwf/ast_spacemobile_the_black_swan_of_low_earth_orbit/)\n\n**SATELLITE COMMUNICATION COMPANIES, THE MAIN RISKS.**\n\n[The main risks to satellite services is not technology, it is regulations.](https://preview.redd.it/fbmcutc40du71.png?width=2688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc637f246bc1d707791b618d195dd7fe552e9a2f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The above chart outlines the main risks that satellite services companies face. As can be seen **regulatory risks are the main risks.** As such overcoming these hurdles and getting the needed permits and licenses will act as major catalysts.\n\n[Screenshot from the US market access application showing network architecture.](https://preview.redd.it/ysr4xgw70du71.png?width=1119&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cf4b45ef23e82ed0ae29c4cf68c539cc857a490)\n\n* Analyzing the applications in question, which are two the Bluewalker 3 single experimental satellite application and the application for US market access of the SpaceMobile constellation we find three major parts/ hurdles that are subject to the regulators approval. These three main regulatory risks are: **Fronthaul** (satellite to cellular phone spectrum), **Backhaul** (satellite to gateway spectrum) and **Orbital debris.** We shall look into them all below.\n\n**FRONTHAUL CELLULAR SPECTRUM - USA**\n\n* For SpaceMobile constellation US market access application AST legal/regulatory division has been very bright and exploited a regulation that opens up their use of partner cellular spectrum wherever that is not used terrestrially by a very simple and straightforward method, requiring no application nor permission of authorities, just notification.\n* The initial application for SpaceMobile constellation contained fronthaul (cellular, satellite to phone) control and backhaul (satellite to groundstation) bands. This has since been amended (see below). And the application now contains just backhaul and satellite control bands. Whereas the applications for the cellular fronthaul bands will see a different regulatory very streamlined and simple process.\n\n[Screenshot of the public notice when AST SpaceMobile amended its application. https:\\/\\/docs.fcc.gov\\/public\\/attachments\\/DOC-368002A1.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/vnab1edb0du71.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f995037d7dd0289215a87028429c7fb8e4dc3bd)\n\n* This other process is available since in September 2004 when the FCC ventured into taking:\n\n&gt;\u201dadditional steps to facilitate the development of secondary markets expand upon and complement several of the Commission\u2019s major policy initiatives and public interest objectives. These include our efforts to encourage the development of broadband services for all Americans, promote increased facilities-based competition among service providers, enhance economic opportunities and access for the provision of communications services, and enable development of additional and innovative services in rural areas\u201d\n\n* Quote above is from FCC 04-167 Its a bit of a complex read, p27 is the key paragraph:\n\n&gt;27. Thus, if the spectrum leasing transaction does not involve a geographic overlap with spectrum held by the spectrum lessee in any of the particular services listed, as described above, we will permit the leasing arrangement to proceed without prior public notice or case-by-case review.\u201d\\*\n\n* Reading a note to the AST amendment of the SpaceMobile application it becomes clear this is indeed the backdoor / approach AST intends to use to gain US market access to use the cellular fronthaul frequencies. It is thereby no longer an intricate application to the FCC, it has been reduced to a simple notification process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Screenshot of letter attached to amendment off the original SpaceMobile constellation application. Highlighted text shows the reasoning behind seeking the amendment. This and the regulations cited above suggests a notification is all it takes, not an application to use the leased terrestrial cellular spectrum for AST SpaceMobile Satellite constellation in the USA.A regulation put in place to maximize the use of spectrum in the USA, comes handy indeed. This regulation derisks the US market access application for SpaceMobile constellation, considerably. And as the US to large extent serves as regulatory benchmark for the developed world when it comes to space this will see effects in other markets.](https://preview.redd.it/6szcuyaf0du71.png?width=876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7393e888a3dfde3e44bb0d05baa68704bca75fda)\n\n**FRONTHAUL CELLULAR SPECTRUM - REST OF THE WORLD**\n\n* As described in a report that can be purchased from Quilty the access to use fronthaul spectrum is a process that is different in different countries. And in some countries this is subject to a unified license regime. On these markets gaining access to fronthaul will be just as straight forward / streamlined as in the USA. Partner Mobile network operators are already allowed to use them from satellite. I have done extensive searches for partner companies that holds unified licenses.The countries I have found are Angola, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, India, HongKong and Rwanda. AST does not provide this list it is assembled from multiple sources by me.\n* Further investigations has led to a comprehensive list of the 20 terrestrial mobile network operators that are AST SpaceMobile partners. These collectively hold 1.5 Bn customers and the business model of AST SpaceMobile involves applying for permission / licenses where needed through these terrestrial partners. As Quilty describes it this process will be fast in some countries, and likely see regulators in other countries rush to cut the redtape when they the opportunity to close the digital divide by allowing the use. On some markets, however, such processes will likely stall or be glacial. The partners under MoU or agreements are: MTN, Vodafone, Telecom Argentina, Telstra, Liberty Latin America, Tigo (Millicom International), America Movil, Telefonica, Safaricom, Indosat, Vodacom, Smart, Uganda Telecom (UTL), AT&amp;T, Rakuten, American Towers, Africell, MUNI, LIBTELCO and perhaps still Bell Canada, but the latter is not confirmed. AST does not provide this complete list when asked it is assembled from multiple sources by me.\n* Just as the unified licenses are found in near equatorial countries, so is the partner coverage high near the equator. Companies like America Movil, AT&amp;T, Tigo, Telecom Argentina, Telefonica, LL America means 80%+ of customers in Latin America are covered. And in Africa MTN and vodafone group dominate. Smart and Indosat Ooredoo Hutchinson partnerships covers Philippines and Indonesia. This focus is explained by the fact that AST SpaceMobile will launch the equtorial constellation initially consisting of 18 satellites and 2 in orbit spares for a total of 20, starting launches in 2022. Connecting the unconnected is an AST objective there are lots of these potential customers near the equator. Starting the rollout where regulatory issues are most easily overcome and access most swiftly granted is most likely another AST objective, these objectives are both met near the equator.\n\n**ORBITAL DEBRIS RISKS - Bluewalker 3.**\n\n* A close foreseeable catalyst for AST SpaceMobile would be the Bluewalker 3 experimental satellite application grant, which by all measures progresses smoothly an answer to the last outstanding question from the FCC regarding orbital debris was answered nov 15, and the answer filed November 18 2021. The ball lies now with the FCC, and if there are no more questions to ask the next step will be to grant the application. I foresee no regulatory issues there. But in this phase permits/ lisences granted will still move share price.\n* As all questions so far has been answered, and FCC letters only contain single questions now, the AST Bluewalker 3 application is mature for approval any day. An imminent catalyst before end of year.\n\n[Orbital debris density varies with altitude, the lowest altitudes are kept clean by drag](https://preview.redd.it/g0qqmscj0du71.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb4f2dae07c0d48d6a6fe69f4a81f6c2df453690)\n\n**ORBITAL DEBRIS RISKS - SpaceMobile constellation US Market Access application.**\n\n* The individual requirement per satellite is to get below 1:10,000 risk. As the AST satellites fly edge on they present small area that debris might impact and the US market access application states 1:19,700. risk per satellite.\n\n[Screenshot from AST SpaceMobile constellation US Market Access application showing a 1:19,700 total risk calculated using standard NASA software.](https://preview.redd.it/dhbho9vm0du71.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3777f2c52c5f05549682a410614d63ee8c9b134c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 1/19,700= 0.00005076 that would be the individual large object impact risk probability. When the satellite is flying on the altitude of the application as calculated with branch std NASA software. If they are duds.\n* Then the regulations say to consider maneuver able sats 0 risk (as space is monitored and they can maneuver away) and they say to use a 10% failure rate. And get below 0.001 total constellation impact risk. That is below .1% one in a thousand times that some satellite would have an object impact.\n* So for a 243 sat constellation we have 24.3 theoretical dead in the sky sats we need to calculate the aggregated large object orbital debris risk for.\n* The way to do that is to first calculate the chance of a single sat not colliding. That is: 1-0.000005076=0.99994924 Then we calculate the chance of no one out of 24.3 sats collide: 0.99994924\\^ 24.3 That is a chance of 0.99881289 that all duds make it. The complimentary event being 0.00119 That is pretty close to the limit of 0.001 total risk.\n* Now regulations are clear on the fact 0.001 is not a rule, it is a benchmark that the FCC may choose to do exemptions from. Meaning they can allow a risk larger than 0.001. So there are a number of tweaks to this.\n* One would be to amend application to 198 satellites whereby the limit is just met. 198 is more than needed for full global MIMO, then play the starlink trick once global MIMO is achieved and lower altitude.\n* A second way is to ask FCC to make an exemption of the 0.001 total debris impact risk limit.\n* A third way is to claim that the spacecrafts having multiple magnetorquers (10x redundancy) throughout the array as well as also having Orbion Hall effect thrusters is less likely to fail orbital avoidance having dual redundant maneuverability. And ask exemption from 10% failure rate.\n\n[Orbion Hall Effect \\(Ion\\) thrusters](https://preview.redd.it/1nufotbq0du71.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72d3a67a99acff8ff65cac5505b86c14e50050de)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A magnetorquer \\(this one made by AST subsidiary NanoAvionics. Multiple Magentorquers are distributed throughout the Bluebird satellite arrays for redundancy. They change pitch, yaw and roll of LEO spacecraft with help of the earth magnetic field and require no propellant.](https://preview.redd.it/veycuw7t0du71.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb1edabeee7599824b3dc101e13ce04ce05a2968)\n\n* A fourth is to lower altitude of constellation from start.\n* A fifth way is to launch a separate constellation to cover USA using other orbital planes. (This would be unlikely).\n* A sixth way is a slight reduction of size. We have seen this played out already, presumably as R and D has developed more efficient microns (it is the name of the antenna array elements), and studies likely narrowed down the number of beams actually needed per sat. Array has shrunk from 30x30 a year ago, to 24x24 (Deutsche Bank coverage) to 20x20 (Barclays coverage report, company statements) and 20x17.8 (measured by me from recent company renderings). If this ongoing reduction leads to amendment of orbital debris impact risk later on remains to see. They might have shrunk a bit since application was filed.\n\n[Size and proportion of AST Bluebird satellites. These have a new form factor for satellites, travel to space packed as cubes and unfolds using mechanically stored energy \\(spring loaded\\) dampening hinges to form a flat array that flies in low drag configuration edge first. It measures 20 x 17.8 meters and features 330 square meters of phased array each, compared to less than 2 square meters on a Starlink satellite. This huge antenna is key to connect directly to cellular phones. Flying edge first is also a design feature that allows a lot more antenna real estate without violating orbital debris regulations.](https://preview.redd.it/9ksicjly0du71.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4448bb8f742547e721a474dabf4808a216b158ee)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* It is an AST objective to have 336 sats up by 2027 according to AST investor presentation. This is the equivalent of 2 x 168 satellite constellations. Mirroring the Starlink double constellation concept. Two such constellations would use two different aggregated orbital debris collision risk calculations. If you add a 30% margin on 168 you end up with 243 satellites. The AST SpaceMobile US market access application is for 243 satellites, whereas just 168 are actually needed for the first MIMO global constellation. It stands to reason there might be a 30% margin to the application that is mostly a negotiation tactic. And if so the 168 needed satellites for global MIMO have an aggregated risk well below the regulatory requirement. If we consider this 2 x 168 satellites the real objective of AST, then orbital debris will not be an issue for the initial 168 US market access application.\n\n**BACKHAUL CELLULAR SPECTRUM Q and V bands.**\n\n* AST SpaceMobile use extremely high throughput Q and V bands for satellite backhaul.\n* The access to these bands are achieved on two parallel routes, one is application to ITU, this has been done through NICTA, a regulatory body of Papua New Guinea who has approved the AST SpaceMobile application to launch. AST attests to this fact in correspondence with the FCC.\n* The second route is by application to each respective country where AST, or its partners Vodafone and American Towers operates a terrestrial Space station / gateway. For most parts this will be American Towers and AST will lease the terrestrial Space Stations to avoid Capital Expenditures, CapEx. Now The Architecture is NewRadio some next level technology that uses leaders at virtualisation Altiostar and Rakuten software to virtualize the entire network and have AI slice it for optimum performance on throughput and latency and distribute the traffic on legacy cellular networks and the internet as appropriate. Using the internet for this is one factor that means AST will not need a terrestrial ground station, nor such permits for backhaul, in each and every country where they operate. just in some.\n* In the US [an extra licensing round](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-21-941A1.docx) has been initiated by the FCC to supply AST SpaceMobile with backhaul cellular spectrum. Applications to take part in this round ends on Nov 4 2021. After this date judging by the OneWeb 92 days after deadline and Kuiper 65 days offsets from last round. AST SpaceMobile will receive their Backhaul spectrum grant somewhere between Jan 8 2022 to Feb 4 2022. Found this link last Friday, also says the commentary period is over for SpaceMobile. The existence of this licensing round is a little known fact.\n* Importantly the Kuiper application in the prior round had\u00a0 \\_not\\_ yet resolved their orbital debris issues but were still granted v-band rights conditional of later fixing their orbital debris analysis. This means these processes are parallell and will be resolved seperately not delaying the frequenzy grant. They might serve as two seperate catalysts. The orbital debris issue might take another month or two of correspondence to resolve, we see this from the BW3 correspondence. Putting the complete AST US Market access grant, including orbital debris, somewhere in the same timeframe as BW3 launch window March-April 2022 or some month later: June 2022.\n\n**OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS, THE 3GPP 5g standard.**\n\n* Many constellations try to do satellite communications and they compensate for small phased arrays in space and to wide beams by using proprietary user equipment and proprietary communication standards. AST does not use proprietary standards nor proprietary phones. They are adpating to the existing standard. And the existing standard is adapting to AST SpaceMobile.\n* 3GPP 5g standard release 16, and later release 17, contain many techniques that are suited for connection to satellite, including better adopted to doppler and latency of LEO satellites, 4x4 beamhandling MIMO, carrier aggregation, improved power management, and positioning. This mutualistic / synergistic relationship between the terrestrial end user equipment and the space based satellites will continue to improve once they connect. The chip Qualcomm x65 which has been with OEM manufacturers in 2021 and will be in phones from 2022 already incorporates release 16. This chip is manufactured by AST partner Samsung.\n* AST will connect to legacy cellphones, including smartphones. But as new phones are launched they will keep getting better at it, and add functionality such as very accurate assured 5g positioning. More reliable than GPS, less prone to interference, jamming and spoofing. Good for drones, which by the way also AST latency is, sub 30 ms. Iridium latency in comparison is terrible: above 300 ms. 5g through AST SpaceMobile thereby likely to get regulatory approval to pilot drones and vehicles remotely by low latency sensor feed and assured positioning / fused LEO GNSS.\n\n[Fused LEO GNSS. GPS type positioning from LEO satellites \\/ assured PNT. Right column. Note the Precision and anti jam anti spoof advantage. +56 dB is 40,000 x stronger signal than GPS. 5g standard release 16 and beyond will include positioning using multiple uplink, downlink and roundtrip multialteration signals as well as angle of arrival\\/ angle of departure multiangulation. These abilities has civilian and military use cases.](https://preview.redd.it/ixwajudb1du71.png?width=352&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd58398daced97a0c8f2ac5a9cfed2140732fc09)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CATALYST TIMEFRAMES, Summary of the above.**   \n**R O U G H   E S T I M A T E S**\n\n* Bluewalker 3 experimental satellite license grant.

How the price will move and a model for that trajectory is in another [writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pvuls1/model_for_share_price_in_pre_revenue_growth_stock/) here on WSB comparing it to another stock. That other stock, Lithium Americas, has tracked the model well running +22% in as many days since that post on a run up to an expected regulatory approval. AST SpaceMobile has yet to start run up and regulatory catalyst spikes but studying the price movement on Lithium Americas on these regulatory milestones should give the investor an idea about the magnitude of regulatory approvals for junior explorers. Be that mining lithium in Nevada or mining connectivity in Space. You still need that permit to start a hugely profitable operation.\n\n**QUESTIONS?**\n\n* Feel free to ask for references of what is said above.

For the week, the S&amp;P 500 added back 0.8% and sits just 3.4% away from its record.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs stuck by its bullish year-end forecast earlier this week, predicting stocks would start to climb the wall of worries. And they did.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said in a note to clients that his year-end S&amp;P 500 price target for 2021 is still 4,700, which is nearly 7% above its current level.\n*****\n&gt; The firm said earnings growth, not valuation expansion, was the primary driver of the S&amp;P 500\u2032s 17% return year to date, adding that should still be the case.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings season begins\n&gt; The third-quarter earnings season \u2014 which kicks off next week with big bank earnings \u2014 is expected to be another strong series of reports, despite some worries about supply chain issues and higher costs. Third-quarter earnings are expected to have risen 27.6% year over year, according to FactSet. That would be the third-highest growth rate since 2010.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some record earnings seasons the past few quarters, so all eyes will be on if earnings can help justify stocks near all-time high levels,\u201d Detrick said. \u201cWe do expect another solid earnings season, but we\u2019ve seen some high profile warnings already, so corporate America could have a rather high bar to clear this quarter. Buckle up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bank earnings are the main focus next week with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs set to report.\n*****\n&gt; After a range-bound few months for bank stocks, analysts are looking ahead to catalysts that could fuel the next phase in their recovery. Wall Street expects loan growth, interest rates and reserve releases to play into the major banks\u2019 reports.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings for the third quarter quarter should again be strong and mostly outpace expectations,\u201d Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen said. \u201cHours worked in the third quarter rose by about 5% suggesting real GDP for the quarter may be close to 7%. With most companies reporting strong pricing power, solid real GDP growth should result in another surprisingly strong corporate earnings season.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen sees earnings season rewarding cyclicals, like banks, and small caps more than technology stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the stock market is already showing signs of a leadership shift away from slow economic growth favorites including growth, tech, and defensive toward more the economically sensitive areas of small caps and cyclical sectors,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; # Supply chain, higher cost warnings?\nWhile the earnings season should be strong, there are likely to be some warning signs about inflation and supply constraints that could scare the market about the year-end set-up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe risks of higher inflation, Fed tapering and what will likely be a choppy earnings season are still with us,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; There was some foreshadowing of this last week, when Bed Bath and Beyond shares cratered 25% after the company said it saw a steep drop-off in traffic in August. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond saw inflation costs escalating over the summer months, especially toward the end of its second quarter in August, which corroded profits.\n*****\n&gt; What investors know going into the third quarter \u2014 from company guidance \u2014 is that there could be haves and have nots this earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; FactSet data shows that 47 S&amp;P 500 companies have issued negative earnings guidance for the third quarter, and 56 companies have issued positive outlooks.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed headwind ahead?\n&gt; The headline jobs number Friday was a major disappointment, as the economy added just 194,000 jobs in September, well below the the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000. On the positive side, the unemployment rate fell to a much lower point than economists forecast. At 4.8%, that\u2019s the same level seen in late 2016.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s unclear if the number changes the calculus for when and how fast the Federal Reserve will slow its $120 billion-per-month bond-buying program.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view these figures are good enough, and when combined with the debt-ceiling can being kicked down the road, likely solidifies November as \u2018go time\u2019 for tapering,\u201d Wells Fargo Securities senior equity analyst Christopher Harvey said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe continue to expect a choppy equity market rally and a two-to-four-week tech bounce, but the bounce probably peters out next month when the Fed says those magical words: We will begin to taper,\u201d he added.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WuOc7cb.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnJ6ZF2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CojntqX.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mxZnyBJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eZbwxOb.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JPCsx2m.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kyfY7Xn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zEMv32q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uaj9G7t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VAaeJ4E.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fgsZNEH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/W5HmLSK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/DDVPGco.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2021\n\n&gt; The fourth quarter is now off to the races and we thought it worthwhile to check in on the best and worst-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks on a year-to-date basis. As shown below, there are currently six members of the index that have rallied over 100% this year. Apt for the year that its vaccine has rolled out, the biggest gainer of these has been Moderna (MRNA) with a 196.12% rally. It now has a market cap of $124.87 billion versus a market cap of only $41 billion at the start of the year. Of the 20 best performers, MRNA is also the only one with a market cap above $100 billion. The next largest is ConocoPhillips (COP) with a $95.76 billion market cap. COP is one of multiple Energy stocks on this list as well. Of the top 20 performers, Energy sector names dominate the list with 8 members.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Pivoting to the other end of the spectrum, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is down the most this year having been cut by 36.18%. IPG Photonics (IPGP), Lamb Weston Holdings (LW), Viatris (VTRS), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Global Payments (GPN) also have fallen by at least 25%. Once again, there is only one member of this list with a market cap above $100 billion: Qualcomm (QCOM). One other interesting factor to note of the worst performers is there are several stocks that were at some point plays on pandemic trends, whether those be reopening or stay at home. For example, in addition to LVS, another gaming/reopening name, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), ranks as the eighth-worst performer YTD. Additionally, strong performers during the onset of the pandemic like Clorox (CLX), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) are all down double digits this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Intraday Commodity Spikes\n\n&gt; Since the late spring, both silver and gold have been in steady downtrends spending much of that time below their 50-DMAs. Those downtrends remain in place, but both metals did find a short-term bottom on September 29th. While they have been rallying in the past week and a half, today each one has stalled out. From the early morning leading up to the Nonfarm Payrolls report, precious metals ramped higher with a surge immediately following the weaker than expected report. Only a couple hours after the release, gold and silver had erased a large portion of their earlier gains. In fact, silver is now 2.15% below its intraday high and gold is 1.36% below its high. For gold, in particular, that intraday reversal also marked a rejection of its 50-DMA which it\u2014as well as silver\u2014has struggled to stay above for most of the past several months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-GC-SI.png))**\n\n&gt; Crude oil is yet another commodity that is currently down off of its intraday highs, and like gold, the reversal came at a pretty interesting level. At its high Friday morning, front-month WTI futures rose above $80 for the first time since November 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL.png))**\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Job Market Continues To Frustrate In September\n\n&gt; The September payroll report likely created more questions than it answered.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its September employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added a disappointing 194,000 jobs during the month, falling well short of Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 median forecast for a gain of 500,000. This comes on the heels of a lukewarm August report, which did receive an upward revision of 131,000. Somewhat contradictory, the unemployment rate fell more than forecast to 4.8% in September, beating expectations, though that was paired with a reduced labor force participation rate of 61.6% when expectations called for an increase.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe observation window for this report likely came too soon for positive catalysts to really gain traction,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLeisure and hospitality jobs, a proxy for economic reopening, were only marginally higher. We take this to mean Delta\u2019s waning impact will likely be more evident in October\u2019s report where we expect to see reopening momentum reassert itself.\u201d\n\n&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, in-person segments of the labor market such as leisure and hospitality jobs grew steadily during the first half of the year when COVID-19 remained under relative control. However, the latest flare-up has dampened that trend. We expect to see renewed growth in this sector as the delta variant continues to abate.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.8.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As mentioned, definitive takeaways from this report are difficult to come by due to the offsetting nature of the report. On the one hand, headline numbers came in very weak, but private payrolls, as well as manufacturing payrolls, fared better. The unemployment rate experienced a significant drop, but interpreting that number becomes muddied when considering the fact that we are already experiencing a significant worker shortage and the participation rate is declining, not increasing, as we would hope to see in a true recovery.\n\n&gt; What is more, because the observation window for the report cuts off mid-month, we cannot yet draw conclusions about the impact of school reopening and the lapsing of enhanced unemployment benefits\u2014hotly debated crosscurrents\u2014plus the aforementioned waning delta impact. Regarding the inflation debate\u2014average hourly earnings rose 0.6% month over month and 4.6% year over year. And while wages are undeniably growing and helping to fuel inflation, the data are not mix-adjusted and therefore are inflated due to the suppressed growth in the in-person, lower-wage segment of the labor market.\n\n&gt; The biggest question, though, is what this means for the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) asset tapering plans. The market had all but expected the Fed to announce a tapering timeline at its next meeting coming into this report, with the caveat that Fed Chair Jerome Powell needed only to see a \u201creasonably good\u201d job report first. Whether September\u2019s surprise report has cleared that low bar or not now becomes an open question, one which the market had all but dismissed as a formality previously.\n\n&gt; Indeed, in the aftermath of the report\u2019s release Treasury markets immediately began pricing in a possible delay to any taper, and equity markets gyrated between positive and negative territory as they struggled to process whether bad news should actually be considered good news in this context. We will have to see in the coming weeks whether this report will be substantial enough to bring on the much-anticipated taper announcement, but one thing is for sure\u2014there are no gimmies in this labor market recovery.\n*****\n\n&gt; # Columbus Day Performance\n\n&gt; Columbus Day is an interesting trading day for financial markets as it is one of the few trading days of the year when the equity market is open, but the bond market is closed. This may lead investors to think that equity markets should perform positively, as investors do not have credit markets to allocate capital to on that specific day. However, looking at the S&amp;P 500's historical performance on Columbus Day over the last 25 years doesn't necessarily show a real positive bias. Columbus Day tends to act just like any other trading day. Over the last 25 years, median performance on Columbus Day has been a gain of 10 basis points (bps) with positive returns 55.6% of the time. While that's slightly higher than the median one-day gain of 7 bps for all trading days over the last 25 years, the difference isn't significant. That's not to say that Columbus Day hasn't seen some outliers, though. Who can forget in 2008, during the middle of the Financial Crisis, when the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 11% on Columbus Day!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Day-of.png))**\n\n&gt; For the week of Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500's median gain has been 0.31% with positive returns 63% of the time which also isn't extraordinary relative to average weekly returns for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years. The worst Columbus Day weeks were in 1999 (-6.63%) and 2018 (-4.10%) while the best were in 1998 (+7.32%), 2002 (5.87%), and 2011 (+5.98%). Interestingly enough, in 2008, even after rallying over 11% on Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500 finished the week up just 4.60% as it erased more than half of its gains from the holiday session.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Week-of.png))**\n\n&gt; The table below lists the S&amp;P 500's performance leading up to and after Columbus Day for each of the last 25 years. With a decline of over 2.5% since the start of September, this year ranks as the weakest performance for the equity market since 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Columbus-Day-Table-100821.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Most Important Chart In The World\n\n&gt; And just like that, the calendar turned to October and volatility picked up in a big way, with three consecutive 1% moves for the S&amp;P 500 Index to start the month. As we noted in our October preview, this month gets a bad rap for being a bearish month (it isn\u2019t), but it absolutely owns the title as the most volatile month.\n\n&gt; t took nearly a full year, but the S&amp;P 500 finally had its first 5% pullback of 2021, thus ending hopes of 2021 joining 1954, 1958, 1964, 1993, 1995, and 2017 as the only years to go a full calendar year without a 5% move lower.\n\n&gt; \u201cVolatility is the price of admission,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cSure, we\u2019d all prefer stocks go straight up forever, but that isn\u2019t reality. Investors must learn to embrace and accept the eventual scares and bouts of volatility that are common even in the strongest bull markets.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, stocks experience a 14.2% peak-to-trough pullback on average during the year, putting the recent 5% pullback in perspective. In fact, 21 out of the past 41 years saw at least a 10% correction. Incredibly, 12 of those years finished in the green and those 12 years gained an average of 17.0%. Who could forget last year\u2019s 34% bear market and move back to up 16% by the end of the year? In other words, big pullbacks can happen even in years that see outsized gains, which is why this chart is so important for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The last new all-time high for the S&amp;P 500 was on September 2, but as of the end of September there were still 54 new all-time highs in 2021, the second most ever with one quarter to go. The good news? Previous years that saw a lot new highs the first three quarters usually had strong performance the final quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking things a step further, this year the S&amp;P 500 produced one of its best ever year-to-date gains through September, up 14.7% with a quarter to go. It turns out that good starts to a year tend to resolve higher. In fact, 9 of the past 10 years the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 12.5% with a quarter to go there were further gains in the fourth quarter. As you can see below, the returns are greatly skewed due to 1987, but the median return in the final quarter of the year is an impressive 5.2% (versus the average fourth quarter return of 4.0%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Performance Through Q3 And its Impact on Q4 Performance\n\n&gt; Every year, the makeup and number of sectors that outperform the S&amp;P 500 changes. This year, four sectors (Energy, Financials, Real Estate, and Communication Services) outperformed the S&amp;P 500 through the end of Q3, while last year it was only three sectors that outperformed in the first three quarters of the year (Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services).\n\n&gt; As we all know, past performance does not indicate future performance, and in looking at sectors that have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of prior years compared to how they performed in Q4, the same holds true. The table below lists the number of sectors that outperformed and underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of each year since 2000 and then shows their median performance during Q4 of the same year. Looking at a summary of the annual results, it's almost a coinflip as to whether or not the leading sectors in the first three quarters of a given year will continue to outperform in Q4. On average, the sectors that outperform YTD through 9/30 have averaged a Q4 gain of 3.58% (median: +6.40%) with positive returns 76% of the time. Sectors that lag the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of the year average a rest of year gain of 3.67% (median: 5.95%) with gains 71% of the time. While the term 'strength begets strength' has historically been applicable to the broader market, at the sector level, buying the YTD winners (or losers) ahead of Q4 in expectation of continued momentum to close out the year (or a mean reversion bounce) hasn't offered any material outperformance.\n\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Snap227.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical October Trading: Volatile Start Sets Up Rally through Month\u2019s End\n\n&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the full month of October has been a solid month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all recorded gains ranging from 0.6% by Russell 2000 to 1.9% by NASDAQ. But these gains have come with volatile trading, most notably during the early days of the month. October has opened softly with mild gains on its first trading day by DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000. On the second day, all five indexes have been weak followed by a rebound on the third trading day before additional weakness pulls the market lower through the seventh trading day. At which point, the market has historically found support and began to rally through mid-month and beyond.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/070f50fc0225a24692163a37694f0425/da1ccfd284e5df51-2c/s500x750/009fdcd32ca89da61f3a47401e5e5eaf71f34f50.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 2021!](https://i.imgur.com/xrMCop9.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.11.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.11.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cF0CbQE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.12.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D4dB9sd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.12.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jDBI2Dv.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.13.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qVRtzZv.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.13.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/V7gDj4f.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.14.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hZ42eSL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.14.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HNdhjgf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.15.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I2ihrfy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.15.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets. :)",

        "selftext": "What is [Blackbbery IVY](https://youtu.be/fwDnUNENSoY) (Intelligent Data Platform) works one every vehicle and every platform(in vehicle and cloud)\n\nMany are asking if GM is using WEJO([GPS data platform](https://www.wejo.com/)) for its ULTIFI platform ([software platform](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/general-motors-new-software-platform-ultifi-is-coming-to-vehicles-starting-in-2023/) ) instead of Blackberry Ivy ([intelligent vehicle data platform](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws))\n\nThe clear and straight forward answer is NO! WEJO and AUTONOMO ([here](https://otonomo.io/)) only provide GPS type and location data. They both LICENSE data from OEM and sell it to whoever wants to use. This data is NOT processed in cars using machine learning models or in cloud learning models.  the ULTIFI platfrom is bigger than just GPS coordinate data...the GM ULTIFI platform needs data from all 300+ sensors in car. \n\n[Blackberry Ivy](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-ivy-to-provide-secure-vehicle-based-payments) is a pipeline that sucks in data from over 300 sensors in each car. It then processes it right on the edge (in car chips) and then creates a AI model to use in real time by car APPS and then it also uploads that model in the cloud for other app developers to use. All this data is owned by OEM and they can decide who to give it. Blackberry ivy is NOT just GPS but camera videos to seat sensors to wiper sensors to accelerator sensors to gas sensors to battery sensors to turn signals etc!!! it's mother of all sensors processing platforms. \n\nThe software platform that GM launched (ULTIFI) is coming out in 2023 models the same time Blackberry IVY is coming out. GM is using Blackberry IVY for the data pipeline and providing it to their own app developers and then eventually will open up to other outisders...just like apple store and android play store. \n\nBlackberry ivy can sit on BB QNX operating system, BB QNX Hypervisor, Linux, anywhere!!! GM is using LINUX for ULTIFI platform to blackberry IVY will sit in there processing thee data. The QNX is embedded in pretty much every car sensor's chips (AMD,Qualcomm, etc) so each sensor has the ability to process all this data in realtime and apply machine learning to it for insight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yes the final answer is GM ULTIFI software platform is using Blackberry Ivy!!!! This is bigger than anything...this is huge. First big customer of BB Ivy.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 29, 2021**\n\nThe remarkable rally in equities continued, with stocks jumping despite two of the largest companies, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), posting disappointing earnings results in an otherwise solid earnings season. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) both closed the week at record closing levels.\n\nComing into Q3 earnings season, market participants were worried the persistent supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances would hamper corporate profits, so it is very encouraging to see companies holding up better than expected. Recent economic data has also contributed to the bounce in equities. \n\nAfter suffering its first -5% dip in September, the SPY has come back with a vengeance, advancing more than 7% from the October 4 bottom. In this same time period, the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped a staggering 10% and the Dow Jones (DIA) gained 5%. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I publicly remained bullish during September volatility and consistently encouraged dip-buying via this recap. Happy to say the strategy, as it has all year, worked great and personally resulted in my most profitable month all year. Hope some of y'all took advantage. Never try to fight market trends, much easier to ride them until you can\u2019t anymore. As I have said for like six months at this point, I think the trend will change once the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes. When that happens, I\u2019ll reassess my position. Until then I see any and all dips as buying opportunities. \n\nAmazon (AMZN) shares dropped after the e-commerce juggernaut missed third-quarter expectations and forecasted a jump in expenses in the fourth quarter due to supply chain disruptions and rising costs for labor, materials and freight. These factors are expected to generate \"several billion dollars of additional costs\" to Amazon in the current quarter, the company said in its earnings statement. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Earnings:** $6.12 vs $8.92 per share expected\n* **Revenue:** $110.81 billion vs $111.6 billion expected\n* Q4 Guidance: Amazon forecast sales between $130 billion and $140 billion\n* **Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime Subs:** $55.9 billion\n* **Net product sales:** $54.9 billion\n\nApple (AAPL) also disappointed Wall Street in its fiscal first-quarter results, with key iPhone sales missing expectations, with the launch of the iPhone 13 hampered by the global shortage in semiconductors that forced Apple to massively cut down on production, new rules that allow third-party payment systems in the App store, and supply chain issues, which Tim Cook says cost the company more than $6 billion. Key Apple suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM) fell on the miss. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **EPS:** $1.24 vs. $1.24 estimated \n* **Revenue:** $83.36 billion  vs. $84.85 billion estimated, up 29% year-over-year \n* **iPhone revenue:** $38.87 billion vs. $41.51 billion estimated, up 47% year-over-year \n* **Services revenue:** $18.28 billion vs. $17.64 billion estimated, up 25.6% year-over-year \n* **Other Products revenue:** $8.79 billion vs. $9.33 billion estimated, up 11.5% year-over-year \n* **Mac revenue:** $9.18 billion vs. $9.23 billion estimated, up 1.6% year-over-year \n* **iPad revenue:** $8.25 billion vs. $7.23 billion estimated, up 21.4% year-over-year \n\nEarlier in the week, a report showed US GDP decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) announced it will be rebranding under new name \u201cMeta\u201d and the ticker will change to MVRS starting December 1. This is to reflect the company\u2019s emphasis into investing in the metaverse, a 3D shared virtual space accessible via VR.\n* Following the post-earning surge, Microsoft (MSFT) unseated Apple (AAPL) as the world\u2019s most valuable company by market cap. \n* Tesla (TSLA) shares continued their monster run, closing above $1100 for a new all-time high. Congrats bulls, we getting paid!\n* Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) disclosed plans to expand drilling in the top US shale basin in West Texas after posting biggest quarterly profits in years amid elevated energy prices.\n* Squid Game Director Hwang Dong-hyuk confirmed there will be a season 2 but said he is \u201cnot a priority\u201d right now. Netflix (NFLX) stock was up 2.5% today to reach a new ATH. After lagging other tech companies in the last year or so, Netflix stocks has been on absolute fire following the release of Squid Game, the most popular show ever on the platform. It is reported Netflix made roughly $900 billion from the show. \n* Shares of Starbucks (SBUX) plummeted 6% after reporting earnings miss amid slowing sales in China.\n* The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation into NVIDIA (NVDA) plpanned $54 billion bid for semiconductor designer ARM. Very basically, the problem is that tons of companies, including Apple\u2019s new M1 chip are designed using ARM architecture, other chip companies are worried that NVDA\u2019s takeover could damage competition. In response NVDA has insisted it would maintain ARM as a \u201ctech neutral\u201d supplier.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Oppenheimer from $165 to $170 at Outperform.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 4, 2021**\n\nAfter an encouraging day last Friday, the stock market sank once again as market participants continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington and wait for upcoming economic and earnings data to gauge concerns over supply chain disruptions and inflation. Tech stocks once again came under pressure as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continues to rise. The Nasdaq (QQQ) close the day 2.1% lower, which means the tech-heavy index is now roughly 8% below its previous all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.29% lower, the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.92%, and the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.91%.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen previous episodes of rising rates, both earlier this year as well as when the Fed first announced intentions to begin tapering quantitative easing in the not too distant future. Each of these episodes caused a hiccup but didn\u2019t derail the broader bull market. According to Edward Jones, yields went from below 1% to 1.75% during the first three months of this year, a period that included pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500 of 3.7% for four days and 4.2% for 12 days. However, during that entire three-month stretch in which rates were rising, the stock market rose more than 7%.  In this current spate, 10-year rates have jumped from 1.30% on September 15 to as high as 1.54% last week, reflecting a renewed concern over inflation pressures and reduced Fed stimulus expectations\n\nStocks are struggling to regain their footing after the September selloff, given that many of the concerns that sparked last month\u2019s drop remain. Congressional lawmakers have yet to come to an agreement on a solution to raise the debt limit to prevent a potential government default sometime mid-October. Failure to do so would be catastrophic for the US economy.  As a reminder, Congress successfully averted a government shutdown last week. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it as early as this week Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown. \n\nPut simply, a default by the US would be an economic and political disaster that must be avoided. I cannot fathom the government willingly plunging the US into an unprecedented financial crisis for political reasons, though one can never guess the future. According to a report by Moody\u2019s Analytics, one of the three big along with Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Group, approximately 6 million jobs would be lost and the unemployment would spike dramatically, US GDP would decline, and there would be an irrevocable stain on the faith and strength of US financial markets. \u201cInternationally, the United States will have for the first time undermined the full faith and credit of its own currency -- a blow to our standing in the world and a boon for our adversaries such as China who are arguing to the world that the US is on the decline\u201d\n\nThe report goes on to say, \u201cGlobal financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government\u2019s finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.\u201d\n\nHere is a link to the full report, I encourage you to read it\n\n[https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/playing-a-dangerous-game-with-the-debt-limit.pdf](https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/playing-a-dangerous-game-with-the-debt-limit.pdf)\n\nLooking ahead, the September Jobs Report will be released later this week. Market participantsd are hoping to see payroll gains accelerate after a shockingly disappointing August report, which shoed just 235,000 new payrolls gains verses more than 700,000 expected. Consensus economists anticipate that 475,000 payrolls returned in September, and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, or the lowest since March 2020.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) underperformed the market after major outages and disruptions of service were reported across the company\u2019s suite of products. \n* Amazon (AMZN) is suffering its worst streak of underperformance in roughly two years and has turned negative year-to-date.\n* GlobalFoundries, which was created by the divestiture of the manufacturing arm of AMD reportedly filed for a US IPO.  \n* Tesla (TSLA) unexpectedly topped estimates for third-quarter deliveries, despite the global semiconductor shortage that is affecting all automakers. Comparatively, Ford (F) deliveries were down 27.4% in the third quarter. While one can\u2019t make direct comparisons due to scale differences, still very impressive to see Tesla (TSLA) successfully navigate the shortage.\n* A group of Tesla investors filed a court filing to argue that Elon Musk to repay the company $9.4 billion for the benefits he received after Tesla bought SolarCity, which Musk partly owned. \n* Factory orders were up 1.2% in August month-on-month, [according to Commerce Department data ](https://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3/prel/pdf/s-i-o.pdf)on Monday. This came in faster than the 1.0% rise expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data, and represented a fourth consecutive monthly advance.\n* Qualcomm (QCOM) and investment partnership firm SSW Partners announced an agreement to purchase automobile technology company Veoneer (VNE) Monday morning for $37 a share, which values the company at $4.5 billion",

        "selftext": "For my full breakdown check the link [here.](https://greencandleinvestments.substack.com/p/nvidia-corporation-ticker-nvda-brief?r=ksa6f&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompany Description  \nNvidia Corporation is a visual computing company that designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive markets. The GPU segment offers processors, which include GeForce for PC gaming and mainstream PCs; GeForce NOW for cloud-based gaming; Quadro for design professionals working in computer-aided design, video editing, special effects, Tesla for artificial intelligence (AI) utilizing deep learning, accelerated computing, general purpose computing, and much more. NVIDIA sells their products directly to manufacturers and system builders and is one of the leaders in the chip manufacturing industry.  \n\n\nQuantitative Analysis  \nAt the time of this writing (10/10/2021), NVDA is trading at $208.31 with a 52 week range of $115.66 - $230.43 and a market cap of $519.11B. In Q2 of their fiscal year 2022, NVDA\u2019s revenue was $6.51 billion, up 68% year over year. NVIDIA\u2019s gaming revenue grew 85% year over year to $3.06 billion. The data center revenue grew 35% year over year to $2.37 billion. Return of equity (ROE: Net Income / Total Equity \\*100) of NVDA is 39.25% and net margin (net income / revenue) is 32.33%. The price to earnings (price per share / earnings per share) ratio was 74.61 and the debt to equities ratio (total liabilities / total equity) is 0.83.  \n\n\nQualitative Analysis  \nNvidia is a global leader in the growing industry of computer chip manufacturers and supplies major companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The COVID pandemic brought a massive increase in demand for computer chips and supply simply could not keep up, leading to the ongoing chip shortage around the world. The impact of the chip shortage is particularly evident in the automotive industry, where new car manufacturing has fallen dramatically and prices of both new and used vehicles continue to hit all time highs month after month. Outside of traditional computing usages, Nvidia has a unique opportunity to integrate into the emerging cryptocurrency industry.\u00a0 In order to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, computers and mining processors need chips similar to what Nvidia creates. There are countless other uses for chips and potentially other uses of chips that have yet to be discovered. With the increasing need and the backing of a large investment from Nancy Pelosi, there\u2019s positive momentum behind one of the global leaders in chip manufacturing.  \n\n\nBullish Thesis  \n1. Backing of Nancy Pelosi Investment: \u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u2019s investment activity has gained a lot of traction and attention, a Twitter account has even been created that now has over 114k followers to track her investments. As mentioned above, Pelosi has a significant investment of $6.5 million in Nvidia. As outlined in the article, Pelosi has had extreme success and retail traders who have shadowed Pelosi have also seen incredible returns. Although this isn\u2019t a bullish point based on the fundamentals of the company, you cannot ignore the success of Pelosi\u2019s investments.  \n\n\n2. Increasing Demand: There are more and more products in need of chips. With increasing artificial intelligence in \u00a0vehicles and chips being placed in everyday products, the need for Nvidia\u2019s products will continue to increase.  \n\n\n3. Major Suppliers: Nvidia supplies chips to major companies such as Amazon, NIO the automated car manufacturer, Facebook, Google, and Tesla currently use Nvidia\u2019s graphics chips. With major companies using their chips, it provides a safety net for sales of Nvidia\u2019s products.  \n\n\nBearish Thesis  \n1. Competition: There are a number of other major chip manufacturing companies that offer NVDA stiff competition. Although Nvidia holds a strong position in chip market share, investors should keep a close eye on several other chip manufacturers. Competitors include: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM), and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM).  \n\n\n2. Short-term supply chain issues for semiconductors: The demand for semiconductor chips skyrocketed during the pandemic, leaving many manufacturers unable to keep up. This has been particularly evident in the automotive market, where the chip shortage is estimated to cost auto makers \\~210B dollars. Worse still, some have estimated that the chip shortage could continue into 2022 and even 2023. It\u2019s apparent that chip manufacturing companies have had a hard time scaling production, likely due to a number of supply-chain and other COVID-related issues. With demand likely to remain steady, NVDA will be pressured to scale up production and increase supply - time will tell how successful they are in doing so.  \n\n\n3. Automakers designing their own chips: The chip shortage has caused new car production - and thus supply and sales - to plummet over the last year. Because of the low supply, both new and used car prices have skyrocketed to record highs. Rather than simply wait for chip manufacturing companies to catch up, some automakers have started to consider designing and manufacturing chips internally. For example, Tesla has already begun making their own chips and one of GM\u2019s China joint ventures announced in September that they would begin designing their own chips. If chip manufacturing companies are unable to meet demand, expect more large companies with R&amp;D funds to follow Tesla and GM.\u00a0 \u00a0",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, October 13th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-wednesday-oct-13.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Wall Street looks to avoid a four-session losing streak\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures were essentially flat Wednesday after Dow stock JPMorgan Chase reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue and ahead of key inflation data. Shares of JPMorgan rose modestly in the premarket as third-quarter results from the bank were supported by a $1.5 billion boost from better-than-expected loan losses.\n\n&gt; * The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq all dropped Tuesday for the third straight session. The modest losses indicated that investors were in a wait-and-see mode ahead of earnings season really kicking into high gear.\n\n&gt; * Shares of Delta Air Lines dipped in the premarket after the carrier on Wednesday reported that third-quarter earnings and revenue topped expectations. It was Delta\u2019s first quarterly profit without taking federal aid into account since the start of the pandemic. However, it was still below 2019 pre-Covid levels.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Supply chain woes, rising costs may make for rocky earnings\n\n&gt; * Supply chain issues, labor shortages and higher energy prices are making this a very difficult quarter to model. As of Tuesday, 22 companies that are early reporters beat estimates by 11%, according to Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. While this is above the traditional beat of 3% to 5%, it\u2019s far below the average of prior quarters this year, including the roughly 18% beat for the second quarter. Third-quarter estimates, which had been rising steadily for months, have stopped in the last few weeks.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. September consumer prices expected to remain high\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 1.57% on Wednesday ahead of what\u2019s expected to be another elevated inflation report. The government at 8:30 a.m. ET releases the September consumer price index. Economists expect headline CPI and core CPI, which excludes the food and energy sectors, to be around the prior month\u2019s year-over-year increases of 5.3% and 4%, respectively. The Federal Reserve at 2 p.m. ET releases minutes from its policy meeting in September when central bankers indicated they expect to begin reducing monthly asset purchases \u201csoon,\u201d but did not say when.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. White House aims to help key West Coast ports stay open 24/7\n\n&gt; * President Joe Biden will unveil a plan Wednesday to try to ease West Coast port backlogs by expanding round-the-clock operations. The Port of Los Angeles is expected to announce a shift to 24/7 operations, following a similar transition by the Port of Long Beach in California last month. Central to this plan to ease supple chain disruptions are commitments by some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and shippers, including FedEx, UPS, Walmart and Home Depot, to increase overnight and off-hours operations at the ports to get the goods to market. Together, the ports account for about 40% of the shipping containers entering the United States.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. U.S. to reopen land borders in November for fully vaccinated\n\n&gt; * The U.S. said Wednesday it will reopen its land borders to nonessential travel next month, ending a 19-month freeze due to Covid as the nation moves to require all international visitors to be vaccinated. Vehicle, rail and ferry travel between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico has been largely restricted to essential travel since the earliest days of the pandemic. The latest move follows last month\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will end country-based travel bans for air travel and instead require Covid shots for foreign nationals seeking to enter by plane.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/LsmNGMW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H5hBrGA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/R248qyz.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/eZbwxOb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/vuQ72d7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/KdmemIV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/LUKc1Da.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DTX4gBn.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eRf3g77.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IT3mApN.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/7znGyIh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5TXBfcz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YLEAO9D.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-jpmorgan-chase-blackrock-delta-air-and-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **JPMorgan Chase (JPM)** \u2013 JPMorgan Chase reported a profit of $3.74 per share for the third quarter, compared with a consensus estimate of $3.00, while revenue also topped Wall Street forecasts.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 29, 2021**\n\nThe remarkable rally in equities continued, with stocks jumping despite two of the largest companies, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), posting disappointing earnings results in an otherwise solid earnings season. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) both closed the week at record closing levels.\n\nComing into Q3 earnings season, market participants were worried the persistent supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances would hamper corporate profits, so it is very encouraging to see companies holding up better than expected. Recent economic data has also contributed to the bounce in equities. \n\nAfter suffering its first -5% dip in September, the SPY has come back with a vengeance, advancing more than 7% from the October 4 bottom. In this same time period, the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped a staggering 10% and the Dow Jones (DIA) gained 5%. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I publicly remained bullish during September volatility and consistently encouraged dip-buying via this recap. Happy to say the strategy, as it has all year, worked great and personally resulted in my most profitable month all year. Hope some of y'all took advantage. Never try to fight market trends, much easier to ride them until you can\u2019t anymore. As I have said for like six months at this point, I think the trend will change once the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes. When that happens, I\u2019ll reassess my position. Until then I see any and all dips as buying opportunities. \n\nAmazon (AMZN) shares dropped after the e-commerce juggernaut missed third-quarter expectations and forecasted a jump in expenses in the fourth quarter due to supply chain disruptions and rising costs for labor, materials and freight. These factors are expected to generate \"several billion dollars of additional costs\" to Amazon in the current quarter, the company said in its earnings statement. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Earnings:** $6.12 vs $8.92 per share expected\n* **Revenue:** $110.81 billion vs $111.6 billion expected\n* Q4 Guidance: Amazon forecast sales between $130 billion and $140 billion\n* **Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime Subs:** $55.9 billion\n* **Net product sales:** $54.9 billion\n\nApple (AAPL) also disappointed Wall Street in its fiscal first-quarter results, with key iPhone sales missing expectations, with the launch of the iPhone 13 hampered by the global shortage in semiconductors that forced Apple to massively cut down on production, new rules that allow third-party payment systems in the App store, and supply chain issues, which Tim Cook says cost the company more than $6 billion. Key Apple suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM) fell on the miss. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **EPS:** $1.24 vs. $1.24 estimated \n* **Revenue:** $83.36 billion  vs. $84.85 billion estimated, up 29% year-over-year \n* **iPhone revenue:** $38.87 billion vs. $41.51 billion estimated, up 47% year-over-year \n* **Services revenue:** $18.28 billion vs. $17.64 billion estimated, up 25.6% year-over-year \n* **Other Products revenue:** $8.79 billion vs. $9.33 billion estimated, up 11.5% year-over-year \n* **Mac revenue:** $9.18 billion vs. $9.23 billion estimated, up 1.6% year-over-year \n* **iPad revenue:** $8.25 billion vs. $7.23 billion estimated, up 21.4% year-over-year \n\nEarlier in the week, a report showed US GDP decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) announced it will be rebranding under new name \u201cMeta\u201d and the ticker will change to MVRS starting December 1. This is to reflect the company\u2019s emphasis into investing in the metaverse, a 3D shared virtual space accessible via VR.\n* Following the post-earning surge, Microsoft (MSFT) unseated Apple (AAPL) as the world\u2019s most valuable company by market cap. \n* Tesla (TSLA) shares continued their monster run, closing above $1100 for a new all-time high. Congrats bulls, we getting paid!\n* Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) disclosed plans to expand drilling in the top US shale basin in West Texas after posting biggest quarterly profits in years amid elevated energy prices.\n* Squid Game Director Hwang Dong-hyuk confirmed there will be a season 2 but said he is \u201cnot a priority\u201d right now. Netflix (NFLX) stock was up 2.5% today to reach a new ATH. After lagging other tech companies in the last year or so, Netflix stocks has been on absolute fire following the release of Squid Game, the most popular show ever on the platform. It is reported Netflix made roughly $900 billion from the show. \n* Shares of Starbucks (SBUX) plummeted 6% after reporting earnings miss amid slowing sales in China.\n* The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation into NVIDIA (NVDA) plpanned $54 billion bid for semiconductor designer ARM. Very basically, the problem is that tons of companies, including Apple\u2019s new M1 chip are designed using ARM architecture, other chip companies are worried that NVDA\u2019s takeover could damage competition. In response NVDA has insisted it would maintain ARM as a \u201ctech neutral\u201d supplier.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Oppenheimer from $165 to $170 at Outperform.

        "selftext": "**TL/DR** \n\n* AST SpaceMobile is first mover on direct to cellular phone Low Earth Orbit constellations. It is a very profitable enterprise when they succeed. But first they need regulatory clearance / permission, in the form of licenses. These are important hurdles, and as such will act as major catalysts once cleared. Looking into the state of these applications we find that there will be multiple such catalysts in the next months. You might want to skip to the very last section: Catalyst timeframes.  \n\n\n**DISCLAIMER**\n\n* This is not financial advice. This is regulatory analysis. \n* The company covered in this writeup is a first mover in uncharted territory. They aim to do what no one has done before. They are pre-revenue. This is a risky business/investment. The writeup covers only one single aspect in depth. You should gain a broader understanding of the funding, technical concept of a business model etc before investing and not do it from reading of a single aspect.\n* *Comprehensive*, as in you will comprehend things and I should also say *exhaustive*, as in you will be exhausted from reading this long writeup. The subject is complex, and as such I might not have understood all things correctly. What is said below is to the best of my knowledge. I added pictures to make the reading less tedious.\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\n* In a previous wallstreetbets writeup I outline the company and what makes it unique. This post is recommended background reading if you are not familiar with the company. [AST SpaceMobile. The Black Swan of Low Earth Orbit satellite communication constellations. \ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2\ud83e\udda2 \ud83e\udd85 Why is it so different?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pvciwf/ast_spacemobile_the_black_swan_of_low_earth_orbit/)\n\n**SATELLITE COMMUNICATION COMPANIES, THE MAIN RISKS.**\n\n[The main risks to satellite services is not technology, it is regulations.](https://preview.redd.it/4wxo8mf8o9u71.png?width=2688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09b652534e9e19458e4833ab125191504ff35d40)\n\n* The above chart outlines the main risks that satellite services companies face. As can be seen **regulatory risks are the main risks.** As such overcoming these hurdles and getting the needed permits and licenses will act as major catalysts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Screenshot from the US market access application showing network architecture.](https://preview.redd.it/n9weep87p9u71.jpg?width=1119&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4f9200f2dd9454d613ce4c6f6a4dd938994b6c3)\n\n* Analyzing the applications in question, which are two the Bluewalker 3 single experimental satellite application and the application for US market access of the SpaceMobile constellation we find three major parts/ hurdles that are subject to the regulators approval. These three main regulatory risks are: **Fronthaul** (satellite to cellular phone spectrum), **Backhaul** (satellite to gateway spectrum) and **Orbital debris.** We shall look into them all below.\n\n**FRONTHAUL CELLULAR SPECTRUM - USA**\n\n* For SpaceMobile constellation US market access application AST legal/regulatory division has been very bright and exploited a regulation that opens up their use of partner cellular spectrum wherever that is not used terrestrially by a very simple and straightforward method, requiring no application nor permission of authorities, just notification.\n* The initial application for SpaceMobile constellation contained fronthaul (cellular, satellite to phone) control and backhaul (satellite to groundstation) bands. This has since been amended (see below). And the application now contains just backhaul and satellite control bands. Whereas the applications for the cellular fronthaul bands will see a different regulatory very streamlined and simple process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Screenshot of the public notice when AST SpaceMobile amended its application. https:\\/\\/docs.fcc.gov\\/public\\/attachments\\/DOC-368002A1.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/vq5c0zkrl9u71.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aed69ad5b4b4be7df2f547d999b3baf480c5ee80)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* This other process is available since in September 2004 when the FCC ventured into taking:\n\n&gt;\u201dadditional steps to facilitate the development of secondary markets expand upon and complement several of the Commission\u2019s major policy initiatives and public interest objectives. These include our efforts to encourage the development of broadband services for all Americans, promote increased facilities-based competition among service providers, enhance economic opportunities and access for the provision of communications services, and enable development of additional and innovative services in rural areas\u201d\n\n* Quote above is from FCC 04-167 Its a bit of a complex read, p27 is the key paragraph: \n\n&gt;27. Thus, if the spectrum leasing transaction does not involve a geographic overlap with spectrum held by the spectrum lessee in any of the particular services listed, as described above, we will permit the leasing arrangement to proceed without prior public notice or case-by-case review.\u201d\\*\n\n* Reading a note to the AST amendment of the SpaceMobile application it becomes clear this is indeed the backdoor / approach AST intends to use to gain US market access to use the cellular fronthaul frequencies. It is thereby no longer an intricate application to the FCC, it has been reduced to a simple notification process.  \n\n\n[Screenshot of letter attached to amendment off the original SpaceMobile constellation application. Highlighted text shows the reasoning behind seeking the amendment. This and the regulations cited above suggests a notification is all it takes, not an application to use the leased terrestrial cellular spectrum for AST SpaceMobile Satellite constellation in the USA.](https://preview.redd.it/2c1u31ewm9u71.png?width=876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45a1b30005cf2c8725034918adaa3426825206a6)\n\n* A regulation put in place to maximize the use of spectrum in the USA, comes handy indeed. This regulation derisks the US market access application for SpaceMobile constellation, considerably. And as the US to large extent serves as regulatory benchmark for the developed world when it comes to space this will see effects in other markets.\n\n**FRONTHAUL CELLULAR SPECTRUM - REST OF THE WORLD**\n\n* As descibed in a report that can be purchased from Quilty the access to use fronthaul spectrum is a process that is different in different countries. And in some countries this is subject to a unified license regime. On these markets gaining access to fronthaul will be just as straight forward  / streamlined as in the USA. Partner Mobile network operators are already allowed to use them from satellite. I have done extensive searches for partner companies that holds unified licences.  \nThe countries I have found are Angola, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, India, HongKong and Rwanda. AST does not provide this list it is assembled from multiple sources by me.  \n\n* Further investigations has led to a comprehensive list of the 20 terrestrial mobile network operators that are AST SpaceMobile partners. These collectively hold 1.5 Bn customers and the business model of AST SpaceMobile involves applying for permission / licenses where needed through these terrestrial partners. As Quilty describes it this process will be fast in some countries, and likely see regulators in other countries rush to cut the redtape when they the opportunity to close the digital divide by allowing the use. On some markets, however, such processes will likely stall or be glacial. The partners under MoU or agreements are: MTN, Vodafone, Telecom Argentina, Telstra,  Liberty Latin America, Tigo (Millicom International), America Movil, Telefonica, Safaricom, Indosat, Vodacom, Smart, Uganda Telecom (UTL), AT&amp;T, Rakuten, American Towers, Africell, MUNI, LIBTELCO and perhaps still Bell Canada, but the latter is not confirmed. AST does not provide this complete list when asked it is assembled from multiple sources by me.  \n\n* Just as the unified licenses are found in near equatorial countries, so is the partner coverage high near the equator. Companies like America Movil, AT&amp;T, Tigo, Telecom Argentina, Telefonica, LL America means 80%+ of customers in Latin America are covered. And in Africa MTN and vodafone group dominate. Smart and Indosat Ooredoo Hutchinson partnerships covers Philippines and Indonesia. This focus is explained by the fact that AST SpaceMobile will launch the equtorial constellation initially consisting of 18 satellites and 2 in orbit spares for a total of 20, starting launches in 2022. Connecting the unconnected is an AST objective there are lots of these potential customers near the equator. Starting the rollout where regulatory issues are most easily overcome and access most swiftly granted is most likely another AST objective, these objectives are both met near the equator.\n\n**ORBITAL DEBRIS RISKS - Bluewalker 3.**  \n\n\n* A close foreseeable catalyst for AST SpaceMobile would be the Bluewalker 3 experimental satellite application grant, which by all measures progresses smoothly an answer to the last outstanding question from the FCC regarding orbital debris was answered nov 15, and the answer filed November 18 2021. The ball lies now with the FCC, and if there are no more questions to ask the next step will be to grant the application. I foresee no regulatory issues there. But in this phase permits/ lisences granted will still move share price.   \n\n* As all questions so far has been answered, and FCC letters only contain single questions now, the AST Bluewalker 3 application is mature for approval any day. An imminent catalyst before end of year.\n\n[Orbital debris density varies with altitude, the lowest altitudes are kept clean by drag ](https://preview.redd.it/ijgtz1s6y9u71.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab2a79348fc17d529a6987dda581cc78b6bfe13f)\n\n**ORBITAL DEBRIS RISKS  - SpaceMobile constellation US Market Access application.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The individual requirement per satellite is to get below 1:10,000 risk. As the AST satellites fly edge on they present small area that debris might impact and the US market access application states 1:19,700. risk per satellite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Screenshot from AST SpaceMobile constellation US Market Access application showing a 1:19,700 total risk calculated using standard NASA software.](https://preview.redd.it/4akbdn980au71.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=106f28a8f91c0540839d65f8c3bd38d23b3b4376)\n\n* 1/19,700= 0.00005076 that would be the individual large object impact risk probability. When the satellite is flying on the altitude of the application as calculated with branch std NASA software. If they are duds.\n* Then the regulations say to consider maneuver able sats 0 risk (as space is monitored and they can maneuver away) and they say to use a 10% failure rate. And get below 0.001 total constellation impact risk. That is below .1% one in a thousand times that some satellite would have an object impact.\n* So for a 243 sat constellation we have 24.3 theoretical dead in the sky sats we need to calculate the aggregated large object orbital debris risk for.\n* The way to do that is to first calculate the chance of a single sat not colliding. That is: 1-0.000005076=0.99994924 Then we calculate the chance of no one out of 24.3 sats collide: 0.99994924\\^ 24.3 That is a chance of 0.99881289 that all duds make it. The complimentary event being 0.00119 That is pretty close to the limit of 0.001 total risk.\n* Now regulations are clear on the fact 0.001 is not a rule, it is a benchmark that the FCC may choose to do exemptions from. Meaning they can allow a risk larger than 0.001. So there are a number of tweaks to this. \n* One would be to amend application to 198 satellites whereby the limit is just met. 198 is more than needed for full global MIMO, then play the starlink trick once global MIMO is achieved and lower altitude. \n* A second way is to ask FCC to make an exemption of the 0.001 total debris impact risk limit.\n* A third way is to claim that the spacecrafts having multiple magnetorquers (10x redundancy) throughout the array as well as also having Orbion Hall effect thrusters is less likely to fail orbital avoidance having dual redundant maneuverability. And ask exemption from 10% failure rate.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Orbion Hall Effect \\(Ion\\) thrusters](https://preview.redd.it/pvk90d592au71.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78ac837379b1dcee5e1065aea2ce86b4f113327e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A magnetorquer \\(this one made by AST subsidiary NanoAvionics. Multiple Magentorquers are distributed throughout the Bluebird satellite arrays for redundancy. They change pitch, yaw and roll of LEO spacecraft with help of the earth magnetic field and require no propellant.](https://preview.redd.it/qi4p3sij2au71.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dd7bbe6d0093f5f6a512c6429fb04db79a7a4a1)\n\n* A fourth is to lower altitude of constellation from start.\n* A fifth way is to launch a separate constellation to cover USA using other orbital planes. (This would be unlikely).\n* A sixth way is a slight reduction of size. We have seen this played out already, presumably as R and D has developed more efficient microns (it is the name of the antenna array elements), and studies likely narrowed down the number of beams actually needed per sat. Array has shrunk from 30x30 a year ago, to 24x24 (Deutsche Bank coverage) to 20x20 (Barclays coverage report, company statements) and 20x17.8 (measured by me from recent company renderings). If this ongoing reduction leads to amendment of orbital debris impact risk later on remains to see. They might have shrunk a bit since application was filed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Size and proportion of AST Bluebird satellites. These have a new form factor for satellites, travel to space packed as cubes and unfolds using mechanically stored energy \\(spring loaded\\)  dampening hinges to form a flat array that flies in low drag configuration edge first. It measures 20 x 17.8 meters and features 330 square meters of phased array each, compared to less than 2 square meters on a Starlink satellite. This huge antenna is key to connect directly to cellular phones. Flying edge first is also a design feature that allows a lot more antenna real estate without violating orbital debris regulations.](https://preview.redd.it/cix35xgj6au71.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51932e8db9e3bd91c43f9cf61772fa9a1d108b5c)\n\n* It is an AST objective to have 336 sats up by 2027 according to AST investor presentation. This is the equivalent of 2 x 168 satellite constellations. Mirroring the Starlink double constellation concept. Two such constellations would use two different aggregated orbital debris collision risk calculations. If you add a 30% margin on 168 you end up with 234 satellites. The AST SpaceMobile US market access application is for 243 satellites, whereas just 168 are actually needed for the first MIMO global constellation. It stands to reason there might be a 30% margin to the application that is mostly a negotiation tactic. And if so the 168 needed satellites for global MIMO have an aggregated risk well below the regulatory requirement. If we consider this 2 x 168 satellites the real objective of AST, then orbital debris will not be an issue for the initial 168 US market access application.\n\n**BACKHAUL CELLULAR SPECTRUM Q nd V bands.**\n\n* AST SpaceMobile use extremely high throughput Q and V bands for satellite backhaul.\n* The access to these bands are achieved on two parallel routes, one is application to ITU, this has been done through NICTA, a regulatory body of Papua New Guinea who has approved the AST SpaceMobile application to launch.  AST attests to this fact in correspondence with the FCC.\n* The second route is by application to each respective country where AST, or its partners Vodafone and American Towers operates a terrestrial Space station / gateway. For most parts this will be American Towers and AST will lease the terrestrial Space Stations to avoid Capital Expenditures, CapEx. Now The Architecture is NewRadio some next level technology that uses leaders at virtualisation Altiostar and Rakuten software to virtualize the entire network and have AI slice it for optimum performance on throughput and latency and distribute the traffic on legacy cellular networks and the internet as appropriate. Using the internet for this is one factor that means AST will not need a terrestrial ground station, nor such permits for backhaul, in each and every country where they operate. just in some. \n* In the US [an extra licensing round](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-21-941A1.docx) has been initiated by the FCC to supply AST SpaceMobile with backhaul cellular spectrum. Applications to take part in this round ends on Nov 4 2021. After this date judging by the OneWeb 92 days after deadline and Kuiper 65 days offsets from last round. AST SpaceMobile will receive their Backhaul spectrum grant somewhere between Jan 8 2022 to Feb 4 2022.\n* Importantly the Kuiper application in the prior round had\u00a0 \\_not\\_ yet resolved their orbital debris issues but were still granted v-band rights conditional of later fixing their orbital debris analysis. This means these processes are parallell and will be resolved seperately not delaying the frequenzy grant. They might serve as two seperate catalysts. The orbital debris issue might take another month or two of correspondence to resolve, we see this from the BW3 correspondence. Putting the complete AST US Market access grant, including orbital debris, somewhere in the same timeframe as BW3 launch window March-April 2022 or some month later: June 2022.\n\n**OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS, THE 3GPP 5g standard.**\n\n* Many constellations try to do satellite communications and they compensate for small phased arrays in space and to wide beams by using proprietary user equipment and proprietary communication standards. AST does not use proprietary standards nor proprietary phones. They are adpating to the existing standard. And the existing standard is adapting to AST SpaceMobile.\n* 3GPP 5g standard release 16, and later release 17, contain many techniques that are suited for connection to satellite, including better adopted to doppler and latency of LEO satellites, 4x4 beamhandling MIMO, carrier aggregation, improved power management, and positioning. This mutualistic / synergistic relationship between the terrestrial end user equipment and the space based satellites will continue to improve once they connect. The chip Qualcomm x65 which has been with OEM manufacturers in 2021 and will be in phones from 2022 already incorporates release 16. This chip is manufactured by AST partner Samsung. \n* AST will connect to legacy cellphones, including smartphones. But as new phones are launched they will keep getting better at it, and add functionality such as very accurate assured 5g positioning. More reliable than GPS, less prone to interference, jamming and spoofing. Good for drones, which by the way also AST latency is, sub 30 ms. Iridium latency in comparison is terrible: above 300 ms. 5g through AST SpaceMobile thereby likely to get regulatory approval to pilot drones and vehicles remotely by low latency sensor feed and assured positioning / fused LEO GNSS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fused LEO GNSS. GPS type positioning from LEO satellites. Right column. Note the Precision and anti jam anti spoof advantage. +56 dB is 40,000 x stronger signal than GPS. 5g standard release 16 and beyond will include positioning using multiple uplink, downlink  and roundtrip multialteration signals as well as angle of arrival\\/ angle of departure multiangulation. These abilities has civilian and military use cases.](https://preview.redd.it/tiyegjszhau71.png?width=352&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8805e102e405ad1b70bf1867db02814c8583fd79)\n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CATALYST TIMEFRAMES, Summary of the above.

That other stock, Lithium Americas, has tracked the model well running +22% in as many days since that post on a run up to an expected regulatory approval. AST SpaceMobile has yet to start run up and regulatory catalyst spikes but studying the price movement on Lithium Americas on these regulatory milestones should give the investor an idea about the magnitude of regulatory approvals for junior explorers. Be that mining lithium in Nevada or mining connectivity in Space. You still need that permit to start a hugely profitable operation.\n\n**QUESTIONS?**\n\n* Feel free to ask for references of what is said above.

J&amp;J shares rose modestly.\n&gt; * Volatility that accompanied September\u2019s market decline continued in October, with the first two trading days of the new month up big and then down big. The Nasdaq, as of Monday\u2019s close, was almost 7.3% away from its latest record close Sept. 7, inching nearer to a correction. The S&amp;P 500 was 5.2% from its Sept. 2 record high. The Dow was more than 4.5% away from its Aug. 16 record close.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. U.S. faces recession if Congress doesn\u2019t act on debt limit , Yellen says\n\n&gt; * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Tuesday she believes the economy would fall into a recession if Congress fails to address the borrowing limit before an unprecedented default on the U.S. debt. \u201cI do regard Oct. 18 as a deadline. It would be catastrophic to not pay the government\u2019s bills, for us to be in a position where we lacked the resources to pay the government\u2019s bills,\u201d Yellen said on \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d On Monday, President Joe Biden urged Republican senators to \u201cget out of the way\u201d on the debt ceiling. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Democrats should use their majorities on Capitol Hill to act without GOP votes.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Oil prices rose to around 7-year highs after OPEC, allies moves\n\n&gt; * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, rose modestly Tuesday morning to around seven-year highs near $78 per barrel. WTI jumped roughly 2.3% on Monday as international oil producers decided to keep a cap on supplies. Despite pressure from the U.S. to ramp up output, OPEC and its allies were concerned that a fourth global wave of Covid infections could slow a demand recovery, a source told Reuters just before Monday\u2019s vote. U.S. oil prices have surged more than 60% in 2021, bringing major energy companies along for the ride. Exxon has gained nearly 50% this year.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Facebook whistleblower to testify; platform outage fixed\n\n&gt; * Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen is set to testify at Tuesday\u2019s hearing of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection. After recent reports in The Wall Street Journal based on documents she leaked raised a public outcry, Haugen revealed her identity in an interview on the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which aired Sunday night. She insisted that \u201cFacebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.\u201d Shares of Facebook rose 1% in Tuesday\u2019s premarket after closing down almost 5% in their worst session in nearly a year.\n\n&gt; * Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp services are back online after a massive global outage. Facebook said late Monday that \u201cthe root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change.\u201d The roughly six-hour incident marked the longest stretch of downtime for the social media company since 2008, when a bug knocked the site offline for about a day, affecting around 80 million users. The company\u2019s platforms currently have billions users.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Tesla must pay ex-worker $137 million over hostile workplace, racism\n\n&gt; * A San Francisco federal court decided that Tesla must pay a former contract worker, Owen Diaz, around $137 million after he endured racist abuse working for the company, his attorneys told CNBC. The jury awarded more than attorneys had asked for their client, including $130 million in punitive damages and $6.9 million for emotional distress. Diaz told the court that colleagues used epithets to denigrate him and other Black workers, telling him to \u201cgo back to Africa\u201d and leaving racist graffiti in the restrooms and a racist drawing in his workspace. Diaz\u2019s lawyers said the case was only able to move forward because their client had not signed one of Tesla\u2019s mandatory arbitration agreements.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/cufqIAb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wz4zrQT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8lPe5bB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/RtabSpV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/U5PgJ90.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aubwMW2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vzQs6xT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/892SyJi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xcmpnv9.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KpOco76.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/JnGeOww.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3a1JSQR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lordstown-motors-ocugen-pepsico-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lordstown Motors (RIDE)** \u2013 The electric truck maker was downgraded to \u201cunderweight\u201d from \u201cequal-weight\u201d at Morgan Stanley, which notes that the recently announced sale of Lordstown\u2019s Ohio plant to Foxconn values the plant at less than a fifth of prior estimates.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 1st, 2021.\n\n# **Markets could be challenged in the week ahead as the Fed prepares to reverse easy policy - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/markets-could-be-challenged-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-fed-prepares-to-reverse-easy-policy.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve is expected to take its first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to fight the pandemic, a milestone on the road back toward normal.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday is the big event for markets in the week ahead. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.\n*****\n&gt; Economic data will also be important, with the October jobs report on Friday. There are dozens of earnings expected, including pharmaceuticals like Pfizer and Moderna, as well as a host of travel, energy, insurance, and tech companies.\n*****\n&gt; The Bank of England also meets Thursday, and it is expected to raise interest rates. The move comes after rate hikes by South Korea, Norway and others.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. \u201cIn a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Inflation has been running at a 30-year high. Core PCE inflation \u2014 which is the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge \u2014jumped 3.6% in September on a year-over-year basis, the same as in August.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher on the week, with the S&amp;P 500 up about 1.1% as of Friday afternoon and up roughly 6.7% for the month of October. Both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 notched new highs in the past week. The widely watched 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.53% Friday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is an incredible level of complacency out there in this environment,\u201d Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; Other events the markets are monitoring include the gathering of world leaders at the G-20 in Italy and the United Nations climate summit COP26, beginning Sunday in Scotland.\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Wild week\u2019\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a wild week,\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s Michael Schumacher said. He noted that the Fed\u2019s action will dominate the week, and the jobs report will be secondary.\n*****\n&gt; Wells Fargo economists expect 390,000 jobs were added in October and average hourly earnings grew by 0.4%, he noted. Payrolls were up just 194,000 in September. Schumacher said inflation is the biggest concern in the markets, so the wage data will be most closely watched.\n*****\n&gt; Schumacher said the market is widely expecting the Fed to announce it will reduce its bond purchases by $15 billion a month, starting either in November or December. The central bank implemented its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program in early 2020, as it slashed rates and introduced programs to buy a range of assets to help keep the markets liquid.\n*****\n&gt; Now, as the program is being wound down, it is what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says about inflation that matters most because that will drive interest rate expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Yet, Powell is expected to stress that the Fed is not automatically going to raise interest rates once the bond purchases end in the middle of next year. Traders are pricing in as many as three interest rate hikes next year, but in the latest Fed forecast, only half of central bank officials agreed there should be even one.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe inflation commentary is a lot more important,\u201d Schumacher said. \u201cPowell has sounded concerned about expectations getting baked in.\u201d He noted that the 2-year yield, which most reflects the Fed, has risen more than 30 basis points since the last Fed meeting five weeks ago.\n*****\n&gt; Schumacher said market expectations for rate hikes may be overdone, and that he does not expect a move until the beginning of 2023. \u201cThe direction is right, but the speed is wrong,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Powell\u2019s comments will be closely watched for any adjustment in his thinking on inflation. The Fed had described the surge in rates as \u201ctransitory\u201d or temporary. The consumer price index has been running above 5%, and core CPI was at 4% in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe general feeling among central bankers and the major central banks is this inflation rate will come back down,\u201d TIAA Bank president of world markets Chris Gaffney said. \u201cNobody is using \u2018transitory\u2019 anymore, but they don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re going to have prolonged high inflation.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Gaffney said the weaker-than-expected 2% growth in third-quarter gross domestic product could help the Fed convince the markets that it intends to keep rates lower for longer.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs long as they stay accommodative, I think the recovery continues,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fairly bullish for the markets going forward. We\u2019ll certainly see a lot more choppiness, but I still think the global economy, the U.S. economy particularly, is right now a great environment for corporations. We\u2019re seeing fairly positive earnings reports, and more importantly expectations for future earnings.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There have been some high-profile misses, including both Apple and Amazon this past week. Both their stocks fell, weighing on the Nasdaq down Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings overall have been good, but there\u2019s still a lot of profit margin challenges out there,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cThere\u2019s no better example than Apple and Amazon.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kID8drk.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kpeo12w.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/mgqDnIk.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/feNGOpc.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GDzFNzM.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/r8J2LuB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qWy1mUR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kGexB3t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K4NfO23.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TglfDZd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2HOk4x5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vcv5Pne.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GgX6FOh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/PmzM56I.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/d5RZesR.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # November\u2019s First Trading Day: DJIA Up Over 1% Three Years in a Row\n\n&gt; Based upon data in the 2022 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac on page 90, the first trading day of November is the fourth best of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA point gained. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have all advanced 13 times over the last 21 years.

Not to be outdone though, October 29 and November 2 and 3 are also some of the better days of the year. \u201cI\u2019d like to think it has something to do with my birthday being on October 28, but the truth is bulls should be aware that the coming days are historically some of the best of the year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the single best day to buy at the close and hold for the next five trading days is today, October 27. Yes, these 5 days were lower last year by 0.6%, but you have to go back to the late 1960s to see the last time they were down two years in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, November has been quite strong historically. In fact, since 1950, and the past 10 years, it is the best month of the year, while it ranks second over the past 20 years and during a post-election year. \u201cNovember is the best month of the year, but it doesn\u2019t seem to get nearly as much love as you\u2019d think,\u201d added Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe all assume December is the best month, but November is actually better and gets very little fanfare. Maybe it should be a month for the bulls, not for turkeys.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Year\u2019s Best 3-Month Span About To Start\n\n&gt; November, December and January constitute the year\u2019s seasonally strongest 3-month period for the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and the NASDAQ Composite. This seasonal strength is created by a combination of the annual, semiannual and quarterly operations of institutions and the habitual behavior of retail investors and consumers.\n\n&gt; The November-January 3-month span has produced a gain of 4.3% for the S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA since 1949. October-December runs a close second at 4.1% for S&amp;P and 3.9% for DJIA. Since 1971 NASDAQ has gained a whopping 6.3% November-January with December-February in second at 5.0% and October-December in third at4.4%.\n\n&gt; These charts also highlight the Best and Worst Months of the year with the Best running from October/November to April/May/June and the Worst from May/June/July to September/October. Stocks have been firming up since we issued our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal to subscribers on October 8 and look poised for a solid yearend rally that continues into early 2022.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e010745ce0513ef26c01ad558f3324d0/5de97b698922b56d-fc/s500x750/77e7204b6cd2e2850a23200d70c176145dea1f34.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bd388d961bd47113bc428f68d2326639/5de97b698922b56d-6f/s500x750/f04c4e20d4d9d98fd0b02b7f8472b21dfd8fa543.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a218e808de4cf5062ba7fe2829c50222/5de97b698922b56d-58/s500x750/0adaf5599c04919e8fb8fca7e5a5129f414f0ccb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Short Term Breadth Takes Off\n\n&gt; One of the points noted about the recent moves for the S&amp;P 500 over the past few days have been on the outsized impacts of big gains or losses in names like Tesla (TSLA) or Facebook (FB). In spite of the impacts of those single names, the S&amp;P 500's return to record highs has happened on very strong breadth across sectors. Below, we show 10-day advance-decline line charts from our Sector Snapshot.\n\n&gt; The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average daily number of advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last ten trading days. It's a short-term breadth measure that traders use to measure how extended the market is at the moment. Very high readings suggest that the market might be overbought in the near term, and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low readings suggest the opposite -- that the market might be oversold in the near term, and upside mean reversion can be expected.\n\n&gt; For the broad S&amp;P 500, the 10-day AD line has hit the highest level since February 12th. Going back to 1990, the current reading stands in the 97th percentile. Looking at each sector, most lines are also in the upper decile of readings since 1990 and only two are not currently overbought: Communication Services and Consumer Staples. Meanwhile, some like Technology and Real Estate are a full two standard deviations above the historical norm. In fact, the Tech sector's line is the most elevated relative to its respective history of any sector with the current reading in the 98th percentile of all periods. The last time that the line was as elevated as now was in November of last year. No other sector has as long of a gap in time in which it has seen levels similar to the current reading. Most other sectors have seen higher readings as recently as August or September, though current levels are nonetheless elevated. The market has had quite the run over the last two weeks, and we'd expect some sort of cool-off period soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102621-AD-Lines.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # High Number of Record Highs\n\n&gt; Major US equity indices have returned to all-time highs in the second half of October with the S&amp;P 500 and Dow both hitting record levels today. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ Composite is roughly a quarter of one percent away and the closest to a new all-time high since the last one on September 7th. The Russell 2,000, on the other hand, is at the high end of the past several months' range, but it is still over 2% below its high from March 15th.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 having been at new highs over the past few days, it has made 57 new all-time highs year to date. As shown in the top-left chart below, there have only been three other years in the past that have seen more record highs during the full course of the year: 2017 (62), 1964 (67), and 1995 (78). For the other major indices, the pace of record highs is less impressive but still strong. The Dow has made 38 new highs in 2021 which is more than triple the historical average. This year is on pace to see the highest number of record highs for the index since 2017 when it tied 1991 for the record of 71 closes at an all-time high. The NASDAQ Composite has also seen a solid number of highs at 36 which is well above the historical average of 19 per year historically. Given the index has been rangebound essentially all year, the Russell 2,000, conversely, has only seen 13 closing record highs. That is the same number as last year and it is actually below the average of 20 per year historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102621-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steps Back\n\n&gt; The weekly sentiment survey from AAII saw a surge in optimism in recent weeks, but it took a step back this week even with the S&amp;P 500 at new highs. Bullish sentiment fell from a recent high of 46.9% down to 39.8% this week. Outside of last week, that is still the highest level since the first week of September.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bulls.png))**\n\n&gt; While bullish sentiment saw a significant 7.1 percentage point drop, a relatively small share of those losses turned to the bearish camp. Bearish sentiment only rose 1.6 percentage points to 29.4%. That is still below levels from two weeks ago and is in line with the average from throughout the summer.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bears.png))**\n\n&gt; The corresponding moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread to fall but bulls continue to outweigh bears by 10.4 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; As previously mentioned, the largest share of losses to bulls did not go to bears, but instead were picked up by those reporting neutral sentiment. That reading moved back above 30% this week gaining 5.3 percentage points. Again, that does not mark any sort of new high or low but instead brings sentiment back to similar levels seen only a month or two ago.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 29th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1pI0oKgfc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.31.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULZcEQ_jrGQ))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 4, 2021**\n\nAfter an encouraging day last Friday, the stock market sank once again as market participants continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington and wait for upcoming economic and earnings data to gauge concerns over supply chain disruptions and inflation. Tech stocks once again came under pressure as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continues to rise. The Nasdaq (QQQ) close the day 2.1% lower, which means the tech-heavy index is now roughly 8% below its previous all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.29% lower, the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.92%, and the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.91%.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen previous episodes of rising rates, both earlier this year as well as when the Fed first announced intentions to begin tapering quantitative easing in the not too distant future. Each of these episodes caused a hiccup but didn\u2019t derail the broader bull market. According to Edward Jones, yields went from below 1% to 1.75% during the first three months of this year, a period that included pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500 of 3.7% for four days and 4.2% for 12 days. However, during that entire three-month stretch in which rates were rising, the stock market rose more than 7%.  In this current spate, 10-year rates have jumped from 1.30% on September 15 to as high as 1.54% last week, reflecting a renewed concern over inflation pressures and reduced Fed stimulus expectations\n\nStocks are struggling to regain their footing after the September selloff, given that many of the concerns that sparked last month\u2019s drop remain. Congressional lawmakers have yet to come to an agreement on a solution to raise the debt limit to prevent a potential government default sometime mid-October. Failure to do so would be catastrophic for the US economy.  As a reminder, Congress successfully averted a government shutdown last week. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it as early as this week Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown. \n\nPut simply, a default by the US would be an economic and political disaster that must be avoided. I cannot fathom the government willingly plunging the US into an unprecedented financial crisis for political reasons, though one can never guess the future. According to a report by Moody\u2019s Analytics, one of the three big along with Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Group, approximately 6 million jobs would be lost and the unemployment would spike dramatically, US GDP would decline, and there would be an irrevocable stain on the faith and strength of US financial markets. \u201cInternationally, the United States will have for the first time undermined the full faith and credit of its own currency -- a blow to our standing in the world and a boon for our adversaries such as China who are arguing to the world that the US is on the decline\u201d\n\nThe report goes on to say, \u201cGlobal financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government\u2019s finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.\u201d\n\nHere is a link to the full report, I encourage you to read it\n\n[https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/playing-a-dangerous-game-with-the-debt-limit.pdf](https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/playing-a-dangerous-game-with-the-debt-limit.pdf)\n\nLooking ahead, the September Jobs Report will be released later this week. Market participantsd are hoping to see payroll gains accelerate after a shockingly disappointing August report, which shoed just 235,000 new payrolls gains verses more than 700,000 expected. Consensus economists anticipate that 475,000 payrolls returned in September, and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, or the lowest since March 2020.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) underperformed the market after major outages and disruptions of service were reported across the company\u2019s suite of products. \n* Amazon (AMZN) is suffering its worst streak of underperformance in roughly two years and has turned negative year-to-date.\n* GlobalFoundries, which was created by the divestiture of the manufacturing arm of AMD reportedly filed for a US IPO.  \n* Tesla (TSLA) unexpectedly topped estimates for third-quarter deliveries, despite the global semiconductor shortage that is affecting all automakers. Comparatively, Ford (F) deliveries were down 27.4% in the third quarter. While one can\u2019t make direct comparisons due to scale differences, still very impressive to see Tesla (TSLA) successfully navigate the shortage.\n* A group of Tesla investors filed a court filing to argue that Elon Musk to repay the company $9.4 billion for the benefits he received after Tesla bought SolarCity, which Musk partly owned. \n* Factory orders were up 1.2% in August month-on-month, [according to Commerce Department data ](https://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3/prel/pdf/s-i-o.pdf)on Monday. This came in faster than the 1.0% rise expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data, and represented a fourth consecutive monthly advance.\n* Qualcomm (QCOM) and investment partnership firm SSW Partners announced an agreement to purchase automobile technology company Veoneer (VNE) Monday morning for $37 a share, which values the company at $4.5 billion",

But in 2020 this is no longer the case. Computing, automotive and security markets have now outpaced the growth of mobile devices. The $20.7B CIS industry is still dominated by mobile and consumer applications, representing more than 72% of revenues. \n\n Yet, despite all headwinds in 2020, computing, automotive and security have each grown to similar shares, reaching about 8% of CIS revenues, and 23% combined. They had represented 21% in 2019. In computing, higher demand for laptops and tablets in the COVID-19 context combined with the introduction of sensing cameras, such as 3D and fingerprint, has reversed a multi-year downward trend. In automotive and security, the high demand for cameras comes from smart car, smart home, and smart building trends.  \n\n Some future growth of the CIS market will therefore come from those markets, although mobile will still play a major role due to its sheer size. Looking more precisely at the growth forecast for mobile, social media has completely redefined our relationship to phones. \n\n Future technology for phone cameras will therefore primarily serve social media applications. We expect the production volume of mobile handsets to resume an upward trend in 2021, growing by 11.5% Year-over-Year (YoY), which is the major contributor to Yole D\u00e9veloppement (Yole)\u2019s CIS forecast upgrade. The combined need for real time distant communication and expression is rising. Combined with the growth of the other markets, the CIS industry should at least keep growing at 7.5% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for the five years ahead. \n\n [Status of CMOS Image Sensor Industry 2021 - i-Micronews](https://www.i-micronews.com/products/status-of-cmos-image-sensor-industry-2021/?cn-reloaded=1) \n\n Rich Geruson said the path to commercializing ALIIS was via semiconductors. CIS is just that. CMOS Image Sensors are to the camera what the cones and rods are to the retina of the eyes. These CMOS photosensors stream video like a TV in reverse to an ISP.  The ISP is where ALIIS can live, right next to the CMOS Image Sensor. It receives the image stream from these \"electronic eyeballs\" and fixes it (just like the part of the brain that flips what you see right side up and fills in the blind spot) before sending it downstream to applications like surveillance, mobile, IoT, and automotive apps, etc.\n\n [Korean Operations Initiated \u2013 NexOptic](https://nexoptic.com/news/korean-operations-initiated/) \n\nWhat about Qualcomm, Arm and Nvidia, there is an endless stream of new developments to emerge from this company!\n\nStay tuned!!\n\n [Aliis \u2013 NexOptic](https://nexoptic.com/aliis/)",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 1st, 2021.\n\n# **Markets could be challenged in the week ahead as the Fed prepares to reverse easy policy - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/markets-could-be-challenged-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-fed-prepares-to-reverse-easy-policy.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve is expected to take its first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to fight the pandemic, a milestone on the road back toward normal.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday is the big event for markets in the week ahead. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.\n*****\n&gt; Economic data will also be important, with the October jobs report on Friday. There are dozens of earnings expected, including pharmaceuticals like Pfizer and Moderna, as well as a host of travel, energy, insurance, and tech companies.\n*****\n&gt; The Bank of England also meets Thursday, and it is expected to raise interest rates. The move comes after rate hikes by South Korea, Norway and others.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. \u201cIn a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Inflation has been running at a 30-year high. Core PCE inflation \u2014 which is the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge \u2014jumped 3.6% in September on a year-over-year basis, the same as in August.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher on the week, with the S&amp;P 500 up about 1.1% as of Friday afternoon and up roughly 6.7% for the month of October. Both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 notched new highs in the past week. The widely watched 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.53% Friday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is an incredible level of complacency out there in this environment,\u201d Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; Other events the markets are monitoring include the gathering of world leaders at the G-20 in Italy and the United Nations climate summit COP26, beginning Sunday in Scotland.\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Wild week\u2019\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a wild week,\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s Michael Schumacher said. He noted that the Fed\u2019s action will dominate the week, and the jobs report will be secondary.\n*****\n&gt; Wells Fargo economists expect 390,000 jobs were added in October and average hourly earnings grew by 0.4%, he noted. Payrolls were up just 194,000 in September. Schumacher said inflation is the biggest concern in the markets, so the wage data will be most closely watched.\n*****\n&gt; Schumacher said the market is widely expecting the Fed to announce it will reduce its bond purchases by $15 billion a month, starting either in November or December. The central bank implemented its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program in early 2020, as it slashed rates and introduced programs to buy a range of assets to help keep the markets liquid.\n*****\n&gt; Now, as the program is being wound down, it is what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says about inflation that matters most because that will drive interest rate expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Yet, Powell is expected to stress that the Fed is not automatically going to raise interest rates once the bond purchases end in the middle of next year. Traders are pricing in as many as three interest rate hikes next year, but in the latest Fed forecast, only half of central bank officials agreed there should be even one.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe inflation commentary is a lot more important,\u201d Schumacher said. \u201cPowell has sounded concerned about expectations getting baked in.\u201d He noted that the 2-year yield, which most reflects the Fed, has risen more than 30 basis points since the last Fed meeting five weeks ago.\n*****\n&gt; Schumacher said market expectations for rate hikes may be overdone, and that he does not expect a move until the beginning of 2023. \u201cThe direction is right, but the speed is wrong,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Powell\u2019s comments will be closely watched for any adjustment in his thinking on inflation. The Fed had described the surge in rates as \u201ctransitory\u201d or temporary. The consumer price index has been running above 5%, and core CPI was at 4% in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe general feeling among central bankers and the major central banks is this inflation rate will come back down,\u201d TIAA Bank president of world markets Chris Gaffney said. \u201cNobody is using \u2018transitory\u2019 anymore, but they don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re going to have prolonged high inflation.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Gaffney said the weaker-than-expected 2% growth in third-quarter gross domestic product could help the Fed convince the markets that it intends to keep rates lower for longer.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs long as they stay accommodative, I think the recovery continues,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fairly bullish for the markets going forward. We\u2019ll certainly see a lot more choppiness, but I still think the global economy, the U.S. economy particularly, is right now a great environment for corporations. We\u2019re seeing fairly positive earnings reports, and more importantly expectations for future earnings.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There have been some high-profile misses, including both Apple and Amazon this past week. Both their stocks fell, weighing on the Nasdaq down Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings overall have been good, but there\u2019s still a lot of profit margin challenges out there,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cThere\u2019s no better example than Apple and Amazon.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kID8drk.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kpeo12w.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/mgqDnIk.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/feNGOpc.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GDzFNzM.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/r8J2LuB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qWy1mUR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kGexB3t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tBwoR2a.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TglfDZd.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2HOk4x5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vcv5Pne.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GgX6FOh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/PmzM56I.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/d5RZesR.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # November\u2019s First Trading Day: DJIA Up Over 1% Three Years in a Row\n\n&gt; Based upon data in the 2022 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac on page 90, the first trading day of November is the fourth best of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA point gained. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have all advanced 13 times over the last 21 years. Average performance on the day ranges from a low of 0.17% by S&amp;P 500 to 0.28% by NASDAQ over the 21-year time period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0362ad93159683f932d60b790bfa9ac8/e57961a120ac1354-3a/s500x750/517dc1575ee1212443153f2b842289d3b9eda639.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Here Comes One of the Best Days of the Year (and the Best Week and Month)\n\n&gt; The calendar is about to do a lot of favors for the bulls, as late October and early November historically are quite strong.\n\n&gt; October 28 was the best day of the year, until it fell more than 3% last year, but this day is still one of the strongest days historically for stocks. Not to be outdone though, October 29 and November 2 and 3 are also some of the better days of the year. \u201cI\u2019d like to think it has something to do with my birthday being on October 28, but the truth is bulls should be aware that the coming days are historically some of the best of the year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the single best day to buy at the close and hold for the next five trading days is today, October 27. Yes, these 5 days were lower last year by 0.6%, but you have to go back to the late 1960s to see the last time they were down two years in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, November has been quite strong historically. In fact, since 1950, and the past 10 years, it is the best month of the year, while it ranks second over the past 20 years and during a post-election year. \u201cNovember is the best month of the year, but it doesn\u2019t seem to get nearly as much love as you\u2019d think,\u201d added Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe all assume December is the best month, but November is actually better and gets very little fanfare. Maybe it should be a month for the bulls, not for turkeys.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Year\u2019s Best 3-Month Span About To Start\n\n&gt; November, December and January constitute the year\u2019s seasonally strongest 3-month period for the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and the NASDAQ Composite. This seasonal strength is created by a combination of the annual, semiannual and quarterly operations of institutions and the habitual behavior of retail investors and consumers.\n\n&gt; The November-January 3-month span has produced a gain of 4.3% for the S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA since 1949. October-December runs a close second at 4.1% for S&amp;P and 3.9% for DJIA. Since 1971 NASDAQ has gained a whopping 6.3% November-January with December-February in second at 5.0% and October-December in third at4.4%.\n\n&gt; These charts also highlight the Best and Worst Months of the year with the Best running from October/November to April/May/June and the Worst from May/June/July to September/October. Stocks have been firming up since we issued our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal to subscribers on October 8 and look poised for a solid yearend rally that continues into early 2022.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e010745ce0513ef26c01ad558f3324d0/5de97b698922b56d-fc/s500x750/77e7204b6cd2e2850a23200d70c176145dea1f34.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bd388d961bd47113bc428f68d2326639/5de97b698922b56d-6f/s500x750/f04c4e20d4d9d98fd0b02b7f8472b21dfd8fa543.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a218e808de4cf5062ba7fe2829c50222/5de97b698922b56d-58/s500x750/0adaf5599c04919e8fb8fca7e5a5129f414f0ccb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Short Term Breadth Takes Off\n\n&gt; One of the points noted about the recent moves for the S&amp;P 500 over the past few days have been on the outsized impacts of big gains or losses in names like Tesla (TSLA) or Facebook (FB). In spite of the impacts of those single names, the S&amp;P 500's return to record highs has happened on very strong breadth across sectors. Below, we show 10-day advance-decline line charts from our Sector Snapshot.\n\n&gt; The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average daily number of advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last ten trading days. It's a short-term breadth measure that traders use to measure how extended the market is at the moment. Very high readings suggest that the market might be overbought in the near term, and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low readings suggest the opposite -- that the market might be oversold in the near term, and upside mean reversion can be expected.\n\n&gt; For the broad S&amp;P 500, the 10-day AD line has hit the highest level since February 12th. Going back to 1990, the current reading stands in the 97th percentile. Looking at each sector, most lines are also in the upper decile of readings since 1990 and only two are not currently overbought: Communication Services and Consumer Staples. Meanwhile, some like Technology and Real Estate are a full two standard deviations above the historical norm. In fact, the Tech sector's line is the most elevated relative to its respective history of any sector with the current reading in the 98th percentile of all periods. The last time that the line was as elevated as now was in November of last year. No other sector has as long of a gap in time in which it has seen levels similar to the current reading. Most other sectors have seen higher readings as recently as August or September, though current levels are nonetheless elevated. The market has had quite the run over the last two weeks, and we'd expect some sort of cool-off period soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102621-AD-Lines.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # High Number of Record Highs\n\n&gt; Major US equity indices have returned to all-time highs in the second half of October with the S&amp;P 500 and Dow both hitting record levels today. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ Composite is roughly a quarter of one percent away and the closest to a new all-time high since the last one on September 7th. The Russell 2,000, on the other hand, is at the high end of the past several months' range, but it is still over 2% below its high from March 15th.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 having been at new highs over the past few days, it has made 57 new all-time highs year to date. As shown in the top-left chart below, there have only been three other years in the past that have seen more record highs during the full course of the year: 2017 (62), 1964 (67), and 1995 (78). For the other major indices, the pace of record highs is less impressive but still strong. The Dow has made 38 new highs in 2021 which is more than triple the historical average. This year is on pace to see the highest number of record highs for the index since 2017 when it tied 1991 for the record of 71 closes at an all-time high. The NASDAQ Composite has also seen a solid number of highs at 36 which is well above the historical average of 19 per year historically. Given the index has been rangebound essentially all year, the Russell 2,000, conversely, has only seen 13 closing record highs. That is the same number as last year and it is actually below the average of 20 per year historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102621-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steps Back\n\n&gt; The weekly sentiment survey from AAII saw a surge in optimism in recent weeks, but it took a step back this week even with the S&amp;P 500 at new highs. Bullish sentiment fell from a recent high of 46.9% down to 39.8% this week. Outside of last week, that is still the highest level since the first week of September.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bulls.png))**\n\n&gt; While bullish sentiment saw a significant 7.1 percentage point drop, a relatively small share of those losses turned to the bearish camp. Bearish sentiment only rose 1.6 percentage points to 29.4%. That is still below levels from two weeks ago and is in line with the average from throughout the summer.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bears.png))**\n\n&gt; The corresponding moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread to fall but bulls continue to outweigh bears by 10.4 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; As previously mentioned, the largest share of losses to bulls did not go to bears, but instead were picked up by those reporting neutral sentiment. That reading moved back above 30% this week gaining 5.3 percentage points. Again, that does not mark any sort of new high or low but instead brings sentiment back to similar levels seen only a month or two ago.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 29th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J1pI0oKgfc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.31.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULZcEQ_jrGQ))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 11th, 2021.\n\n# **Stock market on comeback trail heads into what\u2019s supposed to be another stellar earnings season - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/stock-market-on-comeback-trail-heads-into-whats-supposed-to-be-another-stellar-earnings-season-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks proved hard to keep down this week, and the start of the earnings season next week could further bolster the comeback if profits roll in as expected or better.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages notched a winning week after overcoming a debt ceiling debacle in Washington. Lawmakers passed a short-term deal that will extend the debt ceiling until December, kicking that overhang for the market down the road.\n*****\n&gt; This week\u2019s price action also overcame surging oil prices and a disappointing jobs report, with investors buying bank and energy shares.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn the face of Washington drama, delta worries, multiyear highs in crude oil, and a much weaker than expected jobs number, you have to be impressed by how stocks were able to bounce back this week,\u201d LPL Financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick said.\n*****\n&gt; https://i.imgur.com/Zh7JRt2.png\n*****\n&gt; A market pullback that began in September brought the S&amp;P 500 down more than 5% from its record at one point Monday, before stocks mounted a comeback. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 added back 0.8% and sits just 3.4% away from its record.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs stuck by its bullish year-end forecast earlier this week, predicting stocks would start to climb the wall of worries. And they did.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said in a note to clients that his year-end S&amp;P 500 price target for 2021 is still 4,700, which is nearly 7% above its current level.\n*****\n&gt; The firm said earnings growth, not valuation expansion, was the primary driver of the S&amp;P 500\u2032s 17% return year to date, adding that should still be the case.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings season begins\n&gt; The third-quarter earnings season \u2014 which kicks off next week with big bank earnings \u2014 is expected to be another strong series of reports, despite some worries about supply chain issues and higher costs. Third-quarter earnings are expected to have risen 27.6% year over year, according to FactSet. That would be the third-highest growth rate since 2010.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some record earnings seasons the past few quarters, so all eyes will be on if earnings can help justify stocks near all-time high levels,\u201d Detrick said. \u201cWe do expect another solid earnings season, but we\u2019ve seen some high profile warnings already, so corporate America could have a rather high bar to clear this quarter. Buckle up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bank earnings are the main focus next week with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs set to report.\n*****\n&gt; After a range-bound few months for bank stocks, analysts are looking ahead to catalysts that could fuel the next phase in their recovery. Wall Street expects loan growth, interest rates and reserve releases to play into the major banks\u2019 reports.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings for the third quarter quarter should again be strong and mostly outpace expectations,\u201d Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen said. \u201cHours worked in the third quarter rose by about 5% suggesting real GDP for the quarter may be close to 7%. With most companies reporting strong pricing power, solid real GDP growth should result in another surprisingly strong corporate earnings season.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen sees earnings season rewarding cyclicals, like banks, and small caps more than technology stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the stock market is already showing signs of a leadership shift away from slow economic growth favorites including growth, tech, and defensive toward more the economically sensitive areas of small caps and cyclical sectors,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; # Supply chain, higher cost warnings?\nWhile the earnings season should be strong, there are likely to be some warning signs about inflation and supply constraints that could scare the market about the year-end set-up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe risks of higher inflation, Fed tapering and what will likely be a choppy earnings season are still with us,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; There was some foreshadowing of this last week, when Bed Bath and Beyond shares cratered 25% after the company said it saw a steep drop-off in traffic in August. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond saw inflation costs escalating over the summer months, especially toward the end of its second quarter in August, which corroded profits.\n*****\n&gt; What investors know going into the third quarter \u2014 from company guidance \u2014 is that there could be haves and have nots this earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; FactSet data shows that 47 S&amp;P 500 companies have issued negative earnings guidance for the third quarter, and 56 companies have issued positive outlooks.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed headwind ahead?\n&gt; The headline jobs number Friday was a major disappointment, as the economy added just 194,000 jobs in September, well below the the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000. On the positive side, the unemployment rate fell to a much lower point than economists forecast. At 4.8%, that\u2019s the same level seen in late 2016.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s unclear if the number changes the calculus for when and how fast the Federal Reserve will slow its $120 billion-per-month bond-buying program.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view these figures are good enough, and when combined with the debt-ceiling can being kicked down the road, likely solidifies November as \u2018go time\u2019 for tapering,\u201d Wells Fargo Securities senior equity analyst Christopher Harvey said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe continue to expect a choppy equity market rally and a two-to-four-week tech bounce, but the bounce probably peters out next month when the Fed says those magical words: We will begin to taper,\u201d he added.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WuOc7cb.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnJ6ZF2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CojntqX.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mxZnyBJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eZbwxOb.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JPCsx2m.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kyfY7Xn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zEMv32q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uaj9G7t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VAaeJ4E.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fgsZNEH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/W5HmLSK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/DDVPGco.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2021\n\n&gt; The fourth quarter is now off to the races and we thought it worthwhile to check in on the best and worst-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks on a year-to-date basis. As shown below, there are currently six members of the index that have rallied over 100% this year. Apt for the year that its vaccine has rolled out, the biggest gainer of these has been Moderna (MRNA) with a 196.12% rally. It now has a market cap of $124.87 billion versus a market cap of only $41 billion at the start of the year. Of the 20 best performers, MRNA is also the only one with a market cap above $100 billion. The next largest is ConocoPhillips (COP) with a $95.76 billion market cap. COP is one of multiple Energy stocks on this list as well. Of the top 20 performers, Energy sector names dominate the list with 8 members.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Pivoting to the other end of the spectrum, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is down the most this year having been cut by 36.18%. IPG Photonics (IPGP), Lamb Weston Holdings (LW), Viatris (VTRS), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Global Payments (GPN) also have fallen by at least 25%. Once again, there is only one member of this list with a market cap above $100 billion: Qualcomm (QCOM). One other interesting factor to note of the worst performers is there are several stocks that were at some point plays on pandemic trends, whether those be reopening or stay at home. For example, in addition to LVS, another gaming/reopening name, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), ranks as the eighth-worst performer YTD. Additionally, strong performers during the onset of the pandemic like Clorox (CLX), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) are all down double digits this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Intraday Commodity Spikes\n\n&gt; Since the late spring, both silver and gold have been in steady downtrends spending much of that time below their 50-DMAs. Those downtrends remain in place, but both metals did find a short-term bottom on September 29th. While they have been rallying in the past week and a half, today each one has stalled out. From the early morning leading up to the Nonfarm Payrolls report, precious metals ramped higher with a surge immediately following the weaker than expected report. Only a couple hours after the release, gold and silver had erased a large portion of their earlier gains. In fact, silver is now 2.15% below its intraday high and gold is 1.36% below its high. For gold, in particular, that intraday reversal also marked a rejection of its 50-DMA which it\u2014as well as silver\u2014has struggled to stay above for most of the past several months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-GC-SI.png))**\n\n&gt; Crude oil is yet another commodity that is currently down off of its intraday highs, and like gold, the reversal came at a pretty interesting level. At its high Friday morning, front-month WTI futures rose above $80 for the first time since November 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL.png))**\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Job Market Continues To Frustrate In September\n\n&gt; The September payroll report likely created more questions than it answered.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its September employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added a disappointing 194,000 jobs during the month, falling well short of Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 median forecast for a gain of 500,000. This comes on the heels of a lukewarm August report, which did receive an upward revision of 131,000. Somewhat contradictory, the unemployment rate fell more than forecast to 4.8% in September, beating expectations, though that was paired with a reduced labor force participation rate of 61.6% when expectations called for an increase.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe observation window for this report likely came too soon for positive catalysts to really gain traction,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLeisure and hospitality jobs, a proxy for economic reopening, were only marginally higher. We take this to mean Delta\u2019s waning impact will likely be more evident in October\u2019s report where we expect to see reopening momentum reassert itself.\u201d\n\n&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, in-person segments of the labor market such as leisure and hospitality jobs grew steadily during the first half of the year when COVID-19 remained under relative control. However, the latest flare-up has dampened that trend. We expect to see renewed growth in this sector as the delta variant continues to abate.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.8.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As mentioned, definitive takeaways from this report are difficult to come by due to the offsetting nature of the report. On the one hand, headline numbers came in very weak, but private payrolls, as well as manufacturing payrolls, fared better. The unemployment rate experienced a significant drop, but interpreting that number becomes muddied when considering the fact that we are already experiencing a significant worker shortage and the participation rate is declining, not increasing, as we would hope to see in a true recovery.\n\n&gt; What is more, because the observation window for the report cuts off mid-month, we cannot yet draw conclusions about the impact of school reopening and the lapsing of enhanced unemployment benefits\u2014hotly debated crosscurrents\u2014plus the aforementioned waning delta impact. Regarding the inflation debate\u2014average hourly earnings rose 0.6% month over month and 4.6% year over year. And while wages are undeniably growing and helping to fuel inflation, the data are not mix-adjusted and therefore are inflated due to the suppressed growth in the in-person, lower-wage segment of the labor market.\n\n&gt; The biggest question, though, is what this means for the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) asset tapering plans. The market had all but expected the Fed to announce a tapering timeline at its next meeting coming into this report, with the caveat that Fed Chair Jerome Powell needed only to see a \u201creasonably good\u201d job report first. Whether September\u2019s surprise report has cleared that low bar or not now becomes an open question, one which the market had all but dismissed as a formality previously.\n\n&gt; Indeed, in the aftermath of the report\u2019s release Treasury markets immediately began pricing in a possible delay to any taper, and equity markets gyrated between positive and negative territory as they struggled to process whether bad news should actually be considered good news in this context. We will have to see in the coming weeks whether this report will be substantial enough to bring on the much-anticipated taper announcement, but one thing is for sure\u2014there are no gimmies in this labor market recovery.\n*****\n\n&gt; # Columbus Day Performance\n\n&gt; Columbus Day is an interesting trading day for financial markets as it is one of the few trading days of the year when the equity market is open, but the bond market is closed. This may lead investors to think that equity markets should perform positively, as investors do not have credit markets to allocate capital to on that specific day. However, looking at the S&amp;P 500's historical performance on Columbus Day over the last 25 years doesn't necessarily show a real positive bias. Columbus Day tends to act just like any other trading day. Over the last 25 years, median performance on Columbus Day has been a gain of 10 basis points (bps) with positive returns 55.6% of the time. While that's slightly higher than the median one-day gain of 7 bps for all trading days over the last 25 years, the difference isn't significant. That's not to say that Columbus Day hasn't seen some outliers, though. Who can forget in 2008, during the middle of the Financial Crisis, when the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 11% on Columbus Day!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Day-of.png))**\n\n&gt; For the week of Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500's median gain has been 0.31% with positive returns 63% of the time which also isn't extraordinary relative to average weekly returns for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years. The worst Columbus Day weeks were in 1999 (-6.63%) and 2018 (-4.10%) while the best were in 1998 (+7.32%), 2002 (5.87%), and 2011 (+5.98%). Interestingly enough, in 2008, even after rallying over 11% on Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500 finished the week up just 4.60% as it erased more than half of its gains from the holiday session.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Week-of.png))**\n\n&gt; The table below lists the S&amp;P 500's performance leading up to and after Columbus Day for each of the last 25 years. With a decline of over 2.5% since the start of September, this year ranks as the weakest performance for the equity market since 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Columbus-Day-Table-100821.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Most Important Chart In The World\n\n&gt; And just like that, the calendar turned to October and volatility picked up in a big way, with three consecutive 1% moves for the S&amp;P 500 Index to start the month. As we noted in our October preview, this month gets a bad rap for being a bearish month (it isn\u2019t), but it absolutely owns the title as the most volatile month.\n\n&gt; t took nearly a full year, but the S&amp;P 500 finally had its first 5% pullback of 2021, thus ending hopes of 2021 joining 1954, 1958, 1964, 1993, 1995, and 2017 as the only years to go a full calendar year without a 5% move lower.\n\n&gt; \u201cVolatility is the price of admission,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cSure, we\u2019d all prefer stocks go straight up forever, but that isn\u2019t reality. Investors must learn to embrace and accept the eventual scares and bouts of volatility that are common even in the strongest bull markets.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, stocks experience a 14.2% peak-to-trough pullback on average during the year, putting the recent 5% pullback in perspective. In fact, 21 out of the past 41 years saw at least a 10% correction. Incredibly, 12 of those years finished in the green and those 12 years gained an average of 17.0%. Who could forget last year\u2019s 34% bear market and move back to up 16% by the end of the year? In other words, big pullbacks can happen even in years that see outsized gains, which is why this chart is so important for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The last new all-time high for the S&amp;P 500 was on September 2, but as of the end of September there were still 54 new all-time highs in 2021, the second most ever with one quarter to go. The good news? Previous years that saw a lot new highs the first three quarters usually had strong performance the final quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking things a step further, this year the S&amp;P 500 produced one of its best ever year-to-date gains through September, up 14.7% with a quarter to go. It turns out that good starts to a year tend to resolve higher. In fact, 9 of the past 10 years the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 12.5% with a quarter to go there were further gains in the fourth quarter. As you can see below, the returns are greatly skewed due to 1987, but the median return in the final quarter of the year is an impressive 5.2% (versus the average fourth quarter return of 4.0%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Performance Through Q3 And its Impact on Q4 Performance\n\n&gt; Every year, the makeup and number of sectors that outperform the S&amp;P 500 changes. This year, four sectors (Energy, Financials, Real Estate, and Communication Services) outperformed the S&amp;P 500 through the end of Q3, while last year it was only three sectors that outperformed in the first three quarters of the year (Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services).\n\n&gt; As we all know, past performance does not indicate future performance, and in looking at sectors that have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of prior years compared to how they performed in Q4, the same holds true. The table below lists the number of sectors that outperformed and underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of each year since 2000 and then shows their median performance during Q4 of the same year. Looking at a summary of the annual results, it's almost a coinflip as to whether or not the leading sectors in the first three quarters of a given year will continue to outperform in Q4. On average, the sectors that outperform YTD through 9/30 have averaged a Q4 gain of 3.58% (median: +6.40%) with positive returns 76% of the time. Sectors that lag the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of the year average a rest of year gain of 3.67% (median: 5.95%) with gains 71% of the time. While the term 'strength begets strength' has historically been applicable to the broader market, at the sector level, buying the YTD winners (or losers) ahead of Q4 in expectation of continued momentum to close out the year (or a mean reversion bounce) hasn't offered any material outperformance.\n\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Snap227.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical October Trading: Volatile Start Sets Up Rally through Month\u2019s End\n\n&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the full month of October has been a solid month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all recorded gains ranging from 0.6% by Russell 2000 to 1.9% by NASDAQ. But these gains have come with volatile trading, most notably during the early days of the month. October has opened softly with mild gains on its first trading day by DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000. On the second day, all five indexes have been weak followed by a rebound on the third trading day before additional weakness pulls the market lower through the seventh trading day. At which point, the market has historically found support and began to rally through mid-month and beyond.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/070f50fc0225a24692163a37694f0425/da1ccfd284e5df51-2c/s500x750/009fdcd32ca89da61f3a47401e5e5eaf71f34f50.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 8th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwLj9O1yEmE))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.10.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 2021!](https://i.imgur.com/xrMCop9.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.11.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.11.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cF0CbQE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.12.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D4dB9sd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.12.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jDBI2Dv.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.13.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qVRtzZv.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.13.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/V7gDj4f.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.14.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hZ42eSL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.14.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HNdhjgf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.15.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I2ihrfy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.15.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/smallstreetbets. :)",

        "selftext": "Putting AI on the edge (and the end-points) is imminent\n\n [Why The MLPerf Benchmark Is Good For AI, And Good For You (nextplatform.com)](https://www.nextplatform.com/2021/08/10/why-the-mlperf-benchmark-is-good-for-ai-and-good-for-you/) \n\n MLPerf was created only three and a half years ago by researchers and engineers from Baidu, Google, Harvard University, Stanford University, and the University of California Berkeley and it is now administered by the MLCommons consortium, formed in December 2020. Very quickly, it has become a key suite of tests that hardware and software vendors use to demonstrate the performance of their AI systems and that end user customers depend on to help them make architectural choices for their AI systems.\n\n  The MLPerf benchmark suite will create a virtuous cycle, driving hardware and software engineers to co-design their systems for the many different types of AI algorithms that are used for image recognition, recommendation engines, and such.\n\n The explosion of Artificial Intelligence is ushering a new era for semiconductor manufacturers, bringing newer opportunities and challenges. While AI tasks have traditionally been handled in mega data centers and server-grade platforms, there is a gradual shift towards edge computing. Applications such as autonomous driving, where a moment\u2019s delay in decision making could be fatal, are paving way for AI on the edge. Access control applications, where the privacy of data is pivotal, rely on edge processing rather than cloud-based processing. \n\n [Edge AI hardware: How chipmakers are redefining architectures and accelerating market adoption - PathPartnerTech](https://www.pathpartnertech.com/blog/2020/06/18/edge-ai-hardware-how-chipmakers-are-redefining-architectures-and-accelerating-market-adoption/) \n\n What is really driving this growth?\n\n1. **Need for reliable real-time performance**: A lot of applications require AI on the devices due to the reliability and latency constraints of remote computing. Imagine an autonomous car unable to make a decision due to a lack of connectivity to the remote servers. This could be fatal. A medical robot, that is expected to help patients, receiving the command a tad bit late on how to assist a patient in a life-threatening situation.\n2. **Concerns over data security**: Applications, where data privacy and security are of utmost importance, depend on processing on the edge to avoid any misuse of information during transmission or otherwise. For example, access control systems in high-security enterprises may not want to store the data on public cloud networks. An edge installation would be very much needed.\n3. **Cost of data transmission**: Cost is another factor. Applications that need to process huge amounts of data regularly would incur skyrocketing costs for network transmission. Processing on the edge could potentially minimize those costs\n4. **Innovations in silicon technology**: Finally, innovations in silicon technology have paved the way for specialized AI hardware that is physically smaller, consumers low power, generates less heat, and delivers the horsepower needed for the most intensive algorithms.\n\n All of the above factors combined have given the impetus to the semiconductor industry to adopt a new phase of growth \u2013 through the growth of AI chipsets and associated software. \n\n Typically ML and AI solutions work in two phases \u2013 a training phase where the neural networks are trained to assign ideal weights to the variables and an inference phase where the neural networks use the models and weights to arrive at the output. \n\n However, AI at the edge has a more stringent set of requirements. Processing power, processing speed, speed/quantum of memory access, power consumption, physical size, and the cost: these have become way more prominent. \u201cPerformance per watt\u201d is a trending term in AI circles that has become one of the key benchmarking criteria for AI hardware. \n\n One of the most definitive ways of proving hardware performance is by performing benchmarking tests using standard networks and datasets. For example, MLPerf framework has become one of the most sought-after benchmarks in the AI industry.  \n\n Qualcomm, perhaps best known for its leadership Snapdragon mobile platform, has further enhanced its AI bona fides with V1.1 MLPerf inference benchmark suite released in September. \n\n [A Deeper Look Into Qualcomm\u2019s MLPerf Results (forbes.com)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlfreund/2021/10/05/a-deeper-look-into-qualcomms-mlperf-results/?sh=6fa1a3395ca3) \n\n Qualcomm was able to deliver the highest data center inference performance for image processing, the highest performance per watt across the board and the fastest edge performance. Realizing up to 34% improvement in software performance since the last MLPerf V1.0 release \n\n Qualcomm delivered the highest performance efficiency of all entrants in all models and platforms. In addition, a Gigabyte server with 16 Cloud AI100 cards delivered the highest inference performance of all submissions, beating an Inspur and NVIDIA DGX server with 8 A100 GPUs each. \n\n The Cloud AI 100 consumes only 15-75 watts, compared to 300-500 watts of power consumed by each GPU. So, on a chip-to-chip basis, the Qualcomm AI 100 delivers 50% of the performance at only 15% of the power. \n\n While power efficiency in the data center is important, it is vitally so on the edge and edge server configurations, and here the Qualcomm technology has no peer. Looking at the AEDK DM.2e development platform (using a 15-watt version of the Cloud AI100), computing applications realize a full four times better power efficiency for edge devices, and twice the efficiency in edge cloud server applications tested.\n\n  Qualcomm is also delivering the lowest latency at the lowest power, critical for many computer vision applications such as autonomous guidance, on-premise safety and security applications that demand the lowest response time to be able to react to rapidly changing scenes. \n\nNvidia benchmark test results were also impressive.\n\n [MLPerf AI Benchmarks | NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/mlperf/) \n\n  The complexity of AI demands a tight integration between all aspects of the platform. As demonstrated in MLPerf's benchmarks, the NVIDIA AI platform delivers leadership performance with the world's most advanced GPU, powerful and scalable interconnect technologies, and cutting-edge software\u2014an end-to-end solution that can be deployed in the data center, in the cloud, or at the edge with\u00a0amazing results. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Computer vision and imaging are at the core of AI research, driving scientific discovery and readily representing core components of medical care.

        "selftext": "I entered a large long position on October 20, 2019, based on momentum and NOK\u2019s growing 5G market share. In February of 2021, I furnished a little DD of $NOK with a one-year to 18-month, price target of $14 (possibly with an OTT exuberance at that time). Digging deeper into Nokia, it continues to be one of the most interesting stocks on the market. (Being an Autistic Silverback looking to buy more crayons to eat, since my wife is too busy with her boyfriend and has no time to make me dinner, I bought in with another large long position in April of 2021 \\[Previously posted on the $NOK subs\\]).\n\nThere is a lot to look into. . . \"Nokia Bell Labs (formerly named **Bell Labs Innovations** \\- 1996\u20132007) is an American industrial research and scientific development company now owned by the Finnish company Nokia $NOK which itself was established in 1865. Nokia Bell Labs\u2019 headquarters is located in Murray Hill, New Jersey, the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world.\" \n\n\u00b7 9 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories, as well as 4 Turing Awards.\n\n\u00b7 The C Programming Language, as well as Unix was developed at Bell.\n\nWith the 5G/6G arms race heating up, it is time for the 100-year-old Nokia Bell Labs think-tank and 155-year-old $NOK, to be leveraged once more.\n\nSpeculation:\n\n\u00b7 The outstanding shares of $NOK is 5.6B ... while, with a large float and a high percentage of short interest and public participation even $NOK can be manipulated.\n\n\u00b7 However, with $NOK short interest has been dropping, from nearly $300M in January to $150M in July 2021, and this month $171M. Accumulation of Institutional Ownership has ranged from about 4.0% in Q4 2020 to 6.44% in Q2 2021, to the present 8.07%. The Institutional Ownership has increased because of the analyst upgrades and the added possibility of dividends being reinstated. \n\n\u00b7 Today, because of the B of A analyst downgrade to Underperform, $NOK dipped 3%, however, the upside is this created a bargain to buy $NOK on this dip. There is such a great growing market for 5G that the current B of A outlier analysis regarding competition is off base. \n\n\u00b7 On October 28, 2021 $NOK is headed for its 3rd Earning Beat in a row, and the B of A outlier analysis has created a great buying opportunity. \n\n\"Have you ever wondered how you can enter the world of IoT or meet the increased requirements of the emerging 5G use cases? Are you in need of tools to seize the opportunities of 5G? Would you prefer to win new revenue with low risk and minimal investment, instead of spending CAPEX and time building an IoT network and developing new services?\u201d\n\n\u201cWelcome to Nokia WING, a managed service that offers operators the ability to support their enterprise customers with global IoT connectivity across borders and technologies. It is live today with a truly global footprint but also prepared for the challenges of tomorrow \u2013 no matter what directions it is taking. There is nothing else like WING on the market.\" - Nokia website\n\n\u00b7 At the start of new bubbles, CapEx (Capital Expenditure) for juniors get filled very quickly. If we make a comparison to precious metals miners... this company is a first wave major, not a second wave junior. i.e. in the early stages CapEx is high, and that is why in October of 2019 $NOK suspended dividends to reserve cash for increased spending in RD. Since, 2019 $NOK has made major expenditures in RD and to date over 130 billion Euro.\n\n\u00b7 In November of 2020, Nokia , Elisa and Qualcomm together have achieved the fastest 5G speeds recorded in the world. However, in March of 2021 Nokia achieved a new record of over 4.5 Gbps speed for the first time during a trial on live commercial equipment.\n\n**5G Market:**\n\n5G Applications and Services Market value expected: USD 132B in 2020, to 663B in 2027: The global 5G Applications and Services Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR ) of \u201c25.8% from 2020 to 2027\" (According to Digital Journal July 14, 2021 Article)\n\nA 25.8% CAGR sounds good to me...\n\nVerticals:\n\n\u00b7 Manufacturing\n\n\u00b7 Energy &amp; Utility\n\n\u00b7 Media &amp; Entertainment\n\n\u00b7 IT &amp; Telecom\n\n\u00b7 Transportation &amp; Logistics\n\n\u00b7 Healthcare\n\n\u00b7 Retail\n\n\u00b7 Agriculture\n\n\u00b7 O&amp;G and Mining\n\n\u00b7 BFSI\n\n\u00b7 Construction\n\n\u00b7 Real Estate\n\n$NOK is listed in the Article among the 5G Industry Major Market Players.\n\n$NOK offers a service that has unlimited applications... My favorite type of technology!\n\n\u00b7 According to Statista \u201cThe global market for Internet of things ( IoT ) end-user solutions is expected to grow to 212 billion U.S. dollars in size by the end of 2019. The technology reached 100 billion dollars in market revenue for the first time in 2017, and forecasts suggest that this figure will grow to around 1.6 trillion by 2025.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 5G/6G is the LIFEBLOOD of IoT .\n\n\u00b7 \"5G is much more than just fast downloads; its unique combination of high-speed connectivity, very low latency, and ubiquitous coverage will support smart vehicles and transport infrastructure such as connected cars, trucks, and buses, where a split-second delay could mean the difference between a smooth flow of traffic and a 4-way crash at an intersection.\"\n\n\u00b7 What is the number 1 problem that EV manufactures wish to solve right now? Completely independent self-driving. 5G/6G is part of the solution! Why is Elon Musk focusing on Starlink now? It is the solution for Tesla's biggest roadblock. Don\u2019t forget, the June 29, 2021 article about Musk and Starlink began \u201cDon Joyce, a **Nokia** manager working from home at a remote lake cottage in Canada, recently abandoned his painfully slow phone-line internet in favor of satellite broadband service Starlink, offered by Elon Musk's SpaceX.\u201d Moreover, Musk said \u201che was talking to possible partners as a number of countries require operators to provide rural coverage as conditions of their 5G licenses.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 5G infrastructures are the neurons for IoT!\n\n\u00b7 5G is huge. It is of UTMOST importance. Why would the US go to such lengths to cripple China's Huawei for YEARS? Huawei seems to be their number 1 target!\n\n**Market Share:**\n\n$NOK is targeting a 4G and 5G market share **between 25% to 27%** and on July 16, 2021 ERIC tanked over 11%, due to retaliation for Sweden\u2019s China ban, ERIC had a 28% market share in China, and due to the retaliation, ERIC lost 60% of its market share in China, amounting to $300M. $NOK has no fear of retaliation and only what to gain, particularly since China needs $NOK for its cloud services.  \n\n**$NOK 5G Contracts in last year have more than Doubled since last year:**\n\nMoreover, $NOK\u2019s contracts are growing by leaps and bounds. On October 5, 2020 $NOK had secured 100 5G Contracts, in July, $NOK\u2019s contracts and market share are way up, 170 Commercial 5G Deals, 67 5G Live Operator Networks, 230 Commercial 5G Agreements. Now, **189** Commercial 5G Deals, **72** 5G Live Operator Networks, **240+** Commercial 5G Agreements\n\n**$NOK is the leader in SEP\u2019s:**\n\nThe argument is that SEP ownership... materially, affects which patents actually matter, and as of **April 28, 2021**, and independent study by PA Consulting firms confined that Nokia owns over 3,500 patent families declared essential to 5G. As such, $NOK is now the leader in SEP\u2019s. \u201cNokia\u2019s industry-leading patent portfolio is built on more than \u20ac130 billion invested in R&amp;D since 2000 and is composed of around 20,000 patent families, including over 3,500 patent families declared essential to 5G.\u201d\n\n$NOK President and CEO Pekka Lundmark has been leading $NOK since August 1, 2021,he has been steady, understated and rather than exaggerate $NOK\u2019s position he has delivered earnings beat for Q1 FY21, Q2 FY21 and is expected to do the same on October 28, 2021 for Q3 FY21. He has avoided money pits and has helped $NOK grab market share and profitable 5G contracts. \n\nCompare $NOK to Ericsson through March 21, 2021 and Market Cap and contracts to date:\n\nClearly, $NOK and Ericsson are converging, $NOK is gaining market share, has more 5G contracts, SEP\u2019s, cash surplus and Ericson investors are jumping over to $NOK. Don\u2019t forget Ericsson settled with $NOK regarding patent litigation and has to pay $NOK damages. Ericsson said the settlement followed investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) into corruption, including the bribing of government officials. Ericsson settled with the DOJ in 2019 and agreed to pay over $1 billion in penalties.\n\n$NOK is successful in its Patent Litigation.\n\nOn April of 2021, after $NOK received several favorable rulings Nokia and Lenovo settled a patent dispute, in May of 2021 Ericson settled with $NOK and agreed to pay $NOK 97M Euro, in June of 2021 Daimler agreed to pay Nokia for using its patents and Nokia will license mobile telecommunications technology to Daimler, in July $NOK launched patent lawsuits against OnePlus Technology, throughout Europe and Asia.  \n\n**$NOK upgraded by analysts across the board:**\n\n\u00b7 On July 5, 2021, Exane BNP Paribas analyst Stefan Slowinski upgraded $NOK to Outperform from Neutral with a **$7.70** price target.\n\n\u00b7 On July 15, 2021, Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Duval upgraded $NOK from neutral to buy and raised his price target from $4.90 to **$6.50**.\n\n\u00b7 On July 14, 2021, JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande, upgrading Nokia to Overweight, and a **$7.80** price target. That's 32% upside from the previous day\u2019s close of $5.88.\n\n\u00b7 Part of the analyst upgrade is because in Q2 FY21 $NOK updated its financial guidance for full year 2021. In the second quarter Nokia saw continued strength in the business, improving its expectations for the full year. Nokia revised its outlook for full year 2021 guidance on Q2 FY21.\n\n**A quick calculation of Value metrics from February 2021 to October 25, 2021:**\n\n\u00b7 Current Mcap: As of February, 23.35B, as of July 2021, 32.4B and today 33B even with the interim dip.\n\n\u00b7 In February $NOK had a 16% market share, today $NOK has over a 25% -27% market share, and using that figure (which will probably grow) 25% of 663B in 2027... market size refers to the maximum total number of sales or customers your business can see, often measured over the course of a year.\n\n\u00b7 663B x 0.25 = 165B Revenue, assuming Revenue = Sales for now, 165B/5B shares = 33 SPS. Assuming P/S Ratio of 1, Market Value per Share = $33.00 USD by 2027.\n\n\u00b7 Current price = $5.70, 33/5.7 = 5.80, so a 580% gain in 6 years based on a P/S Ratio of 1.00 (NOK\u2019s current P/S ratio is about 1.25).\n\nI**nstitutional Behavior:**\n\n\u00b7 Pursuant to Nasdaq, (Fintel\u2019s figures are double) which is conservative, in February $NOK had 442 institutional investors, at 4% ownership, and rising... in July 2021, $NOK had Institutional Holders, holding 6.44% an over 50% increase from February. Now in October, **8.10**% **a 100% increase from February**. Also, Nokia has a very high chance of reinstating dividends in 2022, and owning now would lower the cost basis. \n\n\u00b7 Institutional investors including mutual funds (now that $NOK has passed the $5 threshold) are increasing buys of Nokia, and are also anticipating the possibility of reinstated dividends. The mid-point for dividends of tech stocks is 4.75% however, if an investor bust NOK at $5.7 and the price is $11.50 by 2022 and Nokia is paying dividends of 4.75% than that investor is earning 54.6 cents per share, equaling a return of 9.5% on that investors cost basis of $5.7 per share.  \n\n**Active Positions**\n\n**ACTIVE POSITIONS**\n\n**HOLDERS**\n\n**SHARES**\n\nIncreased Positions\n\n228\n\n161,325,793\n\nDecreased Positions\n\n212\n\n78,855,976\n\nHeld Positions\n\n134\n\n219,319,630\n\nTotal Institutional Shares\n\n574\n\n459,501,399\n\n**New and Sold Out Positions**\n\n**ACTIVE POSITIONS**\n\n**HOLDERS**\n\n**SHARES**\n\nNew Positions\n\n69\n\n72,161,909\n\nSold Out Positions\n\n68\n\n6,080,400\n\n**Some - Highlights of $NOK 5G Contract Gains:**\n\n\u00b7 Nokia teamed up with Telecom Armenia to launch gigabit broadband services over a passive optical network (PON). Telecom Armenia will deploy Nokia\u2019s GPON and XGS-PON fiber equipment along with its Wi-Fi Beacons and Altiplano management platform. TPG Telecom selected Nokia to deploy a live 5G standalone (SA) network on the 700MHz spectrum band in Australia. The network will enable TPG Telecom to provide wide outdoor 5G services and deep indoor 5G coverage in urban and suburban areas on the back of equipment from Nokia\u2019s ReefShark-powered AirScale product portfolio.\n\nThe Finland-based telco equipment vendor provided Red Electrica de Espana, a Spain-based electricity transmission system operator, with an IP/MPLS network and Dense Wave Division Multiplexing optical transport network. Nokia also inked a multi-year subscription contract with a leading supplier of robot-based automation solutions \u2014 KUKA \u2014 to install its avant-garde 5G SA private wireless networking in the latter\u2019s Smart Production and Development Center in Augsburg, Germany. The incorporation of the 5G technology in KUKA\u2019s intelligent robotics and automation solutions will empower automation manufacturers to leverage the same in modern industrial applications.\n\nNokia expanded its relationship with channel partner and service integrator Xantaro to deliver Wi-Fi 6 and mesh Wi-Fi coverage inside buildings. Under this project, the companies will connect more than 2 million homes across the U.K. with a broadband speed of up to 10 gigabit per second. Nokia also joined forces with Export Development Canada to tap into probable investment opportunities across the globe for 5G deployment and network infrastructure upgrades.\n\nDuring the quarter-to-be-reported, Nokia partnered with the City of Melbourne to conduct a pilot run using Nokia Scene Analytics artificial intelligence technology to tackle the issue of waste dumping more efficiently and keep laneways safe and clean. Nokia inked a deal with A1 Telekom Austria Group to expand the carrier\u2019s 5G services across Bulgaria, Serbia, and Slovenia while strengthening its presence in the domestic market. The multi-country deal with the **America Movil, S.A.B. de C.V.** AMX unit seeks to offer commercial 5G and premium digital services in the near future.\n\nNokia secured a deal with Union Wireless to replace its RAN equipment with its avant-garde AirScale 4G/5G radio portfolio. The partnership is part of Union Wireless\u2019 \u201cRip and Replace\u201d initiative. Union Wireless will initially deploy 4G service that can further be upgraded to 5G for an enhanced subscriber experience while complying with the Secure and Trusted Telecommunications Act. Nokia\u2019s AirScale 4G/5G radios will be installed across Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, and Utah. Moreover, Nokia extended its partnership with **United States Cellular Corporation** USM for the deployment of 5G SA core network. The deployment initiative enabled the telco to capitalize on Nokia\u2019s diverse portfolio of hardware, software, and services for the proper functioning of the 5G SA core network.\n\nNokia joined forces with Telekom Slovenije to power its FTTH network with the deployment of avant-garde broadband equipment. This will bring 10Gb/s fiber to Slovenia, and is scheduled to commence this year. Further, Nokia launched a charging configurator microservice for its existing Nokia Converged Charging (NCC) monetization solution. NCC is specifically designed for the 5G economy and provides real-time charging capabilities that enable communications service providers to monetize new revenue opportunities and offer a better experience to their customers. With more than 240 commercial 5G agreements, Nokia currently has 72 live 5G networks, thereby marking a significant feat in the highly competitive market.\n\nCoveted deals with a comprehensive list of leading entities like Lightspeed Broadband, Africell, Openreach, Taiwan Star Telecom, Vodafone, Empire Access, Taiwan Mobile, United Group, Vocus, Indosat Mega Media, Asiacell, NorthC, Infradata, MTN, NL-ix, Uniti Group, African Telecommunications Union, Spark, AngloGold Ashanti Colombia and Indosat Ooredoo are likely to have positioned Nokia for the ongoing technology cycle, given the strength of its end-to-end portfolio. These developments are likely to have had a positive impact on its third-quarter performance despite challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nI always look for the big players, and what they are doing with their money. Words are cheap. Follow the money.\n\nTo be an investor in such conditions, one must have the strongest of conviction. One must do their own DD... Conviction cannot be outsourced.\n\nStrategy:\n\n\u00b7 PT for 2022: 14.00\n\n\u00b7 PT for 2027: 33.00",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 11th, 2021.\n\n# **Stock market on comeback trail heads into what\u2019s supposed to be another stellar earnings season - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/stock-market-on-comeback-trail-heads-into-whats-supposed-to-be-another-stellar-earnings-season-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks proved hard to keep down this week, and the start of the earnings season next week could further bolster the comeback if profits roll in as expected or better.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages notched a winning week after overcoming a debt ceiling debacle in Washington. Lawmakers passed a short-term deal that will extend the debt ceiling until December, kicking that overhang for the market down the road.\n*****\n&gt; This week\u2019s price action also overcame surging oil prices and a disappointing jobs report, with investors buying bank and energy shares.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn the face of Washington drama, delta worries, multiyear highs in crude oil, and a much weaker than expected jobs number, you have to be impressed by how stocks were able to bounce back this week,\u201d LPL Financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick said.\n*****\n&gt; https://i.imgur.com/Zh7JRt2.png\n*****\n&gt; A market pullback that began in September brought the S&amp;P 500 down more than 5% from its record at one point Monday, before stocks mounted a comeback. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 added back 0.8% and sits just 3.4% away from its record.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs stuck by its bullish year-end forecast earlier this week, predicting stocks would start to climb the wall of worries. And they did.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said in a note to clients that his year-end S&amp;P 500 price target for 2021 is still 4,700, which is nearly 7% above its current level.\n*****\n&gt; The firm said earnings growth, not valuation expansion, was the primary driver of the S&amp;P 500\u2032s 17% return year to date, adding that should still be the case.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings season begins\n&gt; The third-quarter earnings season \u2014 which kicks off next week with big bank earnings \u2014 is expected to be another strong series of reports, despite some worries about supply chain issues and higher costs. Third-quarter earnings are expected to have risen 27.6% year over year, according to FactSet. That would be the third-highest growth rate since 2010.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some record earnings seasons the past few quarters, so all eyes will be on if earnings can help justify stocks near all-time high levels,\u201d Detrick said. \u201cWe do expect another solid earnings season, but we\u2019ve seen some high profile warnings already, so corporate America could have a rather high bar to clear this quarter. Buckle up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bank earnings are the main focus next week with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs set to report.\n*****\n&gt; After a range-bound few months for bank stocks, analysts are looking ahead to catalysts that could fuel the next phase in their recovery. Wall Street expects loan growth, interest rates and reserve releases to play into the major banks\u2019 reports.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings for the third quarter quarter should again be strong and mostly outpace expectations,\u201d Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen said. \u201cHours worked in the third quarter rose by about 5% suggesting real GDP for the quarter may be close to 7%. With most companies reporting strong pricing power, solid real GDP growth should result in another surprisingly strong corporate earnings season.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen sees earnings season rewarding cyclicals, like banks, and small caps more than technology stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the stock market is already showing signs of a leadership shift away from slow economic growth favorites including growth, tech, and defensive toward more the economically sensitive areas of small caps and cyclical sectors,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; # Supply chain, higher cost warnings?\nWhile the earnings season should be strong, there are likely to be some warning signs about inflation and supply constraints that could scare the market about the year-end set-up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe risks of higher inflation, Fed tapering and what will likely be a choppy earnings season are still with us,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; There was some foreshadowing of this last week, when Bed Bath and Beyond shares cratered 25% after the company said it saw a steep drop-off in traffic in August. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond saw inflation costs escalating over the summer months, especially toward the end of its second quarter in August, which corroded profits.\n*****\n&gt; What investors know going into the third quarter \u2014 from company guidance \u2014 is that there could be haves and have nots this earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; FactSet data shows that 47 S&amp;P 500 companies have issued negative earnings guidance for the third quarter, and 56 companies have issued positive outlooks.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed headwind ahead?\n&gt; The headline jobs number Friday was a major disappointment, as the economy added just 194,000 jobs in September, well below the the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000. On the positive side, the unemployment rate fell to a much lower point than economists forecast. At 4.8%, that\u2019s the same level seen in late 2016.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s unclear if the number changes the calculus for when and how fast the Federal Reserve will slow its $120 billion-per-month bond-buying program.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view these figures are good enough, and when combined with the debt-ceiling can being kicked down the road, likely solidifies November as \u2018go time\u2019 for tapering,\u201d Wells Fargo Securities senior equity analyst Christopher Harvey said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe continue to expect a choppy equity market rally and a two-to-four-week tech bounce, but the bounce probably peters out next month when the Fed says those magical words: We will begin to taper,\u201d he added.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WuOc7cb.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnJ6ZF2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CojntqX.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mxZnyBJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eZbwxOb.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JPCsx2m.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kyfY7Xn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zEMv32q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uaj9G7t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VAaeJ4E.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fgsZNEH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/W5HmLSK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/DDVPGco.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2021\n\n&gt; The fourth quarter is now off to the races and we thought it worthwhile to check in on the best and worst-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks on a year-to-date basis. As shown below, there are currently six members of the index that have rallied over 100% this year. Apt for the year that its vaccine has rolled out, the biggest gainer of these has been Moderna (MRNA) with a 196.12% rally. It now has a market cap of $124.87 billion versus a market cap of only $41 billion at the start of the year. Of the 20 best performers, MRNA is also the only one with a market cap above $100 billion. The next largest is ConocoPhillips (COP) with a $95.76 billion market cap. COP is one of multiple Energy stocks on this list as well. Of the top 20 performers, Energy sector names dominate the list with 8 members.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Pivoting to the other end of the spectrum, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is down the most this year having been cut by 36.18%. IPG Photonics (IPGP), Lamb Weston Holdings (LW), Viatris (VTRS), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Global Payments (GPN) also have fallen by at least 25%. Once again, there is only one member of this list with a market cap above $100 billion: Qualcomm (QCOM). One other interesting factor to note of the worst performers is there are several stocks that were at some point plays on pandemic trends, whether those be reopening or stay at home. For example, in addition to LVS, another gaming/reopening name, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), ranks as the eighth-worst performer YTD. Additionally, strong performers during the onset of the pandemic like Clorox (CLX), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) are all down double digits this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Intraday Commodity Spikes\n\n&gt; Since the late spring, both silver and gold have been in steady downtrends spending much of that time below their 50-DMAs. Those downtrends remain in place, but both metals did find a short-term bottom on September 29th. While they have been rallying in the past week and a half, today each one has stalled out. From the early morning leading up to the Nonfarm Payrolls report, precious metals ramped higher with a surge immediately following the weaker than expected report. Only a couple hours after the release, gold and silver had erased a large portion of their earlier gains. In fact, silver is now 2.15% below its intraday high and gold is 1.36% below its high. For gold, in particular, that intraday reversal also marked a rejection of its 50-DMA which it\u2014as well as silver\u2014has struggled to stay above for most of the past several months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-GC-SI.png))**\n\n&gt; Crude oil is yet another commodity that is currently down off of its intraday highs, and like gold, the reversal came at a pretty interesting level. At its high Friday morning, front-month WTI futures rose above $80 for the first time since November 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL.png))**\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Job Market Continues To Frustrate In September\n\n&gt; The September payroll report likely created more questions than it answered.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its September employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added a disappointing 194,000 jobs during the month, falling well short of Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 median forecast for a gain of 500,000. This comes on the heels of a lukewarm August report, which did receive an upward revision of 131,000. Somewhat contradictory, the unemployment rate fell more than forecast to 4.8% in September, beating expectations, though that was paired with a reduced labor force participation rate of 61.6% when expectations called for an increase.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe observation window for this report likely came too soon for positive catalysts to really gain traction,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLeisure and hospitality jobs, a proxy for economic reopening, were only marginally higher. We take this to mean Delta\u2019s waning impact will likely be more evident in October\u2019s report where we expect to see reopening momentum reassert itself.\u201d\n\n&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, in-person segments of the labor market such as leisure and hospitality jobs grew steadily during the first half of the year when COVID-19 remained under relative control. However, the latest flare-up has dampened that trend. We expect to see renewed growth in this sector as the delta variant continues to abate.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.8.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As mentioned, definitive takeaways from this report are difficult to come by due to the offsetting nature of the report. On the one hand, headline numbers came in very weak, but private payrolls, as well as manufacturing payrolls, fared better. The unemployment rate experienced a significant drop, but interpreting that number becomes muddied when considering the fact that we are already experiencing a significant worker shortage and the participation rate is declining, not increasing, as we would hope to see in a true recovery.\n\n&gt; What is more, because the observation window for the report cuts off mid-month, we cannot yet draw conclusions about the impact of school reopening and the lapsing of enhanced unemployment benefits\u2014hotly debated crosscurrents\u2014plus the aforementioned waning delta impact. Regarding the inflation debate\u2014average hourly earnings rose 0.6% month over month and 4.6% year over year. And while wages are undeniably growing and helping to fuel inflation, the data are not mix-adjusted and therefore are inflated due to the suppressed growth in the in-person, lower-wage segment of the labor market.\n\n&gt; The biggest question, though, is what this means for the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) asset tapering plans. The market had all but expected the Fed to announce a tapering timeline at its next meeting coming into this report, with the caveat that Fed Chair Jerome Powell needed only to see a \u201creasonably good\u201d job report first. Whether September\u2019s surprise report has cleared that low bar or not now becomes an open question, one which the market had all but dismissed as a formality previously.\n\n&gt; Indeed, in the aftermath of the report\u2019s release Treasury markets immediately began pricing in a possible delay to any taper, and equity markets gyrated between positive and negative territory as they struggled to process whether bad news should actually be considered good news in this context. We will have to see in the coming weeks whether this report will be substantial enough to bring on the much-anticipated taper announcement, but one thing is for sure\u2014there are no gimmies in this labor market recovery.\n*****\n\n&gt; # Columbus Day Performance\n\n&gt; Columbus Day is an interesting trading day for financial markets as it is one of the few trading days of the year when the equity market is open, but the bond market is closed. This may lead investors to think that equity markets should perform positively, as investors do not have credit markets to allocate capital to on that specific day. However, looking at the S&amp;P 500's historical performance on Columbus Day over the last 25 years doesn't necessarily show a real positive bias. Columbus Day tends to act just like any other trading day. Over the last 25 years, median performance on Columbus Day has been a gain of 10 basis points (bps) with positive returns 55.6% of the time. While that's slightly higher than the median one-day gain of 7 bps for all trading days over the last 25 years, the difference isn't significant. That's not to say that Columbus Day hasn't seen some outliers, though. Who can forget in 2008, during the middle of the Financial Crisis, when the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 11% on Columbus Day!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Day-of.png))**\n\n&gt; For the week of Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500's median gain has been 0.31% with positive returns 63% of the time which also isn't extraordinary relative to average weekly returns for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years. The worst Columbus Day weeks were in 1999 (-6.63%) and 2018 (-4.10%) while the best were in 1998 (+7.32%), 2002 (5.87%), and 2011 (+5.98%). Interestingly enough, in 2008, even after rallying over 11% on Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500 finished the week up just 4.60% as it erased more than half of its gains from the holiday session.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Week-of.png))**\n\n&gt; The table below lists the S&amp;P 500's performance leading up to and after Columbus Day for each of the last 25 years. With a decline of over 2.5% since the start of September, this year ranks as the weakest performance for the equity market since 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Columbus-Day-Table-100821.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Most Important Chart In The World\n\n&gt; And just like that, the calendar turned to October and volatility picked up in a big way, with three consecutive 1% moves for the S&amp;P 500 Index to start the month. As we noted in our October preview, this month gets a bad rap for being a bearish month (it isn\u2019t), but it absolutely owns the title as the most volatile month.\n\n&gt; t took nearly a full year, but the S&amp;P 500 finally had its first 5% pullback of 2021, thus ending hopes of 2021 joining 1954, 1958, 1964, 1993, 1995, and 2017 as the only years to go a full calendar year without a 5% move lower.\n\n&gt; \u201cVolatility is the price of admission,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cSure, we\u2019d all prefer stocks go straight up forever, but that isn\u2019t reality. Investors must learn to embrace and accept the eventual scares and bouts of volatility that are common even in the strongest bull markets.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, stocks experience a 14.2% peak-to-trough pullback on average during the year, putting the recent 5% pullback in perspective. In fact, 21 out of the past 41 years saw at least a 10% correction. Incredibly, 12 of those years finished in the green and those 12 years gained an average of 17.0%. Who could forget last year\u2019s 34% bear market and move back to up 16% by the end of the year? In other words, big pullbacks can happen even in years that see outsized gains, which is why this chart is so important for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The last new all-time high for the S&amp;P 500 was on September 2, but as of the end of September there were still 54 new all-time highs in 2021, the second most ever with one quarter to go. The good news? Previous years that saw a lot new highs the first three quarters usually had strong performance the final quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking things a step further, this year the S&amp;P 500 produced one of its best ever year-to-date gains through September, up 14.7% with a quarter to go. It turns out that good starts to a year tend to resolve higher. In fact, 9 of the past 10 years the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 12.5% with a quarter to go there were further gains in the fourth quarter. As you can see below, the returns are greatly skewed due to 1987, but the median return in the final quarter of the year is an impressive 5.2% (versus the average fourth quarter return of 4.0%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Performance Through Q3 And its Impact on Q4 Performance\n\n&gt; Every year, the makeup and number of sectors that outperform the S&amp;P 500 changes. This year, four sectors (Energy, Financials, Real Estate, and Communication Services) outperformed the S&amp;P 500 through the end of Q3, while last year it was only three sectors that outperformed in the first three quarters of the year (Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services).\n\n&gt; As we all know, past performance does not indicate future performance, and in looking at sectors that have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of prior years compared to how they performed in Q4, the same holds true. The table below lists the number of sectors that outperformed and underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of each year since 2000 and then shows their median performance during Q4 of the same year. Looking at a summary of the annual results, it's almost a coinflip as to whether or not the leading sectors in the first three quarters of a given year will continue to outperform in Q4. On average, the sectors that outperform YTD through 9/30 have averaged a Q4 gain of 3.58% (median: +6.40%) with positive returns 76% of the time. Sectors that lag the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of the year average a rest of year gain of 3.67% (median: 5.95%) with gains 71% of the time. While the term 'strength begets strength' has historically been applicable to the broader market, at the sector level, buying the YTD winners (or losers) ahead of Q4 in expectation of continued momentum to close out the year (or a mean reversion bounce) hasn't offered any material outperformance.\n\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Snap227.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical October Trading: Volatile Start Sets Up Rally through Month\u2019s End\n\n&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the full month of October has been a solid month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all recorded gains ranging from 0.6% by Russell 2000 to 1.9% by NASDAQ. But these gains have come with volatile trading, most notably during the early days of the month. October has opened softly with mild gains on its first trading day by DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000. On the second day, all five indexes have been weak followed by a rebound on the third trading day before additional weakness pulls the market lower through the seventh trading day. At which point, the market has historically found support and began to rally through mid-month and beyond.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/070f50fc0225a24692163a37694f0425/da1ccfd284e5df51-2c/s500x750/009fdcd32ca89da61f3a47401e5e5eaf71f34f50.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 8th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwLj9O1yEmE))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.10.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 2021!](https://i.imgur.com/xrMCop9.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.11.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.11.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cF0CbQE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.12.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D4dB9sd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.12.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jDBI2Dv.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.13.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qVRtzZv.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.13.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/V7gDj4f.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.14.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hZ42eSL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.14.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HNdhjgf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.15.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I2ihrfy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.15.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, October 13th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-wednesday-oct-13.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Wall Street looks to avoid a four-session losing streak\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures were essentially flat Wednesday after Dow stock JPMorgan Chase reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue and ahead of key inflation data. Shares of JPMorgan rose modestly in the premarket as third-quarter results from the bank were supported by a $1.5 billion boost from better-than-expected loan losses.\n\n&gt; * The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq all dropped Tuesday for the third straight session. The modest losses indicated that investors were in a wait-and-see mode ahead of earnings season really kicking into high gear.\n\n&gt; * Shares of Delta Air Lines dipped in the premarket after the carrier on Wednesday reported that third-quarter earnings and revenue topped expectations. It was Delta\u2019s first quarterly profit without taking federal aid into account since the start of the pandemic. However, it was still below 2019 pre-Covid levels.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Supply chain woes, rising costs may make for rocky earnings\n\n&gt; * Supply chain issues, labor shortages and higher energy prices are making this a very difficult quarter to model. As of Tuesday, 22 companies that are early reporters beat estimates by 11%, according to Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. While this is above the traditional beat of 3% to 5%, it\u2019s far below the average of prior quarters this year, including the roughly 18% beat for the second quarter. Third-quarter estimates, which had been rising steadily for months, have stopped in the last few weeks.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. September consumer prices expected to remain high\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 1.57% on Wednesday ahead of what\u2019s expected to be another elevated inflation report. The government at 8:30 a.m. ET releases the September consumer price index. Economists expect headline CPI and core CPI, which excludes the food and energy sectors, to be around the prior month\u2019s year-over-year increases of 5.3% and 4%, respectively. The Federal Reserve at 2 p.m. ET releases minutes from its policy meeting in September when central bankers indicated they expect to begin reducing monthly asset purchases \u201csoon,\u201d but did not say when.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. White House aims to help key West Coast ports stay open 24/7\n\n&gt; * President Joe Biden will unveil a plan Wednesday to try to ease West Coast port backlogs by expanding round-the-clock operations. The Port of Los Angeles is expected to announce a shift to 24/7 operations, following a similar transition by the Port of Long Beach in California last month. Central to this plan to ease supple chain disruptions are commitments by some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and shippers, including FedEx, UPS, Walmart and Home Depot, to increase overnight and off-hours operations at the ports to get the goods to market. Together, the ports account for about 40% of the shipping containers entering the United States.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. U.S. to reopen land borders in November for fully vaccinated\n\n&gt; * The U.S. said Wednesday it will reopen its land borders to nonessential travel next month, ending a 19-month freeze due to Covid as the nation moves to require all international visitors to be vaccinated. Vehicle, rail and ferry travel between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico has been largely restricted to essential travel since the earliest days of the pandemic. The latest move follows last month\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will end country-based travel bans for air travel and instead require Covid shots for foreign nationals seeking to enter by plane.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/LsmNGMW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H5hBrGA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/R248qyz.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/eZbwxOb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/vuQ72d7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/KdmemIV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/LUKc1Da.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DTX4gBn.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eRf3g77.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IT3mApN.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/7znGyIh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5TXBfcz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YLEAO9D.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* DATS\n* PLUG\n* NRXP\n* KOSS\n* ANY\n* JPM\n* GWH\n* BNGO\n* CRSP\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-jpmorgan-chase-blackrock-delta-air-and-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **JPMorgan Chase (JPM)** \u2013 JPMorgan Chase reported a profit of $3.74 per share for the third quarter, compared with a consensus estimate of $3.00, while revenue also topped Wall Street forecasts.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, October 5th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lordstown-motors-ocugen-pepsico-and-more.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Wall Street looks higher after Monday\u2019s tech decline\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open Tuesday as tech stocks bounced, one day after the Nasdaq sank more than 2.1%. Monday\u2019s session was marked by rotation out of tech names as bond yields remained elevated. The S&amp;P 500 on Monday fell 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 323 points, or nearly 1%.\n&gt; * PepsiCo on Tuesday raised its full-year forecast after its quarterly earnings and revenue topped analysts\u2019 expectations. The company\u2019s shares were up nearly 1% in the premarket.\n&gt; * Johnson &amp; Johnson said Tuesday it has submitted data to the FDA for emergency use authorization of a booster shot of its Covid vaccine for all adults. J&amp;J shares rose modestly.\n&gt; * Volatility that accompanied September\u2019s market decline continued in October, with the first two trading days of the new month up big and then down big. The Nasdaq, as of Monday\u2019s close, was almost 7.3% away from its latest record close Sept. 7, inching nearer to a correction. The S&amp;P 500 was 5.2% from its Sept. 2 record high. The Dow was more than 4.5% away from its Aug. 16 record close.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. U.S. faces recession if Congress doesn\u2019t act on debt limit , Yellen says\n\n&gt; * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Tuesday she believes the economy would fall into a recession if Congress fails to address the borrowing limit before an unprecedented default on the U.S. debt. \u201cI do regard Oct. 18 as a deadline. It would be catastrophic to not pay the government\u2019s bills, for us to be in a position where we lacked the resources to pay the government\u2019s bills,\u201d Yellen said on \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d On Monday, President Joe Biden urged Republican senators to \u201cget out of the way\u201d on the debt ceiling. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Democrats should use their majorities on Capitol Hill to act without GOP votes.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Oil prices rose to around 7-year highs after OPEC, allies moves\n\n&gt; * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, rose modestly Tuesday morning to around seven-year highs near $78 per barrel. WTI jumped roughly 2.3% on Monday as international oil producers decided to keep a cap on supplies. Despite pressure from the U.S. to ramp up output, OPEC and its allies were concerned that a fourth global wave of Covid infections could slow a demand recovery, a source told Reuters just before Monday\u2019s vote. U.S. oil prices have surged more than 60% in 2021, bringing major energy companies along for the ride. Exxon has gained nearly 50% this year.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Facebook whistleblower to testify; platform outage fixed\n\n&gt; * Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen is set to testify at Tuesday\u2019s hearing of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection. After recent reports in The Wall Street Journal based on documents she leaked raised a public outcry, Haugen revealed her identity in an interview on the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which aired Sunday night. She insisted that \u201cFacebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.\u201d Shares of Facebook rose 1% in Tuesday\u2019s premarket after closing down almost 5% in their worst session in nearly a year.\n\n&gt; * Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp services are back online after a massive global outage. Facebook said late Monday that \u201cthe root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change.\u201d The roughly six-hour incident marked the longest stretch of downtime for the social media company since 2008, when a bug knocked the site offline for about a day, affecting around 80 million users. The company\u2019s platforms currently have billions users.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Tesla must pay ex-worker $137 million over hostile workplace, racism\n\n&gt; * A San Francisco federal court decided that Tesla must pay a former contract worker, Owen Diaz, around $137 million after he endured racist abuse working for the company, his attorneys told CNBC. The jury awarded more than attorneys had asked for their client, including $130 million in punitive damages and $6.9 million for emotional distress. Diaz told the court that colleagues used epithets to denigrate him and other Black workers, telling him to \u201cgo back to Africa\u201d and leaving racist graffiti in the restrooms and a racist drawing in his workspace. Diaz\u2019s lawyers said the case was only able to move forward because their client had not signed one of Tesla\u2019s mandatory arbitration agreements.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/cufqIAb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wz4zrQT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8lPe5bB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/RtabSpV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/U5PgJ90.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aubwMW2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vzQs6xT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/892SyJi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xcmpnv9.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KpOco76.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/JnGeOww.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3a1JSQR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* OCGN\n* VXRT\n* FB\n* MARPS\n* ANVS\n* RIDE\n* STMX.X\n* AYX\n* RSI\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lordstown-motors-ocugen-pepsico-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lordstown Motors (RIDE)** \u2013 The electric truck maker was downgraded to \u201cunderweight\u201d from \u201cequal-weight\u201d at Morgan Stanley, which notes that the recently announced sale of Lordstown\u2019s Ohio plant to Foxconn values the plant at less than a fifth of prior estimates.

This means sending data to centralized cloud servers for processing, along with concerns over latency, bandwidth, and security, is driving the demand for processing and intelligence close to or even at the very point where the data is collected \u2013 at the *edge*. \n\n From smart cities, smart factories, wearables, and in-home automation, combined with the convergence of machine learning (ML) algorithms, edge devices with onboard AI processors, advances in sensor design, and next-generation communication technologies like 5G, are spawning a shift towards *AI at the device edge*. \n\n[https://developer.qualcomm.com/sites/default/files/attachments/ebook\\_ai\\_at\\_edge\\_qdn-v05\\_0.pdf](https://developer.qualcomm.com/sites/default/files/attachments/ebook_ai_at_edge_qdn-v05_0.pdf)\n\nNexoptic announced Sept 14 that it has begun executing its next phase of integration with Qualcomm. \n\n[https://nexoptic.com/news/richard-geruson-nexoptic-chairman-announces-a-new-phase-for-aliis-integration-into-qualcomm-5g-chipsets/](https://nexoptic.com/news/richard-geruson-nexoptic-chairman-announces-a-new-phase-for-aliis-integration-into-qualcomm-5g-chipsets/)\n\n As a Qualcomm Advantage Network (\u201cQAN\u201d) ecosystem partner, the Company has begun a new phase of advanced build into Qualcomm\u2019s camera firmware. This brand-new collaboration offers NexOptic a deeper integration into Qualcomm\u2019s new Snapdragon chipsets than is possible on other platforms, creating unique and exciting opportunities for NexOptic\u2019s image signal processing topologies that can leverage a combination of hardware and software. \n\n Previous phases integrated ALIIS\u2122 onto 2019 Snapdragon chipsets and delivered real time video enhancement at 720p 30FPS. Now, new advancements to NexOptic\u2019s Aliis algorithms as well as performance gains in Qualcomm\u2019s AI accelerator chips have already yielded faster processing abilities at higher resolutions for real time video enhancement.  \n\n This project is allowing OEMs and ODMs to see first-hand the power of Aliis and provide them access to a high-quality reference implementation that can be adapted into multiple standard and unique applications and use cases. \n\n \u201cAs our AI solutions become more advanced, we\u2019re able to provide an increasing number of imaging solutions for customers to select from, separately or in customized bundles,\u201d said Rich Geruson, NexOptic Chairman. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to be able to leverage the ingenuity and power of partners like Qualcomm to create and deliver such cutting-edge solutions.\u201d \n\n[https://www.qualcomm.com/support/qan/member-directory/nexoptic-technology-corp](https://www.qualcomm.com/support/qan/member-directory/nexoptic-technology-corp)\n\n NexOptic delivers progressive AI for imaging through its All Light Intelligent Imaging Solutions (ALIIS\u2122) technology. ALIIS provides highly advanced image and video correction plus data compression for smartphones, DSLR\u2019s, autonomous vehicles, security, smart homes, retail, and industrial automation applications.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, October 5th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lordstown-motors-ocugen-pepsico-and-more.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Wall Street looks higher after Monday\u2019s tech decline\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open Tuesday as tech stocks bounced, one day after the Nasdaq sank more than 2.1%. Monday\u2019s session was marked by rotation out of tech names as bond yields remained elevated. The S&amp;P 500 on Monday fell 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 323 points, or nearly 1%.\n&gt; * PepsiCo on Tuesday raised its full-year forecast after its quarterly earnings and revenue topped analysts\u2019 expectations. The company\u2019s shares were up nearly 1% in the premarket.\n&gt; * Johnson &amp; Johnson said Tuesday it has submitted data to the FDA for emergency use authorization of a booster shot of its Covid vaccine for all adults. J&amp;J shares rose modestly.\n&gt; * Volatility that accompanied September\u2019s market decline continued in October, with the first two trading days of the new month up big and then down big. The Nasdaq, as of Monday\u2019s close, was almost 7.3% away from its latest record close Sept. 7, inching nearer to a correction. The S&amp;P 500 was 5.2% from its Sept. 2 record high. The Dow was more than 4.5% away from its Aug. 16 record close.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. U.S. faces recession if Congress doesn\u2019t act on debt limit , Yellen says\n\n&gt; * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Tuesday she believes the economy would fall into a recession if Congress fails to address the borrowing limit before an unprecedented default on the U.S. debt. \u201cI do regard Oct. 18 as a deadline. It would be catastrophic to not pay the government\u2019s bills, for us to be in a position where we lacked the resources to pay the government\u2019s bills,\u201d Yellen said on \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d On Monday, President Joe Biden urged Republican senators to \u201cget out of the way\u201d on the debt ceiling. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Democrats should use their majorities on Capitol Hill to act without GOP votes.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Oil prices rose to around 7-year highs after OPEC, allies moves\n\n&gt; * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, rose modestly Tuesday morning to around seven-year highs near $78 per barrel. WTI jumped roughly 2.3% on Monday as international oil producers decided to keep a cap on supplies. Despite pressure from the U.S. to ramp up output, OPEC and its allies were concerned that a fourth global wave of Covid infections could slow a demand recovery, a source told Reuters just before Monday\u2019s vote. U.S. oil prices have surged more than 60% in 2021, bringing major energy companies along for the ride. Exxon has gained nearly 50% this year.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Facebook whistleblower to testify; platform outage fixed\n\n&gt; * Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen is set to testify at Tuesday\u2019s hearing of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection. After recent reports in The Wall Street Journal based on documents she leaked raised a public outcry, Haugen revealed her identity in an interview on the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which aired Sunday night. She insisted that \u201cFacebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.\u201d Shares of Facebook rose 1% in Tuesday\u2019s premarket after closing down almost 5% in their worst session in nearly a year.\n\n&gt; * Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp services are back online after a massive global outage. Facebook said late Monday that \u201cthe root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change.\u201d The roughly six-hour incident marked the longest stretch of downtime for the social media company since 2008, when a bug knocked the site offline for about a day, affecting around 80 million users. The company\u2019s platforms currently have billions users.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Tesla must pay ex-worker $137 million over hostile workplace, racism\n\n&gt; * A San Francisco federal court decided that Tesla must pay a former contract worker, Owen Diaz, around $137 million after he endured racist abuse working for the company, his attorneys told CNBC. The jury awarded more than attorneys had asked for their client, including $130 million in punitive damages and $6.9 million for emotional distress. Diaz told the court that colleagues used epithets to denigrate him and other Black workers, telling him to \u201cgo back to Africa\u201d and leaving racist graffiti in the restrooms and a racist drawing in his workspace. Diaz\u2019s lawyers said the case was only able to move forward because their client had not signed one of Tesla\u2019s mandatory arbitration agreements.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/cufqIAb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wz4zrQT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8lPe5bB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/RtabSpV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/U5PgJ90.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aubwMW2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vzQs6xT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/892SyJi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xcmpnv9.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KpOco76.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/JnGeOww.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3a1JSQR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lordstown-motors-ocugen-pepsico-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lordstown Motors (RIDE)** \u2013 The electric truck maker was downgraded to \u201cunderweight\u201d from \u201cequal-weight\u201d at Morgan Stanley, which notes that the recently announced sale of Lordstown\u2019s Ohio plant to Foxconn values the plant at less than a fifth of prior estimates.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, October 5th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lordstown-motors-ocugen-pepsico-and-more.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Wall Street looks higher after Monday\u2019s tech decline\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open Tuesday as tech stocks bounced, one day after the Nasdaq sank more than 2.1%. Monday\u2019s session was marked by rotation out of tech names as bond yields remained elevated. The S&amp;P 500 on Monday fell 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 323 points, or nearly 1%.\n&gt; * PepsiCo on Tuesday raised its full-year forecast after its quarterly earnings and revenue topped analysts\u2019 expectations. The company\u2019s shares were up nearly 1% in the premarket.\n&gt; * Johnson &amp; Johnson said Tuesday it has submitted data to the FDA for emergency use authorization of a booster shot of its Covid vaccine for all adults. J&amp;J shares rose modestly.\n&gt; * Volatility that accompanied September\u2019s market decline continued in October, with the first two trading days of the new month up big and then down big. The Nasdaq, as of Monday\u2019s close, was almost 7.3% away from its latest record close Sept. 7, inching nearer to a correction. The S&amp;P 500 was 5.2% from its Sept. 2 record high. The Dow was more than 4.5% away from its Aug. 16 record close.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. U.S. faces recession if Congress doesn\u2019t act on debt limit , Yellen says\n\n&gt; * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Tuesday she believes the economy would fall into a recession if Congress fails to address the borrowing limit before an unprecedented default on the U.S. debt. \u201cI do regard Oct. 18 as a deadline. It would be catastrophic to not pay the government\u2019s bills, for us to be in a position where we lacked the resources to pay the government\u2019s bills,\u201d Yellen said on \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d On Monday, President Joe Biden urged Republican senators to \u201cget out of the way\u201d on the debt ceiling. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Democrats should use their majorities on Capitol Hill to act without GOP votes.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Oil prices rose to around 7-year highs after OPEC, allies moves\n\n&gt; * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, rose modestly Tuesday morning to around seven-year highs near $78 per barrel. WTI jumped roughly 2.3% on Monday as international oil producers decided to keep a cap on supplies. Despite pressure from the U.S. to ramp up output, OPEC and its allies were concerned that a fourth global wave of Covid infections could slow a demand recovery, a source told Reuters just before Monday\u2019s vote. U.S. oil prices have surged more than 60% in 2021, bringing major energy companies along for the ride. Exxon has gained nearly 50% this year.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Facebook whistleblower to testify; platform outage fixed\n\n&gt; * Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen is set to testify at Tuesday\u2019s hearing of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection. After recent reports in The Wall Street Journal based on documents she leaked raised a public outcry, Haugen revealed her identity in an interview on the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which aired Sunday night. She insisted that \u201cFacebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.\u201d Shares of Facebook rose 1% in Tuesday\u2019s premarket after closing down almost 5% in their worst session in nearly a year.\n\n&gt; * Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp services are back online after a massive global outage. Facebook said late Monday that \u201cthe root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change.\u201d The roughly six-hour incident marked the longest stretch of downtime for the social media company since 2008, when a bug knocked the site offline for about a day, affecting around 80 million users. The company\u2019s platforms currently have billions users.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Tesla must pay ex-worker $137 million over hostile workplace, racism\n\n&gt; * A San Francisco federal court decided that Tesla must pay a former contract worker, Owen Diaz, around $137 million after he endured racist abuse working for the company, his attorneys told CNBC. The jury awarded more than attorneys had asked for their client, including $130 million in punitive damages and $6.9 million for emotional distress. Diaz told the court that colleagues used epithets to denigrate him and other Black workers, telling him to \u201cgo back to Africa\u201d and leaving racist graffiti in the restrooms and a racist drawing in his workspace. Diaz\u2019s lawyers said the case was only able to move forward because their client had not signed one of Tesla\u2019s mandatory arbitration agreements.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/cufqIAb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wz4zrQT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8lPe5bB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/RtabSpV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/U5PgJ90.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aubwMW2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vzQs6xT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/892SyJi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xcmpnv9.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KpOco76.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/JnGeOww.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3a1JSQR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* OCGN\n* VXRT\n* FB\n* MARPS\n* ANVS\n* RIDE\n* STMX.X\n* AYX\n* RSI\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lordstown-motors-ocugen-pepsico-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lordstown Motors (RIDE)** \u2013 The electric truck maker was downgraded to \u201cunderweight\u201d from \u201cequal-weight\u201d at Morgan Stanley, which notes that the recently announced sale of Lordstown\u2019s Ohio plant to Foxconn values the plant at less than a fifth of prior estimates.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, October 13th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-wednesday-oct-13.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Wall Street looks to avoid a four-session losing streak\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures were essentially flat Wednesday after Dow stock JPMorgan Chase reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue and ahead of key inflation data. Shares of JPMorgan rose modestly in the premarket as third-quarter results from the bank were supported by a $1.5 billion boost from better-than-expected loan losses.\n\n&gt; * The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq all dropped Tuesday for the third straight session. The modest losses indicated that investors were in a wait-and-see mode ahead of earnings season really kicking into high gear.\n\n&gt; * Shares of Delta Air Lines dipped in the premarket after the carrier on Wednesday reported that third-quarter earnings and revenue topped expectations. It was Delta\u2019s first quarterly profit without taking federal aid into account since the start of the pandemic. However, it was still below 2019 pre-Covid levels.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Supply chain woes, rising costs may make for rocky earnings\n\n&gt; * Supply chain issues, labor shortages and higher energy prices are making this a very difficult quarter to model. As of Tuesday, 22 companies that are early reporters beat estimates by 11%, according to Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. While this is above the traditional beat of 3% to 5%, it\u2019s far below the average of prior quarters this year, including the roughly 18% beat for the second quarter. Third-quarter estimates, which had been rising steadily for months, have stopped in the last few weeks.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. September consumer prices expected to remain high\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 1.57% on Wednesday ahead of what\u2019s expected to be another elevated inflation report. The government at 8:30 a.m. ET releases the September consumer price index. Economists expect headline CPI and core CPI, which excludes the food and energy sectors, to be around the prior month\u2019s year-over-year increases of 5.3% and 4%, respectively. The Federal Reserve at 2 p.m. ET releases minutes from its policy meeting in September when central bankers indicated they expect to begin reducing monthly asset purchases \u201csoon,\u201d but did not say when.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. White House aims to help key West Coast ports stay open 24/7\n\n&gt; * President Joe Biden will unveil a plan Wednesday to try to ease West Coast port backlogs by expanding round-the-clock operations. The Port of Los Angeles is expected to announce a shift to 24/7 operations, following a similar transition by the Port of Long Beach in California last month. Central to this plan to ease supple chain disruptions are commitments by some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and shippers, including FedEx, UPS, Walmart and Home Depot, to increase overnight and off-hours operations at the ports to get the goods to market. Together, the ports account for about 40% of the shipping containers entering the United States.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. U.S. to reopen land borders in November for fully vaccinated\n\n&gt; * The U.S. said Wednesday it will reopen its land borders to nonessential travel next month, ending a 19-month freeze due to Covid as the nation moves to require all international visitors to be vaccinated. Vehicle, rail and ferry travel between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico has been largely restricted to essential travel since the earliest days of the pandemic. The latest move follows last month\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will end country-based travel bans for air travel and instead require Covid shots for foreign nationals seeking to enter by plane.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/LsmNGMW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H5hBrGA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/R248qyz.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/eZbwxOb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/vuQ72d7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/KdmemIV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/LUKc1Da.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DTX4gBn.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eRf3g77.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IT3mApN.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/7znGyIh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5TXBfcz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YLEAO9D.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-jpmorgan-chase-blackrock-delta-air-and-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **JPMorgan Chase (JPM)** \u2013 JPMorgan Chase reported a profit of $3.74 per share for the third quarter, compared with a consensus estimate of $3.00, while revenue also topped Wall Street forecasts.

Central to this plan to ease supple chain disruptions are commitments by some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and shippers, including FedEx, UPS, Walmart and Home Depot, to increase overnight and off-hours operations at the ports to get the goods to market. Together, the ports account for about 40% of the shipping containers entering the United States.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. U.S. to reopen land borders in November for fully vaccinated\n\n&gt; * The U.S. said Wednesday it will reopen its land borders to nonessential travel next month, ending a 19-month freeze due to Covid as the nation moves to require all international visitors to be vaccinated. Vehicle, rail and ferry travel between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico has been largely restricted to essential travel since the earliest days of the pandemic. The latest move follows last month\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will end country-based travel bans for air travel and instead require Covid shots for foreign nationals seeking to enter by plane.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/LsmNGMW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H5hBrGA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/R248qyz.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/eZbwxOb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/vuQ72d7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/KdmemIV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/LUKc1Da.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DTX4gBn.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eRf3g77.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IT3mApN.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/7znGyIh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5TXBfcz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YLEAO9D.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* DATS\n* PLUG\n* NRXP\n* KOSS\n* ANY\n* JPM\n* GWH\n* BNGO\n* CRSP\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-jpmorgan-chase-blackrock-delta-air-and-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **JPMorgan Chase (JPM)** \u2013 JPMorgan Chase reported a profit of $3.74 per share for the third quarter, compared with a consensus estimate of $3.00, while revenue also topped Wall Street forecasts.

Others were exiting with a quickness (understatement).  There was a day when the whole float was treated (44 million shares), but I decided to add.  Why? Let me explain.  \n\n \n\n**First, Why did it Crater?**\n\nShort sellers attacked SAVA with essentially a short report called a citizens petition (CP). Jordan Thomas's (JT's) thesis was, \"the FDA must stop phase 3 trials to protect patients.\"  Well, patient safety is undoubtedly a noble concern, except that JT offered NO evidence of any serious safety events (in over 70 pages).  Then why did JT pick safety?  Because the FDA only halts trials for safety issues.  Well, fast forward a month, and as expected, Phase three trials started two days ago (the FDA did not stop them).  Also, as expected, the SP is steadily recovering. Clear proof that the CP and all its allegations are a nonissue. This, fellow SAVAage apes, is essentially a buying opportunity in its purest unadulterated form. Rise!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Who Try To Stop More Wrinkle!](https://preview.redd.it/s6vmu66kutq71.png?width=710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09c4f3640274895d14003b58c17941bbb0e959b0)\n\n \n\nIf you want to take a deeper dive, please see my post on the CP and the motives behind it:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/SAVA\\_stock/comments/pmy1uz/calling\\_all\\_savage\\_apes/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SAVA_stock/comments/pmy1uz/calling_all_savage_apes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nJoe Springer uses conservative estimates (based on the TAM and medication revenue) to arrive at an SP of $3750. (That's after FDA approval, potentially in 12-18 months). \n\nSo, where are we?  We have a stock that FUD has beaten down. It is on its way to recovery.  It also is a potential multi-bagger within 12 months or less.  \n\n \n\n**When to buy?**\n\nSAVA hit a low of $39, and over the last two weeks, it has recovered to $62 as of 9/30. For you smooth-brained apes and degenerates, thats a 58% increase in two weeks.  Too late to buy? No, SAVA's SP needs to appreciate over 100% to reach ATH's, which it hit before JT's FUD. More importantly, after my DD, I'm convinced SAVA's SP will be over $1000 within 12 months. Let me now discuss the certifiably psychotic SP I just mentioned ($1000).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Im more of an investor than a trader, but this chart though... Had to share.  There is a nice cup and handle formation if you zoom about to about 3 weeks time frame. ](https://preview.redd.it/5me3rxxi5tq71.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a26423fd61b8be21ae7052a697d893d9c1166129)\n\n \n\n**The Market:**\n\nHalf of all elderly hospitalizations are related to AD.  It is the 6th leading cause of death per the CDC.  However, some epidemiologists argue that this data underestimates the genuine harm, and AD is actually the 3rd leading cause of death behind cardiovascular disease and cancer. The treatment?  There is no adequate AD treatment. The market is gravely, desperately looking.  Let me give you another example.\n\nThe FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm (BIIB's AD drug mentioned above). Aduhelm causes brain swelling in 30% of the people who take it. The risk of brain swelling requires serial Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k annually. Most incredible is that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL, in two separate trials.  Several insurers, hospitals, and many physicians have refused to use Aduhelm. Again, for emphasis, the FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation over a trillion dollars. Caregivers? Their fate is more difficult than the patient's.   \n\nSo now you understand the market and how desperately the FDA needs to approve something for Patients, families, and caregivers. To reiterate, as a physician, I believe this is one of the most underserved areas in all of medicine. \n\n**What does SAVA have to offer:**\n\nAduhelm (BIIB's AD medication) is a flop, so I won't misuse my time differentiating Aduhelm from SAVA's AD med, Simufilam.  LLY's medication is slightly better than placebo, but when compared to SAVA's Simufilam, well, there is no parity.  Not only is Simufilam cheaper, easier to administer (oral vs. IV), safer, but SAVA's data in phase 2 is the best phase 2 data ever presented for AD!  Every Physician, PA, NP, nurse, and tech I have discussed the data with (in person, real people, who know and trust me) has become an investor.  Four of those individuals were neurologists. Yes, anecdotal, but all glory starts with anecdotes. Synopsys:  Simufilam's data thus far is historical.  As in AD, data has never been this promising.\n\nA couple of important technical points (also to give the illusion that I am impartial, and I admit Im not):  SAVA's data is open-lable and, thus, more likely to be influenced by placebo (This is an actual valid limitation of the open-label data). However, earlier randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial backs up the open-label data. It also correlates well with the biomarker data.  Further, as Remi (the CEO of SAVA) pointed out, the degree and duration of response make placebo highly unlikely. Additionally, the trial was multicenter, and independent 3rd parties administered the test. All the endpoints were clearly defined and met, making \"p-hacking\" less likely (a common way biopharma fluffs their data). What's all this jargon mean?  There is a high probability that Phase 3 should replicate Phase 2 data. If SAVA can indeed reproduce the data in a trial with a control arm, then historic data aside, we have a quick, easy FDA approval.  Also, we dont need historical data; SAVA only needs to show a slowing cognitive decline, not an improvement in cognition (as it has in phase 2).  Or, as apes say, Simufilam. cause. more. wrinkle.    Lastly, the FDA has given SAVA a \"Special Protocol Agreement\" (SPA) to simplify the approval further.  The SPA removes subjectivity and dumb downs (fewer wrinkles required) in the approval process. A simple if-then statement. If there is improvement in cognition (or even a slow down of decline), then FDA we have approval. \n\nLLY's AD medication effect is probably the most robust, at least until Simufilam presented its data.  Here is a chart comparing the expected decline (gray) vs. LLY's drug (green) vs. SAVA's Drug (Red).  Yes, the higher the line, the better the medication.  Yes, it is that much better. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bz2l8wc2xpq71.png?width=1079&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6f295820005ef081f087a56ce51546ca78fa2b4\n\n \n\nI have linked a neurologist's blog. This said neurologist served on the FDA advisory committee and has decades of clinical experience. He has many more wrinkles than myself and speaks about why the data is phenomenal.\n\nhttps://luysii.wordpress.com/2021/08/25/cassava-sciences-9-month-data-is-probably-better-than-they-realize/  \n\nSo we have to ask ourselves if SAVA's medication is safe (which it is) and better (in terms of cost, efficacy, safety, administration, etc.), then should it also get fast-track approval?  Yes, I firmly believe that SAVA's AD medication, Simufilam, will get Breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) or fast-track approval via some other method.  Other methods include \"Priority Review,\" \"Accelerated Approval.\"  Or simply the FDA ends the trial early and approves the medication (for early proven efficacy, Yes, this happens, which we will talk about soon). Please recall what happened to LLY when BTD was announced. If you dont remember anything else from this read, please remember this point.  If SAVA discloses BTD or the like, its market cap should rocket skyward and beyond.  If history is our gauge, then we should see an 8.5x after the announcement, at minimum. \n\nAs this need is tremendous, I expect the FDA to act extraordinarily manner. Has the FDA ever halted to approve a medication or therapy because delay in approval is unethical?  The unethical part is holding a beneficial treatment from the placebo arm in a study and further from the general population (for the smooth-brained apes amongst us).  Yes, read on for the history lesson.\n\nThe FDA halted the SPRINT and ASCOT-BPLA trials early. This was done because the FDA noted a benefit in the treatment arm and concluded that it would be unethical to keep giving patients a placebo. These are just two of many examples. I firmly believe the same will happen to Simufilam.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5024796/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5024796/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **Other Catalyst:**\n\nPartnership announcement with a cash infusion.  In his previous earnings call, Remi stated there would be a \"non-dilutive, nondebt\" cash infusion within \"weeks to months.\"  Im guessing this announcement will be at earnings 11/8. \n\nExpect SAVA to release 12-month biomarker data soon.  In its earlier 28-day trial, Simufilam had excellent biomarker data. So I believe the 12-month data will look fantastic as well.  \n\nThe COO announced a \"hypergrowth phase,\" which is currently underway.  SAVA has purchased a 90,000 sq foot building and partnered with Evonik (one of the world's largest drug manufacturers).  SAVA has also partnered with 50+ research sites across the country for phase 3 trials.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere has been institutional buy very recently, which is a great sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/24ltp5a0htq71.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8669415c0476d6c9c2c1998937b4a3f2cea33761\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4v7h0k4bhtq71.png?width=997&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d92cd3cfc7130e550041260c00f09e2d4e5ffead\n\n \n\n# Ortex Update September 30th, -2.49% Short Interest, Utilization 99.43%, Cost to borrow rising fast 5.78%\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSo Cost to borrow rate is increasing and its going fast now, SAVA is a hard to borrow stock meaning the shorts will find it hard to get any shares to short with besides what they have already lent =)\n\nShort interest estimated is down 2.49%\n\nTotal estimated short interest is 33.46%\n\nTotal shares estimated short 12.53 million\n\nshares on loan 17.21 million\n\nfree float on loan 45.96%\n\nUtilization 99.43%\n\nCost to borrow 5.78% (it was 3.86 yesterday) CTB minimum 6.91%\n\non loan avg age (D) 23.99\n\nNumber of loans 903\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6hygycqhtq71.png?width=1988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=add4783fcc7043b9f12319636aaee7167d4ad036\n\n SAVA is heavily shorted as seen above.  I believe the bulk of the shorters are hoping the general market will crash, and stocks that ran the most will be crushed the hardest. SAVA is one of the best-performing stocks in the last two years and thus has a very high beta. In my estimation, thats a grave mistake.  Not only because shorts are betting on the loss of a much-needed medical treatment but also because the data is historical and consistent across several studies and endpoints.  The odds are stacked against shorts, Bigley.  With one announcement, SAVA could squeeze well past ATH's ($147) regardless of what the general market is doing.\n\nFunding isn't a near-term issue. $SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. SAVA is getting daily institutional buying has increased significantly since the 12-month data was made public.\n\nApologies if this makes you gag, but I must. I believe I have seen the worse of humanity after seeing JT, and his crew, try and FUD SAVA out of existence. I find it heinous morally reprehensible. This thought motivates me to hold through the rollercoaster ride that SAVA has been. Knowing I support a potential breakthrough therapy\u2014an unmet medical need is plaguing our loved ones.  Sleep well, effing shorts; your time is coming. \n\nThis is not medical or financial advice. Over 19 years, I've been wrong many times. If you can't tell from my post, Im excited.  Very excited about SAVA and might be overly optimistic, maybe even biased, so please do your own DD. Good luck! I'll continue posting SAVA updates if there is interest.\n\n**TLDR:**  SAVA cratered because of FUD. Simufilam is the culmination of decades of trial and error. There are tens of millions of patients waiting on this medication globally. It has massive potential (SP of over 3000) within 1-2 years.  It has already appreciated over 50%.  Get in while you can.",
