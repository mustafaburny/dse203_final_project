        "selftext": "All you autists worried about RKT and will end up paper handing any dips need to wake up. RKT is one of the best deals on the market right now. Here's why:\n\n**RKT will undoubtedly eventually be valued as a Fintech Company.**\n\nWhy? Because it has all the core components of a fintech company. RKT at it's core is a consumer-facing, tech-based mortgage origination platform and it's productivity, Revenue per Employee, and margins are **in line if not better than fintech players**. Let's take a look:\n\n* RKT's Q1 2020 EBITDA Margin was a **blistering 44%!** Compare that other FinTechs latest EBITDA margins \n   * SHOP at negative 1.9%\n   * GWRE at 6%\n   * LMND at negative 73%!\n   * PYPL at 19%\n* RKT has an **Revenue per Employee (as of 3/31/20) figure of $300k**! Again, compare to other Fintechs, RKT is nearly the exact Median\n   * SHOP at $416k / employee\n   * GWRE at $276k / employee\n   * LMND at $251k / employee\n   * PYPL at $828k / employee\n* Now, let's look at the valuation for the other Fintechs. **RKT is very obviously undervalued compared to the segment**\n   * Enterprise Value / Revenue\n      * SHOP - 54.3x LTM Revenue\n      * GWRE - 11.7x LTM Revenue\n      * LMND - 44.3x LTM Revenue\n      * PYPL - 11.4x LTM Revenue\n      * **RKT - 2.2x LTM Revenue**\n   * P/E\n      * SHOP - N/A, negative EPS\n      * GWRE - 333x P/E\n      * LMND - N/A,negative EPS\n      * PYPL - 87x P/E\n      * **RKT - 7.7x P/E**\n\n**But, but, what about the mortgage volume? Isn't RKT exposed to interest rates and mortgage volume?**\n\nPlain and simple, there is no force that is going to stop volume right now. We can all say that fundamentals don't matter and for stock market pricing they may not. But in terms of interest rate action by the Fed, they very much do matter, and it is clear the Fed does not intend to raise rate until fundamentals truly stabilize. And if rates do come up, it will mean even J.Pow &amp; Co think inflation is getting too hot. Fuck SLV gang, **Real Estate is the ultimate anti-inflation safe-haven.** So volume should remain largely unaffected as investors seek inflation protection.\n\n**RKT continues to gain market share in an expanding market**\n\nLet's face it, eventually boomers will not be applying for new mortgages and millennials are not going to walk into Chase with a $100 fountain pen to apply for a mortgage. One of the biggest themes of the housing market today is increasing rate of home ownership among millenials. RKT's completely digitized offering positions them to capitalize on market trends. The numbers prove this as RKT's share of the total mortgage market has increased from 1.3% in 2009 to &gt;9% in the first quarter of 2020, making RKT the **largest mortgage originator in the US.**\n\n**RKT's technology drives faster, better outcomes for end consumer**\n\nRKT's application process can be understood as \"parallel\" vs. the traditional mortgage industry's \"linear\" process. This results in faster approvals and faster closing times. RKT closes loans 25% faster than the industry average - 29 days on average vs. the industry average of 40 days. Not only is this good for the end consumer (instant-gratification millennials), it means RKT's workforce is significantly more efficient than the industry average, closing average of **8.3 loans per month per team member** in YTD 2020 vs. the **industry average of 2.3 per moth per team member**\n\n**In summary, the retail mortgage industry is in desperate need of digitization. RKT is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this need.** After all, who else is going to do this? Penny-fucking-Mac?\n\nTLDR: Go long RKT, I am long shares and will continue to add on dips.",

Payment will be via Paypal/Venmo. \n\nDisclaimer: This is not an attempt to pump the stock. Don\u2019t pump it cause I\u2019d like a gradual run up. Also, I have 25k in shares and 2k in calls, so $30 would be a big payday for me (just being as transparent as possible). \n\nI\u2019m just feeling pretty content with the past couple weeks of trading. By no means am I one of those gain porn 2000% profit dudes, but I\u2019ve been doing pretty good. I just want to show some appreciation for you comedians out there (the purple dudes, the nikola dudes, the Kodak dudes).

I\u2019ll do this once for the $200 and another for the $100. \n\nThe winners will be notified via DM and I will also post their user name here when selected. Please be aware, if you do not claim this within 24 hours, a new winner will be selected! \n\nHave your Paypal acc ready. I prefer paypal just because it\u2019s easier!

BigCommerce merchants can be among the first  to adopt the new feature, which provides shoppers an intuitive,  seamless and secure way to purchase products they discover on Instagram  in a few clicks, without leaving the app.\n\nLeveraging  BigCommerce\u2019s native integration with Facebook Commerce Manager,  merchants can easily connect their ecommerce storefront\u2019s catalog to  Instagram and give customers the ability to buy from their favorite  brands directly on Instagram\u2014rather than navigating to a brand\u2019s website  to make a purchase\u2014and pay using PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, American  Express or Discover. After placing an order, customers can also use the  Instagram app to view their order status, estimated delivery date and  tracking number, as well as cancel orders, initiate returns or request  additional support.\n\n\"Creating  a streamlined checkout experience is paramount for merchants looking to  social commerce to drive revenue growth. The rollout of checkout on  Instagram is another significant step in Instagram\u2019s evolution toward  becoming an essential commerce channel for customer-focused brands,\"  said Brent Bellm, chief executive officer at BigCommerce. \"BigCommerce  is proud to be one of a select group of partners to offer their  customers access to this innovative new feature at launch.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bigcommerce-teams-facebook-unlock-checkout-150500474.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bigcommerce-teams-facebook-unlock-checkout-150500474.html)",

In some ways I was privileged because I got to work with my dad in factories during an era where manufacturing technology started to change in drastic ways. It inspired me as a young pup which eventually lead me down the road of online mathematics-related education. Lucky for you, this includes game theory and finances.\n\nI write these DD's because I believe I have an enormous advantage in the current climate. I love to distribute knowledge, love the process of learning and I consider it one of my hobbies.\n\nI self-taught myself serverless and cloud computing technologies while I was in school and moved to California to pursue building my dream company in education technology. It also appears that the US is shifting toward increased Mexican trade, which I understand quite closely and have written about before.\n\nI love education and I love teaching - it is my passion. The intent here is to spur imagination and debate on the subject. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # Dropbox as an Education Company\n\n[Compliance is king](https://preview.redd.it/mil0bshb4qe51.png?width=2782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b42c5173e74ab83bd9cc38b115796a772c6d5b43)\n\nDropbox has a wonderful history introducing the masses to cloud computing applications. It solved a real file problem at the time - Apple and Microsoft files were not intuitive and there was a split in adoption. Academics of various ages needed an elegant solution and that was Dropbox. Think about that; users looked to solve a File Operating System problem using cloud computing in 2007. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDropbox is an education company. The best education technology companies are those that support the flow of education with high quality tooling rather than trying to replace it. Under this framework, I regularly invest in things like Autodesk, Adobe, and Dropbox as the companies have created an environment where IT school administrators will offer Creative Cloud, Autodesk, and Dropbox services under their student email.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are familiar with the American education system, you know that this is an absurdly slow dinosaur when it comes to getting changes in motion. Technology, as a result, has to execute in rather phenomenal way to even have a chance in the education space. This is why you'll see awfully accessible and robust technology exist in the space - Windows, Macs, Chromebooks, Khan Academy, Symbolab, Dropbox, Adobe, Autodesk, Oracle, Blackboard, Canvas, etc. They are convenient tools that pay a lot of attention to things like ADA (disabilities) compliance and the like.\n\nThere is a revolution occurring in education in the form of disabilities pedagogy (the study of how to teach). Unlocking a lot of understanding in children with non-verbal autism, PTSD, and other serious learning challenges is an enormous frontier in teaching, learning, and understanding human development. \\*\\*These technologies do not get in the way and exist to assist.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # Dropbox as a Technical Product\n\nThe File &amp; Storage system in any given operating system will always be critically important to a user and the need will always be larger than you can anticipate. It extends from IT safety, banking, education, supercomputing, and so on. Can you evaluate the amount of storage and data needed after Machine Learning tools have grown for 10 years? It can not be determined, but it can be anticipated. Organizations that have built their own distributed infrastructure are advantaged. One can reasonably assume that these companies will distribute the building blocks to their products. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xu67kf179qe51.png?width=2953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16a1ce179420a08750c5df246064f6eebdad30cc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note: the CEO is currently in the Board of Directors of Facebook - who is also looking into workspace applications \\*\\*SPECIFICALLY TO SOLVE LONG TERM WORK-FROM-HOME COMMUNICATIONS\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Workplace @ Facebook](https://preview.redd.it/vpcnvvru4qe51.png?width=3382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46b3f6da6502c53102a73047c4b13977f3d498b1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Workspace @ Dropbox](https://preview.redd.it/rr462ns25qe51.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb2ba0e8e4fcc2bc24e82129bd0e209bee2d55d8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is an enormous list of high-quality features that Dropbox offer due to its integration and infrastructure approach across multiple platforms:\n\n* \\- File security\n\n[banned by xi](https://preview.redd.it/mtg94ntd8qe51.png?width=1411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e62965952b2e9b876860beede13c106b59115f6)\n\n* \\- Signatures\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ewaxdbdl8qe51.png?width=2791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce09ff54bad22b1920a33326478f69e11171a81d\n\n* \\- Computer vision document scanning\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[OCR](https://preview.redd.it/0551mtwz8qe51.png?width=2413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22ec6a63fe1fe5935dea0d7c743ea4a202f7a393)\n\n* \\- Workspace expectations (file syncing, large file transfers, organization,IT controls)\n* \\- Link generators to leak those sweet unreleased albums through zoom [https://www.dropbox.com/s/36pz554f6ds5eyu/Uzi%20Wheezy%20Zoom.wav.m4a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/36pz554f6ds5eyu/Uzi%20Wheezy%20Zoom.wav.m4a?dl=0)\n* \\- File embedding \n* \\- Self-built storage infrastructure\n* \\- Deep industry wide integrations ranging from Zoom to Adobe\n* \\- Deep relationships in the education sector\n* \\- An unholy amount of other file solutions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hicx44ptdqe51.png?width=2547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc087db00260d31a49e3c33a32020848f9d91e05\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Compliance Advantage\n\nCloud computing is no longer a mystery, nor is it an open secret. It's a necessary supply chain tool, demanded, and growing faster than imaginations can keep up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work in the fintech industry. Let me tell you, compliance is everything. There is no Square, Paypal, Dropbox, Cloudflare, or any of your favorite important apps without various degrees of compliance. It would be much more helpful to view Square as an organization that distributes compliance to it's small businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \\- For Banking it's the Bank Secrecy Act and PATRIOT Act\n* \\- For Education it's FERPA\n* \\- For Healthcare it's HIPAA\n* \\- The list goes on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean? It's means that mature cloud companies like Cloudflare, Dropbox, and the like are in an excellent positions to \\*\\*satisfy the legal means to continue to grow at scale\\*\\*. This is an extremely important factor to consider in the next 5 years. **Dropbox is not something people \"get\" -  it's something that they're \"given\".** For example, when I signed my name to accept my first career job - I was given Dropbox's HelloSign to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cloud Computing Hierarchy of needs](https://preview.redd.it/s3hfokxg5qe51.png?width=2981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ff1c87c8db5802df55d7f4156ee9b9f2e4f23c4)\n\n[Compliance advantage in education](https://preview.redd.it/s1qhcdxj5qe51.png?width=3821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34678980f20b163d47ec041add6defae67720038)\n\n[Another example of compliance-focused approaches](https://preview.redd.it/6nhym58n5qe51.png?width=3821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bc8101854eaa2a29f643f630024be629b23b9de)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Monopoly Problem &amp; Integrations Competitors\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1d1vs3oy5qe51.png?width=1835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81db898c8bd65364d7b2162ede4daecd5455547e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverybody knows it. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple is a monopoly cluster on data. Breaking them up is not a complex equation. Much like the death of a drug or religious cartel; there are many other viable candidates eager to steer the wheel in another direction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is possible to compete against them, as evidence by organizations like Dropbox, Cloudflare, TikTok, Zoom, and the like. These smaller companies combining is what I consider the Unicorn Operating System. There opportunity is by distributing infrastructure to overwhelm larger companies that depend on acquisitions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is already happening. Zoom &amp; Dropbox distribute infrastructure.\n\n[Cloud Infrastructure is critical.](https://preview.redd.it/2entdn446qe51.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f486402438fd28382c109b7e3cc6c62483f99a1a)\n\n[Dropbox executing like a pioneer, similar to Paypal](https://preview.redd.it/wfli2evh6qe51.png?width=1834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7e0ac53777e81ff94736208493a873475eed8ef)\n\n# # Dropbox Financially\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7s08qzcdqe51.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9ad76618cd785e924f3e2203480903a9e681e0d\n\nThis part easy.

        "selftext": "Hi all! I am a 29M and still in school pursuing a PhD in the USA. I have no student loans/cc debt etc.  I am living off a stipend, but I manage to put aside $600 each month to invest. I just started investing a couple of months ago and since I am not confident about what I am doing, I opened two brokerage accounts, one with Robinhood and the other with Chase. The Chase account is an \u201caggressive\u201d (meaning approx. 90% stocks) portfolio account, in which the bank handles my entire portfolio and I simply put money in it every month. The RH account is, of course, handled by me. My idea is to continue this for a year or two and ultimately consolidate all my money into one account and close the other one, depending on which performs better. \n\nIn my RH account I have/planning to have the following stocks:\n\n**Technology:** GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, FB, AMZN, BABA, INTC, TSM, QCOM, NVDA\n\n**Finance:**  BAC, JPM, PYPL, BRK.B, V, AXP, C\n\n**Communications:** T, VZ\n\n**Consumer Discretionary:** PG, MCD, WMT, DIS, KO\n\n**Industrial:** BA, LMT, DAL, AER\n\n**Healthcare:** JNJ, UNH\n\nI do not plan to invest in ETFs as of now since I am young and able to take risks. Out of the $600 I am investing each month, $300 goes to my Chase investment account and $300 goes to my RH account. I am planning to DCA by investing an equal amount in each of the stock I own in RH, so I would like to own no more than 30 stocks, preferably 25.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1) Is my strategy of having an RH account and another investing account with Chase a good one? Or should I just stick to one or the other from the get-go? Will having two investment accounts be an issue when I file my taxes?\n\n2) Does my portfolio look good? Am I well / over-diversified? Am I missing some obvious sectors? I think I might end up with way too many similar companies e.g. INTC, TSM, QCOM, and NVDA which is not really diversification. Maybe I should just pick one out of all such companies?\n\nAny other advice/comments about my portfolio are welcome. TIA!",

Again, compare to other Fintechs, RKT is nearly the exact Median\n   * SHOP at $416k / employee\n   * GWRE at $276k / employee\n   * LMND at $251k / employee\n   * PYPL at $828k / employee\n* Now, let's look at the valuation for the other Fintechs. **RKT is very obviously undervalued compared to the segment**\n   * Enterprise Value / Revenue\n      * SHOP - 54.3x LTM Revenue\n      * GWRE - 11.7x LTM Revenue\n      * LMND - 44.3x LTM Revenue\n      * PYPL - 11.4x LTM Revenue\n      * **RKT - 2.2x LTM Revenue**\n   * P/E\n      * SHOP - N/A, negative EPS\n      * GWRE - 333x P/E\n      * LMND - N/A,negative EPS\n      * PYPL - 87x P/E\n      * **RKT - 7.7x P/E**\n\n**But, but, what about the mortgage volume? Isn't RKT exposed to interest rates and mortgage volume?**\n\nPlain and simple, there is no force that is going to stop volume right now. We can all say that fundamentals don't matter and for stock market pricing they may not. But in terms of interest rate action by the Fed, they very much do matter, and it is clear the Fed does not intend to raise rate until fundamentals truly stabilize. And if rates do come up, it will mean even J.Pow &amp; Co think inflation is getting too hot. Fuck SLV gang, **Real Estate is the ultimate anti-inflation safe-haven.** So volume should remain largely unaffected as investors seek inflation protection.\n\n**RKT continues to gain market share in an expanding market**\n\nLet's face it, eventually boomers will not be applying for new mortgages and millennials are not going to walk into Chase with a $100 fountain pen to apply for a mortgage. One of the biggest themes of the housing market today is increasing rate of home ownership among millenials. RKT's completely digitized offering positions them to capitalize on market trends. The numbers prove this as RKT's share of the total mortgage market has increased from 1.3% in 2009 to &gt;9% in the first quarter of 2020, making RKT the **largest mortgage originator in the US.**\n\n**RKT's technology drives faster, better outcomes for end consumer**\n\nRKT's application process can be understood as \"parallel\" vs. the traditional mortgage industry's \"linear\" process. This results in faster approvals and faster closing times. RKT closes loans 25% faster than the industry average - 29 days on average vs. the industry average of 40 days. Not only is this good for the end consumer (instant-gratification millennials), it means RKT's workforce is significantly more efficient than the industry average, closing average of **8.3 loans per month per team member** in YTD 2020 vs. the **industry average of 2.3 per moth per team member**\n\n**In summary, the retail mortgage industry is in desperate need of digitization. RKT is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this need.** After all, who else is going to do this? Penny-fucking-Mac?\n\nTLDR: Go long RKT, I am long shares and will continue to add on dips.",

        "selftext": "Since everyone has been talking about investing in SQ, I thought maybe we could start an open discussion about the risks of Square the business, whether or not we can continue to expect a skyrocketing share price in the years to come.\n\nI'll point out some things I'm iffy about, would like to get feedback on what you all think. Maybe there's things I'm not aware of.\n\n* Competitors. Square has a good product in an explosive growth industry, but I see their products easily replicable by Apple, Google, and PayPal. Should their business prove to have high demand and margins, there's no doubt FAANG giants will follow. Square has a head start, but do they have a competitive advantage? They have lots of commercial business data atm, but I'm doubtful of the value of that in today's market (more on that in my next point). They're beginning to collect consumer data, but imagine how much more data Visa and Mastercard has over them on that. Their technology is easily replicable by other big companies with enough resources to execute.\n* The limitations of the loan business. One of Square's most promising competitive advantages is that they provide loans to small businesses that show promising growth and room for expansion based on their revenue and profit which is logged into the Square system. There is an undeniable market of unserved small business owners that greatly benefit from this feature, but it's doubtful that this would unleash profits that wouldn't hit a low ceiling most of the time. For example, a hair salon can only purchase so many new salon chairs before they run out of customers to serve within that vicinity. Square could strike gold with a really profitable revolutionary small business, but I don't see why those businesses wouldn't be funded by VC's first before coming to Square. Even if they came to Square first, those businesses are one in a million. I do see Square making profits here, but not profits that would take them out of a niche player role.\n* The limitations of commercial business data. With current data limitations, it's impossible for Square's current technology to be an efficient evaluator of which businesses can achieve explosive growth and which ones will never escape low margins. There are too many non-numerical variables in determining a profitable business. Data technology and AI is not there yet.\n* Personal finance inertia. For Square to disrupt the banking industry, they need some clear advantage over banks. Why should we do the extra work of switching over if we are at an established bank? I'm not saying Square wouldn't be a better option than a traditional bank, but it takes a lot to turn the tide in an industry as conservative as the banking industry.\n\nFeel free to refute any of these concerns, maybe there's something really compelling to Square that I'm not seeing. If I'm wrong, I'd love to know.",

BigCommerce merchants can be among the  first  to adopt the new feature, which provides shoppers an intuitive,   seamless and secure way to purchase products they discover on Instagram   in a few clicks, without leaving the app.\n\nLeveraging   BigCommerce\u2019s native integration with Facebook Commerce Manager,   merchants can easily connect their ecommerce storefront\u2019s catalog to   Instagram and give customers the ability to buy from their favorite   brands directly on Instagram\u2014rather than navigating to a brand\u2019s website   to make a purchase\u2014and pay using PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, American   Express or Discover. After placing an order, customers can also use the   Instagram app to view their order status, estimated delivery date and   tracking number, as well as cancel orders, initiate returns or request   additional support.\n\n\"Creating  a  streamlined checkout experience is paramount for merchants looking to   social commerce to drive revenue growth. The rollout of checkout on   Instagram is another significant step in Instagram\u2019s evolution toward   becoming an essential commerce channel for customer-focused brands,\"   said Brent Bellm, chief executive officer at BigCommerce. \"BigCommerce   is proud to be one of a select group of partners to offer their   customers access to this innovative new feature at launch.\"\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bigcommerce-teams-facebook-unlock-checkout-150500474.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bigcommerce-teams-facebook-unlock-checkout-150500474.html)",

Sorry, wounds a little fresh right now. Heres how you buy wifes boyfriend a car, and it looks like a bunch of stuff from Wayfair(???)\n\n1) Open joint account. Why? I dunno. There was a reason. Surely.\n\n2) Divorce. Keep it clean and amicable. Have a transport truck show up at 3AM at CVS down the street. load them cars up. Oops, don't forget the dog.\n\n3) Hide in Mom's boathouse for a while. till thing blow over. Set boathouse on fire with shop light. become homeless at  - um, too old to \"become\" anything.\n\n4) Get shit together mostly. Fund old trading account.  YOLO everything, because sometimes you can't drink away all the regret.  Live in a shitty rental ($675) - drive a $2K car. Hate everybody - really get determined to lose money(AAL calls in April - WTF - switch to puts in June,\n\n5) Shower. Get a Peleton Delivered. Leave it in box. Buy online HGH and testosterone. Get first unsolicited chubby in two years. Discover through PayPal Peleton transaction that the trading account is still jointly held.\n\n6) This is the important part - reach out to ex, because ya'll are cool now and boyfriends don't have to hide in the garage anymore. Send some docs for her to sign. Wait while she orders checks and debit cards.. Get alert about unusual activity. Realize at least one of her boyfriends was smarter than you think. You lost $67k. Over a weekend. $37K of which went to a Dodge dealer.\n\nSo probably don't do joint accounts - problem is, trading on a joint account was the same stupid that enabled all my option plays.

I've dropped some of those lesser holdings, but I stock pick myself I also hold a few stocks that are not in Ark (such a LuLu, Doms Pizza, Visa, Disney etc). \n\nSo I'm up to 70 holdings (55 Ark,15 my picks), ranging from my top holding that is 8% of my portfolio, to the smaller more speculative holdings of about 0.5%.\n\nSometimes I think my portfolio is well diversified and 70 holdings is fine (some people just have a S&amp;P 500 or Nasdaq 100 tracker), sometimes I think I need to trim it down to about 40 to have it more concentrated, and increase my main holdings (Fangs, SQ, PayPal, Roku, Pins, Meli, and yes Tesla).\n\nOpinions please, taking into account that I don't need any money out of my portfolio for at least ten years, so although I'm the opposite of a value investor, I do believe in the Buffett way of buy and hold.

        "selftext": "There are 4 key pieces to understand why Ally Bank ($ALLY) is a massive opportunity right now. \n\n1.  Ally Bank offers an innovative disruption to traditional banks. Being all online, they can massively cut costs and use that extra money to improve their business for their customers. This can already be seen in their market leading high yield savings accounts, and in their 24 hour customer service. \n2. Ally has consistently delivered a great product and great service. All my friends who use them love them, and they've been recommended by Graham Stephan a number of times because of this.\n3. Ally's biggest competitive advantage has always been their online first business model. \n4. This business model is built perfectly for this current pandemic, and life afterwards. And we've clearly seen this already. E-commerce giants like Amazon and Shopify are up 50-100% from pre-covid highs, as are digital first fin tech companies like Square and Paypal. Essentially all internet companies have shot up during the pandemic. Except, for some reason, Ally. To date it's only recovered about 50% of it's pandemic losses, and is still well below its pre-covid highs, even though similar fin tech companies have nearly doubled their stock prices.\n\nI'm very open to discussion. Am I missing something? This seems like a stock that would've shot up with the rest of them, but it hasn't. What gives?\n\nTLDR: the market is overlooking Ally Bank and it provides a great buying opportunity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Disclaimer: I own shares in Ally",

I know that they are only making 60% a year on those $200 loans and those aren't higher than avg payday loans of 400-600% but still, their are more options even easier to get like credit cards with max may only get up to 27% I believe.

        "selftext": "(writing this to remind myself why i do what i do)\n\nThis year my portfolio has been whipsawed from a positive +5% in Feb to a massive swan dive in March and April  (i didn't dare look) and  -14% in May. It  turned positive in a few times in June and July. And now on 7th August, I am back to 02 Jan 2020 nos.\n\nI own 30 stocks, 10 of which comprise of 66% of the total portfolio. The next 20 stocks 15% and the reminder 19% is in Cash. I also didn't trade much, I did 11 trades, 8 of which was in Feb, and only 3 in the last few months.\n\nI started 2020 with 20% in cash, and after T-Mobile completed the transaction with Sprint, I sold it off and maintained cash between 25% and 30%. And now I am keeping around 20% cash in case I need to average down.\n\nThis year all my value stocks didn't do well. My overvalued technology stocks on the other hand, did better than expected. I also broke a rule twice, which is not to invest &gt;10% of my beginning portfolio in any stock. I did it to average down my cost on this two turnaround stocks.\n\nMy performance year to date is 0.8%. I didn't beat the S&amp;P 500 (+2.5%) but I fared better against the Dow (-5%)\n\nI really do not know what is going to happen in the next five months. Some people have suggested this is 1999 all over again ( the S&amp;P took 17 before it reached the August 1999 levels again), some have predicted gloom and doom and more people realize that Covid-19 will get worse before it gets better. \n\nMy strategy will be to employ the \\~ 20% cash onto my existing stocks. The internal debate I have right now is that I have been averaging down on my value stocks, why shouldn't I buy more of my stocks trending upwards  instead ? (To paraphrase Peter Lynch, add to winners instead of losers). I will need to think this deeply on this topic, as the answer isn't that simple as PL invested in fast growing stocks and not turn-arounds or value stocks. I also do not think it is mutually exclusive  to add to both.\n\nI have a long investing horizon.\n\nMy stocks / gain and losses since the beginning (&gt;5 years ago)\n\n    CUSIP\t\t% of portfolio\tGains/Loss \n    \t\t\t\t\n    AMZN\t\t6.39%\t\t628.66%\n    BIP\t\t0.75%\t\t67.40%\n    BPY\t\t0.56%\t\t-40.81%\n    BAM\t\t0.36%\t\t-28.11%\n    BIPC\t\t0.09%\t\t19.58%\n    BRK.B\t\t10.16%\t\t215.86%\n    CDK \t\t0.40%\t\t-21.97%\n    CPB\t\t0.49%\t\t45.21%\n    CMG\t\t1.76%\t\t269.63%\n    CRM\t\t1.03%\t\t173.41%\n    DB \t\t0.50%\t\t-52.43%\n    DIS\t\t2.46%\t\t441.90%\n    FB \t\t10.89%\t\t199.96%\n    GE\t\t10.15%\t\t-25.46%\n    JBT \t\t2.94%\t\t549.53%\n    JCI \t\t0.97%\t\t4.03%\n    JNJ\t\t0.66%\t\t134.35%\n    JPM\t\t1.93%\t\t71.64%\n    LYG\t\t0.76%\t\t-61.42%\n    MAIN\t\t0.31%\t\t-15.20%\n    MCO \t\t2.63%\t\t643.12%\n    MDLZ\t\t0.83%\t\t73.85%\n    MSFT \t\t4.29%\t\t667.34%\n    PYPL \t\t4.75%\t\t627.99%\n    RHHBY\t\t0.75%\t\t52.23%\n    SPOT\t\t0.63%\t\t85.69%\n    UL \t\t1.56%\t\t84.76%\n    WAB\t\t0.05%\t\t42.54%\n    NYSE:WFC-Q\t0.38%\t\t-3.79%\n    LON:LLOY\t11.49%\t\t-30.77%\n    Cash\t\t19.05%\t\t19.05%",

        "selftext": "You\u2019ve probably seen a rising trend of bullish posts about Nvidia recently, whether it\u2019s about recent acquisitions being included in revenue, its management, or the semiconductor industry in general.\n\nYesterday, Evening Standard reported that $NVDA has locked in a takeover of Arm Ltd. from SoftBank for a reported 40 billion.\n\nThe reason this is important is that Arm owns instructions-set architectures (ISAs) for the chips within nearly every smartphone, along with a handful of other products. Usually, this isn\u2019t an issue, since SoftBank would sell the rights to produce these chips to Apple, Qualcomm, and others for a fee. \n\n$NVDA, unlike SoftBank, is an actual semiconductor company. They could potentially limit access to their ISAs so that $NVDA can become the sole producer of those chips. Or, due to SoftBank being in the sinosphere and $NVDA being American, potential tensions could arise from the recent economic sanctions.\n\nEither way, considering that the deal is essentially locked in, $NVDA is flying straight to tendie town. Arm is a powerful player in the semiconductor industry, and its acquisition by $NVDA demonstrates that the company is making big moves to become more prevalent. $NVDA could theoretically lockdown a subsector of the semiconductor market by restricting access to chips under Arm\u2019s ISA. And if the Don requests $NVDA restrict Chinese access to the ISAs, you can bet that it will get a fucking BOATLOAD of government subsidies.\n\nTL;DR $NVDA 520c 9/18",

        "selftext": "Alright guys so I'm one of the hosts on a YouTube channel named \"Max Tech\".  \nI previously did YouTube work for the channel \"Appleinsider\" since 2016, making videos on Apple products which include Mac computers with Intel chips. \n\nI also grew up playing video games and building custom PCs right when AMD started to release six-core and 8-core processors that were cheaper than Intel CPUs and targeted towards gamers.  \n\nEven though the Intel chips were better for gaming, I still bought AMD because they were cheaper. Intel maintained the lead for many years since games really only used 4 cores, and Intel chips gave more consistent frame rates for gaming.\n\nAt one point, it was clear to me and to everyone else that Intel was intentionally holding off from innovating and improving their performance because they already owned a bulk of the market share. They realized that they could make more profit by making small improvements every year, while AMD was busting their ass trying to figure out how they can compete. (it was ultimately the gaming and custom PC market) \n\nMeanwhile.. Apple was using Intel chips quite successfully in their Mac computers the like MacBooks and iMacs. And Apple was also using their XEON chips for their higher-end machines. And of course, Intel was killing it in the server market.\n\nNow in 2013, Intel announced that they were working on their new 10nm chip process and that it should be ready to launch in 2015, and they said their 7nm chips should launch in 2017. \n\nBack to Intel, over the new few years, Intel delayed 10nm to 2016... and then to 2017.. and then to late 2019... We are now in 2020 and Intel is still shipping 14+++++ nm chips for high-end machines like the 2020 5K Apple iMac that was just released yesterday. Only laptops are getting the actual 10nm chips right now. \n\nIn 2017, AMD shocked the world by announcing their new Ryzen chips, and then also their Threadripper chips, and ever since then, they've been quickly catching up to Intel in terms of both performance and price. \n\nBecause of this, Intel instantly started lowering the price of their chips, and in 2018, they finally made 6-core chips for the MacBook Pro. 8-core chips in 2019, and now 10-core chips in 2020. This is an obvious and desperate move to try and compete with AMD. \n\nBecause Intel's 10nm chips were not ready in 2015 or 2016, Apple's redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro which was thinner than ever before, had overheating issues. The overheating was severe in 2018 with the 6-core chips that Intel made in fear of AMD. \n\nThere were even leaked emails from Intel executives worried about AMD's price to performance beating out Intel. \n\nAnd right now, it is well known that AMD is making BETTER price-to-performance x86 chips. \n\nThe MOST important part of this discussion is that the tech community as a whole, including or YouTube and Reddit, are now convinced that AMD is the way to go. I've seen countless comments on my videos that are dissing on Intel chips and wishing that Apple would switch to using Intel. \n\nIf we make a build guide video using an Intel processor, we get shamed and called dumb for not using an AMD chip. Our Mac Pro videos got a ton of negative feedback because Apple is stupid for using Intel chips. Our 2020 MacBook Pro videos were getting comments dissing on Intel's 10th-gen chips. The entire community is starting to hate Intel and preferring AMD.  \n\nAMD stock has increased over 11x since they announced the first Ryzen chips in August of 2016.  \nIntel stock has only increased 38% since that same date. \n\nAnd looking towards the future.. Intel has recently delayed their 7nm chips until late 2022 or 2023. This caused their stock price to tank at they last earnings call. \n\nThere's even now a class-action lawsuit against Intel because of this delay. \n\nThis also caused their chief of chip engineering to resign, and they reorganized their entire chip team. \n\nThey've even discussed outsourcing their future 6nm, 5nm and 3nm chip production to their rival foundry TSMC because they've lost confidence in their own foundry. \n\nSo it's clear that Intel is getting killed by AMD with each passing year, and the tech community knows it. (Which is VERY important)   \n\n\nThis brings us into the Apple and TSMC portion of this DD.   \n\n\nBack in 2013, Apple announced their A7 chip for their iPhone 5s, the first 64 bit smartphone chip, and ever since then, there was a massive performance war between Apple and Qualcomm, fighting to create the fastest smartphone chips, in which Apple ultimately won. \n\n(The A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro is still much faster than the Snapdragon 865+ which was just recently released this year) \n\nStuck in the middle of this battle was TSMC, which has been the EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Apple Silicon chips for their iPhones and iPads since the A10 chip in 2016. \n\nAnd in 2018, Apple released their 11\" iPad Pro with the A12X chip manufactured by TSMC's 7nm process. This iPad from 2 years ago is so powerful that it still outperforms the new 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with Intel's 10th gen chip in both processor AND graphics performance. \n\nNow, Apple is about to announce their iPhone 12 in about a month that's gonna pack the A14 chip which is being built on TSMC's brand new 5nm process. \n\nAnd of course, the next iPad Pro will get a much improved A14X 5nm chip, and it's the same story for the Apple Silicon Mac chips that will start being released later this year in October/November. \n\nI'm of course, talking about Apple finally ditching Intel and moving forward with their own chips. This makes sense for Apple for various different reasons.\n\n1: They can run iPhone &amp; iPad apps on their Macs.\n\n2: They control both the software and hardware for incredibly amounts of performance optimization.\n\n3: They can make sure every new Mac update gets a new chip with performance improvements instead of relying on Intel to release improved chips. \n\n4: This is of course, much cheaper for Apple since they don't have to pay Intel the high price of their chips. \n\n5: They don't have to deal with overheating issues since most Intel chips are still on 14nm technology, therefore running very hot and using a lot of power.   \n\n\nAnd there's a good chance that the very first Apple Silicon Mac chips are gonna outperform the current Intel chips, stay much cooler and give you much better battery life. \n\nJust to give you some perspective in terms of how Intel's 10nm compares to TSMC's 5nm..\n\nIntel 10nm transistor density: around 100 million transistors per square millimeter.\n\nTSMC 5nm transistor density: around 171 million transistors per square millimeter. \n\n  \nTSMC has already confirmed that they're working on risk production of their new 3nm process in 2021,  with those chips going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\nSo here's what the future looks like:\n\n  \nIntel 7nm in late 2022/2023 : 240 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nTSMC 3nm shipping in 2022 Apple products: 290 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nAnd apparently, TSMC is already working on plans for their 2nm process for 2024.   \n\n\nAnd due to Intel's past, there's a very good chance that Intel could delay 7nm even further, especially since they had to restructure their entire chip team, while TSMC has been on point.   \n\n\nSo the future isn't looking very bright for Intel's chip technology compared to TSMC. No wonder why they wanted to outsource their chips from them.   \n\n\nAnd one last bit on Apple's switch to their own chips built by TSMC. \n\nApple has already given developers their transition kit which is a Mac Mini with an A12Z chip from their iPad Pro. \n\nOne developer tweeted this: \"At this point, I think that the first gen Apple Silicon machines will be faster at running x86 code than an actual x86...\"  \n\n\nWhat he means is that Apple's new Rosetta 2 emulation software is so good that he thinks it'll outperform Intel chips even though it's not running natively for ARM. \n\nSo basically, Apple made the right choice by ditching Intel.   \n\n\nAnd if Apple proves everyone wrong by coming out with incredibly great Macs thanks to their switch to their own Apple Silicon ARM-based chips, then there's a VERY good chance that the rest of the market will follow them and start developing ARM-based chips for laptops.\n\nThis will force Windows to start heavily investing in their ARM-based Windows software. \n\nAnd if you didn't already know.. Intel is FAR behind in the ARM-based chip world.   \n\n\nNow, the most common argument I hear is this: Apple is only a tiny part of Intel's business, and while that may be true.. the MOST important thing is the public's view of Intel.  \n\n\nThe tech community is already starting to despise Intel as a brand name because of their overpriced processors and the fact that AMD is beginning to CRUSH them. \n\nJust wait until Apple Silicon Macs start getting released and people realize that ARM-chips have a ton of potential, and they'll start hating Intel even more. \n\nThis will cause Intel's brand recognition and reputation to get absolutely destroyed in favor of AMD and Apple Silicon. This alone will lead to less market share. And what will happen if Nvidia or Apple buy out ARM? \n\nAnd by the way, there are now more and more ARM-based servers popping up, so there's a good chance that Intel will start to lose market share on the server side if ARM-based servers prove themselves. (They use less power so this makes sense for server farms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is that Intel just got ditched by Apple.. and they're getting killed by AMD and TSMC. ARM is coming VERY quickly and Intel is NOT ready. They have been plagued with delay after delay, and all of this drama will ruin the confidence of their staff, leading to lowered productivity. It's not looking good for Intel for the long-term.  \n\n\nAs of right now, Intel stock is very cheap, and you might make a few bucks if you trade short term.. but I wouldn't hold Intel stock long term.   \n\n\nIf you want more in-depth info with visuals and extra details, you can check out two videos I made on the Max Tech Youtube channel: \n\n\"How Intel Lost the CPU Race..\"\n\n\"Apple Silicon ARM Chips vs Intel x86 Processors for Mac?\"\n\nHopefully you enjoyed this DD.",

AMD will hit $100 by Feb 2021.\n\nSamsung is ditching expensive Qualcom Snapdragon 875 chipset and they will be mounting Exynos 1000 chipset with AMD's RADEON GPU for the new Galaxy s21.\n\nQualcom announced their new Snapdragon 875 chipset to be at least 25% more expensive than previous generation. That is $250 phone manufactures have to pay. Smartphones are becoming more and more expensive, and most of the flagship phones cost around $1k. That price tag is too high for average Joe and this price will go higher as Qualcom increasing their chipset price.\n\nGoogle, Xiaomi, LG are all using Qualcom chipset and they will soon follow what Samsung is doing.\n\nAlso with screens getting bigger, more GPU power is needed.

        "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm back from my last DD: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4mgq1/intc\\_why\\_you\\_should\\_not\\_hold\\_intel\\_stock\\_long\\_term/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4mgq1/intc_why_you_should_not_hold_intel_stock_long_term/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)  \n\n\nI'll try and make this one a bit shorter.   \n\n\nVadim Yuryev here from the YouTube channel Max Tech.  \nI've been covering a lot of Apple products and Macs for the last 4 years ever since I started working for Appleinsider. \n\nAs you all know, Apple has recently announced that they're switching to their own custom Apple Silicon Mac chips, which will of course be built exclusively by TSMC on their brand new 5nm process (World's first)\n\nWhat most people don't know is that they've been working toward this transition for many years. For example, in 2017, they dropped 32 bit app support for iOS 11. In 2018, their macOS Mojave forced developers to use their Metal framework (That's why Nvidia cards don't work anymore in eGPUs) In 2019, macOS Catalina dropped support for 32 bit apps.\n\nThese 3 steps are incredibly important to the Apple Silicon Macs coming this Fall because one of the most important features is the ability to run completely unmodified iPhone and iPad apps on day 1, which of course, are 64 bit apps that run using the Metal framework on the current Apple Silicon chips. manufactured by TSMC. \n\nBecause of this, the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon chips is gonna be much more smooth compared to the previous transition from PowerPC to Intel chips. \n\nA major benefit for the future is that app developers can build apps that have most of the code shared across all Apple devices, which minor adjustments to get the UI to scale properly from the Mac, to the iPad, to the iPhone and of course the Apple TV.\n\nAnd a huge benefit will be the ability to fix bugs and optimize code for all platforms at once instead of having to do it all separately since the main code is shared.\n\nAnd unlike the last transition, Rosetta 2 can now translate x86 app code into ARM-supported code during the install time instead of using real-time emulation. And for plugins and drivers, Rosetta 2 emulates them as well.\n\nDevelopers who have been using Apple's Developer Transition Kit with the A12Z chip from the iPad Pro have already mentioned that Rosetta 2 works incredibly well, much better than expected:  \n[https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20](https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/never\\_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20](https://twitter.com/never_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20)\n\nAnd this is with the A12Z chip, which mind you, hasn't changed in terms of processing performance from the A12X chip from 2018. This is also a chip that comes in an iPad Pro that is thinner than any iPhone ever, and has absolutely zero active cooling. \n\nThat chip from 2018 currently outperforms Intel's brand new 10th-gen 10nm chip that came in the 2020 MacBook Pro in terms of both processing and Metal graphics performance.\n\nApple Silicon Macs will of course, have active fan cooling, and Apple has already stated that their Apple Silicon chips for their Macs will be a brand new family of chips, and each Mac will have a chip built specifically for it's enclosure and it's cooling capabilities.\n\nAnd Apple has mentioned that their Silicon has been built for years with easy scalability in mind, so they can add much more cores into the new Mac chips, especially since they'll have active fan cooling. \n\nBecause of the pandemic, Apple's original plans to release a new iPad Pro this Fall with the brand new A14X chip built on TSMC's new 5nm process and a new Mini-LED display were delayed, so that's why the released the 2020 iPad Pro in March, where they basically reused the A12X chip and rebranded it.\n\nSo right now, most investors have no idea how good the A14X is gonna be.\n\nThe A13 chip from last year's iPhones already performs incredibly well in terms of single-core performance, almost neck and neck with Intel's i9-9900K.\n\nThe new A14 chip will be a major improvement, due to being the first chip built on TSMC's 5nm chip.\n\nThere will also be an A14X chip will have a massive improvement over the current A12Z chip, and let me remind you that it will be in an iPad Pro that's thin and passively cooled.\n\nThis same 5nm technology is gonna be scaled up to fit active cooled Apple Silicon Mac computers, first coming into MacBooks like the MacBook Air and the 13\" MacBook Pro, and then into the redesigned 24\" iMac. \n\nOne of the first rumored chips will be a 12-core 5nm chip built by TSMC with 8 high performance cores and 4 efficiency cores. This will likely go into the MacBook Pro. \n\nI'm almost certain that it will outperform the previous Intel-based MacBook Pros in every way. And on top of that, the new Apple Silicon chips will come with Apple's Neural engine and machine learnings accelerations. Along with that, they'll get the same HEVC hardware accelerators as well, which is now becoming the standard for video recording. \n\nBasically, the point of all of this is that TSMC's new 5nm chips that will come in the Apple Silicon Macs are gonna be much faster than anyone is expecting, and those first Macs are rumored to be coming this October or November. \n\nThese chips will shake the entire industry due to the vast performance per watt improvements and the way Apple is gonna use them in terms of their Apple devices sharing the same code. \n\nAnd if Apple succeeds in this transition, there's a very good chance that the rest of the industry will start slowly switching to ARM-based chips, which TSMC is the leader in. (Intel is way behind in ARM chip technology)\n\nBecause of this, TSMC will be confirmed as the leader in chip-making technology, and investors will jump onboard.\n\nTheir main advantage is that they're the first to 5nm, and Samsung is currently having trouble with their 5nm process. Their Note 20 Ultra isn't launching with 5nm chips like people expected.  \n\"A new [report](https://www.zhitongcaijing.com/content/detail/324146.html) out of China (via [*GizmoChina*](https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/08/05/samsung-lost-qualcomm-5nm-orders-tsmc/)), however, suggests Samsung may have lost most, if not all, of that business to Taiwanese rival TSMC\"\n\n[https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875](https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875)\n\nSo Samsung is having trouble. Intel is having trouble, ordering wafers from TSMC. AMD is ordering wafers from TSMC. Qualcomm is ordering wafers from TSMC.\n\nTSMC is now becoming the Sony of the chip-making world. (Sony owns the camera sensor market by such a vast margin that a TON of cameras come with Sony sensors)\n\nWhat if TSMC becomes the next Sony and more companies rely on them for chips instead of investing into their own chip technology? \n\nSummary: Buy Long calls. Especially while the whole market is having a down day today. Buy the dip!\n\nPositions: TSM $100c 1/15/21",

        "selftext": "Microchip is a semiconductor company out of Arizona with a Mkt. Cap of about $26 Billion. They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",

You could've exited anytime on Friday for a profit except the last 15 mins of trading.  AAPL stock split enthusiasm and tiktok buyout rumors by MSFT(now canned) drove it past 325 eclipsing the stimulus paycheck pause\n\nLooking into next week, again for the SPY we need to think in terms of Geopolitik Say AMZN struck a deal in South Asia and MENA regions, they're set to dominate the ecommerce market there, oh just one problem. all the goods from vietnam / US can't get there because the South China Sea is being blockaded. Or GOOG invents an improvement to instant results, ie Mind Results, results pop up on your android even before you type anything, and it works on 50 different languages. Whoops won't matter if they are banned in Asia due to US loosing allies over there. Tiktok case is the reverse example of this.\n\nWho makes the most money ultimately comes down to who have MORE GUNS(and wins wars),  we will see how this play out over the next few months along with the rona pandemic. It's been this way for thousands of years ever since Roman times. This view is also echoed by the world's biggest Hedge Funds.\n\n***\"Ray Dalio's, chairman of Bridgewater capital(160B AUM) 2nd article on Geopolitics\"***\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-cycle-united-states-dollar-part-2-ray-dalio/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-cycle-united-states-dollar-part-2-ray-dalio/)\n\n&gt;Governance between countries is very different from governance within countries.  That is because within countries there are laws and standards of behavior that govern, whereas between countries raw power matters most, and laws, rules, and even mutually agreed treaties and organizations for arbitration such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization don't matter much.

        "selftext": "Hi all! I am a 29M and still in school pursuing a PhD in the USA. I have no student loans/cc debt etc.  I am living off a stipend, but I manage to put aside $600 each month to invest. I just started investing a couple of months ago and since I am not confident about what I am doing, I opened two brokerage accounts, one with Robinhood and the other with Chase. The Chase account is an \u201caggressive\u201d (meaning approx. 90% stocks) portfolio account, in which the bank handles my entire portfolio and I simply put money in it every month. The RH account is, of course, handled by me. My idea is to continue this for a year or two and ultimately consolidate all my money into one account and close the other one, depending on which performs better. \n\nIn my RH account I have/planning to have the following stocks:\n\n**Technology:** GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, FB, AMZN, BABA, INTC, TSM, QCOM, NVDA\n\n**Finance:**  BAC, JPM, PYPL, BRK.B, V, AXP, C\n\n**Communications:** T, VZ\n\n**Consumer Discretionary:** PG, MCD, WMT, DIS, KO\n\n**Industrial:** BA, LMT, DAL, AER\n\n**Healthcare:** JNJ, UNH\n\nI do not plan to invest in ETFs as of now since I am young and able to take risks. Out of the $600 I am investing each month, $300 goes to my Chase investment account and $300 goes to my RH account. I am planning to DCA by investing an equal amount in each of the stock I own in RH, so I would like to own no more than 30 stocks, preferably 25.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1) Is my strategy of having an RH account and another investing account with Chase a good one? Or should I just stick to one or the other from the get-go? Will having two investment accounts be an issue when I file my taxes?\n\n2) Does my portfolio look good? Am I well / over-diversified? Am I missing some obvious sectors? I think I might end up with way too many similar companies e.g. INTC, TSM, QCOM, and NVDA which is not really diversification. Maybe I should just pick one out of all such companies?\n\nAny other advice/comments about my portfolio are welcome. TIA!",

        "selftext": "Swaggy is back with his Sunday morning read of Unusual Options Activity. I get a lot of DMs asking about the activity, so if you want to read a bit about option flow, I made [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) describing how it works.\n\nIn addition, if you would like to check out the option flow tool and scan for yourself, here is the [option flow tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow).\n\nAs for unusual trades, it\u2019s been pretty quiet the last two weeks. Most flow is coming into big tech stocks and pumping them higher. I caught a few other smaller plays that I\u2019ll get into the details of here.\n\n**MSFT \u2013 Microsoft Corporation**\n\nMicrosoft has been a repeat name for some bullish flow in the last months. Looks like players have been opening bull call spreads with relatively medium-term expirations (end of the year) expecting the stock to continue it\u2019s slow rise up. The range of strike prices has been $215-$240. MSFT has been one of the companies looking to acquire TikTok in the latest rumors. Other names that have seen some similar flow last week were AMZN, FB, ADBE, and of course, AAPL.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tmrkvz3e4ri51.png?width=2150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5128bc760d4ad4905cf479242fa4be52c7dfcd5\n\n**NVDA \u2013 NVIDIA Corporation**\n\nNVDA reported earnings last week and although they blew estimates out of the water, the stock remained flat post-earnings. NVDA demonstrated some high growth in their server market and overall they have been one of the best performing tech stonks. Flow has been mixed, but leaning on the bullish side. Overall activity has picked up greatly since last week as traders could be expecting another move up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1klzg6ze4ri51.png?width=2430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d91676e3f077ecd17e9a2f2d604de2ac8b64563\n\n**QCOM \u2013 QUALCOMM Incorporated**\n\nQCOM is another semi-conductor company that has seen a good run over the last several months. Players placed bets that the company would continue it\u2019s steady rise up as demand for chips in a more data-driven world are becoming the new norm. A lot of calls were traded with strikes in the $105-$120 range. These mostly have expirations from November to January 2021, so they are mid-term in the timeframes and expectations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rv6wpktf4ri51.png?width=1610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f5f1ed70da42174709714410765d64535b69f56\n\n**ORCL \u2013 Oracle Corporation**\n\nORCL has seen an uptick in activity on the bullish side. Rumors are they are making a bid for the TikTok acquisition as well. ORCL\u2019s stock price has been somewhat stagnant over the last several months and they didn\u2019t rally as hard as the rest of big tech from the March lows. The option flow might indicate a bullish move in the future for this stock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6njzexg4ri51.png?width=2420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fcb092d4b6735bb223c38bedc6fff892e0e33f7\n\n**LYFT \u2013 Lyft Inc**\n\nLYFT and UBER have shut down service in California due to a new ruling that would require them to treat independent contractors as employees with benefits moving forward. Their rebuttal was to simply shut-down service and put the pressure back on the government to make their next move. Soon it will show that these ride-sharing companies have become a staple in our societal culture as they have made our lives so much easier. A whole slew of some pretty large calls were opened last week that was caught as bullish flow. I\u2019m not sure what the catalyst would be here, maybe it\u2019s because the stock is near the lows and shutting down service actually induces less losses on the company. Who knows.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pxz92li4ri51.png?width=2020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5eed0add829b6b63c17a73322ccab635ca8d309\n\n**DLTR \u2013 Dollar Tree Inc**\n\nDollar Tree caught some unusual call volume last week. Looks like players are betting on a 10% gain in the stock price with the October strike. These bets weren\u2019t unusually large in size, but for a company like DLTR they were pretty significant. The plays were sweeps at the $108 strike in Sept 25/Oct 02 expirations. The stock has had a decent run over the last several months and the players are expecting another leg up soon. We\u2019ll see about this one.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k3dkhbkj4ri51.png?width=1902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1de6a827de4fd6572df1600de3f839783271624\n\n**CRM \u2013 Salesforce**\n\nCRM/Salesforce has been a hot stock recently. There was some bullish flow earlier this month and again into last week. My scanner picked up two long position, although in my opinion it looks like a spread was opened (still bullish). The spread was actually opened when the stock was trading at $197, and it is currently $10 higher at $207. The player bought to open 11,000 calls at the $200 strike and sold 11,000 calls at the $220 strike, paying $9 million for the position. They are already profitable on their position, but if CRM closes above $220 by February, they will have a net profit of $22 million.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qkw6lpok4ri51.png?width=1612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cf3112c70a994a5724707e18b3376cb6490b43d\n\n**CZR \u2013 Caesars Entertainment Inc**\n\nCZR caught some bullish activity last week when players opened January and March 2021 calls. The stock has already had an unbelievable recovery from the March lows, but is still nowhere near the highs. Looks like as the country opens back up again (if it stays that way), they expect the company to continue it\u2019s good performance. Some of the bullish flow was put-selling, which suggests the stock will have already reached it\u2019s long-term bottom.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzkpssol4ri51.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7978edf9012a3334d7978075da93bac94215fd1",

        "selftext": "\n \nFor Trading August 12th\n \nTSLA 5:1 SPLIT\n \nGOLD / SILVER COLLAPSE\n \nDJIA CLOSES 450 OFF HIGH\n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a slightly higher start on DJIA and S&amp;P-500 but general weakness in the NASDAQ, again.  By the end of the day the DJIA -104.53 (.38%) was well off its +363 high and the NASDAQ was the big loser -185.54 (1.69%).  The S&amp;P 500 was -26.78 (.80) after being withing a few dollars of a new high, the Russell -9.57 (.6%), and the only winner the DJ Transports +24.59 (.23%).  Market internals were 1:1 on the NYSE but 1.5:1 down on the NASDAQ.  Volume was slightly higher than average for an August day.  The major feature of the day was the massive selloff in the precious metals.  Gold was down $125/oz. at the low and finished $1946.30 -93.40 (6%) while the Silver was lower by $3.21 to $26.049 after hitting an intraday low of $24.48.  The change at the close was 12%.  I would assume that we would see some follow-thru tonight and tomorrow early, but I bought the NEM September $65 / 70 call spread for $1.45.  This is basically the same trade I made last month on the August expo $60/65 spread @ $1.30 that we sold @ $3.20.  We also had the TBT 9/18 15 calls @ $ .40 that we sold today half @ $ .68, and the second half @ $ .74 just before they fell back to $ .55.  Not bad, with YTD now back to +34%.\n \n\nTonight\u2019s closing comment video  https://youtu.be/EvsCZy_K1sw\n\n\nSECTORS: We didn\u2019t have much corporate news today but QCOM won an appeals court ruling on an anti-trust case and the stock ignored the selloff and finished the day $108.83 +2.47 (2.3%).  That made it a standout as the rest of technology was hit hard again today.  It was the 3rd day down for the NASDAQ since its new closing high at $11,108.07 last Thursday.\nThe biggest news of the late day was the announcement that TESLA (TSLA) declared a 5:1 stock split.  While this is really just straight arithmetic, it does create some demand for the shares now, since when the stock split becomes effective at the end of August you would have 5 times the shares at 1/5 of the price.  But it does promote the purchase of \u201cround lots\u201d as opposed to \u201codd lots.\u201d  Does it really increase demand?  Not really, but most stocks (like AAPL) do seem to rise on the news.  TSLA certainly did, closing $1374 -44, and then on the news rallied to its current $1467.20, over $90 higher.\nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN +.82, BGS -.46, FLO +.20, CPB -.63, CAG -.49, MDLZ -.49, KHC -.16, CALM +.19, JJSF -.35, SAFM +2.10, HRL -.31, SJM -.84, PPC +.27, KR -.58, and PBJ #33.32 -.37 (1.13%).\n \nBIOPHARMA was LOWER with BIIB -10.32, ABBV +.19, REGN -9.38, ISRG -8.00, GILD +.35, MYL +.39, TEVA -.07, VRTX -6.87, BHC +.16, INCY -1.32, ICPT -.25, LABU -6.96, and IBB $132.28-2.59 (1.92%).\nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.95, CGC -.54, CRON -.06, GWPH -3.52, ACB -.14, NBEV -.02, CURLF -.38, KERN -.29, and MJ $12.95 +.01 (.08%).\n\nDEFENSE:  was HIGHER with LMT +3.03, GD +2.94, TXT -.18, NOC +6.27, BWXT +.22, TDY +1.75, RTX +.16, and ITA $172.14 +.91 (.53%).\n\n \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with M -.16, JWN +.07, KSS +.55, DDS +.66, WMT -1.33, TGT -1.22, TJX +1.08, RL +1.77, UAA +.27, LULU -8.95, TPR +.12, CPRI +.31, and XRT $50.60 -.39 (.76%).\n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL -12.81, AMZN -63.15, AAPL -10.52, FB -5.50, NFLX -14.89, NVDA -10.20, TSLA +50.43, BABA +.87, BIDU +.08, CMG -11.00, CAT +1.23, MSFT -3.,85, BA +.98, DIS +1.86, and XLK $112.00 -1.42 (1.25%).\nPLEASE BE AWARE THAT THESE PRICES ARE LATE MARKET QUOTES AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE 4:00 CLOSES.\n \n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +2.42, JPM +3.58, BAC +.47, MS +1.22, C +1.17, PNC +3.32, AIG +.52, TRV +.80, AXP +1.70, V +1.46, and XLF $25.31 +.29 (1.16%).\n \nOIL, $41.61 -.33. Oil was higher in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied in the morning on news of production cutbacks from Iraq. The stocks were HIGHER with XLE $38.20 -.13 (.34%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,946.30 -93.40, was a continuation rally and a new recovery high of $2,089.20, but we collapsed and fell as far as $1,919 -124 before coming back slightly.  Tonight, we are currently trading lower again at $1,915.70 \u2013 30.00.  While I like the gold down here, I will have to wait and see how it acts overnight.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $11,435 -580. After breaking out over $10,000 we have had a \u201crunning correction\u201d pushing prices toward $12,000, reaching a recovery high of $12220 yesterday. We had added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97, but sold 250 shares today @ $13.93. GBTC closed $12.54 -1.15 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "Alright guys so I'm one of the hosts on a YouTube channel named \"Max Tech\".  \nI previously did YouTube work for the channel \"Appleinsider\" since 2016, making videos on Apple products which include Mac computers with Intel chips. \n\nI also grew up playing video games and building custom PCs right when AMD started to release six-core and 8-core processors that were cheaper than Intel CPUs and targeted towards gamers.  \n\nEven though the Intel chips were better for gaming, I still bought AMD because they were cheaper. Intel maintained the lead for many years since games really only used 4 cores, and Intel chips gave more consistent frame rates for gaming.\n\nAt one point, it was clear to me and to everyone else that Intel was intentionally holding off from innovating and improving their performance because they already owned a bulk of the market share. They realized that they could make more profit by making small improvements every year, while AMD was busting their ass trying to figure out how they can compete. (it was ultimately the gaming and custom PC market) \n\nMeanwhile.. Apple was using Intel chips quite successfully in their Mac computers the like MacBooks and iMacs. And Apple was also using their XEON chips for their higher-end machines. And of course, Intel was killing it in the server market.\n\nNow in 2013, Intel announced that they were working on their new 10nm chip process and that it should be ready to launch in 2015, and they said their 7nm chips should launch in 2017. \n\nBack to Intel, over the new few years, Intel delayed 10nm to 2016... and then to 2017.. and then to late 2019... We are now in 2020 and Intel is still shipping 14+++++ nm chips for high-end machines like the 2020 5K Apple iMac that was just released yesterday. Only laptops are getting the actual 10nm chips right now. \n\nIn 2017, AMD shocked the world by announcing their new Ryzen chips, and then also their Threadripper chips, and ever since then, they've been quickly catching up to Intel in terms of both performance and price. \n\nBecause of this, Intel instantly started lowering the price of their chips, and in 2018, they finally made 6-core chips for the MacBook Pro. 8-core chips in 2019, and now 10-core chips in 2020. This is an obvious and desperate move to try and compete with AMD. \n\nBecause Intel's 10nm chips were not ready in 2015 or 2016, Apple's redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro which was thinner than ever before, had overheating issues. The overheating was severe in 2018 with the 6-core chips that Intel made in fear of AMD. \n\nThere were even leaked emails from Intel executives worried about AMD's price to performance beating out Intel. \n\nAnd right now, it is well known that AMD is making BETTER price-to-performance x86 chips. \n\nThe MOST important part of this discussion is that the tech community as a whole, including or YouTube and Reddit, are now convinced that AMD is the way to go. I've seen countless comments on my videos that are dissing on Intel chips and wishing that Apple would switch to using Intel. \n\nIf we make a build guide video using an Intel processor, we get shamed and called dumb for not using an AMD chip. Our Mac Pro videos got a ton of negative feedback because Apple is stupid for using Intel chips. Our 2020 MacBook Pro videos were getting comments dissing on Intel's 10th-gen chips. The entire community is starting to hate Intel and preferring AMD.  \n\nAMD stock has increased over 11x since they announced the first Ryzen chips in August of 2016.  \nIntel stock has only increased 38% since that same date. \n\nAnd looking towards the future.. Intel has recently delayed their 7nm chips until late 2022 or 2023. This caused their stock price to tank at they last earnings call. \n\nThere's even now a class-action lawsuit against Intel because of this delay. \n\nThis also caused their chief of chip engineering to resign, and they reorganized their entire chip team. \n\nThey've even discussed outsourcing their future 6nm, 5nm and 3nm chip production to their rival foundry TSMC because they've lost confidence in their own foundry. \n\nSo it's clear that Intel is getting killed by AMD with each passing year, and the tech community knows it. (Which is VERY important)   \n\n\nThis brings us into the Apple and TSMC portion of this DD.   \n\n\nBack in 2013, Apple announced their A7 chip for their iPhone 5s, the first 64 bit smartphone chip, and ever since then, there was a massive performance war between Apple and Qualcomm, fighting to create the fastest smartphone chips, in which Apple ultimately won. \n\n(The A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro is still much faster than the Snapdragon 865+ which was just recently released this year) \n\nStuck in the middle of this battle was TSMC, which has been the EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Apple Silicon chips for their iPhones and iPads since the A10 chip in 2016. \n\nAnd in 2018, Apple released their 11\" iPad Pro with the A12X chip manufactured by TSMC's 7nm process. This iPad from 2 years ago is so powerful that it still outperforms the new 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with Intel's 10th gen chip in both processor AND graphics performance. \n\nNow, Apple is about to announce their iPhone 12 in about a month that's gonna pack the A14 chip which is being built on TSMC's brand new 5nm process. \n\nAnd of course, the next iPad Pro will get a much improved A14X 5nm chip, and it's the same story for the Apple Silicon Mac chips that will start being released later this year in October/November. \n\nI'm of course, talking about Apple finally ditching Intel and moving forward with their own chips. This makes sense for Apple for various different reasons.\n\n1: They can run iPhone &amp; iPad apps on their Macs.\n\n2: They control both the software and hardware for incredibly amounts of performance optimization.\n\n3: They can make sure every new Mac update gets a new chip with performance improvements instead of relying on Intel to release improved chips. \n\n4: This is of course, much cheaper for Apple since they don't have to pay Intel the high price of their chips. \n\n5: They don't have to deal with overheating issues since most Intel chips are still on 14nm technology, therefore running very hot and using a lot of power.   \n\n\nAnd there's a good chance that the very first Apple Silicon Mac chips are gonna outperform the current Intel chips, stay much cooler and give you much better battery life. \n\nJust to give you some perspective in terms of how Intel's 10nm compares to TSMC's 5nm..\n\nIntel 10nm transistor density: around 100 million transistors per square millimeter.\n\nTSMC 5nm transistor density: around 171 million transistors per square millimeter. \n\n  \nTSMC has already confirmed that they're working on risk production of their new 3nm process in 2021,  with those chips going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\nSo here's what the future looks like:\n\n  \nIntel 7nm in late 2022/2023 : 240 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nTSMC 3nm shipping in 2022 Apple products: 290 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nAnd apparently, TSMC is already working on plans for their 2nm process for 2024.   \n\n\nAnd due to Intel's past, there's a very good chance that Intel could delay 7nm even further, especially since they had to restructure their entire chip team, while TSMC has been on point.   \n\n\nSo the future isn't looking very bright for Intel's chip technology compared to TSMC. No wonder why they wanted to outsource their chips from them.   \n\n\nAnd one last bit on Apple's switch to their own chips built by TSMC. \n\nApple has already given developers their transition kit which is a Mac Mini with an A12Z chip from their iPad Pro. \n\nOne developer tweeted this: \"At this point, I think that the first gen Apple Silicon machines will be faster at running x86 code than an actual x86...\"  \n\n\nWhat he means is that Apple's new Rosetta 2 emulation software is so good that he thinks it'll outperform Intel chips even though it's not running natively for ARM. \n\nSo basically, Apple made the right choice by ditching Intel.   \n\n\nAnd if Apple proves everyone wrong by coming out with incredibly great Macs thanks to their switch to their own Apple Silicon ARM-based chips, then there's a VERY good chance that the rest of the market will follow them and start developing ARM-based chips for laptops.\n\nThis will force Windows to start heavily investing in their ARM-based Windows software. \n\nAnd if you didn't already know.. Intel is FAR behind in the ARM-based chip world.   \n\n\nNow, the most common argument I hear is this: Apple is only a tiny part of Intel's business, and while that may be true.. the MOST important thing is the public's view of Intel.  \n\n\nThe tech community is already starting to despise Intel as a brand name because of their overpriced processors and the fact that AMD is beginning to CRUSH them. \n\nJust wait until Apple Silicon Macs start getting released and people realize that ARM-chips have a ton of potential, and they'll start hating Intel even more. \n\nThis will cause Intel's brand recognition and reputation to get absolutely destroyed in favor of AMD and Apple Silicon. This alone will lead to less market share. And what will happen if Nvidia or Apple buy out ARM? \n\nAnd by the way, there are now more and more ARM-based servers popping up, so there's a good chance that Intel will start to lose market share on the server side if ARM-based servers prove themselves. (They use less power so this makes sense for server farms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is that Intel just got ditched by Apple.. and they're getting killed by AMD and TSMC. ARM is coming VERY quickly and Intel is NOT ready. They have been plagued with delay after delay, and all of this drama will ruin the confidence of their staff, leading to lowered productivity. It's not looking good for Intel for the long-term.  \n\n\nAs of right now, Intel stock is very cheap, and you might make a few bucks if you trade short term.. but I wouldn't hold Intel stock long term.   \n\n\nIf you want more in-depth info with visuals and extra details, you can check out two videos I made on the Max Tech Youtube channel: \n\n\"How Intel Lost the CPU Race..\"\n\n\"Apple Silicon ARM Chips vs Intel x86 Processors for Mac?\"\n\nHopefully you enjoyed this DD.",

AMD will hit $100 by Feb 2021.\n\nSamsung is ditching expensive Qualcom Snapdragon 875 chipset and they will be mounting Exynos 1000 chipset with AMD's RADEON GPU for the new Galaxy s21.\n\nQualcom announced their new Snapdragon 875 chipset to be at least 25% more expensive than previous generation. That is $250 phone manufactures have to pay. Smartphones are becoming more and more expensive, and most of the flagship phones cost around $1k. That price tag is too high for average Joe and this price will go higher as Qualcom increasing their chipset price.\n\nGoogle, Xiaomi, LG are all using Qualcom chipset and they will soon follow what Samsung is doing.\n\nAlso with screens getting bigger, more GPU power is needed.

        "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm back from my last DD: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4mgq1/intc\\_why\\_you\\_should\\_not\\_hold\\_intel\\_stock\\_long\\_term/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4mgq1/intc_why_you_should_not_hold_intel_stock_long_term/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)  \n\n\nI'll try and make this one a bit shorter.   \n\n\nVadim Yuryev here from the YouTube channel Max Tech.  \nI've been covering a lot of Apple products and Macs for the last 4 years ever since I started working for Appleinsider. \n\nAs you all know, Apple has recently announced that they're switching to their own custom Apple Silicon Mac chips, which will of course be built exclusively by TSMC on their brand new 5nm process (World's first)\n\nWhat most people don't know is that they've been working toward this transition for many years. For example, in 2017, they dropped 32 bit app support for iOS 11. In 2018, their macOS Mojave forced developers to use their Metal framework (That's why Nvidia cards don't work anymore in eGPUs) In 2019, macOS Catalina dropped support for 32 bit apps.\n\nThese 3 steps are incredibly important to the Apple Silicon Macs coming this Fall because one of the most important features is the ability to run completely unmodified iPhone and iPad apps on day 1, which of course, are 64 bit apps that run using the Metal framework on the current Apple Silicon chips. manufactured by TSMC. \n\nBecause of this, the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon chips is gonna be much more smooth compared to the previous transition from PowerPC to Intel chips. \n\nA major benefit for the future is that app developers can build apps that have most of the code shared across all Apple devices, which minor adjustments to get the UI to scale properly from the Mac, to the iPad, to the iPhone and of course the Apple TV.\n\nAnd a huge benefit will be the ability to fix bugs and optimize code for all platforms at once instead of having to do it all separately since the main code is shared.\n\nAnd unlike the last transition, Rosetta 2 can now translate x86 app code into ARM-supported code during the install time instead of using real-time emulation. And for plugins and drivers, Rosetta 2 emulates them as well.\n\nDevelopers who have been using Apple's Developer Transition Kit with the A12Z chip from the iPad Pro have already mentioned that Rosetta 2 works incredibly well, much better than expected:  \n[https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20](https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/never\\_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20](https://twitter.com/never_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20)\n\nAnd this is with the A12Z chip, which mind you, hasn't changed in terms of processing performance from the A12X chip from 2018. This is also a chip that comes in an iPad Pro that is thinner than any iPhone ever, and has absolutely zero active cooling. \n\nThat chip from 2018 currently outperforms Intel's brand new 10th-gen 10nm chip that came in the 2020 MacBook Pro in terms of both processing and Metal graphics performance.\n\nApple Silicon Macs will of course, have active fan cooling, and Apple has already stated that their Apple Silicon chips for their Macs will be a brand new family of chips, and each Mac will have a chip built specifically for it's enclosure and it's cooling capabilities.\n\nAnd Apple has mentioned that their Silicon has been built for years with easy scalability in mind, so they can add much more cores into the new Mac chips, especially since they'll have active fan cooling. \n\nBecause of the pandemic, Apple's original plans to release a new iPad Pro this Fall with the brand new A14X chip built on TSMC's new 5nm process and a new Mini-LED display were delayed, so that's why the released the 2020 iPad Pro in March, where they basically reused the A12X chip and rebranded it.\n\nSo right now, most investors have no idea how good the A14X is gonna be.\n\nThe A13 chip from last year's iPhones already performs incredibly well in terms of single-core performance, almost neck and neck with Intel's i9-9900K.\n\nThe new A14 chip will be a major improvement, due to being the first chip built on TSMC's 5nm chip.\n\nThere will also be an A14X chip will have a massive improvement over the current A12Z chip, and let me remind you that it will be in an iPad Pro that's thin and passively cooled.\n\nThis same 5nm technology is gonna be scaled up to fit active cooled Apple Silicon Mac computers, first coming into MacBooks like the MacBook Air and the 13\" MacBook Pro, and then into the redesigned 24\" iMac. \n\nOne of the first rumored chips will be a 12-core 5nm chip built by TSMC with 8 high performance cores and 4 efficiency cores. This will likely go into the MacBook Pro. \n\nI'm almost certain that it will outperform the previous Intel-based MacBook Pros in every way. And on top of that, the new Apple Silicon chips will come with Apple's Neural engine and machine learnings accelerations. Along with that, they'll get the same HEVC hardware accelerators as well, which is now becoming the standard for video recording. \n\nBasically, the point of all of this is that TSMC's new 5nm chips that will come in the Apple Silicon Macs are gonna be much faster than anyone is expecting, and those first Macs are rumored to be coming this October or November. \n\nThese chips will shake the entire industry due to the vast performance per watt improvements and the way Apple is gonna use them in terms of their Apple devices sharing the same code. \n\nAnd if Apple succeeds in this transition, there's a very good chance that the rest of the industry will start slowly switching to ARM-based chips, which TSMC is the leader in. (Intel is way behind in ARM chip technology)\n\nBecause of this, TSMC will be confirmed as the leader in chip-making technology, and investors will jump onboard.\n\nTheir main advantage is that they're the first to 5nm, and Samsung is currently having trouble with their 5nm process. Their Note 20 Ultra isn't launching with 5nm chips like people expected.  \n\"A new [report](https://www.zhitongcaijing.com/content/detail/324146.html) out of China (via [*GizmoChina*](https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/08/05/samsung-lost-qualcomm-5nm-orders-tsmc/)), however, suggests Samsung may have lost most, if not all, of that business to Taiwanese rival TSMC\"\n\n[https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875](https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875)\n\nSo Samsung is having trouble. Intel is having trouble, ordering wafers from TSMC. AMD is ordering wafers from TSMC. Qualcomm is ordering wafers from TSMC.\n\nTSMC is now becoming the Sony of the chip-making world. (Sony owns the camera sensor market by such a vast margin that a TON of cameras come with Sony sensors)\n\nWhat if TSMC becomes the next Sony and more companies rely on them for chips instead of investing into their own chip technology? \n\nSummary: Buy Long calls. Especially while the whole market is having a down day today. Buy the dip!\n\nPositions: TSM $100c 1/15/21",

        "selftext": "Microchip is a semiconductor company out of Arizona with a Mkt. Cap of about $26 Billion. They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",

That is because within countries there are laws and standards of behavior that govern, whereas between countries raw power matters most, and laws, rules, and even mutually agreed treaties and organizations for arbitration such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization don't matter much.  Operating internationally is like operating in a jungle in which there is survival of the fittest and most anything goes.  That is what makes having a strong military so important.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Where the US Is in Its Big Cycle The stats seem to suggest that the US is roughly 75% through that cycle, +/- 10%.

        "selftext": "Hi all! I am a 29M and still in school pursuing a PhD in the USA. I have no student loans/cc debt etc.  I am living off a stipend, but I manage to put aside $600 each month to invest. I just started investing a couple of months ago and since I am not confident about what I am doing, I opened two brokerage accounts, one with Robinhood and the other with Chase. The Chase account is an \u201caggressive\u201d (meaning approx. 90% stocks) portfolio account, in which the bank handles my entire portfolio and I simply put money in it every month. The RH account is, of course, handled by me. My idea is to continue this for a year or two and ultimately consolidate all my money into one account and close the other one, depending on which performs better. \n\nIn my RH account I have/planning to have the following stocks:\n\n**Technology:** GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, FB, AMZN, BABA, INTC, TSM, QCOM, NVDA\n\n**Finance:**  BAC, JPM, PYPL, BRK.B, V, AXP, C\n\n**Communications:** T, VZ\n\n**Consumer Discretionary:** PG, MCD, WMT, DIS, KO\n\n**Industrial:** BA, LMT, DAL, AER\n\n**Healthcare:** JNJ, UNH\n\nI do not plan to invest in ETFs as of now since I am young and able to take risks. Out of the $600 I am investing each month, $300 goes to my Chase investment account and $300 goes to my RH account. I am planning to DCA by investing an equal amount in each of the stock I own in RH, so I would like to own no more than 30 stocks, preferably 25.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1) Is my strategy of having an RH account and another investing account with Chase a good one? Or should I just stick to one or the other from the get-go? Will having two investment accounts be an issue when I file my taxes?\n\n2) Does my portfolio look good? Am I well / over-diversified? Am I missing some obvious sectors? I think I might end up with way too many similar companies e.g. INTC, TSM, QCOM, and NVDA which is not really diversification. Maybe I should just pick one out of all such companies?\n\nAny other advice/comments about my portfolio are welcome. TIA!",

        "selftext": "\n \nFor Trading August 12th\n \nTSLA 5:1 SPLIT\n \nGOLD / SILVER COLLAPSE\n \nDJIA CLOSES 450 OFF HIGH\n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a slightly higher start on DJIA and S&amp;P-500 but general weakness in the NASDAQ, again.  By the end of the day the DJIA -104.53 (.38%) was well off its +363 high and the NASDAQ was the big loser -185.54 (1.69%).  The S&amp;P 500 was -26.78 (.80) after being withing a few dollars of a new high, the Russell -9.57 (.6%), and the only winner the DJ Transports +24.59 (.23%).  Market internals were 1:1 on the NYSE but 1.5:1 down on the NASDAQ.  Volume was slightly higher than average for an August day.  The major feature of the day was the massive selloff in the precious metals.  Gold was down $125/oz. at the low and finished $1946.30 -93.40 (6%) while the Silver was lower by $3.21 to $26.049 after hitting an intraday low of $24.48.  The change at the close was 12%.  I would assume that we would see some follow-thru tonight and tomorrow early, but I bought the NEM September $65 / 70 call spread for $1.45.  This is basically the same trade I made last month on the August expo $60/65 spread @ $1.30 that we sold @ $3.20.  We also had the TBT 9/18 15 calls @ $ .40 that we sold today half @ $ .68, and the second half @ $ .74 just before they fell back to $ .55.  Not bad, with YTD now back to +34%.\n \n\nTonight\u2019s closing comment video  https://youtu.be/EvsCZy_K1sw\n\n\nSECTORS: We didn\u2019t have much corporate news today but QCOM won an appeals court ruling on an anti-trust case and the stock ignored the selloff and finished the day $108.83 +2.47 (2.3%).  That made it a standout as the rest of technology was hit hard again today.  It was the 3rd day down for the NASDAQ since its new closing high at $11,108.07 last Thursday.\nThe biggest news of the late day was the announcement that TESLA (TSLA) declared a 5:1 stock split.  While this is really just straight arithmetic, it does create some demand for the shares now, since when the stock split becomes effective at the end of August you would have 5 times the shares at 1/5 of the price.  But it does promote the purchase of \u201cround lots\u201d as opposed to \u201codd lots.\u201d  Does it really increase demand?  Not really, but most stocks (like AAPL) do seem to rise on the news.  TSLA certainly did, closing $1374 -44, and then on the news rallied to its current $1467.20, over $90 higher.\nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN +.82, BGS -.46, FLO +.20, CPB -.63, CAG -.49, MDLZ -.49, KHC -.16, CALM +.19, JJSF -.35, SAFM +2.10, HRL -.31, SJM -.84, PPC +.27, KR -.58, and PBJ #33.32 -.37 (1.13%).\n \nBIOPHARMA was LOWER with BIIB -10.32, ABBV +.19, REGN -9.38, ISRG -8.00, GILD +.35, MYL +.39, TEVA -.07, VRTX -6.87, BHC +.16, INCY -1.32, ICPT -.25, LABU -6.96, and IBB $132.28-2.59 (1.92%).\nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.95, CGC -.54, CRON -.06, GWPH -3.52, ACB -.14, NBEV -.02, CURLF -.38, KERN -.29, and MJ $12.95 +.01 (.08%).\n\nDEFENSE:  was HIGHER with LMT +3.03, GD +2.94, TXT -.18, NOC +6.27, BWXT +.22, TDY +1.75, RTX +.16, and ITA $172.14 +.91 (.53%).\n\n \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with M -.16, JWN +.07, KSS +.55, DDS +.66, WMT -1.33, TGT -1.22, TJX +1.08, RL +1.77, UAA +.27, LULU -8.95, TPR +.12, CPRI +.31, and XRT $50.60 -.39 (.76%).\n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL -12.81, AMZN -63.15, AAPL -10.52, FB -5.50, NFLX -14.89, NVDA -10.20, TSLA +50.43, BABA +.87, BIDU +.08, CMG -11.00, CAT +1.23, MSFT -3.,85, BA +.98, DIS +1.86, and XLK $112.00 -1.42 (1.25%).\nPLEASE BE AWARE THAT THESE PRICES ARE LATE MARKET QUOTES AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE 4:00 CLOSES.\n \n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +2.42, JPM +3.58, BAC +.47, MS +1.22, C +1.17, PNC +3.32, AIG +.52, TRV +.80, AXP +1.70, V +1.46, and XLF $25.31 +.29 (1.16%).\n \nOIL, $41.61 -.33. Oil was higher in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied in the morning on news of production cutbacks from Iraq. The stocks were HIGHER with XLE $38.20 -.13 (.34%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,946.30 -93.40, was a continuation rally and a new recovery high of $2,089.20, but we collapsed and fell as far as $1,919 -124 before coming back slightly.  Tonight, we are currently trading lower again at $1,915.70 \u2013 30.00.  While I like the gold down here, I will have to wait and see how it acts overnight.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $11,435 -580. After breaking out over $10,000 we have had a \u201crunning correction\u201d pushing prices toward $12,000, reaching a recovery high of $12220 yesterday. We had added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97, but sold 250 shares today @ $13.93. GBTC closed $12.54 -1.15 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "Microchip is a semiconductor company out of Arizona with a Mkt. Cap of about $26 Billion. They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",

        "selftext": "I tried posting in the quarterly thread but didn\u2019t get any attention. \n\nLooking for a little discussion/direction. I have a business minor, a good understanding of personal finance, am quite experienced in funding my own retirement accounts and understanding their tax implications. However, I\u2019ve just never bothered to take the time to get into really buckling down for the stock market. I\u2019m in my 20s and mostly started picking my stock game up during March - I\u2019ve bought stuff in the past, particularly penny stocks while taking finance classes in college. Here\u2019s what I have representing approx $4k in value, why I bought it, and what I might plan to do with it - percentages are rounded:\n\n\n**PCG (10.2%)**\n\nI first bought this back in 2017 during what I thought was the big dip. Then there was a second wildfire caused by them and it slide further and further until I averaged my cost down near its low around $6. I currently have that many shares on a sell order for when it hits $10 but sometimes I feel like just dumping it altogether and moving the money on to something more useful to invest in.\n\n\n**AAL (4.3%)**\n\nI got this near one of its lows close to $13. This was more or less of a gamble since I saw that there was some room for medium term gains as long as they don\u2019t bk. I work in the industry and have a strong sense of its direction so I\u2019ll keep this for now until I sense things going a different direction (I don\u2019t work for AAL in any capacity)\n\n**BOXL (3.2%)**\n\nThis is just a Covid gamble. I feel dumb for getting sucked into it but it\u2019s only a little bit of money lost if it never goes anywhere.\n\n**NET (14.7%)**\n\nJust a company I\u2019ve know for a long time. There\u2019s a lot of emotion behind this one, but its objective metrics are strong anyway so I plan on continuing to find my position on this one if things continue going well.\n\n**KO (29.7%)**\n\nI first bought into Coke in 2018 as a long-term value sink and its ability to retain value while growing at a rate better than a HYSA has been just fine with me. I plan to continue adding to this.\n\n\n**TXN (32.9%)**\n\nA company with a strong history and strong fundamentals. One of my recent additions as a long-term value sink. I plan to continue adding to this.\n\n**VNQ (4.2%)**\n\nVery recently bought into this. I want to be exposed to the real estate market as well med-long term without buying an actual building so I figured a respected real estate etf made sense. I\u2019m wondering if going for a muni bond based etf would make more sense though. This is my \u201cnon-stock\u201d holdings that should take priority as I get older. \n\n\nRecent Specs:\n\nI've only specced on a couple of things so far, but so far so good. I've made roughly 20% in YTD gain yield off of some small working buying and selling SPCE and WFC.",
