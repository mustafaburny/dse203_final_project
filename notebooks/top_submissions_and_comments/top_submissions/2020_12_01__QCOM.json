        "selftext": "A correction (\\~-20%) can happen, but the bubble will not burst (where $TSLA loses more than 50%-90% of its value). Here's why:  \n\nSo a lot of people often use the dotcom bubble as a parallel to speculate the pop of the Tesla bubble. The most immediate comparisons come from names such as Amazon, which lost nearly 90% of its value from the peak of the bubble but was eventually able to gain back most of its shares. Other comparisons also include stocks such as Yahoo, which was actually added to the S&amp;P 500 in 1999, right before the bubble burst, or even Qualcomm/Cisco. \n\nThese speculations and comparisons are always interesting to think about. They come from deductions, aka where you extrapolate data points from the past in order to predict what is going to happen in the future. However, a deduction is often not the most useful mental model, especially when circumstances are different in the future. And this is one of those cases where the circumstances are actually very different. \n\nNow the basic argument of \"Tesla is not a car company\" is often overused. Yes, Tesla creates batteries, they are going into the autonomous market soon, their AutoPilot is one of the best AI that the world has today (stronger than NVIDIA's GPUs), they are going to get into the insurance game, they are going to get into the financing industry, some people might even say they are going to collaborate with Space X to create flying cars in 2050. That's all great. However, I'm actually going to argue that despite all of these things, Tesla's current price is overvalued but yet, the stock will not burst. And this has in large part to do with how the markets and trader psychology works today, and how different it is from 1999/2000:\n\nAs information and financial data has become more widely available through the internet, the markets have had a tendency to price things way ahead of it's time. For example, Tesla believers (bloggers/Youtubers/communities) can now share their bull case for Tesla and what the company will do years and years down the line. While CEOs and company personnel are not allowed to share such projections due to SEC rules, there is nothing stopping these communities from doing so. The most prominent of this has perhaps been Cathie Wood's ARK Invest. She laid out the case for Tesla way back in 2017, and as some of her projections (such as Tesla's profitability) have proven to be correct, people have now become believers that her entire bull case (of Tesla owning the entire autonomous space) will eventually be correct. In a way, the market has become this binary mechanism. FOMO kicks in due to the widespread information that is available, and people pile in. Now, most Tesla bulls believe in the $7000 PT (pre-split) that Cathie Wood has put on this stock, and I doubt very many people are going to be willing to sell before that price. In 1999, if a hedge fund manager was very bullish on a stock, most other investors had no way of knowing. There has been trend towards open-sourcing investing ideas from many investors, and this is a massive deal with Tesla. Other examples of this include Rob Baron or Chamath, who are also very famous investors and well-known Tesla bulls. 20 years ago, investing ideas were supposed to be secretive, with retail investors very much out of the know and speculating on their own. This is no longer the case today. \n\nIn a way, we now live in an investing world of stories, where the story of a stock matters more than the numbers, and these stories get reverberated through social media communities. What a company will do 20 years down the line is a story that is just now more widely available. So even if Tesla stock drops by 10-15% tomorrow, I believe that there are enough believers in this story where they will just continue to buy up the stock from those prices. \"Buy the dip\" has become this sort of motto in many of these investing communities, and this same theory is true for any of these companies that seem to be outlandishly valued as Tesla. \n\nThe bottom line is: As long as the story stays, the bubble of Tesla will not pop. Even if Tesla has a bad quarter but their long term outlook stays the same, I very much think this will stand true. The only way this bubble pops is if the story changes somehow. That can either be from investors such as ARK saying they no longer believe in the long term hypothesis or other events such as the death of Elon Musk. Otherwise, Tesla will very much continue to stand strong.",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: Copied from [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ChrisBloomstran/status/1340414130658820096) by **Christopher Bloomstran**  \n\n\nLet\u2019s get ready to tumble! Come Monday, $TSLA enters the S&amp;P 500, as the world is aware. This is the one you will tell your grandkids about, or at least the new crop of investors, wondering what the bubble of 2020 was like. Tesla can be your example of the insanity....1/ \n\nFor all of the cost-saving benefits of passive investing, the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s committee that actively chooses the components for its indices will prove why passive investors are the dumb money with this coming Monday\u2019s inclusion of $TSLA into its venerable S&amp;P 500 index. 2/ \n\nThe committee is not known for a price consciousness. It chases what\u2019s hot and eliminates from its august roster what\u2019s not. 3/ \n\nIt\u2019s disregard for fundamentals or value was seen sharply in late 1999 &amp; early 2000 when bubble darlings like Peoplesoft, New Century Energy, Global Crossing, Xilinx, Teradyne, Quintiles Transnational, Citrix and JDS Uniphase made their way into the index. 4/ \n\nPull up the long-term charts to see how these \u201ctimely\u201d additions fared post admittance. The most prominent additions in 1999 were America Online (discussed in my 12/5 thread) and Yahoo, whose mania also reminds me of Tesla... 5/ \n\nYahoo went public in 1996, priced at $13 per share, opened at $24.50 and closed at $33 on its first trading day, a market cap of $850 million. From there the shares zoomed ahead by more than 6x in 2 years reaching $354 in January 1999. 6/ \n\nThe company then bought Geocities for $3.6B and Broadcast for $5.7B and the stock was more than cut in half, trading down to $120. Recovering by late 1999, the wizards at S&amp;P announced they would add Yahoo to the index on 11/30/1999. 7/ \n\nThe stock climbed 67% from $210 on the day of the announcement to $350 on the day of its inclusion on 12/7, one week later. Sound familiar? The rollercoaster didn\u2019t high point for another month. 8/ \n\nYahoo peaked not quite a month later at a share price of $475, a market cap of $127B on January 3, 2000 (the cap didn\u2019t include another 124 million option shares, 38M granted in 1999 alone, which implied an additional \\~$50B in market cap on January 3, 2000). 9/ \n\nIn hindsight, or for anyone with reason, which was lacking in those days, there was no need to count the fully diluted shares. Why? Those options would not be exercised. The stock fell 98.3% over the next 1 \u00be years, from $475 to $8.11 on 9/26/2001, a market cap of $2.2B. Yep. 10/ \n\nAt the peak, Yahoo's $127B market cap compared to $600 million in trailing 12-month revenues, so 211 times revenues. 11/ \n\nBut the Yahoo and tech bulls would get right in your face (or on the Yahoo Finance message board) and tell you, moron, that sales had grown 141%, 248%, 258% and 1,345% in the prior 4 years, which they did. 12/ \n\nHeck, even after the stock dropped from a STOCK PRICE of $475 to $30 (a mere 93.7% in a year for those counting) by the end of 2000, sales still GREW by 88% to $1.1B, to \u201conly\u201d 15 times revenues! From there, however, the company flailed. 13/ \n\nSales actually fell 35%, from $1.1B to $717m from 2000 to 2001, which is what drove the shares down to $8.11 and a $2.2B market cap. To what had been the first and dominant home page, and really the dominant search engine, competition came fast. 14/ \n\nYahoo even eventually outsourced its search function to upstart Google if you can believe that. Yahoo did ultimately grow its revenues another 5x to $5B by 2016, when it was bought by Verizon $VZ in 2016 for $4.5B, excluding a sub's partial investment in Alibaba. 15/ \n\nThe buyout was at a far cry from the day Yahoo came into the S&amp;P 500 as the 30th largest capitalization in the index, with a market cap of roughly $90B and I\u2019d guess at a weight of 0.7%. 16/ \n\nAt its January 3, 2000 peak, Yahoo had climbed to the #15 spot in the index, well ahead of Berkshire Hathaway $BRKA $BRKB (which was not yet in the index despite its mere $83B market cap, $131B in assets and $38B in shareholders equity.) 17/ \n\nHad Berkshire been in the index the day Yahoo peaked it would have held only the 37 spot, behind notorious tech darlings Cisco at $358B, Intel $290B, Time Warner $184B, Lucent $171B Sun Mico $168B, AT&amp;T $160B, WorldCom $148B, Dell $130B, HP $120B, Oracle $120B, EMC $116B,... 18/ \n\nQualcomm $116B, DirecTV $102B, Verizon $93B, AOL $93B, Motorola $90B, and Bellsouth $87B. Many of these are gone today, which leads us back to $TSLA. 19/ \n\nNever has the S&amp;P 500 committee brought in a company so large by market cap as will be the case with Tesla's inclusion. Nor have they ever brought in a company at so high a spot in the cap-weighted index, at #6, one notch ahead of Berkshire Hathaway. Insanity. 20/ \n\nOf course, by sales &amp; profits, plenty of companies have entered the index as larger constituents, but that\u2019s not what counts in the passive index. It\u2019s all about float adjusted market cap. Fundamental valuation matters not. Qualifying for index inclusion required some hijinks.21/ \n\nTesla had cut R&amp;D &amp; SG&amp;A, drew on reserves and leaned on environmental carbon credits to \u201cearn\u201d a GAAP profit for a necessary four quarters. They did so for five. Oddly, revenues only grew 15% in 2019, prior to the pandemic, in part for a reduction in customer tax incentives. 22/ \n\nImpressively, they have grown revenues 15% for the first 9 months of 2020 during the crisis while the incumbents saw sales decline. No doubt the business is growing. But how to value it? 23/ \n\nOn November 16, the S&amp;P index committee announced Tesla would be added on December 21. The market cap was $380B. Here on Saturday December 19, the stock price at $695 yields a market cap of $659B ($BRK, the current #6 is $528B) up $279B or 73% since the announcement. 24/ \n\nThe gain matches the percentage rise seen by Yahoo during the week between its announcement &amp; addition. The $279B gain is LARGER than the $215B market cap of the world\u2019s largest auto manufacturer, Toyota. Tesla\u2019s $659B cap is on 948M shares out at 9/30 (up 5% since YE 2019). 25/ \n\nThe share count excludes another 157M unvested or unexercised option and RSU shares, which would add more than $100B to the market cap on a fully diluted basis. 26/ \n\nLet\u2019s not count those for the same reason they were excluded in the Yahoo calculation. Why? Many may go unexercised. Why? Nobody in their right mind would pay $659B, $760B diluted, for a car co w/ $30B in sales, little or no economic profit and an enormous growth capital need.27/ \n\n25x sales? 2,030x GAAP earnings? 422x earnings assuming Toyota\u2019s best in industry 6% profit margin? Heck, even 85 times Microsoft\u2019s 30% profit margin (a bone for the Tesla is not a car company but also a software/robotaxi crowd). Welcome to the game, index fund investors. 28/ \n\n80% of Tesla\u2019s shares float, not owned by insiders, which means the adjusted market cap weight will be $528B, compelling somewhere between $50 and $75B of direct index purchases, not to mention those needed by index huggers and closet indexers. 29/ \n\nThe stock will come in at \\~1.75% of the $30.5 trillion index, itself significantly overvalued, not unlike when Yahoo peaked in January 2000 and the index peaked at over 30x earnings and 44x cyclically adjusted (CAPE) shortly thereafter. 30/ \n\nWhat prospective return does the Tesla bull expect, or the passive investor with 1.75% of capital in the shares come Monday? At 15% a year, the market cap, assuming no further dilution, grows to $3T over the next decade, \\~10% of the market value of the entire S&amp;P 500 today. 31/ \n\nAt \u201conly\u201d 10% per year, the fully diluted market cap grows to $2 trillion, almost where $AAPL is valued these days. At a 10% shareholder return, to trade at 30x earnings, Tesla will need to be earning $67 billion. 32/ \n\nFor grins let\u2019s assume the company actually earns some blend of auto maker profit (most earn \\~3%, Toyota \\~6%) and a subscription software, robotaxi margin of 30%. Generously call it a 20% blended profit margin, which I\u2019d bet heavily against. 33/ \n\nAt the impossible 20% margin, $67B would sit under $335B in revenues, roughly 11 times today\u2019s run rate. Revenues will need to grow by almost 28% per year, and profits to 20% of revenues, to get to a 30x multiple on earnings. 34/ \n\nTo finance the necessary capital stock to produce $335B in revenues will require about half that much in capital, either debt or equity. 35/ \n\nCar companies require roughly a dollar in capital to produce a dollar in revenues, but remember we are \"assuming\" this is a software company or whatever else hallucinogens conjure up in the minds of bulls. 36/ \n\nThe best course of action for Tesla is to keep selling \u201cat-the-market\u201d blocks, with no prospectus, road show or risk warning, to the dumb money that is willing, or compelled, as is the passive crowd, to pay dangerous prices. The dilution at today\u2019s prices is infinitesimal. 37/ \n\nThrough the end of 2019 Tesla had sold $12.7B in shares and borrowed $16B in debt and preferred stock. Total capital raised of $28B exceeded FY 2019 revenues of $25B and produced a $6B cumulative LOSS. 38/ \n\nSo far in 2020, Tesla has borrowed an additional net $200m and sold $12.3B of new shares (assuming a sale of the most recent $5B \u201cat-the-market\u201d). Bulls revere the cash on the balance sheet, but it didn\u2019t come from profit or free cash. 39/ \n\nTotal capital raised is now $40B before retained losses. What does Tesla earn on capital? Nothing yet. Equity is less than capital raised from stock sales by the amount of cumulative losses. Per share book is of course higher thanks to successful stock sales way above book...40/ \n\nFrom a business case and investment standpoint, the math doesn\u2019t work. Consider that total automobiles sold worldwide peaked two years ago at about 95m passenger and commercial car and truck units. At $20,000 per new vehicle, we can call the global auto market $2T in size. 41/ \n\nOur example has Tesla\u2019s market cap growing over the next decade at \u201conly\u201d 10% per year to a like $2T. Car companies, with the exception of Ferrari, which makes three cars per year, don\u2019t trade for one times sales. They trade for less. 42/ \n\nToyota, which earns a 6% margin and 6% on capital, trades itself at an all-time-high $215B on revenues of $280B in 2019, less in 2020. 43/ \n\nAuto manufacturers trade for less than sales because they make \\~3% net margins and earn that same \\~3% on capital and revenues grow at \\~3%. We can call the industry 3x3x3 (new material here folks). The car business is a bad business, and that\u2019s what Tesla is trying to disrupt? 44/ \n\nThe best case for shareholders: If Tesla grows the aforementioned sales for the next decade by 28% to $335B (it won\u2019t), the stock will trade for no more than 1x sales, because it\u2019s a CAR company. 45/ \n\nIf it earns Toyota\u2019s best in class 6% margin, even allowing for software \u201cupgrades,\u201d it earns $20B and trades for 25x, or a $500B market cap, which is a 33% loss from here people using diluted shares. If sales, margins or the multiple are lower, shareholders lose more. 46/ \n\nThe realistic case: The performance of the stock from here is a giant loss over time and the Tesla cult loses interest in the brand. In fact, they come to hate the brand because of their coming stock losses, customer and employee mistreatment. 47/ \n\nAsk the guys and gals on the S and X lines about their unpaid \u201cbreak\u201d here at quarter end. Rumor has it they can \"volunteer their time\" to help boost production before yearend. Sales grow nowhere near 28% a year. The incumbent auto manufacturers won\u2019t roll over and play dead. 48/ \n\nMy prior tweet elaborated on [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) using his inflated shares as currency to acquire another manufacturer w/ capacity, as he mentioned he\u2019d be up for in a friendly merger of equals. The point of that message was that the incumbents won\u2019t take his dangerous scrip in a deal. 49/ \n\nThat leaves Elon with having to sell new shares perpetually to finance his growth. It makes 100% sense when the shares are insanely overvalued to do so, and despite the ethics of doing so in these recent at-the-market deals. 50/ \n\nBy contrast, Mr. Buffett points out he\u2019d prefer new and current shareholders to have a fair experience in his company\u2019s shares. If the auto makers won\u2019t take them in a deal, and they shouldn\u2019t, then that leaves new shareholders to provide growth capital. Hello passive crowd. 51/ \n\nWe\u2019ll see what happens after Monday, when Tesla assumes the #6 perch in the index. When the argument for passive is low fees, remind me in ten years how much of the loss in Tesla\u2019s shares from here should be considered a \u201cfee,\u201d or a tax on stupidity. 52/ \n\nAt 1.75% of the index, a decline of 80-90% would be heavy, but realistic. Impossible to decline that much? An 88% drop takes you all the way back to\u2026.where Tesla\u2019s shares began the year. 53/ \n\nA 90% decline takes the cap to $66B, 2.2x current run rate revenues &amp; 37x a hypothetical 6% net margin. A mere 80% drop gets to a $132B cap, 4.4x revenues, and to give the bulls on Tesla not being a car company credit, still 37x a 12% hypothetical profit margin. Ridiculous. 54/ \n\nYou can play around all you like w/ assumptions for growth, market share, expansion into new markets, profit &amp; returns on capital, but paying for some fractional ownership of today\u2019s $760B fully diluted market value is highly likely to produce a disastrous investment result. 55/ \n\nBravo, S&amp;P. The decision to add $TSLA at present valuation is almost sure to exact pain on passive investors, compelled to \u201cinvest\u201d 1.75% of capital in one of the most overvalued companies on record. Brilliant. As the other Buffett sings, \u201cCome Monday, it\u2019ll be all right...\u201d 56/ \n\nAs disclosure, I have a small short position in $TSLA. Don\u2019t take this note as investment advice because it\u2019s not. Do your own research. Stocks go up &amp; down, and shorting is extremely dangerous. Upside is capped and downside is unlimited. $TSLA has risen 8.3x just this year. 57/ \n\nIf Tesla repeats the same return over the next year the market cap would be $6.3 trillion. Two years of repeat performance and the cap becomes $52 trillion. Of course, that\u2019s 70% larger than the entire S&amp;P 500, but by then any short seller is long bankrupt. 58/58 END",

This technology utilizes advanced low power bluetooth beacons and ensures both user privacy and administrative control. \n\nSo far the company has successfully deployed it\u2019s solutions across a variety of sectors.\n\n**Government Contracts** \\- TraceSafe has won government contracts in Cayman Islands, Singapore, and Hong Kong. These government contracts are lucrative as all travelers going to these destinations are required to self Quarantine with TraceSafe devices. So far, TraceSafe has been working together with the government of Hong Kong since March 2020, and more then 150,000 TraceSafe solutions have ben deployed. Additionally, contracts have been signed with hospitals in Singapore to track patients and beds, and a SE Asian Conglomerate (the customer has not disclosed for privacy reasons, but many people say that this client is Singapore Health Ministry). The Company is in active discussions with over 20 governments and is likely to announce a new deal with another government in Asia or North America. \n\n**TraceSafe and Hong Kong contract:**   \n[https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-09-10/tracesafe-secures-new-order-in-hong-kong-for-quarantine-management-wristbands](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-09-10/tracesafe-secures-new-order-in-hong-kong-for-quarantine-management-wristbands)\n\n**TraceSafe Hong Kong Case Study:**   \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUmyKaytCZc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUmyKaytCZc)\n\n**Hong Kong deal a \u2018catalyst\u2019 for future deals:**  \n[https://ca.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/930200/tracesafe--pandemic-has-become-a-catalyst--for-contact-tracing-bracelets-after-hong-kong-contract-930200.html](https://ca.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/930200/tracesafe--pandemic-has-become-a-catalyst--for-contact-tracing-bracelets-after-hong-kong-contract-930200.html)\n\n**TraceSafe order with Southeast Asian conglomerate:**  \n[https://www.accesswire.com/607388/TraceSafe-Awarded-Large-Scale-Order-from-Southeast-Asian-Conglomerate](https://www.accesswire.com/607388/TraceSafe-Awarded-Large-Scale-Order-from-Southeast-Asian-Conglomerate)\n\n**Venue Management** \\- Venues were hard hit by Covid with many sports teams experiencing significant financial distress as they mainly had to cease operations, and can no longer have fans at games. TraceSafe has inked contracts with the IIHF World Junior Hockey Tournament in Edmonton, Canada TD Gardens in Boston and Lampert Stadium in Toronto (Toronto Wolfpack rugby team). Getting approved for both TD Gardens and the World Juniors is a big deal as it was approved by Hockey Canada and likely points to potentially working with teams from the NBA or NHL in 2021. In addition to the covid use case, TraceSafe bracelets can be outfitted with payment capabilities to use for Concession stands. Privately held Delaware North owns TD Gardens, and is one of the biggest private hospitality and restaurant companies in the world (as per Forbes). If all of these deals are successful, it sets the stage for TraceSafe to work with some of the biggest sports and venue companies in the world.   \nThe deal with Hockey Canada involves a partnership with one of Canada\u2019s biggest telecommunications providers, Telus. Powered by Telus\u2019 world class wireless network, Tracesafe technology is deployed across the tournament bubble to provide quarantine management and monitoring of exposures. There are no other contact tracing companies in Canada that have partnered with a company of Telus\u2019 magnitude, and it is expected that this partnership will continue as TraceSafe solutions are deployed among Telus\u2019 corporate clients and employees.   \nHockey Canada, IIHF, Telus, TD Gardens (Delaware North)...the clients don\u2019t get much bigger and better than this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2txn3594r661.png?width=262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d6ed5e021d0850a986de3ca9c1a338a2a402ce6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/posbfr2a4r661.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e0339ea4d1b8816681f9e68720f6899eef9f3d5\n\n**TraceSafe and Telus IoT marketplace:**  \n[https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/tracesafe-approved-for-nationwide-corporate-sales-in-telus-iot-marketplace-2020-12-07](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/tracesafe-approved-for-nationwide-corporate-sales-in-telus-iot-marketplace-2020-12-07)\n\n**TraceSafe and IIHF World Junior Hockey Championships:**   \n[https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/tracesafe-contact-tracing-2021-iihf-120000807.html](https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/tracesafe-contact-tracing-2021-iihf-120000807.html)  \n**TraceSafe partnership with Telus for IIHF World Juniors:**   \n[https://www.telus.com/en/about/news-and-events/media-releases/tracesafe-and-telus-iot-solutions-are-safeguarding-the-iihf-world-junior-championship-bubble](https://www.telus.com/en/about/news-and-events/media-releases/tracesafe-and-telus-iot-solutions-are-safeguarding-the-iihf-world-junior-championship-bubble)\n\n**TraceSafe and TD Gardens:**   \n[https://www.sporttechie.com/tracesafe-contact-tracing-deployed-at-bostons-td-garden](https://www.sporttechie.com/tracesafe-contact-tracing-deployed-at-bostons-td-garden)\n\n**Enterprise Management:** Enterprise in the biggest opportunity as the Private Sector dwarfs the public for  cases. TraceSafe has begun to work with one of Singapore\u2019s biggest construction companies, Boustead Construction. This sets the stage for further deals in Asia within the construction or office segment. TraceSafe technology can be used within this segment to provide location tracking, and greater insights into workplace habits and safety of workers. It becomes a big data play at this point. \n\n**Market Size**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tmgfvmsa4r661.png?width=982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42a3fdc47ad0e494d7b027e2680e12bb4bf51846\n\nThe markets TraceSafe operates in are massive with Enterprise Contract Tracing &amp; Wearable Tech being by far the biggest markets. \n\nOn the enterprise front, TraceSafe signed a deal with UKG which is a company built by the merger of Kronos and a Florida based software provider called Ultimate Software. The company is one of the biggest cloud computing companies in the world with top-tier clients that include Tesla, Marriott, Samsung, Yamaha, Sony Music, The Salvation Army, Miami Dolphins, Phoenix Suns, Revlon. Given the huge number of employees that these companies employ. We anticipate significant revenues to start showing up in Q1 from these customers and more deals in the Enterprise Space as a result of this partnership.\n\n**Airbeam Stake**\n\nTraceSafe currently owns a 13.5% stake in a company called Airbeam that is a 5G smart cities enabler built by former Qualcomm execs. Airbeam is due to IPO in Q1 2021 and the company is currently valued between 200-400M. This puts TraceSafe ownership around 27-54M. Wayne Lloyd announced a decision to issue Airbeam shares via Special Dividend to TraceSafe shareholders once the company goes  public. \n\nBelow is a calculation of how big this dividend will be given a few different Airbeam Valuation scenarios. \n\nAirbeam Valuation &amp; Expected $TSF Special Dividend\n\n150M Valuation = $0.57  per TSF Share\n\n200M Valuation = $0.76 per TSF Share\n\n300M Valuation = $1.14 per TSF Share\n\n400M Valuation = $1.52 per TSF Share\n\n**Comparison of the Competitors**  \n Now let\u2019s compare the Valuations of the TraceSafe\u2019s closest competitors (FaceDrive, Loop Insights)  \n*TraceSafe (TSF)*  \nMarket Cap: 22 Million  \n**Q3 Revenues: $1.1 Million (100% growth over Q2 with revenue only partly recognized for Hong Kong contract)**  \n**Shares Out: 35 million**\n\n*FaceDrive (FD)*\n\nMarket Cap: 1.55 Billion  \n**Q3 Revenues: $266,460**  \n**Shares Out: 94 million**\n\n*Loop Insights (MTRX)* \n\nMarket Cap: 230 Million  \n**Q3 Revenues: $0**  \n**Shares Out: 106 million**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ob2vxspb4r661.png?width=1220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cdd62706b3691499109aaf4ff6d9c3fdb738d8e\n\nAs you can see from the comparison, the contrast in valuations is quite large. Although it speaks to the bloated overvaluation in both $FD and $MTRX, it also underscores how grossly undervalued TraceSafe is as compared to Loop and FaceDrive, which have spent millions of marketing. Facedrive in particular spent over $8million on marketing in June 2020. \n\n**Summary/Conclusion:**   \n*Growing Revenues and Bargain Valuation of Tracesafe*\n\nSo far, TraceSafe has advanced from the Proof of Concept phase and is growing revenues rapidly. Q3 saw Revenues increase an 100% with Q4 Revenues expected to be around 2 Million, which is another 100% Increase. Based on this impressive growth, the market currently is giving TraceSafe around a  4x Sales Multiple. Given QoQ Revenue growth of 100%, this doesn\u2019t seem justified at all. \n\n* **Growing Margins are increasing profitability and will see the Company become Cash-flow positive in 2021.** \n* **TraceSafe is diversifying their product line-up to include Venues, Cruise Lines, Construction Sites and well poised to capitalize in 2021.**\n* **TraceSafe\u2019s stake in Airbeam is now worth 40.5M-54.0M and management is likely to issue Airbeam shares to shareholders.** \n* **Market for Enterprise Wearables expanding at 41% a year bodes well for TraceSafe**\n\nWe feel that TraceSafe\u2019s low valuation is a temporary imbalance given the lack of analyst coverage in small-cap markets which will correct. As to when this correction will occur, the best cure for undervaluation in the Small Cap space is \n\n**1) Promotional marketing or** \n\n**2) let the results speak for themselves**\n\nWe feel that the company is proving it\u2019s model, seeing successes in expanding its products line and customer base alongside a very Successful investment in Airbeam which de-risks investing in TraceSafe as investors today are getting 2 high-quality tech stocks for the price of 1. \n\n***Estimates and Price Target For TraceSafe***\n\nQ4 2020 Revenues: 2M \n\nFY 2021 Revenues: 20M \n\nP/S Multiple: 15x\n\n12 Month Price Target: $9.65 (includes Airbeam Spin-Off Value)",

        "selftext": "Gather round you hopeless autists. We have to talk. Listen to me you hopeless stupid fucking retards.  \nThe only reason I am not posting this on r/investing is because you asstards need help. There is some  \nserious chicken fucking tendies to be made here.  \nI'm the guy who famously claimed that Bob Swan, Intel CEO, should fabricate a silicone butt and fuck it  \nduring Intel's next earning call to appease stock holders instead of going over their financials. (See: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel\\_is\\_fucked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel_is_fucked/)) As it turns out, I was right and Bob Swan showed everyone how much of a dipshit he really is and how he literally knows nothing about this industry. I doubled my principal on my last Intel put and I plan to do the same with my next more here.  \nFirst, let us a take a good look at what happened to intel. There is so much wrong with that company and I talked about it a lot in my last post. This analyst, Stacy Rasgon, who actually seems to have a basic understanding of this shit, sums it up fairly well. Click the fucking link asshole. Listen to him.  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzTg6vWgDhQ  \nSo what do we have here:  \n  \"If you start digging in, theres almost no good news here. Gross margins have collapsed.\"  \n  \"This is the beginning of the bear thesis which seems to be embedded in the numbers here.\"  \n  \"Current trajectory of the business does not look good.\"  \nJesus Christ. Should have gone with the silicone butt bobby. Intel is ACTUALLY on fire. So what the fuck does intel plan to do about it? Bob Swan said himself on the earnings call that he wants to go with TSMC. Interesting choice Bobby Boy. Interesting because for once this is not a bad decision. But WHY would Bob Swan want to go with TSMC?  \nTSMC is perhaps the most strategically important company in the world right now. The American government has dramatically increased military operations with Taiwan.   \nOne very critical point that the average wsb idiot misses is that TSMC is only a foundry. Because of this they can focus only on improving their chip-manufacturing and not have to worry at all about selling/marketing the chips. Some of the major customers of TSMC are \\[3\\]:  \n\n\n* AMD\n* Apple (25% of TSMC revenue)\n* Broadcom\n* Marvell\n* MediaTek\n* Nvidia\n* Qualcomm\n* Xilinx\n\nSoon intel as well. Simply put, if any one of those companies above do well then TSMC wins. Their financials are perfect, they are the world leaders in their covid-proof industry, the only fab with a 5nm process and have a ton of massive customers for whom they have great relationships with (they built and bankrolled a new fabrication center just for Apple for fucks sake). If you pay close attention to this stuff, you may have heard how Nvidia recently went to Samsung for fabrication, yeah, Nvidia backtracked quickly on that and they are going back to TSMC due to Samsungs shit yields \\[4\\].\n\n  \n**Stop massaging your wife's boyfriend's vas deferens and listen up.** The American government  \nis currently preparing for a war with china over TSMC. The US is rapidly heading from a cold to a hot war with China. Some experts, such as Niall Furgeson, a well respected Stanford historian is already calling it \"Cold War 2\" \\[7\\].  \nThere is a video you must watch on this topic. It is produced by a Chinese-Hating-Korean-Trump-Supporter but it is most primary sources from China and it sums up quite well the China internal sentiment on this issue. (Click it you fucking autist):  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2uP\\_8YoJTU&amp;ab\\_channel=KoreanaJones  \nWell, shit. So here we are:\n\n* The US can no longer fabricate semiconductors, only Taiwan can.\n* America will do everything is can as a matter of national security to protect TSMC.\n* USA bans China's only serious semi conductor fabricator SMIC. \\[5\\]\n* USA bans anyone from doing business with Chinese tech firms like Huawei. TSMC even confirmed AGAIN they will not fabricate for Huawei. \\[6\\]\n* Taiwan HATES China so they don't actually even want to work with their shitty fake tech companies.\n* Semiconductors are critical to a modern economy/military. (Xi JinPing has said this himself.)\n* Taiwan's military is a joke compared to China's so they will do everything to appease the Americans  \n  for the survival of their nation.\n* Hong Kong proved to the world, especially Taiwan, that China has zero interest in honoring any governance agreements made. This raises the stakes for Taiwan dramatically as a cooperation with China means a complete erasure of their culture and history.\n* ASML, the people who make the machines for TSMC, are a German company. Unsurprisingly, Germany has taken a similar stance, including military aid, for Taiwan. ASML is a \"crown jewel\" for Germany and they make a shit ton supporting TSMC.\n\n  \nSo what is the bear case for a company that is at the heart of US/Taiwan/Germany/Europe national security interests? A company which is ACTUALLY technologically superior to their competition and is basically the only game in town?  \nThe bear case is potential war with China. But if that happens your positions are going to shit anyway.\n\n**Options (Wish I bought more):**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r9uchpxpd0561.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ba1bc3a98783399ddfe80637b527ceb032ec742\n\n  \n**Stocks:**\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knuge7gsd0561.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b72bd468a5e77f97a423835eaaf2e87b6c1d8275\n\n**References**\n\n1.

[Investment banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_bank), which profited significantly from [initial public offerings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO), fueled speculation and encouraged investment in technology.[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble#cite_note-swindle-12) A combination of rapidly increasing stock prices in the [quaternary sector of the economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_sector_of_the_economy) and confidence that the companies would turn future profits created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics, such as the [price\u2013earnings ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price%E2%80%93earnings_ratio), and base confidence on technological advancements, leading to a [stock market bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_bubble).[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble#cite_note-enigma-10) Between 1995 and 2000, the Nasdaq Composite stock market index rose 400%.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 9, 2020**\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones hit record highs early in the morning before turning steeply negative as stimulus talks in Washington appear to hit a roadblock. \n\nToday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke on the Senate floor and accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of \u201cdelaying, deflecting and moving the goalposts\u201d during stimulus negotiations. This snuffed out investor confidence that a deal would get done, at least in the near-term. Here at Psycho, we don\u2019t expect the passage of more stimulus until a change in White House administration and control of the Senate is decided. \n\nYesterday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin revealed he offered Pelosi a new proposal worth $916 billion. He said his plan \u201cincludes money for state and local governments and robust liability protection for businesses, schools, and universities.\u201d Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers had unveiled a stimulus outline worth about $908 billion, which diverged from Mnuchin\u2019s plan on some key issues, including offering $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits absent from Mnuchin\u2019s proposal, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nEarlier in the week, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released data that reaffirmed that Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech\u2019s (BNTX) vaccine candidate was effective within approximately 10 days after the dose and showed strong protection regardless of age, weight, race, or gender. The FDA is now scheduled to convene its panel of outsider Thursday, with the group expected to vote on the approval of the vaccine.\n\nThe United States recorded its second-worst day of infections Tuesday, with another 220,000 infections. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, says the full impact of Thanksgiving gatherings hasn\u2019t been seen yet. He said, \u201cThe blip from Thanksgiving isn't even here yet. So we\u2019re getting those staggering numbers of new cases and hospitalizati0ns before we even feel the full brunt of the Thanksgiving holiday\u201d. The US is averaging nearly 200,000 infections and 2,237 deaths in the last seven numbers, the deadliest week in the pandemic since late April, according to Johns Hopkins University. There are well over 100,000 patients hospitalized with coronavirus.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Canada officially approves Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech\u2019s (BNTX) coronavirus vaccine.\n* The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a coalition of attorneys general from 48 states and territories filed two separate antitrust lawsuits against Facebook (FB) on Wednesday. The lawsuits target two of Facebook\u2019s major acquisitions, Instagram and WhatsApp, alleging anticompetitive behavior. In response, Facebook General Counsel said, \u201cAntitrust laws exist to protect consumers and promote innovation, not to punish successful businesses. Instagram and WhatsApp became the incredible products they are today because Facebook invested billions of dollars, and years of innovation and expertise, to develop new features and better experiences for the millions who enjoy those products. The most important fact in this case, which the Commission does not mention in its 53-page complaint, is that it cleared these acquisitions years ago. The government now wants a do-over.\u201c\n* QuantumScape, the electric battery developer was on fire again today, up around 30% in the day. The stock is up 125% since the merger finalized.\n* DoorDash (DASH) shares open for trading at $182, almost double their IPO price of $105. \n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Wedbush from $150 to $160 OUTPERFORM. \n* Advanced Energy Systems (AEIS) target raised by Rosenblatt Securities from $107 to $120.\n* Casey's General Store (CASY) target raised by Deutsche Bank (DB) from $218 to $220 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $180s\n* Airbnb is all set to make the IPO tomorrow, Thursday Dec 10. Raising the price in advance, for good measure.\n* Chewy (CHWY) with a host of target raises by notable analysts after a good earnings report. Average price target of $85 with OUTPERFORM rating\n* Disney (DIS) with a series of target raises. \n   * Loop Capital from $150 to $175\n   * Morgan Stanley from $160 to %175\n   * Credit Suisse from $146 to $178\n* Fiserv (FISV) with multiple target raises. \n   * Wells Fargo from $125 to $135 OVERWEIGHT\n   * Raymond James from $120 to $132 OUTPERFORM\n* Generac (GNRC) target raised by JP MOrgan (JPM) from $235 to $258.\n* (JD) target raised by Loop Capital from $99 to $105. Stock currently around $82\n* Qualcomm (QCOM) target raised by Cowen from $170 to $180 OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $160\n* SunOpta (STKL) target raised by Lake Street Capital from $9 to $15 at BUY, implying a 50% upside from current levels. \n* ROKU target raised by Citigroup (C) from $220 to $375, a very notable increase. Stock currently around $325 has been on a tear this year\n* Lululemon (LULU) with massive target increase by Raymond James from $400 to $500 at STRONG-BUY. Stock currently around $375.\n\n\u201cIf you know your own mind, you know enough to keep it always positive.\u201d - Napoleon Hill",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Year-end Santa rally could depend on the big week ahead for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/congres-fe.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is so jam-packed for markets that it could determine whether there will be a smooth glide path for a Santa rally into the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; First, Congress looks set to fight down to the wire about a pandemic stimulus package, and chances are good it could again disappoint. The Fed also holds its final meeting of the year, and market pros are split on whether it will tweak its bond buying program when it issues its statement Wednesday. Since there\u2019s a divided view, there\u2019s room for market reaction either way.\n*****\n&gt; Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.\n*****\n&gt; Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&amp;P 500 at Friday\u2019s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility \u2014 the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don\u2019t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don\u2019t get one,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThe tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut you can\u2019t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Tesla revving up the S&amp;P\n&gt; Tesla\u2019s entry into the S&amp;P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&amp;P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday\u2019s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know if it creates volatility. It\u2019s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,\u201d said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cGiven we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn\u2019t take much to see the VIX spike.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to create more noise,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&amp;P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P.\n*****\n&gt; Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&amp;P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,\u201d Bartolini said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt will be exciting. You\u2019re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.\n*****\n&gt; There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn\u2019t do,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. \u201cThat has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663. Treasury yields moved higher in the past week but retrenched Friday, when the 10-year sank below 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; # Window on the economy\n&gt; There\u2019s a busy economic calendar in the week ahead. Weekly claims Thursday are expected to be closely watched after a surprise jump in people seeking new benefits for the week ending Dec. 5.\n*****\n&gt; November Markit PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors are released Wednesday, as is the November retail sales report.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said he is watching to see how much the services sector is being impacted by the spreading pandemic and related shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the economic data is being overlooked for better or worse because it\u2019s pre-vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the economy is slowing and the labor market has been weakening, particularly since the virus spread has continued to accelerate. Some expect the first quarter to be weaker than the fourth quarter, but activity should pick up in the second quarter as the vaccine is distributed.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/2S0NcDWd/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8vWKDYz/alphatrends1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/L6BpPf6b/finvizfuts.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/5Q2G6MV.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR3gStWM/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Vv8hsGML/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jdjX6YsY/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jGGBSNx/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eOWZhrG.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LxpLHIm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/643dART.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Not All Bad for Small Business\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released their monthly reading on the small business sector. With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.\n\n&gt; As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.\n\n&gt; For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.\n\n&gt; We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Empl.png))**\n\n&gt; Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.\n\n&gt; In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**\n\n&gt; Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.\n\n&gt; Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Expan.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders\n\n&gt; The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/1210-Mega.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish\n\n&gt; For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bullish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**\n\n&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bearish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bearish.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bulls. As shown below, for both the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys, the bull-bear spreads are at historically high levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bull-bear.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Spread.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 4th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68-8FE3FRSw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.6.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCODbMH2beY))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rally To Resume Mid-Month - Typical December Seasonal Pattern\n\n&gt; For the most part, this December has unfolded in rather typical seasonal fashion. The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.\n\n&gt; Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/35feeda338d979bfb6b6f25b3156fb4d/11fa20ff3c6ff3a3-4b/s500x750/454472c6c7d32c04ce9ec7e2e0ca7c045dab183d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is Inflation Looming?\n\n&gt; The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and \u201ccore\u201d readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we\u2019ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.\n\n&gt; \u201cCongress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in today\u2019s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$RAD** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$BB** \n&gt; * **$CTK** \n&gt; * **$GIS** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$TTC** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$JBL** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$UXIN** \n&gt; * **$CNTG** \n&gt; * **$SAFM** \n&gt; * **$MTSC** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$AOUT** \n&gt; * **$NDSN** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$DL** \n&gt; * **$BLBD** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$APDN** \n&gt; * **$CAMP** \n&gt; * **$SCHL** \n&gt; * **$QTT** \n&gt; * **$SCSC** \n&gt; * **$VNCE** \n&gt; * **$RFIL** \n&gt; * **$CSBR** \n&gt; * **$NAV**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Wb0yKPBF/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oxA4VQw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sO15Y4c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jQE7QFL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8q2wpXy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/f4M4FMw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D6W4j8k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dGlrSdg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $289.47\n**FedEx Corp.

        "selftext": "With all the IPO craze weve been seeing right now, its kinda hard to recommend anyone buying into them.( still kinda chocked to see that this opened at 250%.) In fact, ive been recommending more people to move into SPAC plays instead because of the limited downside and room for price discovery especially for the retail investors like us. Investing in a good spac near nav is literally a no brainer and free tendies. That being said, since I have already done the research and a write up for Abcellera, might as well share it with everyone. Please keep in mind that im not recommending people buying into nor do I have a position in this stock. To be quite frankly, no way in hell should this company be trading at such level yet, at least not in another few years to come. But here you go:\n\nWe are talking about a company **backed by Bill Gates and has Peter Thiel as the board of director to bring the table experience in scaling technology companies (Daddy Thiel actually owns a stake of the company)**. Abcellera is a company **that helped Lily with the development of the antibody cocktail for COVID at a record-breaking speed** and is entitled to receive percentage of the proceeds that Lily receives from the sales. Currently US government has secured 300,000 does with the option to secure 70,000 more and Canada has secured 26,000 doses with more to come. **Abcellera has been cash flow positive every year since inception and has shown an annual revenue growth rate of 100% over the past 5 years and is here to print ya\u2019ll motherfuckers some real serious tendies.**\n\nAbout Abcellera\n\nAbcellera is a technology company that searches, decodes, and analyzes natural immune systems to find antibodies that can be developed to prevent and treat disease through artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced technology platform. **Traditional biotech industries usually take too long, cost too much and fails way too often. Drugs discovery usually takes 5 to 15 years with less than 5% success rate and cost billions of dollars to find approved molecules. Abcellera provides the teams and technologies that work broadly with the biotech industries to put the best science and best innovator in touch with the best technology to get faster drugs to patients.** Abcellera essentially **solves the two fundamental problems that hinder the discovery and the development of next generation antibody- based therapeutics. The first is the technology: because of the limitations of legacy discovery approaches, there are many well validated targets for which suitable antibodies cannot be found. The second is access: most companies are forced to cobble together fragmented solutions and lack the facilities and expertise needed to prosecute their antibody programs. Both problems contribute to the rising cost of drug development and delay brining needed therapies to patients.** With the leverage of Abcellera\u2019s technology, Eli Lily was able to put out COVID-19 antibody cocktail to trials within a record-breaking speed of just 3 months. Abcellera was able screen through 5.5mil + immune cells to see which makes antibodies on Day 4, find 2K+ potential antibodies that could stick to the virus surface on Day 6, sequence through DNA of 500+ antibodies that could stick to virus spike protein on Day 9, select 190 most promising antibodies for potency testing on Day 17, and finally select 24 antibody front runners for Eli Lily to further develop them into antibody cocktail. Within the past 3 years, **Abcellera has already accrued more than 40 deals, engaged in 94 discovery programs, and under contracted with 26 partners.** **With validation from the partnerships with major biotech firms, it signifies the effectiveness and the reliability of the platform setting Abcellera up for a more lucrative terms and deals in the future.** Through the partnership agreements, Abcellera **will collect near-term payment for technology access, research and intellectual property right, and downstream payments in form of clinical and commercial milestones and royalties on net sales. (Three parts income source model)**\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\n\nHow big is antibody therapy?\n\nAntibody therapy has already been one of the biggest discoveries and is not a thing of the future rather the thing of the present. In 2019\\*\\*, 7 out of 10 of the best-selling drugs were monoclonal antibodies.\\*\\* **The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market has been valued at 150bil by the end of 2019 and 300bil by 2025** with many drugs already approved for treating cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases.\n\nCompetitive landscape\n\nAlthough there are a few of companies developing antibody therapy drugs, they are not the direct competitors of Abcellera. **The purpose of Abcellera is to provide the technology for the biotech companies especially the small to medium firms the ability to compete on the same playing field as the big boys or act as a more cost-effective way of developing new drugs.** (Think of it as the biotech version of TSMC where it provides AMD the ability to compete or over taking Intel, or acts as a more cost-effective ways for chip designers like Apple and Qualcomm to push out chips.) **Over 90% of the antibody market is dominated by 8 companies and Abcellera is here to shake the ground.**\n\nNotable highlights and future plans for the past months:\n\n\\- Named on the fierce biotech\u2019s fierce 15 list company of 2020\n\n\\- Partnership with Invetx to develop new antibody therapies to improve the quality of life of animals and to bring next generation veterinary therapeutics to the market\n\n\\- Partnership with Kodiak science to develop eye disease antibodies\n\n\\- Partnership with IGM biosciences\n\n\\- Acquisition of Ttianni ( a company for developing humanized mice that is designed to maximize immune responses, increase antibody diversity, and preserve natural mutation of fully human antibodies in rodents)\n\n\\- Acquisition of OrthMab (a clinically validated platform that uses the most advanced computational and experimental protein engineering methods to create bispecific antibodies from any two antibody sequences.)",

Since there\u2019s a divided view, there\u2019s room for market reaction either way.\n*****\n&gt; Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.\n*****\n&gt; Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&amp;P 500 at Friday\u2019s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility \u2014 the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don\u2019t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don\u2019t get one,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThe tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut you can\u2019t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Tesla revving up the S&amp;P\n&gt; Tesla\u2019s entry into the S&amp;P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&amp;P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday\u2019s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know if it creates volatility. It\u2019s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,\u201d said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cGiven we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn\u2019t take much to see the VIX spike.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to create more noise,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&amp;P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P.\n*****\n&gt; Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&amp;P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,\u201d Bartolini said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt will be exciting. You\u2019re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.\n*****\n&gt; There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn\u2019t do,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. \u201cThat has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663. Treasury yields moved higher in the past week but retrenched Friday, when the 10-year sank below 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; # Window on the economy\n&gt; There\u2019s a busy economic calendar in the week ahead. Weekly claims Thursday are expected to be closely watched after a surprise jump in people seeking new benefits for the week ending Dec. 5.\n*****\n&gt; November Markit PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors are released Wednesday, as is the November retail sales report.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said he is watching to see how much the services sector is being impacted by the spreading pandemic and related shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the economic data is being overlooked for better or worse because it\u2019s pre-vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the economy is slowing and the labor market has been weakening, particularly since the virus spread has continued to accelerate. Some expect the first quarter to be weaker than the fourth quarter, but activity should pick up in the second quarter as the vaccine is distributed.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/2S0NcDWd/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8vWKDYz/alphatrends1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/L6BpPf6b/finvizfuts.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/5Q2G6MV.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR3gStWM/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Vv8hsGML/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jdjX6YsY/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jGGBSNx/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eOWZhrG.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LxpLHIm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/643dART.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Not All Bad for Small Business\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released their monthly reading on the small business sector. With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.\n\n&gt; As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.\n\n&gt; For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.\n\n&gt; We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Empl.png))**\n\n&gt; Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.\n\n&gt; In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**\n\n&gt; Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.\n\n&gt; Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Expan.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders\n\n&gt; The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/1210-Mega.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish\n\n&gt; For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bullish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**\n\n&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bearish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bearish.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bulls. As shown below, for both the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys, the bull-bear spreads are at historically high levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bull-bear.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Spread.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rally To Resume Mid-Month - Typical December Seasonal Pattern\n\n&gt; For the most part, this December has unfolded in rather typical seasonal fashion. The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.\n\n&gt; Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/35feeda338d979bfb6b6f25b3156fb4d/11fa20ff3c6ff3a3-4b/s500x750/454472c6c7d32c04ce9ec7e2e0ca7c045dab183d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is Inflation Looming?\n\n&gt; The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and \u201ccore\u201d readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we\u2019ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.\n\n&gt; \u201cCongress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in today\u2019s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 11th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOBjxtu9Ago))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.13.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHqwuwWaaI))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$RAD** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$BB** \n&gt; * **$CTK** \n&gt; * **$GIS** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$TTC** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$JBL** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$UXIN** \n&gt; * **$CNTG** \n&gt; * **$SAFM** \n&gt; * **$MTSC** \n&gt; * **$ABM** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$AOUT** \n&gt; * **$NDSN** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$DL** \n&gt; * **$BLBD** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$APDN** \n&gt; * **$CAMP** \n&gt; * **$SCHL** \n&gt; * **$QTT** \n&gt; * **$SCSC** \n&gt; * **$VNCE** \n&gt; * **$RFIL** \n&gt; * **$CSBR** \n&gt; * **$NAV**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Wb0yKPBF/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oxA4VQw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sO15Y4c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jQE7QFL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8q2wpXy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/f4M4FMw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D6W4j8k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dGlrSdg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $289.47\n**FedEx Corp.

        "selftext": "  \n\nSo, [this is part 3 of a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/kikfkf/microvast_and_tesla_partnership_quantum_scape_and/). To start off I am not advising anyone here to buy or short THCB. This post is just about dispelling some financial myths, giving facts, and my own personal opinions. \n\nSo, this response is in response to this thread. Which I STILL see being referenced and spreading around misconstrued information. [But first I would like to say that it looks like Microvast gained a contract to build EVs with Changan Auto.](http://www.360doc.com/content/20/1223/17/73053976_953064649.shtml) Which is [huge news considering that Changan is a part of the Big Four, being China\u2019s second most popular car brand.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changan_Automobile) Though I will admit that my mandarin isn\u2019t the best. \n\nRegarding the Microvast finances thread this was my original response without actually (admittedly) reading the reports:\n\n\u201cIsn't this actually \"good\" news, as part of the merger details is Microvast valuation. The lower the Microvast valuation is estimated, the larger the ownership of THCB and its shareholders have of microvast, and the lower the total float when the ticker is converted and merger is completed. The debt risk being a more long term issue and not necessarily a short term issue, especially with the Chinese government more than willing to bail these companies out. E.g they gave Nio and others millions in low-interest loans, and have indicated they will spend money where needed. Microvast was the #2 bus battery supplier pre-covid so I doubt the CCP lets them fail\u2026\n\nJust 3 days ago they claimed 2020 sales YoY have doubled and they are running production at full capacity. I wouldn't put too much weight on the debt/equity ratio here. I mean we see that Apple, Nike, Square, and much more all have high debts greater than equity that make their \"valuation\" zero, both large and small caps. With how low credit interest is, as long as the money isn't being wasted I'm not that worried. There is a clear global demand for the field that they are in\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut let\u2019s now actually look at the reports\n\nFirst half 2019\n\n[http://www.agol.com/sites/www.agol.com/files/reports/2019%2006%2030%20AGOL%20Interims%20-%20Non%20Glossy.pdf](http://www.agol.com/sites/www.agol.com/files/reports/2019%2006%2030%20AGOL%20Interims%20-%20Non%20Glossy.pdf)\n\nSecond half 2019 (new)\n\n[http://www.agol.com/sites/www.agol.com/files/reports/2019%2012%2031%20AGOL%20Accounts%20-%20Non%20Glossy.pdf](http://www.agol.com/sites/www.agol.com/files/reports/2019%2012%2031%20AGOL%20Accounts%20-%20Non%20Glossy.pdf)\n\nFirst half 2020\n\n[http://www.agol.com/sites/www.agol.com/files/reports/2020%2006%2030%20AGOL%20Interims%20-%20Non%20Glossy.pdf](http://www.agol.com/sites/www.agol.com/files/reports/2020%2006%2030%20AGOL%20Interims%20-%20Non%20Glossy.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll start off with who exactly is source. These reports are coming out of an emerging market UK investment firm called Ashmore Global Opportunities. Having lost money YoY since inception the environment of these reports were under the assumption that the fund was to be delisted and closed, which commenced last month.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-10-21/ashmore-global-opportunities-ltd-delisting-and-cancellation-of-shares](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-10-21/ashmore-global-opportunities-ltd-delisting-and-cancellation-of-shares)\n\nIn fact prior to Covid they had a fairly positive outlook on Microvast in their 2016-2019 reports, but the end goal was always to devest and close. \n\n**\u201cStrong operating performance, in particular by Microvast, led initially to upward revisions in its valuations and thus of the NAV of the Company. However, the fall in Chinese equities led to lower comparable valuations, and the valuation agent also reflected this in its assessment of Microvast\u2019s valuation. In addition, new capital was raised to fund expansion, in which AGOL could not participate since it is out of its investment period.\u201d**\n\nThey go on to state\n\n**\u201cMicrovast continues to supply batteries for pure e-bus and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) to almost all major Chinese original bus manufacturers (OEMs), with these being deployed in over 30 cities in China. Follow-on orders continue to be received for the European bus market.\u201d**\n\nAll in all, this was actually a fairly small firm and exited literally right before the EV boom. They struggled to make money with their other investments and for that, I don't really hold their opinions that strongly, good or bad.\n\nIn summary (in bold) this is what is in as many reports I could find (we may not get a second half 2020), and my due diligence responses are right below.\n\n**Financials** \n\n**Revenue from 2016 to 2019 is estimated to have fallen from $210M to $176M. Gross Margins has fallen from 35% to 20 directly related to subsidy cuts, and Covid-19.** \n\nIn the original thread the OP says the last revenue it $35m or $90m? This is FALSE the last reported FULL year income was $176M. In their last reports they claim the $35M is misleading as the revenue/contracts are seasonal. Im not sure if OP was using reduing margins to estimate which would be incorrect. I will say that the debt being larger than assets is true but that is the name of the game at this point. Companies like Nike, Apple, JP Morgan, Qualcomm, etc all have more debt than assets. There is no information in these reports if it is long-term or short-term debt which is more important IMHO but we don\u2019t have that. They however don\u2019t seem to have trouble raising money. The reports DO mention that the debt is a result of expanding of factories and R&amp;D. Which is legit, you can freely search for their US patents and Chinese ones (on the Chinese internet), you just have to use the Chinese spelling of the company.  Having built and upgraded factories over the year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key Risks**\n\nAcross all reports this has been under their key risks section. But first I want to clarify this reports English since there seems to have been confusion. They are not saying that this is necessarily what is happening they are stating that this is the MOST RELEVANT risk that COULD happen. \n\nKey risk summary:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Financing problems and possible default on outstanding debts.**\n\nThis is a real risk and is the story of all SPACs IMHO. The reports don\u2019t go into details, but I will say not being \u201cprofitable\u201d was only a relatively recent issue with Covid and supply chain issues. Otherwise, they\u2019ve been profitable and have \u201cgood\u201d debt that came from R&amp;D, factories, etc. Either way it\u2019s a non-factor IMHO based on my commentary above. All it does is change THCB ownership, and investors can see more finances later on and make their own informed decisions. From a trading point of view at this trading level based on actual GWh production, revenue, and gross margins this would make it in terms of \u201cP/E ratio\u201d pretty undervalued (compared to other EV SPACs)  assuming there isn\u2019t a change in THCB\u2019s estimation of Microvast\u2019s value. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Not winning new orders and gaining new revenues.**\n\nThis does not seem to be a significant risk as nearly the entire world seems to be moving towards renewables, including oil which has been investing heavily into renewables. In fact, I think the expansion into an underserved industry such as heavy equipment was brilliant business move. With increases in the domestic and international construction under China and increases in global shipping, the amount of just forklifts alone is expected to increase significantly. [I was unaware that forklift sales are in the millions yearly and I recently found out that Microvast is the battery manufacturer of fortune 500 Linde and its forklifts.](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1664180852734181260&amp;wfr=spider&amp;for=pc)\n\n**Better capitalized competitors who can grow capacity and improve battery technology quicker and thus achieve more favorable economies of scale.**\n\nThis is a significant risk as while Microvast\u2019s [only real competitor for LTO is Toshiba,](https://www.scib.jp/en/index.htm) there are multiple battery manufacturers that supply Li-Iron phosphate and Lithium-Cobalt Oxide, that have the capital to compete with Microvast. But generally, that\u2019s the common risk with investing with small caps, but that\u2019s what also drives volatility.  \n\n**Warranty claims arising from defective cells or modules.**\n\nI don\u2019t believe this to actually be that significant of a risk. The chemistry of the LTO makes this extremely unlikely. Microvast claims there hasn\u2019t been an accident since inception. I am not saying that is not true but I couldn\u2019t find any dirt on the Chinese internet if that\u2019s of any value. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Unfavorable changes to the Chinese government\u2019s New Energy Vehicle policy**\n\nThis is a real risk that has still seen success in other companies. China is running on the California model, and that has not been an Issue for Tesla sales. Obviously Microvast isn\u2019t Tesla but they will have been relying on the same effect. The subsidies are in fact decreasing but Microvast did suffer from a significant 60% cut in 2019 but ongoing any cuts should be much smaller and China is now also giving fines and forcing EV quotas. In summary I think people will buy more as subsidies shrink. While per vehicle sale margins will decrease it will be offset by the exponential growth in EV adoption including city buses\n\n[https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/china-cuts-subsidies-city-ebuses-will-be-less-affected-than-other-segments/](https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/china-cuts-subsidies-city-ebuses-will-be-less-affected-than-other-segments/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary, Microvast is no worse in terms of risk, including finances, than other SPACs on here. At least we have financial information here, something that isn\u2019t too common for other SPACs. Yet there are some individuals who are vehemently against it but post about other SPACs that IMHO are legitimately worthless if they have zero revenue and products. They are entitled to their opinion and so am I, but I would hope those opinions to be based more on facts that we can discuss versus opinions, xenophobic like comments, and generally shitposts long or short.",

        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is near the lows and almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\nIf you guys find this list useful (it's my first time posting this here), I can make this a weekly/weekend thing. I like doing it on Sundays so I can prepare for the trading week ahead.\n\n# High IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays! Also, the \"next earnings date\" data will resume starting in January, 2021 (very soon).\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit. If you want to see the full list and filter by ticker, check out the tool in the link at the top.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|Market Cap|Stock Price|IV (%)|Next Earnings Date|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|VZ - Verizon Communications Inc|250B|$60.38|16%|N/A|\n|SPY - SSgA Active Trust - SSGA SPDR S&amp;P 500|320B|$366.09|17%|N/A|\n|PG - Procter &amp;

        "selftext": "  \n\nWith all the IPO craze weve been seeing right now, its kinda hard to recommend anyone buying into them.( still kinda chocked to see that this opened at 250%.) In fact, ive been recommending more people to move into SPAC plays instead because of the limited downside and room for price discovery especially for the retail investors like us. Investing in a good spac near nav is literally a no brainer and free tendies. That being said, since I have already done the research and a write up for Abcellera, might as well share it with everyone. Please keep in mind that im not recommending people buying into nor do I have a position in this stock. To be quite frankly, no way in hell should this company be trading at such level yet, at least not in another few years to come. But here you go:\n\nWe are talking about a company **backed by Bill Gates and has Peter Thiel as the board of director to bring the table experience in scaling technology companies (Daddy Thiel actually owns a stake of the company)**. Abcellera is a company **that helped Lily with the development of the antibody cocktail for COVID at a record-breaking speed** and is entitled to receive percentage of the proceeds that Lily receives from the sales. Currently US government has secured 300,000 does with the option to secure 70,000 more and Canada has secured 26,000 doses with more to come. **Abcellera has been cash flow positive every year since inception and has shown an annual revenue growth rate of 100% over the past 5 years and is here to print ya\u2019ll motherfuckers some real serious tendies.**\n\nAbout Abcellera\n\nAbcellera is a technology company that searches, decodes, and analyzes natural immune systems to find antibodies that can be developed to prevent and treat disease through artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced technology platform. **Traditional biotech industries usually take too long, cost too much and fails way too often. Drugs discovery usually takes 5 to 15 years with less than 5% success rate and cost billions of dollars to find approved molecules. Abcellera provides the teams and technologies that work broadly with the biotech industries to put the best science and best innovator in touch with the best technology to get faster drugs to patients.** Abcellera essentially **solves the two fundamental problems that hinder the discovery and the development of next generation antibody- based therapeutics. The first is the technology: because of the limitations of legacy discovery approaches, there are many well validated targets for which suitable antibodies cannot be found. The second is access: most companies are forced to cobble together fragmented solutions and lack the facilities and expertise needed to prosecute their antibody programs. Both problems contribute to the rising cost of drug development and delay brining needed therapies to patients.** With the leverage of Abcellera\u2019s technology, Eli Lily was able to put out COVID-19 antibody cocktail to trials within a record-breaking speed of just 3 months. Abcellera was able screen through 5.5mil + immune cells to see which makes antibodies on Day 4, find 2K+ potential antibodies that could stick to the virus surface on Day 6, sequence through DNA of 500+ antibodies that could stick to virus spike protein on Day 9, select 190 most promising antibodies for potency testing on Day 17, and finally select 24 antibody front runners for Eli Lily to further develop them into antibody cocktail. Within the past 3 years, **Abcellera has already accrued more than 40 deals, engaged in 94 discovery programs, and under contracted with 26 partners.** **With validation from the partnerships with major biotech firms, it signifies the effectiveness and the reliability of the platform setting Abcellera up for a more lucrative terms and deals in the future.** Through the partnership agreements, Abcellera **will collect near-term payment for technology access, research and intellectual property right, and downstream payments in form of clinical and commercial milestones and royalties on net sales. (Three parts income source model)**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nHow big is antibody therapy?\n\nAntibody therapy has already been one of the biggest discoveries and is not a thing of the future rather the thing of the present. In 2019**, 7 out of 10 of the best-selling drugs were monoclonal antibodies.** **The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market has been valued at 150bil by the end of 2019 and 300bil by 2025** with many drugs already approved for treating cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases.  \n\nCompetitive landscape \n\nAlthough there are a few of companies developing antibody therapy drugs, they are not the direct competitors of Abcellera. **The purpose of Abcellera is to provide the technology for the biotech companies especially the small to medium firms the ability to compete on the same playing field as the big boys or act as a more cost-effective way of developing new drugs.** (Think of it as the biotech version of TSMC where it provides AMD the ability to compete or over taking Intel, or acts as a more cost-effective ways for chip designers like Apple and Qualcomm to push out chips.) **Over 90% of the antibody market is dominated by 8 companies and Abcellera is here to shake the ground.** \n\nNotable highlights and future plans for the past months:\n\n\\- Named on the fierce biotech\u2019s fierce 15 list company of 2020\n\n\\- Partnership with Invetx to develop new antibody therapies to improve the quality of life of animals and to bring next generation veterinary therapeutics to the market\n\n\\- Partnership with Kodiak science to develop eye disease antibodies\n\n\\- Partnership with IGM biosciences \n\n\\- Acquisition of Ttianni ( a company for developing humanized mice that is designed to maximize immune responses, increase antibody diversity, and preserve natural mutation of fully human antibodies in rodents)\n\n\\- Acquisition of OrthMab (a clinically validated platform that uses the most advanced computational and experimental protein engineering methods to create bispecific antibodies from any two antibody sequences.)",

        "selftext": "**DocuSign crushes earnings and AMC may go bankrupt. Lemonade spiked yesterday over 20% while Pfizer confirmed delivery numbers, let\u2019s talk about this and everything new in the stock market**\n\nHey everyone! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the DOW leading the way up almost 0,3% with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/G9JLH78) close behind up 0,23% and finishing at a new record high while the broader market [SP500](https://ibb.co/7rMK8RY) finished barely down for the day. All 3 of them were trading a lot higher intraday before the most recent Pfizer [news](https://ibb.co/qCXxh0Q) popped up as they are only expected to ship half of the doses that were initially planned, but people spooked at this to much in my opinion. This thing was already known, when they published the candidate data in November, they also [announced](https://ibb.co/cDtdMCy) this number, but people runed away way to fast before going more into the data. Pfizer did not cut supply, they just explained why this happened in this latest headline. It is way better for companies to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around.\n\nThe [VIX](https://ibb.co/HYrVJNH) also saw a spike around the Pfizer news and finished higher for the day while 59% of companies were advancing with almost 150 new highs and just 3 new lows on below average volume of 11,5 billion shares compared to 11,7 billion shares in the last 20 trading days. [CHART](https://ibb.co/6PVC7Lr)\n\nThe best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/2t3kk7m) yesterday were Energy and Real Estate while Utilities finished more than 1% down for the day with small and mid-cap growth companies [leading](https://ibb.co/sP2rMzd) the way while the large-caps where lagging the market as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/d2cJ7hZ) as all the FAANG stocks were down with Microsoft also joining them. While TESLA continued to be red hot and Alibaba has finally regained some momentum.\n\nHere is the most important [ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/w6b2bxv) that will be released today as we will get nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rates in the early morning alongside the trade deficit, with Factory orders numbers coming in a bit latter. \n\nThe [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/7GrND6j) are largely higher today not only in the US but also Europe is [gaining](https://ibb.co/mXsLDSb) momentum after Germany manufacturing [orders](https://ibb.co/9NVsjQw) rose for the sixth straight month in October and [Asia](https://ibb.co/7zhQnDt) as the global retail sector saw an [increase](https://ibb.co/k4dCN3f) of 30% in transactions with the whole Black Friday to Cyber Monday period doing very well this year.\n\nWhile yesterday we got numbers on the [NOVEMBER ISM](https://ibb.co/hcmvzgg) as it continued to a sixth straight month of expansion with employment being the biggest gainer in the index with even greater numbers coming in from the [PMI COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/GHcFV4g) with the fastest growth since 2015 as employment rose at the fastest pace in the history of the survey.\n\nAlso, the Jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/7txF4QQ) came in whey lower than expected at 712k more than 60k below estimated with continuing claims dropping for the first time in the last 9 months to under 6 million\n\nMeanwhile we also got some sales number for October in the [SEMI sector](https://ibb.co/VTy4BvP) yesterday, as sales had big increases Y/Y and M/M with all regions ramping up sales on a monthly basis. This is great news for companies like Nvidia, QCOM, AVGO and many more.\n\nMoving on to the auto sector the US light vehicle sales [forecast](https://ibb.co/THKtD9y) has seen an improved outlook for next year, up around 10% from 2020 at around 15.6 million with US [EV SALES](https://ibb.co/Hdk0qqq) increasing over 70% next year, this could be a huge boost to Tesla and other EV ramping up players like GM and FORD.\n\nThis is great news for Tesla after a big bear on the company just [trimmed](https://ibb.co/25tcFhJ) his short position on TESLA\n\n[Lemonade](https://ibb.co/wLqdKCS) had a big jump yesterday after the Motley Fool [published](https://ibb.co/PrJVJ5G) a long pitch for this company. I also own this stock and I believe it can become a very big player in the insurance business in the future. At the moment the company still only has a small market cap but I plan to own this for the long-term(5+years) as I expect great things from them. But don\u2019t just rush today in the stock because it spiked 20%, wait for it to cool off, maybe dollar cost average on it.\n\nWhile I am very interested to see what Disney [announces](https://ibb.co/hZDjxwk) next week as they may give new information on how the streaming business is doing and what the plans for the company are looking forward as 30% of the revenues of the company came from parks in the last years. I don\u2019t think that parks are ever going to be such a big part of the company as streaming and content production will lead the way. But I still like this company very much as it is one of my biggest portfolio holdings and I can see this stock rising to 170$ in the near future.\n\nA couple of companies released earnings yesterday as DocuSign [beat](https://ibb.co/znppzsn) the top and bottom line with billings coming in at $440M way over the consensus of $386M due to many more customers using the electronic signature to close contracts. While they also offered [guidance](https://ibb.co/34Hfnsz) for next quarter of around $404M to $408M also better than consensus at $387M as the stock is up 5% pre-market. \n\nWhile Marvell [missed](https://ibb.co/nCx5nHF) on expectations as the company cited supply issues constraints that are limiting the capability to satisfy demand. \n\nBad [news](https://ibb.co/yWJz3Kg) also came in for AMC with Warner\u2019s decision to send all they\u2019re 2021 movies directly to streaming on the same day as the theatrical release. This combined with the fact that AMC is filling to sell around [200M shares](https://ibb.co/Lkjkt5G), makes me think that this company is going to have the same route as Hertz. The cinema business wasn\u2019t doing so great since 2017, and this might be the final blow for the industry.\n\nAnd one final thought, it might be a good opportunity to get long on Dave &amp; Busters, Chewy, Adobe and Lululemon for next week, as I think they are all poised for good quarterly results. So, I will give all of them a small allocation today as I think there might be some good upside here in a few days, as there is a lot of money still on the sidelines with the most recent AAII asset [survey](https://ibb.co/7SRKkzk) showing that investors have more than 18% in cash on hands that can be pumped in the stock market.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "**Disney lays out the plans for the future, the FDA advisory panel gives their OK. What\u2019s my price target and should you buy DoorDash and AirBnB? Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good morning! So let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we only saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/1RgJRtS) gaining some ground, up more than half a % while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/vQY7s6C) finished .13% down and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/BcgtnC2) fell just below 30k, losing .23% for the day. All 3 indexes traded way lower in the beginning of the day after the jobless claims came in, but recovered once the FDA Advisory panel meeting started. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/SwcQnHs) finish higher for the day after it opened at over 23 to start us off.\n\nAlmost 60% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/qdWy3jk), but the volume was way below average for most of them, with the Energy sector being the only significant gainer, up 3% for the day while most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/5xskzgj) were flat or even lost ground for the day. On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/Z28KH04), only large-cap value companies from the industrial sector suffered big yesterday, as small cap growth companies outperformed.\n\nYou can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0jvPBX), that big caps, with the exception of Apple and Tesla did struggle yesterday, while most of the companies with big gains were from the oil &amp; gas industry, with Chevron gaining more than 3% for the day, while Exxon, Total and BP also had big gains.\n\nThe numbers that came in [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MPxZS56) on the economic front where mixed. As initial and continuing jobless claims came in [worse](https://ibb.co/NmgdXbJ) than expected, as more than 850K people filed for initial claims up more than 125K since the last week and what the analysts [expected](https://ibb.co/KrGcRk7), as this was the biggest spike in initial claims since march, while the continuing claims also rose for the first time since September. I am wondering, will [this](https://ibb.co/0X6FCH5) finally push the congress to act on a relief bill? I think the economy really needs it as a bridge to better times. Just look at the [EU](https://ibb.co/ncSgyWd), they have finally agreed on $2.2T budget and stimulus package to help the Eurozone get through the difficult times.\n\nBetter numbers came in from the consumer price [index](https://ibb.co/NjLW663), as the index rose by .2%, after it was unchanged in October, but this should be taken with a grain of salt, as most of consumer confidence increase comes from the high-income [consumers](https://ibb.co/DVJ5nK9), while people who have an income under $50K still struggling.\n\nAlso, the Federal [Budget](https://ibb.co/8BFdyZ7) came in better than expected as the deficit shrank more in November compared to October and compared to last year\u2019s month.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/pP78rTs) is a slow day in terms of economic data, but we do get a final read on the Producer price index and the consumer sentiment index.\n\nWe also finally got the [FDA](https://ibb.co/9gLsrh6) panel of outside experts meeting yesterday, which saw the panel vote 17 FOR, 4 against and one abstain. The only small concerns were on the topic of 16 and 17-year old\u2019s as some experts argued that there is insufficient data on that subgroup, but I don\u2019t think that is a case for concern, as the vaccine is likely going to take a while until young people will start to get the shot, as they are one of the least impacted groups. This is great news, as the FDA does usually follow up this committee advice, so we can see the FDA Emergency use authorization very very soon. Vaccine doses are already ready go within 24hours of the authorization so, things will start to move rather fast after that.\n\nSo, we got some earnings numbers yesterday from a lot of companies, let\u2019s talk about them a little.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/C040BWf) posted a beat on the top and bottom line with e-commerce sales rising by more than 80%, while [comparable](https://ibb.co/YQQknbj) sales in stores were more than 17%. With both EPS and revenue beating the estimates, I think this might be the time to get into COSTCO, as they are one of the best retailers in the world, they always trade at a premium, the [stock](https://ibb.co/QnQNJGJ) is just about 5% from the all-time high and is far from overbought territory. I really like them as they have also rewarded shareholders constantly both with great growth and dividends.\n\n[Broadcom](https://ibb.co/St74KMD) also posted a great beat on EPS and an 11% increase in revenues, fueled by a great beat in the semiconductor segment, while also posting a free cash flow of over $3B, way better than expected, as they also increased the quarterly dividend by 11% and have made a lot of [senior](https://ibb.co/hcMS6Vs) leadership changes yesterday, but the [stock](https://ibb.co/TB97nhZ) is down more than 2% in pre-market trading despite a lot of great numbers.\n\nThe company has most of its [revenues](https://ibb.co/bLbzgKL) coming from semiconductor solutions, this is very good as the [global](https://ibb.co/GfZGfnz) semiconductor sales have increased more than 5% in FY2020 and are expected to increase more than 8% for FY 2021, way better than the previous [outlook](https://ibb.co/MSrLh0p) of 6,2%.\n\nThe company also posted all time [highs](https://ibb.co/1vM8WP0) in net revenue, free cash flows, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, while the compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/zRW1jLZ) of the dividend since FY2016 is almost 50%. I think I might be investing even more in this company especially if they have a pullback.\n\nNext let\u2019s go to Lululemon who also [posted](https://ibb.co/qF1NnnN) a beat on EPS and Revenues, while comparable sales were up 19% with better gross and operating margins than expected. This was led by a huge [rise](https://ibb.co/zfKRJX5) in the international markets which will continue to expand as they gain more recognition overseas.\n\nA smaller company that [reported](https://ibb.co/2WMrybz) yesterday was Dave &amp; Buster\u2019s as the losses were smaller than expected as comparable store sales declined by 66% as the restrictions in the restaurant industry keeps hammering away. The stock was trading +4% in after hours as investors may have though of an even worse result.\n\nMoving on, [Adobe](https://ibb.co/Vjwwprm) also released earnings before the market opened yesterday, after a delayed earnings release. They posted a great beat on EPS and the revenues while also giving great guidance for next year, way above the consensus, with more than $15B in revenues and a EPS of over $11. The company also announced a new $15B share buyback [program](https://ibb.co/cKBbMpF) which will increase the value of the stock through the next 4 years while also have a strong [growth](https://ibb.co/G7BySxH) path, and despite all of this the stock [lost](https://ibb.co/Bnkk60T) more than 1,4% for the day.\n\nThe other earnings report that was released yesterday was from [Oracle](https://ibb.co/KsSGZNW), they also posted a great beat on the top and bottom line, but didn\u2019t offer any guidance as that kind of disappointed investors and dipped about 1% in after hours. I don\u2019t really have a great grasp of the company\u2019s growth potential is right now.\n\nWe also got the Disney Investors meeting, in which the company share a lot of new great things. First of all, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/kJRc01G) has gone up another 18% since just 4 weeks ago, and is up to more than 86M subscribers, with the total number for the company\u2019s streaming services surpassing 137M as they plan to expand Disney+ in Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets next year.\n\nThe company also [expects](https://ibb.co/4skfTC8) to have more than 230M subscribers by 2024, a very big increase from the prior estimate, while they are also planning on raising the monthly fee starting in March.\n\nThey plan to [release](https://ibb.co/F0G0C84) a lot of new content directly to Disney+, which is another big hit to the cinema world. With the Marvel and Star Wars series being big blockbusters for the movie industry.\n\nThey presented so much new [content](https://ibb.co/8jpZtWN) for the company, that it took them more than 2 hours to talk about all of this.\n\nBut they also [said](https://ibb.co/DWwJ1tg) that these decisions are temporary, and that they still prefer theatrical releases especially for blockbusters, so, there is still some hope for cinema\u2019s, but maybe not just right now, it will take years to recover from this, and they will probably have to largely reduce the number of screens so that they may become profitable again.\n\nSo, over 100 new content releases per year is a lot for the [company](https://ibb.co/fFD4vhs), this was a very good investors meeting that pleased investors, as the company is [trading](https://ibb.co/Y86n6HD) \\+7,5% in pre-market.\n\nDisney is my second biggest position in my portfolio and I am really happy with what the company presented today. I think this stock may get to 200$ easily when the parks and entertainment business goes back online, as that accounted for 1/3 of the revenues before this year.\n\nIn other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/NL6sXcT), NIO will offer 60M shares, with an additional 9M shares option for underwriters. The stock fell sharply after the news, dropping more than 6% in After-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/85PycWh).\n\nAlso, Qualcomm suffered after the close yesterday, as the shares fell more than 5% after [news](https://ibb.co/5h4syVT) popped that Apple is moving to a develop their first cellular modem which will replace the Qualcomm modem in iPhone. The shares dropped as Qualcomm gets about 11% of its revenue from Apple.\n\nSo, one last thing that I want to talk about is the recent IPOs from DoorDash and AirBnb.\n\nAirBNB also went public yesterday and [started](https://ibb.co/PCNjM3W) trading at $146, way above the $68 IPO price. This means the company has a [market cap](https://ibb.co/QNmGhqy) of over $100B, way higher than its rival Booking at $86B market cap and even [higher](https://ibb.co/cyp2hz1) than some of the biggest hotels in the world, Marriot &amp; Hilton. The [stock](https://ibb.co/C9P3McG) even hit a new high of $165, I believe this happened as brokers started to get hands on the shares and orders started to fill in, but the stock did go back down to finish at $144, that means the stock gained more than 112% just in one day. The stock is down again more than 2% in pre-market guys. \n\nI would avoid these stocks as much as I can as I believe they are well overhyped at the moment. I think we can see a pullback that may offer a better opportunity in AirBnb after the first earnings results. I would buy this company only if it drops to around 80$ as a price target, if not I maintain my sell opinion on the stock, though I personally, am not shorting any stock due to the risk of the high volatility associated with this companies as they have a very small share float.\n\nWhile my opinion on [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/qkqSz1t) is that we might not see a pullback or correction as soon as AirBnb as demand will probably continue to be strong for at least a couple of quarters, before the growth slows down as well as very though future comps. We might see a drop in price then, as I think this stock is also well overvalued. I also maintain my sell opinion on this stock and just like with AirBNB, I am not going to touch this stock, I think a reasonable PT for DoorDash as a sell is about 100$. But I would try to stay away as much as possible, I\u2019d rather go and find better growth opportunities in other companies, and not waste time and money on these 2 stocks. \n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Year-end Santa rally could depend on the big week ahead for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/congres-fe.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is so jam-packed for markets that it could determine whether there will be a smooth glide path for a Santa rally into the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; First, Congress looks set to fight down to the wire about a pandemic stimulus package, and chances are good it could again disappoint. The Fed also holds its final meeting of the year, and market pros are split on whether it will tweak its bond buying program when it issues its statement Wednesday. Since there\u2019s a divided view, there\u2019s room for market reaction either way.\n*****\n&gt; Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.\n*****\n&gt; Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&amp;P 500 at Friday\u2019s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility \u2014 the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don\u2019t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don\u2019t get one,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThe tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,\u201d Hogan said.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBut you can\u2019t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Tesla revving up the S&amp;P\n&gt; Tesla\u2019s entry into the S&amp;P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&amp;P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday\u2019s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t know if it creates volatility. It\u2019s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,\u201d said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cGiven we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn\u2019t take much to see the VIX spike.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to create more noise,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&amp;P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P.\n*****\n&gt; Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&amp;P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,\u201d Bartolini said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt will be exciting. You\u2019re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.\n*****\n&gt; There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn\u2019t do,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. \u201cThat has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663. Treasury yields moved higher in the past week but retrenched Friday, when the 10-year sank below 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; # Window on the economy\n&gt; There\u2019s a busy economic calendar in the week ahead. Weekly claims Thursday are expected to be closely watched after a surprise jump in people seeking new benefits for the week ending Dec. 5.\n*****\n&gt; November Markit PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors are released Wednesday, as is the November retail sales report.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said he is watching to see how much the services sector is being impacted by the spreading pandemic and related shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the economic data is being overlooked for better or worse because it\u2019s pre-vaccine,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect the economy is slowing and the labor market has been weakening, particularly since the virus spread has continued to accelerate. Some expect the first quarter to be weaker than the fourth quarter, but activity should pick up in the second quarter as the vaccine is distributed.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/2S0NcDWd/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8vWKDYz/alphatrends1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/L6BpPf6b/finvizfuts.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/5Q2G6MV.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR3gStWM/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Vv8hsGML/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jdjX6YsY/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jGGBSNx/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eOWZhrG.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LxpLHIm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/643dART.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Not All Bad for Small Business\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released their monthly reading on the small business sector. With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.\n\n&gt; As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.\n\n&gt; For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.\n\n&gt; We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Empl.png))**\n\n&gt; Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.\n\n&gt; In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**\n\n&gt; Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.\n\n&gt; Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Expan.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders\n\n&gt; The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/1210-Mega.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish\n\n&gt; For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bullish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**\n\n&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-AAII-Bearish.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bearish.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bulls.

The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.\n\n&gt; Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/35feeda338d979bfb6b6f25b3156fb4d/11fa20ff3c6ff3a3-4b/s500x750/454472c6c7d32c04ce9ec7e2e0ca7c045dab183d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is Inflation Looming?\n\n&gt; The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and \u201ccore\u201d readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we\u2019ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.\n\n&gt; \u201cCongress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in today\u2019s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/CM3tmKQp/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Wb0yKPBF/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oxA4VQw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sO15Y4c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jQE7QFL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8q2wpXy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/f4M4FMw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D6W4j8k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dGlrSdg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $289.47\n**FedEx Corp.

        "selftext": "**Disney lays out the plans for the future, the FDA advisory panel gives their OK. What\u2019s my price target and should you buy DoorDash and AirBnB? Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good morning! So let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we only saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/1RgJRtS) gaining some ground, up more than half a % while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/vQY7s6C) finished .13% down and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/BcgtnC2) fell just below 30k, losing .23% for the day. All 3 indexes traded way lower in the beginning of the day after the jobless claims came in, but recovered once the FDA Advisory panel meeting started. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/SwcQnHs) finish higher for the day after it opened at over 23 to start us off.\n\nAlmost 60% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/qdWy3jk), but the volume was way below average for most of them, with the Energy sector being the only significant gainer, up 3% for the day while most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/5xskzgj) were flat or even lost ground for the day. On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/Z28KH04), only large-cap value companies from the industrial sector suffered big yesterday, as small cap growth companies outperformed.\n\nYou can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0jvPBX), that big caps, with the exception of Apple and Tesla did struggle yesterday, while most of the companies with big gains were from the oil &amp; gas industry, with Chevron gaining more than 3% for the day, while Exxon, Total and BP also had big gains.\n\nThe numbers that came in [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MPxZS56) on the economic front where mixed. As initial and continuing jobless claims came in [worse](https://ibb.co/NmgdXbJ) than expected, as more than 850K people filed for initial claims up more than 125K since the last week and what the analysts [expected](https://ibb.co/KrGcRk7), as this was the biggest spike in initial claims since march, while the continuing claims also rose for the first time since September. I am wondering, will [this](https://ibb.co/0X6FCH5) finally push the congress to act on a relief bill? I think the economy really needs it as a bridge to better times. Just look at the [EU](https://ibb.co/ncSgyWd), they have finally agreed on $2.2T budget and stimulus package to help the Eurozone get through the difficult times.\n\nBetter numbers came in from the consumer price [index](https://ibb.co/NjLW663), as the index rose by .2%, after it was unchanged in October, but this should be taken with a grain of salt, as most of consumer confidence increase comes from the high-income [consumers](https://ibb.co/DVJ5nK9), while people who have an income under $50K still struggling.\n\nAlso, the Federal [Budget](https://ibb.co/8BFdyZ7) came in better than expected as the deficit shrank more in November compared to October and compared to last year\u2019s month.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/pP78rTs) is a slow day in terms of economic data, but we do get a final read on the Producer price index and the consumer sentiment index.\n\nWe also finally got the [FDA](https://ibb.co/9gLsrh6) panel of outside experts meeting yesterday, which saw the panel vote 17 FOR, 4 against and one abstain. The only small concerns were on the topic of 16 and 17-year old\u2019s as some experts argued that there is insufficient data on that subgroup, but I don\u2019t think that is a case for concern, as the vaccine is likely going to take a while until young people will start to get the shot, as they are one of the least impacted groups. This is great news, as the FDA does usually follow up this committee advice, so we can see the FDA Emergency use authorization very very soon. Vaccine doses are already ready go within 24hours of the authorization so, things will start to move rather fast after that.\n\nSo, we got some earnings numbers yesterday from a lot of companies, let\u2019s talk about them a little.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/C040BWf) posted a beat on the top and bottom line with e-commerce sales rising by more than 80%, while [comparable](https://ibb.co/YQQknbj) sales in stores were more than 17%. With both EPS and revenue beating the estimates, I think this might be the time to get into COSTCO, as they are one of the best retailers in the world, they always trade at a premium, the [stock](https://ibb.co/QnQNJGJ) is just about 5% from the all-time high and is far from overbought territory. I really like them as they have also rewarded shareholders constantly both with great growth and dividends.\n\n[Broadcom](https://ibb.co/St74KMD) also posted a great beat on EPS and an 11% increase in revenues, fueled by a great beat in the semiconductor segment, while also posting a free cash flow of over $3B, way better than expected, as they also increased the quarterly dividend by 11% and have made a lot of [senior](https://ibb.co/hcMS6Vs) leadership changes yesterday, but the [stock](https://ibb.co/TB97nhZ) is down more than 2% in pre-market trading despite a lot of great numbers.\n\nThe company has most of its [revenues](https://ibb.co/bLbzgKL) coming from semiconductor solutions, this is very good as the [global](https://ibb.co/GfZGfnz) semiconductor sales have increased more than 5% in FY2020 and are expected to increase more than 8% for FY 2021, way better than the previous [outlook](https://ibb.co/MSrLh0p) of 6,2%.\n\nThe company also posted all time [highs](https://ibb.co/1vM8WP0) in net revenue, free cash flows, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, while the compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/zRW1jLZ) of the dividend since FY2016 is almost 50%. I think I might be investing even more in this company especially if they have a pullback.\n\nNext let\u2019s go to Lululemon who also [posted](https://ibb.co/qF1NnnN) a beat on EPS and Revenues, while comparable sales were up 19% with better gross and operating margins than expected. This was led by a huge [rise](https://ibb.co/zfKRJX5) in the international markets which will continue to expand as they gain more recognition overseas.\n\nA smaller company that [reported](https://ibb.co/2WMrybz) yesterday was Dave &amp; Buster\u2019s as the losses were smaller than expected as comparable store sales declined by 66% as the restrictions in the restaurant industry keeps hammering away. The stock was trading +4% in after hours as investors may have though of an even worse result.\n\nMoving on, [Adobe](https://ibb.co/Vjwwprm) also released earnings before the market opened yesterday, after a delayed earnings release. They posted a great beat on EPS and the revenues while also giving great guidance for next year, way above the consensus, with more than $15B in revenues and a EPS of over $11. The company also announced a new $15B share buyback [program](https://ibb.co/cKBbMpF) which will increase the value of the stock through the next 4 years while also have a strong [growth](https://ibb.co/G7BySxH) path, and despite all of this the stock [lost](https://ibb.co/Bnkk60T) more than 1,4% for the day.\n\nThe other earnings report that was released yesterday was from [Oracle](https://ibb.co/KsSGZNW), they also posted a great beat on the top and bottom line, but didn\u2019t offer any guidance as that kind of disappointed investors and dipped about 1% in after hours. I don\u2019t really have a great grasp of the company\u2019s growth potential is right now.\n\nWe also got the Disney Investors meeting, in which the company share a lot of new great things. First of all, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/kJRc01G) has gone up another 18% since just 4 weeks ago, and is up to more than 86M subscribers, with the total number for the company\u2019s streaming services surpassing 137M as they plan to expand Disney+ in Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets next year.\n\nThe company also [expects](https://ibb.co/4skfTC8) to have more than 230M subscribers by 2024, a very big increase from the prior estimate, while they are also planning on raising the monthly fee starting in March.\n\nThey plan to [release](https://ibb.co/F0G0C84) a lot of new content directly to Disney+, which is another big hit to the cinema world. With the Marvel and Star Wars series being big blockbusters for the movie industry.\n\nThey presented so much new [content](https://ibb.co/8jpZtWN) for the company, that it took them more than 2 hours to talk about all of this.\n\nBut they also [said](https://ibb.co/DWwJ1tg) that these decisions are temporary, and that they still prefer theatrical releases especially for blockbusters, so, there is still some hope for cinema\u2019s, but maybe not just right now, it will take years to recover from this, and they will probably have to largely reduce the number of screens so that they may become profitable again.\n\nSo, over 100 new content releases per year is a lot for the [company](https://ibb.co/fFD4vhs), this was a very good investors meeting that pleased investors, as the company is [trading](https://ibb.co/Y86n6HD) \\+7,5% in pre-market.\n\nDisney is my second biggest position in my portfolio and I am really happy with what the company presented today. I think this stock may get to 200$ easily when the parks and entertainment business goes back online, as that accounted for 1/3 of the revenues before this year.\n\nIn other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/NL6sXcT), NIO will offer 60M shares, with an additional 9M shares option for underwriters. The stock fell sharply after the news, dropping more than 6% in After-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/85PycWh).\n\nAlso, Qualcomm suffered after the close yesterday, as the shares fell more than 5% after [news](https://ibb.co/5h4syVT) popped that Apple is moving to a develop their first cellular modem which will replace the Qualcomm modem in iPhone. The shares dropped as Qualcomm gets about 11% of its revenue from Apple.\n\nSo, one last thing that I want to talk about is the recent IPOs from DoorDash and AirBnb.\n\nAirBNB also went public yesterday and [started](https://ibb.co/PCNjM3W) trading at $146, way above the $68 IPO price. This means the company has a [market cap](https://ibb.co/QNmGhqy) of over $100B, way higher than its rival Booking at $86B market cap and even [higher](https://ibb.co/cyp2hz1) than some of the biggest hotels in the world, Marriot &amp; Hilton. The [stock](https://ibb.co/C9P3McG) even hit a new high of $165, I believe this happened as brokers started to get hands on the shares and orders started to fill in, but the stock did go back down to finish at $144, that means the stock gained more than 112% just in one day. The stock is down again more than 2% in pre-market guys.\n\nI would avoid these stocks as much as I can as I believe they are well overhyped at the moment. I think we can see a pullback that may offer a better opportunity in AirBnb after the first earnings results. I would buy this company only if it drops to around 80$ as a price target, if not I maintain my sell opinion on the stock, though I personally, am not shorting any stock due to the risk of the high volatility associated with this companies as they have a very small share float.\n\nWhile my opinion on [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/qkqSz1t) is that we might not see a pullback or correction as soon as AirBnb as demand will probably continue to be strong for at least a couple of quarters, before the growth slows down as well as very though future comps. We might see a drop in price then, as I think this stock is also well overvalued. I also maintain my sell opinion on this stock and just like with AirBNB, I am not going to touch this stock, I think a reasonable PT for DoorDash as a sell is about 100$. But I would try to stay away as much as possible, I\u2019d rather go and find better growth opportunities in other companies, and not waste time and money on these 2 stocks.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**Disney lays out the plans for the future, the FDA advisory panel gives their OK. What\u2019s my price target and should you buy DoorDash and AirBnB? Let\u2019s talk about this and everything about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Good morning! So let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we only saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/1RgJRtS) gaining some ground, up more than half a % while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/vQY7s6C) finished .13% down and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/BcgtnC2) fell just below 30k, losing .23% for the day. All 3 indexes traded way lower in the beginning of the day after the jobless claims came in, but recovered once the FDA Advisory panel meeting started. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/SwcQnHs) finish higher for the day after it opened at over 23 to start us off.\n\nAlmost 60% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/qdWy3jk), but the volume was way below average for most of them, with the Energy sector being the only significant gainer, up 3% for the day while most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/5xskzgj) were flat or even lost ground for the day. On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/Z28KH04), only large-cap value companies from the industrial sector suffered big yesterday, as small cap growth companies outperformed.\n\nYou can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0jvPBX), that big caps, with the exception of Apple and Tesla did struggle yesterday, while most of the companies with big gains were from the oil &amp; gas industry, with Chevron gaining more than 3% for the day, while Exxon, Total and BP also had big gains.\n\nThe numbers that came in [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MPxZS56) on the economic front where mixed. As initial and continuing jobless claims came in [worse](https://ibb.co/NmgdXbJ) than expected, as more than 850K people filed for initial claims up more than 125K since the last week and what the analysts [expected](https://ibb.co/KrGcRk7), as this was the biggest spike in initial claims since march, while the continuing claims also rose for the first time since September. I am wondering, will [this](https://ibb.co/0X6FCH5) finally push the congress to act on a relief bill? I think the economy really needs it as a bridge to better times. Just look at the [EU](https://ibb.co/ncSgyWd), they have finally agreed on $2.2T budget and stimulus package to help the Eurozone get through the difficult times.\n\nBetter numbers came in from the consumer price [index](https://ibb.co/NjLW663), as the index rose by .2%, after it was unchanged in October, but this should be taken with a grain of salt, as most of consumer confidence increase comes from the high-income [consumers](https://ibb.co/DVJ5nK9), while people who have an income under $50K still struggling.\n\nAlso, the Federal [Budget](https://ibb.co/8BFdyZ7) came in better than expected as the deficit shrank more in November compared to October and compared to last year\u2019s month.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/pP78rTs) is a slow day in terms of economic data, but we do get a final read on the Producer price index and the consumer sentiment index.\n\nWe also finally got the [FDA](https://ibb.co/9gLsrh6) panel of outside experts meeting yesterday, which saw the panel vote 17 FOR, 4 against and one abstain. The only small concerns were on the topic of 16 and 17-year old\u2019s as some experts argued that there is insufficient data on that subgroup, but I don\u2019t think that is a case for concern, as the vaccine is likely going to take a while until young people will start to get the shot, as they are one of the least impacted groups. This is great news, as the FDA does usually follow up this committee advice, so we can see the FDA Emergency use authorization very very soon. Vaccine doses are already ready go within 24hours of the authorization so, things will start to move rather fast after that.\n\nSo, we got some earnings numbers yesterday from a lot of companies, let\u2019s talk about them a little.\n\n[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/C040BWf) posted a beat on the top and bottom line with e-commerce sales rising by more than 80%, while [comparable](https://ibb.co/YQQknbj) sales in stores were more than 17%.

I don\u2019t really have a great grasp of the company\u2019s growth potential is right now.\n\nWe also got the Disney Investors meeting, in which the company share a lot of new great things. First of all, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/kJRc01G) has gone up another 18% since just 4 weeks ago, and is up to more than 86M subscribers, with the total number for the company\u2019s streaming services surpassing 137M as they plan to expand Disney+ in Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets next year.\n\nThe company also [expects](https://ibb.co/4skfTC8) to have more than 230M subscribers by 2024, a very big increase from the prior estimate, while they are also planning on raising the monthly fee starting in March.\n\nThey plan to [release](https://ibb.co/F0G0C84) a lot of new content directly to Disney+, which is another big hit to the cinema world. With the Marvel and Star Wars series being big blockbusters for the movie industry.\n\nThey presented so much new [content](https://ibb.co/8jpZtWN) for the company, that it took them more than 2 hours to talk about all of this.\n\nBut they also [said](https://ibb.co/DWwJ1tg) that these decisions are temporary, and that they still prefer theatrical releases especially for blockbusters, so, there is still some hope for cinema\u2019s, but maybe not just right now, it will take years to recover from this, and they will probably have to largely reduce the number of screens so that they may become profitable again.\n\nSo, over 100 new content releases per year is a lot for the [company](https://ibb.co/fFD4vhs), this was a very good investors meeting that pleased investors, as the company is [trading](https://ibb.co/Y86n6HD) \\+7,5% in pre-market.\n\nDisney is my second biggest position in my portfolio and I am really happy with what the company presented today. I think this stock may get to 200$ easily when the parks and entertainment business goes back online, as that accounted for 1/3 of the revenues before this year.\n\nIn other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/NL6sXcT), NIO will offer 60M shares, with an additional 9M shares option for underwriters. The stock fell sharply after the news, dropping more than 6% in After-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/85PycWh).\n\nAlso, Qualcomm suffered after the close yesterday, as the shares fell more than 5% after [news](https://ibb.co/5h4syVT) popped that Apple is moving to a develop their first cellular modem which will replace the Qualcomm modem in iPhone. The shares dropped as Qualcomm gets about 11% of its revenue from Apple.\n\nSo, one last thing that I want to talk about is the recent IPOs from DoorDash and AirBnb.\n\nAirBNB also went public yesterday and [started](https://ibb.co/PCNjM3W) trading at $146, way above the $68 IPO price. This means the company has a [market cap](https://ibb.co/QNmGhqy) of over $100B, way higher than its rival Booking at $86B market cap and even [higher](https://ibb.co/cyp2hz1) than some of the biggest hotels in the world, Marriot &amp; Hilton. The [stock](https://ibb.co/C9P3McG) even hit a new high of $165, I believe this happened as brokers started to get hands on the shares and orders started to fill in, but the stock did go back down to finish at $144, that means the stock gained more than 112% just in one day. The stock is down again more than 2% in pre-market guys. \n\nI would avoid these stocks as much as I can as I believe they are well overhyped at the moment. I think we can see a pullback that may offer a better opportunity in AirBnb after the first earnings results. I would buy this company only if it drops to around 80$ as a price target, if not I maintain my sell opinion on the stock, though I personally, am not shorting any stock due to the risk of the high volatility associated with this companies as they have a very small share float.\n\nWhile my opinion on [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/qkqSz1t) is that we might not see a pullback or correction as soon as AirBnb as demand will probably continue to be strong for at least a couple of quarters, before the growth slows down as well as very though future comps. We might see a drop in price then, as I think this stock is also well overvalued. I also maintain my sell opinion on this stock and just like with AirBNB, I am not going to touch this stock, I think a reasonable PT for DoorDash as a sell is about 100$. But I would try to stay away as much as possible, I\u2019d rather go and find better growth opportunities in other companies, and not waste time and money on these 2 stocks. \n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**DocuSign crushes earnings and AMC may go bankrupt. Lemonade spiked yesterday over 20% while Pfizer confirmed delivery numbers, let\u2019s talk about this and everything new in the stock market**\n\nHey everyone! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the DOW leading the way up almost 0,3% with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/G9JLH78) close behind up 0,23% and finishing at a new record high while the broader market [SP500](https://ibb.co/7rMK8RY) finished barely down for the day. All 3 of them were trading a lot higher intraday before the most recent Pfizer [news](https://ibb.co/qCXxh0Q) popped up as they are only expected to ship half of the doses that were initially planned, but people spooked at this to much in my opinion. This thing was already known, when they published the candidate data in November, they also [announced](https://ibb.co/cDtdMCy) this number, but people runed away way to fast before going more into the data. Pfizer did not cut supply, they just explained why this happened in this latest headline. It is way better for companies to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around.\n\nThe [VIX](https://ibb.co/HYrVJNH) also saw a spike around the Pfizer news and finished higher for the day while 59% of companies were advancing with almost 150 new highs and just 3 new lows on below average volume of 11,5 billion shares compared to 11,7 billion shares in the last 20 trading days. [CHART](https://ibb.co/6PVC7Lr)\n\nThe best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/2t3kk7m) yesterday were Energy and Real Estate while Utilities finished more than 1% down for the day with small and mid-cap growth companies [leading](https://ibb.co/sP2rMzd) the way while the large-caps where lagging the market as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/d2cJ7hZ) as all the FAANG stocks were down with Microsoft also joining them. While TESLA continued to be red hot and Alibaba has finally regained some momentum.\n\nHere is the most important [ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/w6b2bxv) that will be released today as we will get nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rates in the early morning alongside the trade deficit, with Factory orders numbers coming in a bit latter. \n\nThe [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/7GrND6j) are largely higher today not only in the US but also Europe is [gaining](https://ibb.co/mXsLDSb) momentum after Germany manufacturing [orders](https://ibb.co/9NVsjQw) rose for the sixth straight month in October and [Asia](https://ibb.co/7zhQnDt) as the global retail sector saw an [increase](https://ibb.co/k4dCN3f) of 30% in transactions with the whole Black Friday to Cyber Monday period doing very well this year.\n\nWhile yesterday we got numbers on the [NOVEMBER ISM](https://ibb.co/hcmvzgg) as it continued to a sixth straight month of expansion with employment being the biggest gainer in the index with even greater numbers coming in from the [PMI COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/GHcFV4g) with the fastest growth since 2015 as employment rose at the fastest pace in the history of the survey.\n\nAlso, the Jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/7txF4QQ) came in whey lower than expected at 712k more than 60k below estimated with continuing claims dropping for the first time in the last 9 months to under 6 million\n\nMeanwhile we also got some sales number for October in the [SEMI sector](https://ibb.co/VTy4BvP) yesterday, as sales had big increases Y/Y and M/M with all regions ramping up sales on a monthly basis. This is great news for companies like Nvidia, QCOM, AVGO and many more.\n\nMoving on to the auto sector the US light vehicle sales [forecast](https://ibb.co/THKtD9y) has seen an improved outlook for next year, up around 10% from 2020 at around 15.6 million with US [EV SALES](https://ibb.co/Hdk0qqq) increasing over 70% next year, this could be a huge boost to Tesla and other EV ramping up players like GM and FORD.\n\nThis is great news for Tesla after a big bear on the company just [trimmed](https://ibb.co/25tcFhJ) his short position on TESLA\n\n[Lemonade](https://ibb.co/wLqdKCS) had a big jump yesterday after the Motley Fool [published](https://ibb.co/PrJVJ5G) a long pitch for this company. I also own this stock and I believe it can become a very big player in the insurance business in the future. At the moment the company still only has a small market cap but I plan to own this for the long-term(5+years) as I expect great things from them. But don\u2019t just rush today in the stock because it spiked 20%, wait for it to cool off, maybe dollar cost average on it.\n\nWhile I am very interested to see what Disney [announces](https://ibb.co/hZDjxwk) next week as they may give new information on how the streaming business is doing and what the plans for the company are looking forward as 30% of the revenues of the company came from parks in the last years. I don\u2019t think that parks are ever going to be such a big part of the company as streaming and content production will lead the way. But I still like this company very much as it is one of my biggest portfolio holdings and I can see this stock rising to 170$ in the near future.\n\nA couple of companies released earnings yesterday as DocuSign [beat](https://ibb.co/znppzsn) the top and bottom line with billings coming in at $440M way over the consensus of $386M due to many more customers using the electronic signature to close contracts. While they also offered [guidance](https://ibb.co/34Hfnsz) for next quarter of around $404M to $408M also better than consensus at $387M as the stock is up 5% pre-market. \n\nWhile Marvell [missed](https://ibb.co/nCx5nHF) on expectations as the company cited supply issues constraints that are limiting the capability to satisfy demand. \n\nBad [news](https://ibb.co/yWJz3Kg) also came in for AMC with Warner\u2019s decision to send all they\u2019re 2021 movies directly to streaming on the same day as the theatrical release. This combined with the fact that AMC is filling to sell around [200M shares](https://ibb.co/Lkjkt5G), makes me think that this company is going to have the same route as Hertz. The cinema business wasn\u2019t doing so great since 2017, and this might be the final blow for the industry.\n\nAnd one final thought, it might be a good opportunity to get long on Dave &amp; Busters, Chewy, Adobe and Lululemon for next week, as I think they are all poised for good quarterly results. So, I will give all of them a small allocation today as I think there might be some good upside here in a few days, as there is a lot of money still on the sidelines with the most recent AAII asset [survey](https://ibb.co/7SRKkzk) showing that investors have more than 18% in cash on hands that can be pumped in the stock market.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "Just want to know how everyone feels about akoustis stock? \n\nHere is my take \n\nAfter following their investor relations page I have noticed that they have been aquiring new customers quite rapidly. They are producing micro chips and filters for 5g networks. They just presented at the 5g summit on the 15th and seemed to have went well. After that their stock is rising quite rapidly and major companies are taking large positions of $18mil and even almost 450% increase in position size. (Cant post the screenshot for whatever reason). I'm thinking if they are getting major support and 5g is basically mainstream.. do they have a chance of competing with say Qualcomm?",

        "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

        "selftext": "I've been dollar cost averaging in M1 Finance since October 28, 2019. I contributed $2000 for tax year 2019 and $6000 (max) for tax year 2020. I have current positions in the following: \n\nTTD, TSLA, FVRR, CRWD, PYPL, NFLX, SNPS, PINS, HUBS, TWLO \n\nMy last change, I took a little off the top with TWLO as I thought it was going to tank...it did not and it kept going. I wanted to spread some love to PYPL, NFLX, SNPS and PINS. I should have let it run, but oh wellz. \n\nWhat I'd like to do is hopefully have 40% annualized return so I can get $1,000,000 in a 10 year timeline. I'm not interested in going index funds (I will advise folks who are in their 20s to do that.) \n\nI am think of liquidating everything to keep my double-up and go into the following M1 pies: \n\n**Financial Pie** 25%\n\n**Consumer Cyclical Pie** 25%\n\n**Communication Services Pie** 25%\n\n**Technology Pie** 25%\n\n**\\*** **Financial Pie** \n\nLMND 50%\n\nPYPL 50%\n\n\\* **Consumer Cyclical Pie**\n\nAMZN 50%\n\nTSLA 50%\n\n\\* **Communication Services Pie**\n\nDIS 20%\n\nFVRR 20%\n\nPINS 20%\n\nTWLO 20%\n\nZM 20%\n\n\\* **Technology Pie**\n\nCRWD 17%\n\nHUBS 17%\n\nSHOP 17%\n\nTTD 17%\n\nADSK 16%\n\nOKTA 16%\n\n\\--------\n\nShould I start from scratch with the above? If I can get 40% or more of annualized returns with what I've done I'd be very happy. Once I get a million, I will then turn into a dividend investor and live off yields for the rest of my life. That's my goal anyway. I welcome any advice or being pointed in the right direction.",
