        "selftext": "Simple answer: [Dr. Lisa Su (how she turns around AMD)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHT5MRky9SA)\n\nWhen you invest in a company, it's not just the product that's important for the company, but its people and leadership as well. Because ultimately, a corporation is just an organization run by bunch of people, which Elon Musk emphasized this point. A company's leader who has a clear vision for the company will bring its people together and its competitive products to market for the future. You look at the leaders between Intel's and AMD's. One got a Ph.D in electric engineering and has a firm grasp of where the industry is heading toward, whereas the other person who was previously a CFO just looks at spreadsheets and uses any means to appease the shareholders. How likely would a business major know anything what the semiconductor industry will look like in five years?\n\nIntel has been dominating 90% of the PC market for many years. The company becomes complacent and so do its shareholders' base as the stockholders enjoy their annual dividend payouts. You do that in a highly competitive semiconductor industry, your company will lose value and eventually get abandoned. You have to be constantly innovating to stay ahead, especially in the technology sector because that's just the nature of the industry. This isn't like consumer staples where the market remains static for a long time. A technology company's moat is easily broken if the company doesn't plan out its roll map &amp; product lines for the next five years. A lot investors could tell this became quite apparent at the last Intel's earning report.\n\nThis also separates the difference between value investing &amp; growth investing. Value investors look at financial statements of a company to judge how it appears now, whereas growth investors look at a company and make financial projections where the company can potentially go toward for the next several years. Growth stocks will never appear cheap at any current time, because if they do, then by definition they already stop growing. If you're a value investor by heart, I advise stay away from investing into tech stocks if you don't have a firm grasp about their respective, ever-changing industries, because most of them will never make sense to you.\n\nThere will be a time to revisit Intel. In my opinion, Intel needs a better leader who has an expertise in the field. Hitherto, AMD will continue to take market shares away from Intel to grow its revenues &amp; earnings, because its leader already planned this out from the last few years. She knew her competitor would have a tougher time catching up in manufacturing the technology. AMD stock is going much higher for the next 2-5 years.\n\nDisclosure: AMD shareholders since $8.00",

        "selftext": "Listen up, AMD faggots.  Enjoy your W for now, but just like all the other cheap chinese made bullshit, it won\u2019t last.  What you are experiencing right now, that retarded pump \u2014 it has a name.  We refer to it as retard strength.  Wouldn\u2019t be possible without all you retards.\n\nFor the rest of you astute individuals, let\u2019s focus on this tendie opportunity with INTC.\n\nLet\u2019s cut the bullshit and get right down to it.\n\nIntel management has guided to free cash flow of $17 **BILLION** this year.  That\u2019s nearly **twice the amount of total revenue** AMD is forecast to generate.  In the first half of 2020, Intel generated more than $10.6 billion in free cash flow \u2014 more than $58 million **per day**!!!\n\nMeanwhile, AMD \u2014 in that same 6 month period \u2014 generated free cash flow of just $32 million **TOTAL**\n\nRead that again you chinese loving fucks.  Intel generated almost **DOUBLE** the free cash flow **PER DAY** than AMD could generate in **6 FUCKING MONTHS**\n\nOh, and guess what else?  INTEL FUCKING PAYS DIVIDENDS!!!\n\nWant to get into P/E ratios???  Cool!\n\nAMD has a laughable P/E ratio of 157.23 \n\nLOLOLOLOL\n\nThat is the literal definition of OVERVALUED.  For you actual retards, P/E ratio is how much an investor is paying per $1 of actual earnings.\n\nIntel is at an amazing 11.61 P/E \u2014 you won\u2019t find a better deal.\n\nSo for all those retards who feel great now, ask me how you feel in 6 months when you\u2019re bagholding that chinese knockoff bullshit.\n\nAs for everyone else, enjoy this insane discount and buy this shit up!\n\nFYI, the cutoff for the next dividend payout from INTC is August 6, so get those shares bought and settled now!",

So many missed chances where we as a country failed to arrest the Coronavirus \n\nA big slap on the face for those of us who still half-believed we are the last remaining superpower \n\nSurely in Q3 2019 this administration and intelligence should have gotten intel about the pandemic. I don\u2019t believe for one second that we were misled by the Chinese Communist party (the official excuse) - who ever believed them in the first place. That is like implying we all take chinese firms accounting practices at face value\n\nValuable time was lost in December, January and February when everyone was busy with impeachment. 99% media focus on the political circus while the virus was spreading across the globe. The China travel ban was fucking useless because what really would have mattered is a European travel ban because Italy seems to have had done more damage to tourist spread than China.\n\nYou can be left or right but you absolutely can not deny that this administration starting from the top, going all the way to the CDC and the states and the bureaucrats have completely fucked this up. And a populace that refuses to wear masks to this day and there are accusations of a \u201cplandemic\u201d\n\nI recall when they were taking in passengers from the diamond princess back in January - they were not sent to quarantine sites - in fact, medical staff received them without any protective suits. That\u2019s the level of laxity that has crept into our institutions. A multi-decade rot of infrastructure which was powered by the unbelievable levels of wealth divide in America thanks to free market, the WTO and 30 years of globalization.\n\nThe result of this lax administration and failure of government at the federal and state levels and the pigheadedness of the masses:\n\n1. Destroyed 401K\u2019s\n\n2. So many Americans are unemployed \n\n3. Total collapse of small business \n\n4. Further destruction of the American middle class \n\n5.

        "selftext": "An update on what happened last week, what's coming this week, and my autist thoughts on how that may play out in the market.\n\n***Quick postmortum of Tendie Stimulus 1***\n\nCongrats to those of who you rode with me on that VXX play--the timing and accuracy worked out so well I'd be lying if I said even I wasn't shocked.  If you went with the 32/34 plays you still saw some profit, but the 30c on 7/24 strike was where it was at.  I updated in the comments on the first post about the switch to 30c on Wednesday and here on my Twitter --sorry if you didn't see it at the time, I'll try to put updates to call/strike on here too at the top this time, not just Twitter (i actually have a real job now, too, unfortunately, that requires me from time to time :()\n\nWe got a big assist from China on the volatility, and in my trading I am trying to remember that mean ol' Mr.China is not going anywhere this week.  If I'm being honest, I think it was a bigger factor last week than even the floundering negotiations.  So, to a certain extent, I can only take so much credit for that call.  Please remember China retaliation is coming if you're still committed to trading both indexes and volatility, and be more conservative in your approach for a bit.\n\nThat said, this week is set up to be another bumpy ride.  Things have been a little confusing, so\n\n*Here's an update on what's happening with negotiations:*\n\nRepublicans, who have not done a thing about the HEROES act until this past week, were busy the past 7 days fighting among *themselves* for the *first* offer to make to Democrats.  Them getting this starting point out on Monday is in no way a victory for the process; this was actually supposed to be done by last Tuesday.  The noteworthy tidbits:\n\n* Donald Trump demanded a payroll tax cut, supported by Mnuchin, early last week (think of this as like a temporary easing measure which allows both individuals and employers to gain an extra 1-3% in their check).  Senate Republicans pushed back, and the WH surprisingly capitulated on the demand.\n* Their next internal squabbles had to do with the Extended UI benefits (I'll get to that in a minute)\n* The big breakthrough this weekend was committing to another round $1,200 Stimulus checks, and an extension on the eviction moratorium (this is HUGE for the housing market)\\*\n\n***So, what's important here?***\n\n* The payroll tax rebuff against the White House orders was important because the GOP knew the Dems wouldn't have it, so they wouldn't add it.  **Senate Republicans already ceding ground on an issue that was key to the President.**  As much as McConnell postures, this would indicate that Republicans understand how sensitive they're re-election chances are to the outcomes here and Momma Pelosi kinda has them by the short and curlys.\n* Repubs came out on Thursday saying two key things: 1) UI extension would fall from $600 to $100 a week in their proposal and 2) they were willing to apply a \"temporary\" extensin of UI benefits as a stopgap measure; with benefits enhancement set to expire this coming week.  PELOSI SAID HELL NO TO THE TEMP EXTENSION.  Again, Dems know they have them cornered.  Republicans this weekend started throwing out raising the weekly to $200, up from $100, and since this is the starting point of negotiations I think the Republicans know they may have to bend over all the way to $350 or $400 weekly, even, and are trying their best to coming in low enough to get out with $300.\n\n*\\*Side note: the eviction moratorium is a huge win for Dems, but it's also a win for staving off what was clearly a coming housing crisis.  I believe there is another win wrapped inside this win; at some point down the road, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not next month, but sometime in the next year, a mortgage/rent relief program is going to be floated.  They already introduced a city-wide lottery here in Los Angeles where you can have your missed COVID rent paid by the government if you can prove you lost employment due to COVID.  There is just no way they can be expecting all the people who got a free ride to be saving and pay back lump sums of multiple thousands to landlords once this all clears up.  I guarantee there is a nationwide rental credit or something in the future, it's economically unfeasible not to.  The hard part will be figuring out how to not punish the people who scrimped and did things right and used their UI/COVID check to pay rent on time, while rewarding those that didn't*\n\n***So, what will happen  in the coming week***\n\n* People are dancing over the $1,200 stimulus check announcement--and yes, I think it will provide a healthy boost for the morning session tomorrow.  I hope so, at least, given I'm holding a 7/27 323c on SPY and a QQQ 7/31 160c (which I'm actually not terribly happy with myself for buying).  But please remember, that's only a part of what is the beginnings of the new package negotiations.  One thing I will say is that MMs actually care way less about UI than UI--the $1,200 covers the midle class working folks if it's  up to $75,000.  Extended UI is also for survival with a cherry on top, the $11,200 affects retail, travel, tech, etc.  That said, this week will still be volatile\n   * Pelosi is going to say, probably Monday afternoon/evening after Republicans send theri package that it's a no.  Markets will get nervous because they will act like they're surprised by this, and freak out that a deal won't get done in time.  Rhetoric around a no deal will get ratcheted up.\n   * There are still probably at least two full back and forth draft cycles between both sides before we see a deal\n   * China is still going to retaliate\n   * All the tech CEOs are being brought to the hill (moved from Monday to Wednesday).  They are speaking in front of the Democratic house rather than the Republican Senate.  I don't expect it to be kind, particularly in light of recent Bezos hate, Zuckerberg Civil Rights issues, and Papa Elon's recent shenanigans (though he won't be there).\n   * Non-partisan takeL Republican or Democrat I think it's pretty clear Pelosi is going to win this one.  a) COVID is getting worse, and the Republican platform largely centered around it being better b) Republicans frittering away off-session time not making any progress is bad optics c) they're already capitulating on key offers d) this is going to THE issue of the coming election--aside from COVID, which Donnie has botched\n\n***How I'm playing it***\n\nHonestly, I'm a fucking QQQ addict, and even I will be staying away until EOW if I can dump these 7/31 calls for a profit Monday morning.  It's just not time yet.  **This week is a week to play invididual equities, not indexes.  If you hit on an index you're not gonna hit THAT big, and if you lose you're going to lose big and be like yeah, I pretty much could see this coming**.  So, if things generally are unfolding as I think;\n\n*Monday*\n\nDumping: my QQQ calls and my SPY 7/27 once/if I see a profit in the morning session. Moving into: GRMN\\* 390p 8/7, CRWD 105 8/7c\\*\\*, SPOT\\*\\*\\* 300c 8/7 or 8/21 depending on how it is PM\n\n*Tuesday*\n\nIf we haven't tanked and VXX has reset to sub 29 VXX: 7/31 29c (dumping likely Thursday)*Wednesday* Sitting on my hands but that's a god damn lie because I'll probably have found some rididulous YOLO on the daily thread and will move my GRMN put money into it\n\nWednesday: Sit on my hands as hard as it will be\n\n*Thursday*\n\nDumping VXX, reassessing, and likely putting a bunch into 8/7 and 8/10c's anticipating a done deal and a bounce back from a beating this week.  Will load up on QQQ as well as I think tech hearings will be a bottom of sorts\n\n*Friday*\n\nUpdating this DD on why I did none of this and instead put my bank account and heart into the bank of Su Bae.  But hopefully not lol.  INTC has to come down.  I'll most likely be staying in the SPY and QQQ call game for 8/7\n\n*Notes:*\n\n\\*GRMN is going to get WAY worse; similar situation have scene stocks drop by the 20% to 30% range in the immediate aftermath.  The fact that they are doing TERRIBLY at communicating with their customers is a godsend because it means they have plenty more bad news to trickle out in pieces next week.  They were cucked, yes, but as always happens in these situations, their lack of honesty, proactiveness, and trasnparency is going to cuck them way more.  Forward guidance during their earnings call will be poopy, and there was already talk that they were honestly topped out at 100 a share.\n\n\\*\\*CRWD has kind of taken a beating this month, and cloud security is going to be a big winner as the GRMN story breaks more.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Erbody that know whatsup knows SPOT is going to hit 300 sometime soon.  Their roster is just too off the charts, I expect their forward guidance on the earnings call to set them over the top.  I'm also reall scared of earnings this season though, so my thoughts may change on this.\n\n**TLDR: The $1,200 check is only a starting point, and not the bread and butter of coming, tense negotiations this week around UI benefits extension.  With shuttle negotiations coming up and lots of doomsday rhetoric around them, China acting a fool, and the tech hearing coming on Wednesday, it may be best to play individual stocks based on your research and some discounts than dive back into indexes just yet.  GRMN puts and CRWD calls should print at least Monday, VXX back in play later in the week, SPY and QQQ calls on Friday**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*As always, updates will be a hodge podge of here and my Twitter of the same name.  Also as always, I know politics as I am a fundraiser for political campaigns, non profits, and foundations, but I am NOT a financial expert or somebody who works in the field, so don't bet the farm on anything I write if something doesn't align with your own Crayola drawings.  We're all just playing hunches and doing our best to justify them; I'm on a streak now, but all streaks end lol.*",

They have more than 50 already in motion.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What do they do? What makes them so special?**\n\nOSS in layman\u2019s terms is a company that takes top-end processors and GPUs, and uses their PCIe gen 4.0 expansion technology to merge them into a military-grade/data center supercomputer.\n\nBut aren\u2019t there many companies that can do this? No. They are the only company in the world with a PCIe 4.0 expansion system that can support NVIDIA\u2019s top end GPU\u2019s. (*Nvidia A-100*)\n\nThis means that they own nearly 100% of the market share in Nvidia's latest PCIe GPU technology.\n\n*(PCIe gen 3.0 is the only other option, but is 50% slower than PCIe 4.0.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What else makes them so special?** Their Financials.\n\nCompare their financials to the pennystocks we always talk about on this subreddit. It\u2019s absurd.

        "selftext": "With AMD shares hitting a new all-time high today on the back of an earnings beat and raised guidance (as well as Intel's 7nm delay), I thought it would be an opportune time to look back on how amazing of a turnaround story this has really been given that only 7 years ago the company's future was very much in doubt.\n\nIn 2013, ArsTechnica ran a profile on how AMD took on Intel in the late 90s, experienced rousing success with its Athlon and Opteron chips, before over-spending and mis-executing its way into a free fall. Back then, AMD found itself completely out-maneuvered by Intel in the desktop, laptop, and sever markets and had largely been shut out of both smartphone and tablet production.\n\nThis fascinating story features some matchmaking by Bill Gates, a failed attempt by AMD to acquire Nvidia when it traded under $15 a share, and a botched integration with graphics maker ATI Technologies. Warning: the two-part article, while super interesting, is absolutely on the lengthy side. For those of you who like the quick-hitters, I've summarized the highlights below.\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/the-rise-and-fall-of-amd-how-an-underdog-stuck-it-to-intel/](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/the-rise-and-fall-of-amd-how-an-underdog-stuck-it-to-intel/)\n\n* During the 1980s, AMD was a second-source supplier for companies using Intel processors. Companies like IBM didn't want to rely solely on Intel for one of the primary components in their computers, so they licensed AMD to produce versions of Intel processors. However in 1985, Intel stopped giving AMD its designs which forced them to reverse-engineer versions of Intel parts. By 1990, Merrill Lynch had declared AMD \"dead\", as the smaller company couldn't keep up with Intel product releases. This would not be the last time, as its aggressive pricing throughout the first half of the 90s had left AMD in a poor financial position. \n* In 1994, a tiny Silicon Valley outfit named NexGen began shipping a chip that was comparable to Intel's flagship Pentium. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates had taken an interest in NexGen, in particular, its brilliant CEO, Atiq Raza. Gates suggested that Raza speak to AMD since the company owned a chip fab but needed a better product to build in it. Raza met with then-CEO Jerry Sanders, who threatened to run NexGen out of business. Upon hearing about the exchange, Gates picked up the phone, called Sanders, and convinced AMD to purchase NexGen for $615mn in 1995. Soon after, Raza, dubbed by Sanders as the \"Michael Jordan of microprocessor design\", helped AMD develop the K6 - a major turning point for the company.\n* The K6 rivaled Intel on speed and price, and its revisions led to one of AMD's most successful architectures: K7, marketed as the Athlon. Athlon received \"CPU of the Year\" in 1999 from ArsTechnica and helped AMD grow sales from $2.5bn in 1998 to $4.6bn by 2000. With the company having just pulled in nearly $1bn in profits, Sanders rented out San Jose's entire HP Pavilion (now the SAP Center) for a party in which he paid for Tim McGraw and Faith Hill to perform and proclaimed AMD's share price would soon hit $100.\n* Around this time the company started spending too much and spreading itself too thin. AMD was making most of its profit from memory, but was also dabbling in logic, microprocessors, and communication products. Sanders had also decided to build a massive fab in Germany with borrowed money. Despite this, AMD continued to find technical success. AMD utilized the Athlon to develop a similar architecture that was more useful for severs. The new product, Opteron, led to AMD capturing an estimated 25% of the server market by 2006 all the while Intel struggled to produce a chip that could compete with the performance advantages of Opteron.\n* While on the surface AMD seemed to be firing on all cylinders with its popular Athlon and Opteron chips, the company was a financial mess behind-the-scenes. The company announced net losses of $61mn in 2001, $1.3bn in 2002, and $274mn in 2003. The main culprit? Investments in fabs that grossly overshot initial cost estimates. Between its two locations in Germany, AMD invested roughly $4.6bn.\n* AMD's competitive edge with Opteron coincided with some low points for Intel that forced the company to re-imagine its architecture altogether. The result was the release of the Intel Core microarchitecture in 2006. Core enabled Intel to take back the performance crown in the PC market, and it proved more power-efficient than AMD's laptop chips right when laptops began to outsell desktops for the first time.  Intel compounded the pain by strategically releasing frequent upgrades and forcing AMD to play catch-up yet again. \n* Though AMD's CPUs consistently improved, over time they became shut out of the high-end market once more and were relegated to compete mainly on price, mirroring the company's early struggles. As Intel churned out its best product in years, AMD began trying to swallow another company whole. In 2006, AMD saw an opportunity for the future by integrating a memory controller into the CPU. However, the company needed the graphics and chipset experience to make it happen.\n* The solution was to purchase Canadian graphics company ATI Technologies for $5.4bn - or roughly half of AMD's market cap. This came after AMD had approached Nvidia as its first-choice takeover target. At that time, Nvidia was trading under $15 a share. But Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia's outspoken CEO, insisted on running the combined company \u2014 a non-starter for AMD leadership. While ATI's technology was considered superior to Intel's, the integration process proved disastrous from the start. Employees from the two companies divided into green (AMD and CPU) and red (ATI and GPU) sides, prioritizing needs of their individual products, and causing major delays time and time again. \n* With problems executing and stagnant sales, AMD ended 2007 with more than $5bn in debt and lost $3.3bn on the year after having taken a write-down charge for its acquisition of ATI. The company was having serious difficulty affording the costs of its fab facilities, when the entire industry endured a sharp downturn in 2008 that caused the stock to plummet from $20 to $4 a share. \n* AMD had no choice but to spin off its foundries in 2009 (AMD spun off GlobalFoundries in 2009), weakening its competitive positioning relative to Intel. Despite efforts to engineer higher quality products, its share of the PC and sever businesses kept declining and AMD was unable to achieve meaningful share in the ultrabook and tablet segments. The low-end CPU market sent margins tumbling and increased exposure to secular declines in PC sales. \n* By 2013, only one singular analyst on Wall Street was bullish on the stock \u2014 which had now fallen from $8 at the start of 2012 to just around $2. Yet after a major delay with the highly anticipated \"Fusion\" 32nm chip, the analyst noted that there were now liquidity concerns due to the declining PC market. Even former CFO Fran Barton thought AMD had next to no future in its battle with Intel: \"***...the game's been played.***\"\n\nFlash-forward to today and AMD just delivered its highest CPU revenue in over 12 years, has taken CPU market share for 11 straight quarters, and currently enjoys double-digit server processor market share. Whether you're an investor or not, bullish or bearish, that is one hell of a comeback. Hats off to Lisa Su and the entire AMD team.",

        "selftext": "*For anyone who reads SEC filings, this is a rehash.*\n\nTaking a look at Intel's released 10-Q, here's some quotes:\n\n&gt;\u2022We now expect an approximate six-month delay in our 7nm-based CPU product timing relative to prior expectations. The primary driver is the yield of our 7nm manufacturing process, which based on recent data, is now trending approximately twelve months behind our internal target. We will continue to invest in our future process technology roadmap, but we will be pragmatic and objective in seeking to deploy the process technology that delivers the most predictability and performance for our customers, whether that be our process, external foundry process or a combination of both. Our advanced packaging technologies combined with our disaggregated architecture give us the flexibility to use the process technology that best serves our customers. As an example, we now expect that our data center discrete GPU design, \u201cPonte Vecchio\", which was described in our 2019 Form 10-K, will be released in late 2021 or early 2022 utilizing external and internal process technologies combined with our advanced packaging technologies.\n\n&gt;\u2022We now expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7nm product, a client CPU, in late 2022 or early 2023. We are also focused on maintaining an annual cadence of significant product improvements independent of our process roadmap, including for holiday 2022. In addition, we expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7nm data center CPU design in the first half of 2023.\n\n\n#They are going to be four years behind AMD ON 7nm production.\n\nI figured I was going to look into what kind of business consumer-grade Intel products were, compared to their server counterpart, and had to look up some specifics for Intel's internal nomenclature.\n\nHere's the results:\n\nIntel DCG (Data Center Group) consists of everything server related. Server processors, network infrastructure, that type of thing.\n\nIntel CCG (Client Computer Group) consists of all consumer stuff. Mobile, PCs, Laptops, etc. The CCG is all consumer-grade stuff for home use.\n\n\nDCG operating income was **$3.1 billion** for **Q2 2020**, compared to **$1.8 billion** in **Q2 2019**. A rise of **+$1.3 billion.**\n\nCCG operating income was **$2.8 billion** for **Q2 2020**, compared with **$3.7 billion** for **Q2 2019**. A drop of **-$0.9 billion.**\n\n||Q2 2020 vs. Q2 2019 | | YTD 2020 vs. YTD 2019 | |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n|| % change | $ Impact | % change | $ Impact |\n|Desktop platform volume |down\t(14)%|\t\t$\t(460)\t| \t\tdown\t(9)%\t|\t$\t(607)|\n|Desktop platform ASP |up\t3%\t|\t$ 61 \t| \t\tup\t3%\t|\t$ 162 \t \t\n|Notebook platform volume|up\t9%\t|$\t434 \t |\t\tup\t15%\t|\t$ 1,501 \t \t\n|Notebook platform ASP| up\t5%\t|$\t274 |\t \t\tup\t1%\t|$\t138 \t \t\n|Adjacent products and other||$ 346 ||\t\t\t$\t650 \t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\t\n|**Total change in revenue**||\t\t\t\t\t$\t655 ||\t \t\t\t\t\t$ 1,844 \t  \n\nSo Intel's PC market is down from last year for both the quarter and the year. They claim it's because people are poor due to COVID, but seem to contradict themselves in their statement about why their notebook group is doing so well. I am supremely intrigued to compare AMD's notes on the topic.\n\nTo quote (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt;Revenue in Q2 2020 was up 7% compared to Q2 2019, driven by strength in notebook platform demand, strong ASP and higher LTE modem and Wi-Fi sales, partially offset by desktop demand. YTD 2020 up 11% compared to YTD 2019, **driven by strong demand for notebook platform products** and higher LTE modem and Wi-Fi sales. Strength in notebook platform products reflects the increased reliance on PCs as more people are working and learning from home due to COVID-19.\n**While we expect notebook strength in Q3 2020, desktop demand is expected to remain weak in the second half of 2020 as a result of weaker global economic conditions due to COVID-19.**\n\nI'm going to read this as \"When a consumer has the choice of building a desktop out of components, they are going to choose our competitor because they are better.\"\n\nThis is a play on Intel. I am intentionally ignoring AMD because I think Intel is going to become irrillevant in the processor market in the near future.\n\nHere's what I am suggesting: keep an eye on the portable/laptop markets. If AMD has their shit together, we will start to see a more competative AMD/Intel split on laptops. It's pretty difficult to find an AMD laptop now, and if it becomes easier, people are going to start buying the better performer with the better price.\n\nFurther, Intel seems to already be suffering when it comes to desktop unit sales. When AMD puts out their 10-K, take a look at their CCG equivalent numbers, and see what they look like. If there seems to be an equivalent amount gained by AMD which was lost by Intel, it will become more apparent whether this was a COVID related drop, or the fact that Intel's processors are plainly worse by comparison.\n\nFor those interested in a play depending on what AMD has in their 10-K:\n\n   * If AMD has a similar drop in consumer grade sales, take no action\n   * If AMD sees a rise similar to the drop in Intel's report on CCG, **INTC 21 JAN 2022 $30P**",

        "selftext": "What\u2019s up fellow scallywag\u2019s, it\u2019s ya boy Swaggy with an update on some unusual options activity caught at the end of last week. Earnings SZN is upon us and the time is now to bring forth our genius into the markets. I\u2019ll go through some of the volume I caught as well as unusual activity.\n\nIf you want to check out the option tool for yourself, go to [SwaggyStocks Option Flow](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices**\n\nAMD caught some momentum Thursday as the stock surged nearly 8%. Big-time call flow came through expecting the stock to be trading at about $60 by mid August. There\u2019s been an uptick in the semi\u2019s as whole (NVDA, MU, INTC) as they are forecasting solid earnings throughout the pandemic as the world goes deeper into the digital rabbit-hole.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/waa6l9l0eia51.png?width=2954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c91c65e472b0cbedb5ea16ec1364461f0253788\n\n**DKNG \u2013 DraftKings**\n\nDraftkings stock price has taken a beating over the last couple weeks after reaching all-time-highs earlier in the month. I caught some call buying in August expiration as well as some leaps 2021 leaps. The stock is at short-term lows, looks like the players are expecting a bounce and the DraftKings brand to develop into one of the strongest in the SportsGambling sector.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6lfh0a4eia51.png?width=2820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f7fa4b5fd9ceba04c86e6058347745f80fb3f8e\n\n**KO \u2013 Coca Cola**\n\nBig call buying in Coca Cola (KO) on Friday. 3,700 (900 OI) call contracts for July expiration and a premium paid of $550k. Another trade was in September contracts at the $47 strike price, 7.5k contract for a premium of just under $1 million. Pretty high volume for KO which typically doesn\u2019t have a lot of option flow. Pepsi Co is reporting earnings tomorrow, looks like this could be a proxy play on Pepsi where KO tries to ride some of the momentum.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbbuv0c6eia51.png?width=2600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=060882c26d52ab5fa1299180734ee53eaf836135\n\n**INTC \u2013 Intel Corporation**\n\nI caught some interesting activity in INTC on Friday. This play is expecting INTC to report strong and have a good showing into the fall. Here are the two plays I caught. A player purchased a long CALL option at $60 strike and sold the CALL at the $65 strike price, essentially opening a bull debit spread. They then sold PUTS at the $52.5 strike (currently 10% OTM) for a credit of $1.3 million. The exact same play was recognized with another 10k contracts at the same strikes and expiration (October 2020). It\u2019s possible this was all one player, or possible two firms mimicking the first play as the strikes/expiration/volume are all very similar. The players are betting that the stock will stay ABOVE $62 by October, but if the stock price stays anywhere above $52.50-$60 range their losses are limited.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hoylbk3heia51.png?width=2736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f226af023a53ddf266b16f5dcc3ab3c3d7a38f0\n\n**The Banks (JPM, BAC, C)**\n\nDidn\u2019t spot anything quite unusual with the banks, other than heavy volume going to earnings (I believe all are reporting Tues-Thurs this week). Looks like most of the volume was predominately bullish sentiment, however, in reality it is quite balanced on both sides. The banks have been getting absolutely hammered throughout the Pandemic and haven\u2019t seen much recovery. This is mainly due to new fiscal policies being introduced that look like they are here to stay. Have the banks bottomed? We\u2019ll find out this week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ykbro4jeia51.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69dca10f7af71ff807544c27f16675fbf4311ea2",

        "selftext": "Okay so this post is not for any quick moves.. this is advice for 6 months to a year. AMD is having success on both it's major fronts. It's CPU wins should be well known and are the reason it has good cash flow: \n\n* Today it just announced two new OEM partnerships with laptop makers. \n* They are dominating Intel currently in the custom market\n* They are at least competitive in the mobile market somewhere Intel is not yet. \n* They are progressively chipping away at the server market share from Intel with cheaper hardware that outperforms much more expensive Intel hardware. \n* The Intel product line has repeatedly gotten criticism for being stale, unexciting and expensive and that was before their star engineer quit months ago\n* CPU partnerships lead to GPU partnerships\n* The fact that they are fabless means they have really good relationships with semiconductor makers. They are able to produce really good custom chips for consoles in ways Intel and NVIDIA simply cannot. They also are advancing their chip architecture much faster than the other two because of these partnerships, offsetting deficiencies in R&amp;D funding. \n\nThe reason AMD is about to really be undervalued is its GPU market. NVIDIA has dominated this segment for years and they are about to hit a wall. \n\n* The rumors and leaks continue to back very significant performance increases to their next gen GPU. The are applying the same methodology to the GPU as they are have with the CPU that has had so much success. They will finally have a top tier card to compete with NVIDIA, or if they don't with the new release they will in a year because:\n* AMD GPUs are going into both next gen consoles from Sony and Msft. This has helped AMD with cash flow in the past but it's much more significant now. Vulkan is a close to the metal API that outperforms directX. The issue here is most game developers have not made games using this API. This is about to change with the next gen consoles. As AMD hardware lines the inside of these devices game devs will start to rapidly switch over to this API. This api is also supported on all systems (linux, windows, consoles) so devs can make much better use of it porting games that will perform well on all systems. This will edge out custom nivida contracts for games and put AMD's api at the forefront of game development. \n* Their good relationship with their fabs means they will continue to dominate the lower tier GPU market\n* Their CPU knowledge makes their integrated graphics basically the best in the business which puts them way ahead in the high-end mobile and low-end OEM markets\n\nI got no calls for you guys other than don't go buying FDs but Intel and probably NVIDIA are going to lose bigly here over the 6 months. You can see the way the market is moving that it knows the market share from failing Intel is just going right into AMD's pocket. AMD has their CPU game on lock and their R&amp;D is finally funding their GPU. Just watch what happens if you want but I'm telling you how to make some trendies here.... just fucking be patient and don't buy calls for next week and go long.",

        "selftext": "I'm going to keep this as short as humanly possible. This is a speculative situation since publicly-traded companies are not allowed to confirm the thoughts of the public, even if they're on the dot. However, they always try to leave you a trail of crumbs to find the missing pieces of information, and so far no one else has gone to the same lengths to dissect what was given to us yesterday. This took a *very* long time to put together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Very briefly so you know who FRSX is:**\n\nFRSX is in the technology and autonomous driving industry. They create software and physical hardware such as cameras and sensors for the use of larger (car) companies. They are also developing COVID-19 thermal sensors with pending patents, but I'm not even going to talk about that right now.\n\n**Very briefly so you know who Huawei is:** \n\nHuawei is one of the largest and most famous/infamous companies in the entire world. They are one the original reasons why Chinese and U.S. trade tensions ran so high. Because they sparked controversy of stealing/copying intel from the U.S. and posing as a foreign threat to the economy.\n\nThey are a massive tech conglomerate with intense market share (more than Apple in China). Many of you have probably used one of their products.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here is the step-by-step process of how I figured out who that unnamed \u201cmulti-billion dollar Chinese tech company\u201d is in their latest order and moving forward.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 1.**[ Press Release From Yesterday](https://ir.foresightauto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/QuadSight-prototype-sale_telecom_270720-ENHE-FINAL.pdf) \\- Introductory Order from \u201cmulti-billion dollar Chinese Tech Company\u201d\n\nStart with the basics. Any company that\u2019s not Chinese is out. Any company under $2 billion valuation is out. Any company not in the tech sector is out. Any company that doesn't operate on a global scale is out. Any company without an Autonomous Vehicle subdivision is out.\n\nSpoiler: This is Huawei, who has become increasingly active in the race for autonomous driving market share. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 2.** [FRSX Germany Tier 1 Auto Supplier](https://ir.foresightauto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/QuadSight-prototype-sale_autonomous-trucks-Tier-One-060520-EN-HE-FINAL.pdf) \\- FRSX products were showcased and successfully demoed in Germany. They received an introductory order from a Tier 1 German auto supplier involved in the $1 Billion USD Autonomous Vehicle/Truck market. \n\nAfter hours of research, this supplier is Veoneer, who supplies AV components for Volkswagen/Audi and a handful of other companies within Huawei\u2019s AV plan. (see below).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 3.**[ Huawei - Autonomous Driving Plans for Germany and China (2020-2022).](https://www.ft.com/content/6ee22ee4-8ce2-11e9-a24d-b42f641eca37) \\-  \n\nHuawei's Chief Strategy Architect, Dang Wenshuan, told the Financial Times that Huawei will be providing autonomous power and components for Germany's Volkswagen/Audi, and China's GAC Group, Beijing New Energy Automobile and Changan Automobile.\n\n*(you need to pay for this information, but it\u2019s not expensive)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 4.** Due to the current politics and long-lasting economic tension between the U.S. and China, Huawei is under serious trade restrictions from the U.S. \n\nTwo years ago they were banned from the U.S. to send a message to China. FRSX is an Israeli company, and if Huawei wants to uphold their agreement to consistently provide AV components, they have limited options unless they want to start from the ground up.\n\nAdditionally, just this week the U.S. and China shut down each other\u2019s consulates in Houston and Chengdu out of spite? Yeah. Not a good look for their political friendship, but potentially great for FRSX.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 5.**[ FRSX Enters Partnership with FLIR to develop and distribute FRSX's Quad-sight Camera](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200401005370/en/FLIR-Systems-Foresight-Sign-Agreement-Develop-Market)\n\nThis is a MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION partnership from FLIR to market the same camera that was ordered from supposed Huawei and Veoneer. This benefits FRSX the most as FLIR\u2019s bluechip status helps put the quad-sight camera in a stronger spotlight.\n\nFLIR already holds AV connections to Volkswagen/Audi, Mercedes, and BMW, and works in[ Autonomous Vehicles.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/foresight-automotive_how-do-thermal-cameras-work-activity-6685498395815120897-TWi4/) They are partnered with Veoneer as well, the company who ordered right before Huawei.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 6**.[ Fisker soon to IPO, autonomous vehicle project using FRSX \"top level\" autopilot system.](https://ownsnap.com/foresight-autonomous-frsx-surges-while-fisker-preps-for-ipo-before-installing-autopilot-system/)\n\nFisker used to be heavily involved with Tesla vehicles and also redesigned certain cars such as the BMW z8. They now have conflict with Tesla and are heavily connected to FRSX while planning to hit the front end of Volkswagen autonomous vehicles hard. Their autopilot system is called \"Foresight\" as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 7.** [Tencent, NIO, and Mobileye.](https://www.nio.com/news/nio-inc-announces-strategic-collaboration-mobileye-bring-level-4-autonomous-driving-vehicles) NIO and Tencent have partnered with Mobileye as their camera technology instead of FRSX, therefore eliminating Tencent as the other \"Multi-billion dollar Chinese Tech company with an Autonomous Vehicle Subdivision\".\n\nTencent currently owns over $2.25 Billion dollars in NIO. The two giants (Huawei and Tencent) have worked together before on different tech projects, but this one is now a competition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 8.** Connect the dots and eliminate the variables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Roadmap of Connections ](https://preview.redd.it/lenzqw3qpod51.png?width=966&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d69919c7918f11bf306691ff15d229af15be2e45)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter using the parameters provided by FRSX, the list was narrowed down to a handful of companies (all strong contenders due to the fact that they had to be a multi-billion dollar tech company to begin with.) The search for elevating factors such as citations of German/Chinese/Huawei/FRSX AV ventures helped us paint a road map of the connections between companies in the AV sector.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do these orders mean? FRSX has several orders from AV ventures who are trying to gather and test the components for their autonomous driving projects. Their partnership with FLIR, absorption into FISKER\u2019s AV business model, and direct orders from Tier 1 Supplier, Veoneer, and a company that fits the parameters of Huawei, signifies potential penetration into this market, which is all traders care about: Potential. \n\nTheir COVID-19 projects/pending patents deserve their own separate speech, but this is where the money is for a shot at true relevancy.",

        "selftext": "Intel shares slumped after warning about another production delay, sparking concern the world\u2019s largest chipmaker will fall further behind rivals in a crucial area it once dominated.\n\nAt issue is a new method for cranking out smaller, more powerful chips, the timing of which \u201cis shifting approximately six months relative to prior expectations\u201d.\n\nIntel\u2019s first 7-nanometer chips will go on sale at the end of 2022 or early 2023, Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said on a conference call. That\u2019s a year behind schedule. AMD is already selling 7-nanometer-based processors.\n\nCompetitive pressure has been building on Intel in recent years. The company designs and manufacturers its own processors, while many rivals focus on design and tap Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to make their chips. That\u2019s helped TSMC improve production faster than Intel, and given companies such as AMD a new chance to compete.\n\nWith this mornings\u2019 pre-market currently indicating opening at $52 (-14%), I\u2019m torn on what to do with Intel.  I\u2019ve been invested in $INTC since Feb 2018, and got in around $45.  Is Intel struggling to compete and on the decline, or and therefore a tech behemoth of the past, or is this a great buy-in for the company?",

        "selftext": "I know what you\u2019re thinking here comes the crayon chart! Nope just my red and green dildo collection history. I am extremely bearish overall but also recognize situations that always pound my ass with green dildos! Monday patterns below!\n\n-Mondays \nLast 8/10-green\u2014 3/3 100% following red Friday \n\nSince March 15/24-Green\u20148/10 80% following a red Friday\n\n3 red days in a row. June 9-11 -6.8%, may 11-13 -4%, March 5-6,9th -12.3%. 3rd red days Opened 3 points down, opened 13 points down, opened 48 points down.\n\n-Though, this is what happens before a significant pull back after a run! Big boys make choppy waters as they sell off profits and retail holds their bags. Example for retards- you own 10% of $100 stock now at $200. You want to take all profits at top vs $190-$200 area so you unload slowly while it bounces back through highs. This also crushes theta and Vix to make cheaper premiums for your put options plays. This is currently happening no matter whatever side you are pulling for and will result in a transition to a bear market!\n\n-So as a bear now I recognize the boring stuff like I hate that we bounced off 3193 support again Friday with what I felt was never significant pressure. As long as we stay above there then no significant fall will happen. We didn\u2019t have a covering pump Friday which opens up a short squeeze opportunity. Economy is screwed and free money is drying up. Even if republican stimulus proposed Monday is decent it won\u2019t become active for at least a couple weeks but the hype will be there for retailers and pumping will occur for more bags to be transferred. \n\nGreen cases\n-Monday\u2019s are green\n-Following 2 red days\n-Strong support 3193\n-Stimulus proposal \n-Fang run ups into earnings \n-no short covering spike Friday \n-run up into FOMC \n\nRed Cases\n-corona,unemployment, blah blah\n-strong resistance on double top\n-another republican stimulus delay\n-China retaliation \n-Bad Fang earnings\n-FOMC mid week\n\nI think republicans will propose a decent plan Monday with another stimulus check, $200/$400 unemployment additions or 70% pay with cap. You could have filed another 3 months extension for mortgages already and too soon for more PPP. Don\u2019t see a surprise negative happening so just a green dildo Monday/Tuesday followed by a depressing FOMC, stimulus/unemployment finalization concerns, disappointing earnings, weak dollar, and a toppy market.\n\nPositions \n\nSpy 8/21 315 puts (bought near top)\nTqqq 8/21 105 puts (bought near top)\n\n(Bought at low of day)\nSpy 7/29 320 calls\nMsft 7/31 207.5 calls\nINTC 7/31 52 calls\nBaba 7/31 257.5 calls\nAAPL 7/31 380 calls",

The one-day drop was the stock\u2019s worst since March, when it finished down 18%, but that was amid a broader market rout when the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, -0.61% tanked 12% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.93% had its worst day ever with a 12.3% dive. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 was only off 0.6% Friday, and the Nasdaq finished down 0.9%.\n\nOther than the March 16 rout, Intel shares have only seen worse days three other times over the past 20 years, two 18% drops in 2002 and a 22% drop in 2000.\n\nLate Thursday, Intel said it was delaying its 7-nanometer line of chips by at least six months because of a \u201cdefect mode\u201d and that it may have to resort to a contingency plan of using \u201csomebody else\u2019s foundry\u201d to make them. In chip parlance, nanometers, or nm, refers to the size of the transistors that go on a computer chip, with the general rule being that smaller transistors are faster and more efficient in using power.\n\nAs a result, shares of AMD AMD, +16.50%, which already sells 7-nm chips, soared 16.5% to close at a record $69.40, only the second time AMD has ever closed at a higher stock price than Intel. Meanwhile, American depositary receipts of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM, +9.69%, which makes AMD\u2019s chips, rallied 9.7%. to close at $73.90.\n\nIntel, on Friday, shed $41.54 billion in market capitalization, putting it far behind Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.63% in the previously close race for most valuable U.S. chip maker. Nvidia shares finished Friday up 0.6% at $407.78 for a market cap of $250.78 billion, versus Intel\u2019s $214.2 billion.",

It\u2019s all about how they are planning to recover, what forward guidance they are giving, and how their emerging market product lines are doing.\n\nExamples:\n\nIntel got a big red dildo stuck in them for 2 main reasons:\n\n1. Delay of their emerging market chip play: the 7nm chip\n2. Huge downgrade to their forward guidance\n\nMicrosoft went nowhere despite beating EPS and revenue because:\n\n1. Worse than expected growth in their Azure cloud product line\n2. Concerning forward guidance\n\nFor earnings plays next week, actually look into what is going to affect the company in the LONG TERM. Don't be the retard that says \ud83c\udf08*Why did they drop, they beat EPS\ud83c\udf08*. If they beat their ~~dogshit~~ bad EPS of 0.01 by 200 percent with .03 EPS, its still ~~fucking dogshit~~ bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: No one gives a shit about EPS/Revenue for these companies, they only care about forward guidance and plans\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlay for the autists that don\u2019t read anything but optionese: \n\nCMCSA 44C 7/31 for short term and CMCSA 47.5C 10/16 for longer term\n\nHuge opportunity for forward guidance plans with new streaming service Peacock and return of all the most popular live sports",

As you can see from this list, Intel is very undervalued at the moment. There's a total of 152 companies from the s&amp;p 500 that have reported Q2 already. So that tells me we still have a ways to go.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MLUMoLRz1dpdk4bX1mXw2rXEFJOldTjqQUMAsFelmSw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MLUMoLRz1dpdk4bX1mXw2rXEFJOldTjqQUMAsFelmSw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe companies at the top are the best deals. The stocks at the bottom of the list are bad deals.\n\nI took the top 60 or so stocks and sorted them by industry to create a little portfolio. You could buy all of these and be in pretty good shape. Some industries got excluded because there were no good stocks in them like industrials.\n\n [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sjJeEKBmdpuLxdBAeqZPZSNCc946\\_HLDoovqy1M7DNc/edit#gid=616174786](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sjJeEKBmdpuLxdBAeqZPZSNCc946_HLDoovqy1M7DNc/edit#gid=616174786) \n\nMake sure to glance at the balance sheet before purchasing.  HRB just went what, 2.5 billion in debt? Not sure what's going on there. May have sold the fed bonds lol. So i won't be buying that company. If the balance sheet looks good then its a buy. Total equity and stock equity should be steadily going up over time.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HRB/balance-sheet/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HRB/balance-sheet/) \n\nI'll update this weekly as more stocks report earnings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsource code has been updated here:  [https://github.com/recola-wand/undervalued-stocks](https://github.com/recola-wand/undervalued-stocks)",

        "selftext": "Had another post today speculating on AMD.\n\nLet\u2019s do a DD.\n\nFundamentals \\*AMD &amp; INTC are essentially the only two players in the consumer CPU market globally \\*AMD is considered the \u201cconsumer friendly\u201d company as they often perform much less \u201cscummy\u201d tactics that company\u2019s such as INTC &amp; NVDA do (I don\u2019t blame them they are the market leaders in their specific sub-sector) \\*PC &amp; Console gaming on the rise - AMD DOMINATES the console gaming market. Every full-home console from 2013 (Xbox one, One S, One X, Ps4, PS4 slim, Ps4 pro) a PLUS THE ENTIRE \u201cnext-gen\u201d console market. AMD APUs have literally ZERO competition unless you consider the NVidia Tegra X1 (the custom APU in the Nintendo switch) \\*PC gaming specifically - AMD DOMINATES the multi core market. This would appeal to consumers who like to play games... but also productivity / and or streaming / and or video editing etc\n\n\\*FINAL fundamental note - You can\u2019t compare an AMD stock present against its speculative potential without mentioning both NVDA &amp; INTC\n\nLETS GET STARTED\n\n\\*Evidence - (Fine. If you insist - I\u2019ll back up my thoughts with some [Graphs](https://imgur.com/gallery/x0UiCyl))\n\nReferenced TICKERS AMD +69% on the year (lol) NVDA +145% on the year INTC +23% on the year (disappointing due to its previous trajectory)\n\nSPECULATION \\*AMDs poor relative performance to NVDA (GPU market) can directly be correlated to two things\n\n1. The lack of a high performance GPU. NONE of amds current line-up (remember we have a future generation coming but the current gen is lackluster for high performance.\n2. Lack of reach to new gaming customers (everyone who really really wanted a Ryzen cpu probably has one by now)\n3. Price to performance ratio is not great on their GPUs but is EXCEPTIONAL on the Ryzen platform I admit\n\nNVDA has the RTX 2000 series (we won\u2019t compare the GPUs that haven\u2019t been officially announced yet from these two companies) \u2014\u2014 \\*NVDA - how is it up so much?\n\n1. Market Leader\n2. Strong leadership under CEO Jensen Huan(probably spelled that wrong sorry I\u2019m a lazy shit sometimes)\n3. High performance and \u201cattempts\u201d at a budget GPU option.\n\nRTX 2060 super cards allow gamers to build a \u201cbeast\u201d of a PC these days for -under 1500$\n\n[Proof](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/mstbPn) \\^ under penalty of permanent BAN I swear to WS gods I put that list together in under 2 minutes. THATS how easy it is to build a pc in this modern era. \u2014\u2014 And finally INTC\n\n1. Dominated the entire sector as a market leader for 7 years. See Core i \u201cgen\u201d CPUS. From sandy bridge to Kaby lake - this company was at the top.\n2. Gained momentum because AMDs FX serious sucked bro\n3. Name recognition. Has your mom heard of intel before? It\u2019s quite possibly. AMD? Less likely. \u2014- Conspiracy level speculation? Okay here it is: NVDA could be a market leader in self driving cars. This could put them in direct competition with TSLA.\n\nTLDR: So what are the plays bitch?\n\nAMD has a LOT of room to Grow. But this is long term. I have a long position of at least 10 shares with them. I\u2019d have to check my other brokers to give an exact number.\n\nNVDA - Why aren\u2019t you buying this stock? Have you looked at the charts? I can go to war defending this company\u2019s stock price.\n\nINTC - Fuck! Before Covid this was a definite buy. If INTC continues to grow it\u2019s market share in the APU, CPU, and GPU markets this company could be fucked in 5+ years or so. Trade at your own caution - but I\u2019m BUYING.",

They're expected to help AMD compete effectively with Intel in the high-end gaming market, as well as the massive mainstream consumer PC market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;AMD's market share gains may now be even easier to come by.

If you say execute on chip production, then that\u2019s at least 2-3 years before we know if they are back on course. Their history with the 10nm delays gives no one any faith that they will be able to right the ship after their announced 6 month delay. If anything, analysts fear the delay will get extended again and again. Listen to the conference call. \n\nSo how does INTC right the stock quickly?\n\nI see these options from other titans ....\n\n1) fire CEO and the VPs responsible for delays\n\n2) increase dividends\n\n3) increase share buyback \n\n4) announce transparency initiative- yields , roadmap , etc. \n\n5) add directors that will hold execs accountable. \n\n\n6 months ago, the 7nm was coming along great. Now, it\u2019s delayed. The market doesn\u2019t believe in Intc anymore. Any positive news they come out from now till 2023 (new 7nm launch) will not be believed.",

SPY holds 257 Billion. If this fund decides to move just .5% out of Microsoft they would be redistributing 1 billion amongst the lower tier stocks. Will they do this? why not? They do it regularly, the question is if enough funds and ETF's do it at once, will it boost some stock and suppress others?\n\nBack to microsoft. SPY had 81 million shares as of yesterday. What did they have last september? 84 million.

Would they boost top holdings right now having such a massive run? if your mandate is to have a diverse portfolio, I doubt it.\n\nThis trend in the SPY ETF reducing holdings over the last year is also true of Apple, and Facebook but not Amazon.\n\nComapnies I like with low weights barring that something crazy with the virus doesn't happen and JPow's printer doesn't get jammed:\n\nCalls on :KO, PFE, INTC,  MMM, RTX",

        "selftext": "So the recent stock jump from AMD recently really caught me off guard. As someone who has generally always viewed Intel as a stronger stock to trade on based on a more diversified hold on the market I. E. their technology is integrated in more technologies across a wider range of markets hence my deduction that they tend to perform better in the stock market (historically this seems to be the case). \n\nHowever,  I'll admit I've been somewhat removed from viewing the news as much as I normally would due to personal reasons and needing a break from information overload, so my scope on the market was limited at the time,  hence the lapse in my judgement. I'm generally pretty good at reading the market, but this one has really changed my ideas on how I would strategize in the future.\n\nEssentially though, I'd like to ask investors: when you're in doubt, do you go with what you hear the buzz is in the market place, or stick to your guns? Also,  what are your feelings on hedging your bets I. E. splitting your investment up to follow a trend as well as your own predictions and if so,  what is the percentage by which you would generally advocate the ratio of that split? Also,  I feel like we should all probably be using platforms like reddit more often to get a direct view of what investors are doing on the ground floor, kinda like a hub where we can all synchronize our trading watches and therefore help to make more stable bets on the market. However, the issue of false or misinformation always comes to mind - but if moderated correctly, it can really be a godsend (just saying). \n\nThis has become vitally important to me, as the absolutely perfect balance of the Intel vs. AMD difference is so exact that it got me thinking about so many other stocks, information trends and the surreal nature of the stock market. \n\nYou can't always be right and it's difficult to know what to predict these days, but I feel like discussing this is important for investors in general, as any useful answers could really help people save or make a lot of money in the future. \n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "With Intel late on 7nm it means they have to use TSMC. Both AMD and TSMC are soaring. However how come SMICY is tanking? SMIC is a generation behind TSMC  but if TSMC gets busy with handling both AMD and INTC orders they may have to move some of their older generation fabs from 10 to 7nm. That would create a shortage of 10 nm fabs so SMIC should benefit. or are people thinking INTC will flood the 10nm market? I dont think INTC is ready to do contract manufacturing so SMIC really should be going up. Also with the sanctions on Huawei , Huawei has no choice but to use SMIC. Also SMIC recently did a secondary listing on Shanghai and the stock tripled. But at the same time the existing pink sheet stock has dropped by 20%. How does that make sense?\n\nSMICY used to be listed as ADR SMI but last year they decided to delist from US market and keep only Hong Kong listing so the shares became pink sheet SMICY. This means no options only shares.\n\nIs this the new market? If there are no options for Robinhood autists to play , a stock will go down?",

Not sure if the date allows enough time for a chance at recovery.

        "selftext": "Hey all,\n   I've really been enjoying this community.  Even on blood red days, the comments and banter are hilarious and put me in a better mood.  \n  I've been losing out pretty steadily on all of my penny picks, and needed a change of pace for a bit. \n    Having a few blue chip stocks is always a solid choice, and just thought I'd suggest Intel (INTC). It took a heavy hit yesterday and this morning, apparently because of news that their new chip will be delayed (from $65 to $50)  But I personally believe it could have a steady rise back .... it is Intel after all.\n    Mods, feel free to delete as it's not a penny stock, but for all those ... especially some new folks like myself, who've been trudging through pennyland exclusively, this might be a good moment to look out at what else is out there.",

Im looking to buy NEE, INTC and DIS stock as I am pretty familiar with these companies and I consume their services. I have no one to guide me. My parents are immigrants who hardly speak English and are unfamiliar with trading. My goal as of now is to purchase and hold onto my stocks for long periods.
