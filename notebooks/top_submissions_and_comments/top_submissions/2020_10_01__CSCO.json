That might be cool but they are too expensive to bet on, or for theta gang, you'd want to be sure the company exists in 5 years.\n\nHere's 12 of the cheapest Jan 2022 Call LEAPS that's around 95% OTM.\n\n|Ticker|Stock Price|Strike|Bid|Ask|PctOptionStrike|% OTM|Vol|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BAC|$25.3|$50C|$0.2|$0.21|0.4%|97.6%|135|\n|JPM|$101.02|$195C|$0.72|$0.86|0.39%|93.0%|108|\n|TAK|$17.82|$35C|$0.05|$0.15|0.29%|96.4%|46|\n|CSCO|$39.85|$75P|$0.16|$0.18|0.23%|88.2%|30|\n|GILD|$63.78|$120C|$0.51|$0.61|0.48%|88.2%|25|\n|CME|$169.35|$330C|$0|$0.4|0.12%|94.9%|24|\n|EPD|$17.04|$32C|$0.03|$0.17|0.25%|96.0%|21|\n|HAS|$89.21|$170C|$0.81|$0.94|0.46%|90.5%|18|\n|AFL|$38.16|$75C|$0|$0.25|0.13%|96.6%|15|\n|CVX|$74.07|$140C|$0.13|$0.8|0.35%|89.0%|12|\n|USB|$39.08|$75C|$0.25|$0.44|0.27%|91.9%|11|\n|AXP|$106.22|$200C|$0.8|$1.09|0.5%|88.29%|5|\n\nImagine you're wheeling a promising stock. There's always a chance the stock blows up 40% in a month (happened to me with LTHM), and it might never drop back to the range where you were wheeling before.\n\nHere's where these cheap LEAPS come in. At such low prices of 0.2% - 0.5% of strike price, a weekly 0.3-0.4 delta covered call or short put typically pays for one of these 90% OTM Call LEAPS with change to spare, and these are valid for another 15 months.\n\nThese options are found using [FDscanner](https://fdscanner.com/) (disclaimer I built it), with the scanner parameters\n\n\\- Expiry Jan 2022\n\n\\- % OTM: 85% - 99%\n\n\\- Option Price/Strike Price: 0-0.5%\n\n\\- Calls only\n\nThese LEAPS will give you the peace of mind that some upside is captured even on extreme upward movement. You could also set the scanner to find less OTM calls eg (45%-55%) at a higher cost, or find companies with cheap 50% OTM puts. Or increase the Option Price/Strike to a larger range (eg 0-2%) to find more companies.\n\nDozens more companies fit the criteria: BUD, KRE, BUD, T, MPLX, SCHW, though their option volume is just 1 - 5 for Friday. Possible the number might break 3 digits but is not captured on the scanner due to them having 0 volume for that day.\n\nAlternatively, try to think of positive black swans for companies in the list. Eg a company trading at deep value, or is at cyclical lows, upcoming major product launches, pharma companies, etc.",

        "selftext": "If you average down, and immediately sell the additional shares you just bought at the same price, the average cost you purchased the stock/option at will also go down. \n\nLets look at an example, suppose you bought 100 shares of CSCO at $48 a few months ago. Now the price is $40 and you would have lost $800 right? Well, if you buy another 100 shares at $40 and immediately sell them at $40, your average purchasing price will only be $44. Do it again and It goes down to $42. Keep on doing this and it you can get your average purchasing price down to where the price is right now. If your average purchasing price is the same price the stock currently trades at, you have no losses on that stock!",

        "selftext": "Obviously value stocks haven\u2019t performed this year, that\u2019s why they\u2019re value stocks, no? I think people look at 2020\u2019s best growth stocks and see the excellent performance in a short period of time and automatically assume that value investing is dead. What they seem to forget is that a lot of the popular stocks now would have been fairly considered \u201cvalue stocks\u201d not even a couple years ago. For example AAPL had a PE of 12 in December 2018. In the early and mid 2010\u2019s people were already dismissing Apple and looking elsewhere for opportunities. But the funny thing is is that AAPL was a \u201cvalue stock\u201d not even a couple years ago, so how can people reasonably say that value investing died? Isn\u2019t AAPL a classic example of how value investing can win in the end? \n\nI know PE isn\u2019t everything but it\u2019s a solid tool to use. Here\u2019s some more, MSFT was 100% a value stock until Nadella came in a few years ago and the stock skyrocketed. It had PEs around 10 in 2013 and 2016. People looked at MSFT the same way people look at CSCO or INTC today. \n\nI think my point is that people say value investing is dead, but the biggest winners of the last few years were \u201cvalue stocks\u201d that ended up breaking out of their undervalued state and dominating the market. I know AAPL and MSFT are obvious example now but 5,10 years ago they weren\u2019t. \n\nThoughts? I could be dead wrong for all I know, and I know that Apple and Microsoft weren\u2019t unpopular stocks at all in that time period, but they weren\u2019t the hottest. XOM and GE and IBM were all the hottest stocks at one time too.",

Yet I\u2019m guessing most of the relevant events coming up will use Teams.\nMicrosoft also is doing so well with cloud and its core business I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so undervalued vs other tech names right now.\n\nMSFT 210 10/16 calls\n\nMSFT 220 10/30 calls (includes earnings)\n\nMSFT 230 Jan 2021 calls",

        "selftext": "##The Boomer Weekly\n\n###Where dreams die. Slowly.\n\nStrap in your enormous genitals and let\u2019s go for a ride through Boomerland. \n\nWe\u2019re kicking it off with CSCO, who was mistakenly pronounced dead last week - had the toe tag on and everything. Turns out, she\u2019s a badass bitch with some sass still in the tank. Up 5.2% on the week headed into Friday with a neat price of 40.00/share. Closed out Friday +3.96% 39.85. \n\nNext up is GE. Hold on; I\u2019m gonna need to take a deep breath here. \n\nGE started the week off rising steadily to ~+2% by Tuesday afternoon before being shot in the face by a series of poorly conceived tweets and bled out quickly on a -6% swing to -4%. Then, they duct taped a jet engine to a backpack and swung back +8% to close Thursday up 4% for the week. Hold on to your soft pretzel because we\u2019re not done with this fucking thing. Friday before open, an analyst at Goldman Sachs decided to see how brazenly he could bullshit the company out of a losing position and boosted his price target to $10/share. Why? Because he thought they were starting to be a little less dumb with money. Solid DD, Goldman. Rock fucking solid. Totally deserves a nearly 50% price boost. This, of course, coming on the heels of an urgent FAA safety mandate concerning GE engines. Boomers bit I guess; it was up 6% pre-market but fell to +2.86% on the day to close out this wild week up 7%. \n\nLet\u2019s do an easy one next.\n\nWMT. Fittingly, a company that runs on minuscule margins didn\u2019t really participate much in this week\u2019s price-boosting extravaganza. Up 1% on the week. \n\nBA. Tuesday was where most of the magic happened here. Up 3.4% at open, it released an industry forecast report that stated - and I\u2019m paraphrasing here - \u201cturns out, we won\u2019t be selling very many airplanes during a global pandemic\u201d. Investors - blindsided by the news - panic sold for a -5% swing. Then, it too, got shot in the face by a series of ill-conceived tweets that afternoon and tumbled down to -5.9%. For the rest of the week, it was on the mend as investors realized a)they already fucking knew Boeing was going to sell fewer planes and b)well, the tweets were bullshit. Closed out Friday only -1.2% on the week. \n\nAnd who said Boomerland was boring?!\n\nJohnson &amp; Johnson &amp; Johnson &amp; Johnson &amp; Johnson $ Johnson whipped it out for +2.6% on the week. \n\nMy boy KO didn\u2019t have much cushion when the tweeter bomb dropped on Tuesday but recovered quickly. Had a nice Wed Thurs Fri to close out the week +2.65% at $50.81/share. Only about 20% more to go to get back to pre-Covid levels. We\u2019ll get there together, little guy; you go when you\u2019re ready. (Disclaimer: I have KO positions in my grown up *and* gambling accounts so I have a raging conflict of interest; come check it out.)\n\nF, former maker of such iconic models as the [Festiva](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/1st_Ford_Festiva.jpg) said, \u201cthese hoes ain\u2019t loyal\u201d to no one in particular before launching to a $0.30 gain on the week (+4.25% ish). On Friday morning, it was up 6.7% on the week but promptly pooped itself and then, obviously, its whole day was ruined after that. +4.2% on the week.\n\nXOM XOM XOM XOM. ooooooh baby did that bitch pop. On Thursday morning, it chugged a glass of its own dirty black go juice and lit the fart on fire to rise 5% in the blink of an eye. I\u2019m not going to tell you why. Not because I don\u2019t know...oil prices? Yeah. Let\u2019s go with that. Closed out the week +4.26% to $34.78, which might seem nifty if you didn\u2019t know that it was $70.00 at the beginning of January. Ouch.\n\nWe wrap up our tour with a nod to UL (Unilever), who improved on its ATH by closing out the week +0.51% to $63.12 Friday EOD. Congrats, you old Anglo-Dutch multinational conglomerate.\n\nHope you enjoyed this week\u2019s drive through Boomerland for the week ending October 9th, 2020. It was a dandy. Enjoy the weekend, heathens.",

They've got WebX, and I think Zoom is too new to know how to adapt and handle any new projects. CSCO had a large drop earlier this year in part due to a dropoff in WebX users I believe. I know for a fact that some very large companies switched over to using Zoom this year, but I also know that some are switching off of Zoom after using it for only a couple quarters. \n\nReally my bet on CSCO going up is also a bet on Zoom going down--but puts are Zoom are kind of expensive for me.

Slowly.*\n\nFasten the seatbelt over your sweaty floopa and let\u2019s get this party started.\n\nWe kick it off with the stock that we were all thinking about this week: CSCO. Thoughts and prayers went out but they weren\u2019t enough; she dead. It barely caught the wave up and most definitely caught the wave down. Shaved -2% more off its share price to come in at a raggedy 38.85ish. This former star child of the Boomerfolio has melted -16.7% on the 3 month chart. \n\nNext up is BA, who had its much heralded FAA test flight. No crashes, which is what you really want see in a test like that. The stock price, meanwhile, was more jittery than a possessed crackhead in church and ended up nearly +5% for the week. \n\nGM, who famously tested electric vehicles in 1805 but decided it was just a meme, swung over 6% this week from a low of -3% on Tuesday to +3.5%ish at close on Friday.\n\nPFE lost a whopping 0.01% on Friday to close out a solid week that saw the stock jump +2.3%.\n\nKO, who last week gave up 50/s last week, failed to reclaim it but posted a solid +2.4%ish gain for the week to 49.38ish. \n\nGotdamn airlines appear to be successfully extorting the government for bailout money after years of spending exorbitant amounts on stock buybacks. They jumped on Friday on the capitulating words from a wrinkly but influential old hag whose husband represents no conflict of interest whatsoever to make gains for the week. I would say it\u2019s unfuckingbelievable but, come on, it\u2019s completely believable.\n\nADM, convicted price-fixer and an indispensable cog in the American food supply system, shat all over callholders with a 2% drop starting EOD Monday. It rallied hard, tanked again overnight Thursday, and had another monster day on Friday to finish up 0.13% on the week ($0.06). Wild shit. \n\nGE, the flagbearer of Boomerland, gained over 2.5% after a pretty choppy week. \n\nHope you enjoyed this week\u2019s tour of Boomerland. Sorry there weren\u2019t as many jokes this time; yours truly got fucking wrecked this week with both puts and calls. I\u2019m gonna gonna watch the dancing bear gif for a while to cheer me up.

        "selftext": "\\#**WHY #AMD #IS #GOING #TO #THE  #MOON**  \n\n\n\\#1\n\n**Heavily Rumoured New CPUs (including 16 core gaming CPU).**\n\nThis would be revolutionary and will put investors into a complete frenzy. The slide was leaked and confirmed by [videocardz.com](https://videocardz.com) which is a very authentic source for tech news. A 16 core CPU that pulls 105w at a reasonable price will be GAME-CHANGING, and everyone will want to get their hands on it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4y8kvv3blq51.png?width=1569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0e772c7f4963cb569eb0024dcee84fb63b4697e\n\nAlong with this game-changing chip, 3 additional CPUs are rumored to be released.   \n\n\n\\#2\n\n**Big Navi having possibly better performance**  \nThere have been leaks off Newegg of Big Navi being better than the 3080. Even if the cards are neck in neck AMD will be able to paint the 6000 series cards as better due to minor discrepancies.\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\t5,120\t1,500\t16GB GDDR6\t512\t256-bit\t300  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\t3,840\t1,500\t12GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t200  \n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6700 XT\t2,560\t1,500\t6GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t150  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0zjsju2clq51.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14551f974837dfc21662c24da268d5284287d169\n\n  \n\\#3\n\n**NVIDIA 3rd Party Card Catastrophe**\n\n*(this section is from my previous post)*\n\nSo most GPUs are made by a 3rd party. AMD and NVIDIA make the actual \"brain\" of the GPU but 3rd party partners add onto it for better performance (very basic explanation). Don't ask me why this is, it is just mainly because of logistical reasons.\n\nBut that is not the point, the point is that the great majority of GPUs are third-party cards meaning that they get to change around the design of the PCB. The issue here is that some of these third-party partners cheaped out on little capacitors.\n\nBy cheapening out it is leading to bad power delivery. The only way to fix this rn is to downclock the card which the normal person doesn't know how to do and doesn't expect is necessary when they are buying a 500$+ piece of hardware.\n\nI feel like if there is a mass callback that will be bad PR. NVIDIA could always release drivers that make the cards run below their listed spec but i'm not sure if people will really want that even if the performance loss is marginal.\n\nEVGA already confirmed the suspicions that these cards were crashing because of capacitor issues. It may be different for other companies but at least for EVGA this is what they are saying currently.\n\n**But why does this matter??**\n\nPeople who were looking to pick up a next-gen GPU right away are now hesitant and will wait for AMDS offerings. The people who did return their GPUs will also possibly wait. Faulty cards will most likely get a down clock which will make Big Navi look better. It supposedly already is better and this 3-5% difference could really change people's minds.  \n\n\n\\#4 \n\nLisa Su is an absolute unit. She will for sure talk about their timeline and plans for 5nm/3nm. I am guessing that this will rally investors to invest because they will see shinny 5nm/3nm while Intel is just getting to 10nm.  \n\n\n**POSITIONS:**  \n\\+95 call  (exp 12/18)  \n\\- 100 call (exp 12/18)\n\n(*call me a pussy for using a debit spread but I think its the best for my case)*  \n\n\nif you have something else you want to share comments below and I will add it!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu)\n\n[https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications)\n\n*This is not financial advice just me presenting the facts and the possibility of a callback.*  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2ciqo9vdlq51.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d0fa79a87e74390c112a07e8d93a82c5a8476e",

AAPL -2.65% unveiled a new iPhone Tuesday capable of connecting to a much faster 5G cellular network, which investors are betting will spur strong demand.\n\nChief Executive Tim Cook stood at the company\u2019s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters to begin the webcast, streamed on Apple\u2019s website\u2014a visual reminder of how the tech giant\u2019s latest flagship-product introduction differs from previous ones because of the coronavirus pandemic, which closed businesses and left people sheltering at home around the world for much of this year.\n\nThe iPhone 12 offered a new physical appearance from last year\u2019s smartphone, moving from a rounded design to a flatter-edged look reminiscent of the iPhone 4. Apple revealed four versions of the phones ranging in sizes and starting in price from $699 for the iPhone 12 Mini with a 5.4-inch display. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has a 6.7-inch display, an increase from 6.5 inches; the higher-end versions emphasize the camera abilities.\n\n\nThe newest iPhone designs move away from the rounded shape of recent models toward a flatter-edged look akin to the iPhone 4. The iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max, unveiled Tuesday.\nPHOTO: APPLE\nThe greatest hype going into the event, however, has been about the device\u2019s 5G capability. Apple\u2019s adoption of the next-generation wireless standard places intense focus on the new technology that has been years in the making. Cellular network carriers have been scrambling to roll out 5G service across the U.S., but coverage remains spotty in the country and it isn\u2019t clear yet whether customers will want it.\n\nWSJ NEWSLETTER\nNotes on the News\nThe news of the week in context, with Tyler Blint-Welsh.\n\nEnter your email\nSIGN UP\n\u201cToday is the beginning of a new era for iPhone,\u201d Mr. Cook said.\n\nShares slipped as the event took place, which has occurred with previous Apple events, before rebounding. With few people familiar with the new cellular service, Mr. Cook made an effort to describe why 5G technology would improve their experience. He cited improved downloads and uploads, higher-quality video streaming, better gaming and less network congestion. Apple also highlighted the integration with the company\u2019s new A14 Bionic microchip.\n\nThe presentation included demonstrations of how 5G iPhones could be helpful in downloading important medical images and for remotely designing factory spaces\u2014tacit acknowledgments that some of the most likely customers for the technology might be business users who can benefit from faster connections.\n\nHow Apple Became the World\u2019s Most Valuable Publicly Traded Company\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHow Apple Became the World\u2019s Most Valuable Publicly Traded Company\nHow Apple Became the World\u2019s Most Valuable Publicly Traded Company\nApple reached a staggering $2 trillion market valuation in August, despite years of doubt from critics over whether the tech giant could continue to succeed after the death of Steve Jobs. Here\u2019s a look at Apple\u2019s rise to the very top. Illustration: Jacob Reynolds/WSJ\n\u201cApple almost provides like the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval,\u201d Mark Vena, a senior analyst for Moor Insights &amp; Strategy said. \u201cThey tend to validate the technology, which is unfair because you could go out today and buy a Samsung phone\u201d with 5G.\n\nThe emphasis on the guts of the iPhone marked a change from recent years where many new features involved cameras and other iterative updates. The lack of dramatic change has come as the smartphone market has matured more than a decade after Apple first introduced the iPhone.\n\nThe latest smartphone arrives five years after iPhone unit sales peaked. Mr. Cook has pushed the company to sell pricier versions of the device and to rely on software services and wearables, such as smartwatches and headphones, to boost revenue.\n\nIn a nod to those efforts, the company began its Tuesday event by introducing an updated HomePod that is smaller than its previous version of the speaker and is priced at $99.\n\n\nApple unveiled a new, smaller HomePod than its previous version of the speaker.\nPHOTO: APPLE\nApple began selling the HomePod in early 2018 after unspecified delays pushed back the rollout following its 2017 debut. The voice-activated device was Apple\u2019s attempt to catch up with the success of Amazon.com Inc. and its smart speakers in late 2014, though when the HomePod debuted at $349 it was considerably more expensive than its rivals.\n\nTo make the case for a pricier offering, Apple has previously emphasized its sound quality, especially when it comes to music. The device\u2019s price has fallen since it first went on the market.\n\nThe iPhone 12 has been hotly anticipated by investors who have driven up the company\u2019s shares 69% in 2020, partly because of excitement over the new phone. Those expectations and Apple\u2019s success in driving up services revenue helped it become the first U.S. public company to eclipse $2 trillion in market value earlier this year.\n\nAnalysts surveyed by FactSet, on average, predict iPhone revenue will rise 15% to $160 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. That is about $6 billion shy of the record set in fiscal 2018, when the $1,000 iPhone X helped bolster sales even as shipments failed to reach a new high.\n\nKaty Huberty, a veteran Apple analyst for Morgan Stanley, last week predicted the company could ship as many as 240 million iPhones this year, helped by customers who haven\u2019t upgraded in several years and excitement for 5G. That would set a record, beating the 231 million devices sold in fiscal 2015. Sales at that level could send the company\u2019s shares up 37% from Monday\u2019s close to a market value of almost $2.9 trillion, she said.\n\n\u201cWe expect this fall\u2019s launch to be the most significant iPhone event in years,\u201d she wrote in a note to investors.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat new products or updates are you hoping to see from Apple? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn recent years, Mr. Cook has been stretching the iPhone lineup to appeal to an array of pocketbooks. That was on display again Tuesday: A step up from the iPhone 12 Mini sits the iPhone 12, starting at $799 with a 6.1-inch display. On the higher end, the iPhone 12 Pro starts at $999, with the Pro Max offering the largest display and beginning at $1,099.\n\nThe iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are available for pre-order on Friday, and the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max will be available Nov. 6, Apple said.\n\nSome analysts are skeptical that customers will flock to a 5G phone without a must-have application or service to help them see the appeal of the new technology. U.S. cellular networks are still being upgraded, and service might be disappointing in some spots for early adopters.\n\nIt is also uncertain how the coronavirus will affect sales of the new devices. The pandemic delayed production of the flagship phone earlier this year, which led Tuesday\u2019s unveiling to be rescheduled from its traditional September date.\n\nMr. Cook appeared publicly for the first time since a Democratic-led House subcommittee last week issued a report claiming Apple uses its control over software on its devices in an anticompetitive manner. Apple has rejected the report\u2019s conclusions and said it doesn\u2019t have a dominant market share in any area.",
