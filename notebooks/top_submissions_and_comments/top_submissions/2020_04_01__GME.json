        "selftext": "GameStop GME reached $3.12 today, the lowest it's ever been in its entire history fo being public. It is around a $200m market cap now. GameStop was betting on a turnaround later this year because of the new console release, but COVID-19 seems to have put those plans on a damper. Moreover, with the virus most people won't want to visit a GameStop let alone go outside.\n\nWhat left is there to be bullish on this company? Michael Burry was long on it earlier this year - why? Can the company last even another 6 months?",

        "selftext": "After about 4 days of research, I am officially bullish on GME. I have built a position of 470 shares and will buy more Monday. I am feeling confident about this, but I am also an autist and a retard so I wouldn't be surprised if I somehow lose all of my money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, here is my bullish thesis:\n\n1) The undisclosed record date for the proxy fight (which means more institutional share recalls)\n\n2) New consoles incoming for the holidays (confirmed) - Historically, the stock runs for multiple months before the new console cycle begins. This time is going to be extremely explosive due to the extremely negative sentiment and short interest. Not to mention about 50% of consoles are bought physically in stores)\n\n3) Gamer activity globally at unprecedented levels\n\n4) Debt payoff/refinancing news and possibly more share buybacks, mixed in with a clean balance sheet\n\n5) Former Nintendo $NTDOY executive Reggie Fils-Aime joins the board of directors on April 20th. Reggie is known for having saved not only Nintendo, but MTV, and Pizza Hut as well. He is a master of building brands.\n\n6) Hestia Capital and Permit Capital (who collectively own 7.6% of Gamestop) have nominated two candidates with turnaround experience and shareholder perspectives to the board for election to GameStop's Board of Directors.\n\n7) Activist investors have been gobbling up shares recently (Michael Burry, Hestia, Donald Foss, Must Asset Management)\n\n8) The extremely bearish sentiment and short interest due to silly arguments (ex: who buys physical? Isn't Gamestop the new Blockbuster? etc.) has artificially moved the stock down to unprecedented levels.\n\n9) 57 million short positions, more than actual shares outstanding meaning potential for a short squeeze.\n\n10) Gamestop has already begun its brand-rebuilding. They have been remodeling stores into gaming cafes and partnered with nearly every major esports organization in Texas. They announced a multi-year sponsorship deal with Dallas-based Envy Gaming, acquired the naming rights to Complexity gaming's 11,000 square-foot \"Gamestop Performance Center,\" and a partnership with Infinite Esports which will include its OpTic Gaming franchise as well as its Overwatch Team.\n\n\\*Note\\* Many people believe Michael Burry to be a one-hit-wonder and an autist. However, when he predicted the financial crisis everyone thought he was wrong, and an autist as well. But he turned out to be right. Maybe its a stretch, but just maybe the same situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, check out [https://www.restoregamestop.com/home](https://www.restoregamestop.com/home) for more information on the proxy vote, and the two elected candidates: Kurt Wolf and Paul Evans. \n\nPicture of Gaming Cafes:\n\n [https://imgur.com/Fp0R20n](https://imgur.com/Fp0R20n) \n\n [https://imgur.com/smdYomu](https://imgur.com/smdYomu) \n\n [https://imgur.com/WSprZc4](https://imgur.com/WSprZc4) \n\nMy position so far: \n\n [https://imgur.com/m1nxdpo](https://imgur.com/m1nxdpo) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCredit to Reddit user: The\\_Bossss for some of the points I used.",

        "selftext": "I'm here today to shill you Gamestop (GME). I won't lose your time with a TLDR long thesis just a few key points why this is the biggest gainer of your life. Here is fuel for the thrusters:\n\n1. GME has 65.5 million shares in total and 55 million shares are short. You read that right. 84% OF SHARES ARE SHORT. Michael Burry owns 3.5 million shares long. Look up proxy war.\n2. History points that console releases are where they make the most money and the stock increases on average 120%+.\n3. Gaming consumption is estimated to be up 75%.\n4. Games have increased memory sizes and the console hard drives can't handle them which may cause a flow back to the consumption of disk games.\n\nGAMESTOP IS A STEAL. TRADING UP 20% ON THE DAY AND IT WILL BE AT 10$ BY MONTHS END.\n\nBuy your calls and the stock far OTM it doesn't really matter. This is a tendies printer.\n\nTHE THRUSTERS ARE LOADING\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: IF YOU ARE LONG MAKE SURE TO CALL IN YOUR SHARES FROM YOUR BROKER AND MAKE SURE THEY AREN'T BEING SHORT-LENT (CALL YOUR BROKERS)",

It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public.

How the fuck could you not?

        "selftext": "Inspired by the \"end of gamestop\" post, I think we're seeing a greater trend. The end of specialized retail.\n\nMacy's, Best Buy, GameStop, Barnes and Noble, Foot Locker, Champs, Bloomingdales, will all be relics of the past in a few years. \n\nWhen I need to buy something, I generally either go to Amazon or Target unless it's clothing. But clothing I usually buy directly from the manufacturer. Occasionally I'll order from an online retailer. My decision to go to Amazon or Target depends on the nature of the item and how immediately I need it.\n\nI'm just not sure how these guys can survive. I can only think of a few reasons why you'd go to one of these stores ever. My theory is that the older generations are comfortable going to a specialty retailer where they know they can get what they need.\n\nYeah, basically I think that Amazon, Target, and Wal-Mart actually still have a lot of room to grow as they continue to eat up these specialty retailers. Some will survive, maybe jewelry stores or some very specialized retailers like that. But most of these will be gone in 10 years.",

Did a bit of my own digging on them and there seems to be something to the idea that the stock is going to have a near term pop due to this proxy battle. Zacks even had a little run down back on 4/3 about IV spiking on the 7/17 $8 *puts*. [(Zacks)](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/852683/implied-volatility-surging-for-gamestop-gme-stock-options)\n\nAs one commenter on the WSB post suggested, the $10c 7/17 seemed most attractive. Dove in for 50 of them near the end of close 4/13 at a cost basis of $0.186/contract. \n\nRegardless of GameStop\u2019s long term future, the short term indicates a chance at printing a big stack of cash if you can snag some contracts before IV takes hold again when this monster pops and the short squeeze really gets rolling.",

        "selftext": "If we look at the release of Ps4 in November of 2013 we can see a huge gain in GME's stock price. \n\nThe launch of a major gaming system only comes around every 7 years (PS3 in 2006, PS4 in 2013, PS5 in 2020). \n\nPS5 will more than likely be available for the 2020 holiday season with mass production starting in June:  [https://www.notebookcheck.net/PlayStation-5-mass-production-to-begin-in-June-with-simultaneous-global-launch-planned-PS5-reveal-event-could-land-in-late-May-or-early-June.462066.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/PlayStation-5-mass-production-to-begin-in-June-with-simultaneous-global-launch-planned-PS5-reveal-event-could-land-in-late-May-or-early-June.462066.0.html) \n\nAccording to this bloomberg article \"Sony remains unlikely to delay the launch of the PS5 from the critical year-end shopping season. So long as archrival Microsoft Corp. doesn\u2019t push back the release of its next-generation Xbox, also expected at the end of the year, Sony won\u2019t delay either\" : [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/sony-is-said-to-plan-limited-playstation-5-output-in-first-year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/sony-is-said-to-plan-limited-playstation-5-output-in-first-year) \n\nWith Covid potentially affecting this date Jan 2022 $5 calls seem like a safer option - this will give 2 holiday seasons for console sales to increase as some people will get it right on release and then a bunch more the next holiday season (usually when bundles are released at somewhat of a discounted price).

SPY is holding strongly above the ES line and it is continually touching the upper bollenger band on the weekly chart. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/Hvexp73\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking, stick to memes krogo! - you are right, I have absolutely no credibility and no idea what I\u2019m doing. It is also nearly impossible to predict short term market movements.\n\nNow anyway, my biggest catalyst for this pump is the reduction in cases in NY. NY is has shown that we can beat this virus. This isn\u2019t bullshit China that\u2019s lying about its cases, this is NY, 100% credible! This economic shutdown is only temporary and it\u2019s already showing signs of ending. All of which is signaling a V shaped recovery. It doesn\u2019t matter if that actually happens, it just matters if people think that will happen. We\u2019re talking about tomorrow here, duh!\n\nJP Morgan also said that we will have a U shaped recovery, pretty much the same as a V. Big banks pay their experts big money to figure that stuff out, you can probably take them at their word. But even if they\u2019re wrong, it only matters if they THINK that, so they will then pump the market tomorrow.\n\nAlso, If you look at every red day we have had, they are almost always followed by a Green Day. It\u2019s a very predictable pattern that fucks everyone who FOMOs. \n\nFurthermore JPOW and Trump will not let this market drop. EVERYONE THINKS THE MARKET CAN\u2019T GO ANY HIGHER, SO LONG AS PEOPLE THINK THAT, THE MARKET WILL PUMP. This is pure science. I know this is still the case because this post is likely to get a lot of hate. \n\nThe OIL crash is priced in since the market didn\u2019t crash too much when oil did. Most things that you know about are PRICED IN. If you know about whatever it is you know, so do the expert investors. Therefore, all the bearish DD you have  is PRICED IN. \n\nThe only time someone had bearish DD that wasn\u2019t priced in was the guy in the big short. The guy from the big short even knows everything is priced this time since he is bullish on fucking GAMESTOP.\n\n\n\nPosition: https://imgur.com/gallery/jpVznRl",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been right on my past two predictions for this stock and I\u2019m up 350% now (would be more but my paper hands fucked me hard). I\u2019ve been watching this chart for a while and every single indication I have from the charts says it\u2019s tanking over the next 3 days. \n\n[week long chart](https://imgur.com/lVjg9h7) shows pretty heavy bear signals. \n\n[month long chart](https://imgur.com/YCQRwI4) shows even harder bear signals. We\u2019re seeing the beginnings of what looks like a classic batman formation. High followed by smaller high and a rally lesser than original high. \n\n[3 month long chart](https://imgur.com/60r3iLH) shows even harder signs. We can see the classic batman formation played out nearly identically to what\u2019s happening now just a few weeks back. \n\nDaily charts have shown massive pushback at $6 and it\u2019s been unable to break that number long enough to show up on anything other than minute charts. And today it\u2019s proved it isn\u2019t willing to push highs that were already established days passed.\n\nAssuming I\u2019m 3 for 3 and right on it falling, what should the plays be? I\u2019m rolling with 5/1 $6p, but you could still buy $5.50p and you\u2019d most likely be in the money. \n\nAs for when to sell in case you want to take profits and run, I\u2019d sell exactly at $4.60. Any further and it\u2019s uncharted territory. The rally for the past 2 weeks was simply because Michael fucking Burry (yes the one and only) bought 5% of the company and you autists decided to follow and pump it up. I imagine the price could drop much further than $4.60, but it\u2019s shown support at $4.70ish and who know what\u2019ll happen after it hits that. If you want to keep bag holding, I\u2019d consider selling again at the pre-Burry average of around $4.10. I really don\u2019t think it\u2019ll drop much further. \n\nPositions:\nYolo on GME 5/1 $6p\nGME 5/1 $5.5p",

        "selftext": "The waters are swirling at the moment with opportunity for GameStop (GME) to meet or exceed earnings expeditions on 5/28. Other catalysts include the ongoing proxy battle and major shortage of the stock. Those two are well known and heavily discussed topics on WSB already, so I won\u2019t go into them more here. \n\nGME is seeing 90% of expected store sales in 2/3rds of their stores still. Nintendo Switch units have been in short supply, and coupled with game sales, this is a great bit of news from GameStop. This alone should provide strong enough earnings from them to catch a good pop when earnings are released on 5/28. \n\nGame sales have been during the pandemic. I believe a lot of these sales are physical and GameStop was able to capture their fair share of these sales. A second bit of gunpowder to add to the stack. \n\nGameStop also recently revealed cuts to pay for executives, and had some insider buying activity. While neither of these are huge for the stock, I believe it\u2019s some good faith moves to drum up big money investors in a lead up to earnings. \n\nIf the stars align, as I think they will on this one, you will see a big pop on GME after earnings release. With enough momentum, you could also see shorts scrambling to cover some of their positions. \n\nAssuming share prices hover around their current levels, I\u2019m looking at one of two call options to get into tomorrow:\n\nGME $6c 5/29 - if you believe the upward momentum in share price will only last a day, this is the one I\u2019d go for as it will expire the day after earnings. \n\nGME $8c 6/19 - if you think the stock could run up through the end of the week and into the next week after earnings, this is the better play as it gives you a nice contract price for entry and plenty of room to run and be able to sell out before the shorts try and put pressure back on the stock towards the middle of the first week in June. \n\nI will likely split my positions in both of these strikes.",

Based on what I have learned, the last three candles on the right show a few things:\n\n1)  This drop is losing momentum, as the candles are decreasing in size. \n\n2) It appears there may be a support point right around $2.90. The last red candle's wick dips below that point but it isn't able to actually take the stock there and the close is higher than the lowest dip at $2.80. \n\n3) Finally, the small green candle might signal that the stock is beginning to climb again (at least for the next few days).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are my initial thoughts, but I'm not sure if they are an accurate analysis of the patterns. I'm using ToS to look at this and the last three bars are all from the same day (04/02) so I'm not sure if this is too narrow of a time period to be trying to analyze like this (I'm using the 180D:4h setting on ToS).",

Activist\ninvestors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.\nThere is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.\nSchedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management\n(such as Index funds).\n\nThere is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize\nis that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.\nThe reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.\nIn contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.\n\n## New Filings\nThis table lists new 13D filings in the last week.

        "selftext": " Quick DD update: Hestia (large shareholder) released news today of the incoming proxy fight. There's over 100% short interest on Gamestop and those borrowed shares have to be recalled before April 20th (record date) in order to participate in the proxy vote.\n\n\u201cDue to the short interest in GameStop, it is possible that stockholders are not aware that their stock has been loaned by their broker. According to information GameStop has provided to custodial banks, brokers and other intermediaries, we believe GameStop has set a record date of Monday, April 20 for the 2020 Annual Meeting. Since shares on loan cannot be voted, it is imperative that stockholders who wish to vote at the 2020 Annual Meeting make certain they have their shares in proper voting order before the record date.\u201d\n\nHere's the link to the SEC Filing: [https://sec.report/Document/0000921895-20-001011/](https://sec.report/Document/0000921895-20-001011/) \n\nCould this trigger the infamous short squeeze?",

I got burned on BAC calls and so now im at 20$ on penny stocks. Should I go in on puts for 4/17 for GME or 4/24 I know after their voting thing everything is going to tank because they're short squeezing. Is that a viable tendies print?",
