        "selftext": "Last night, I was watching the Rolland Garros semi-finals (Grand Slam tournament - basically 1 of the 4 biggest tennis tournaments every year.)\n\nI love tennis both as a player and spectator, and as I have been rooting for this particular player for many years now, whom yesterday had a real chance of winning and going into the Finals of Rolland Garros for the first time in his career, I thought to myself:\n\n*Why not place a small fun bet to make it all the more exciting*.\n\nI had never betted on sports ever before this, maybe once with $2 as a joke with some friends around 10 years ago or so.\n\nThe player I am supporting starts to lose during the first hour of the match. So I sign up, deposit the minimum $10, and find that the return rate was 4/1 (I.e. $10 gets me $50 if my player wins, $40 profit).\n\nBeing a massive fan of the player, I thought on top of my own excitement for the game, 4/1 odds were fantastic.\n\nI am about to place the bet, but I find that the odds had shifted to 3/1 as my player had started earnings some points back.\n\nThen to 10/3, then 3/1 again.\n\nI found myself in a disgusting mindset hoping my player would lose a few points so that I can get in on the 4/1 odds, which I thought were great odds. **I had never, ever wished for this player to lose a point before**. This shook me quite a bit.\n\nAnd it happens! I quickly place my bet, **and I realise I had just bought the dip on a fucking tennis match.**\n\nThe match resumes and my player keeps losing. I refuse to believe this will happen as like I mentioned previously, I am a massive fan, believe in him, and want him to succeed.\n\nThe match reaches a point where my player is nearly defeated, at which point I go back and look at the odds.\n\nI see now the new revised odds at 7/1, then one more point is lost and I it goes to 8/1!\n\nOn the rush of adrenaline from the match and from my desire for my player to win, I deposit another $10 and place another bet at $10, with a profit of $80 if my player wins.\n\nIn the moment I realise **I just doubled down on a tennis dip, and I have a position of $20 with a potential profit of $120.**\n\nA few points later and a lot of adrenaline, and it happens. I am thrilled.\n\nMy player makes a comeback, FUCK YEEAH, I scream!\n\nHe gets back in the game and for the next hour or so ups his game significantly, just as I had hoped. **The match is a complete thriller filled with adrenaline and unbelievable tennis**. I am loving it.\n\nI am so happy for him and at the same time, **I am thinking about my tennis tendies.**\n\nThe game reaches a point from near defeat, to perfect equilibrium in score from the two players.\n\nI log back in to the betting platform to look at how the odds are fairing now.\n\nThe **$10** bet I had made early in the game was now worth **$17.40**\n\nThe **$10** bet I had made later in the game was now worth **$31.31**\n\nI now had the option to cash out nearly at 150% return, get out and enjoy the game and root for my player, **or diamond hand this bitch and root for my player still**.\n\nI choose the latter as the $20 was insignificant to me, and think to my learnings that **I will pass the fuck out before I tap out.**\n\nA few exhilarating points ensue, but it turns out my player had become exhausted. The rest of the game progresses and it's clear that he will lose. He cannot keep up the brilliant come back that had taken place thus far.\n\nI go back into the betting platform and noticed that:\n\nThe **$10** bet I had made early in the game was now worth **$0.35**\n\nThe **$10** bet I had made later in the game was now worth **$0.14**\n\nNot only was my favourite player about to lose, but **my contracts would expire worthless.**\n\nAnd lose he did.\n\nIt was an incredible match and he won the hearts of many fans that night. He is an unbelievable player with so much promise as he is still very young.\n\nThe tennis they played was just fantastic.\n\n\\---\n\nThe whole experience left me thinking to myself that the emotions, the mechanics, the complete and utter unpredictability where identical with options trading.\n\nIt was then that it **really** hit me that the term \"investing\", or \"trading\" platforms is the fakest front for what is actually absolute gambling.\n\n I can't help but feel a bit dirty that I took something I am passionate for, something I've kept pure for so many years, a pure love for the sport and put inside emotions and mechanics of greed and opportunism. That's the definition of the ugly side of capitalism and I got the taste of it first hand last night.\n\nI have deleted my betting account and will never engage in sports betting again after this. **The rooting and cheering I had for this player in previous matches VS this one felt self-less and pure, whereas last night I found myself rooting on the fact that I'd make money. This left me feeling pretty shitty with myself.**\n\nI thought I would share this story with all of you retards, hoping that you will learn something and relate on a level which will benefit you in life.\n\n\\---\n\n**tl;dr**\n\n1) Some things are best kept pure and outside the scope of making money.\n\n2) Options are not financial derivatives, they are **gambling** derivatives.\n\n3) Gambling can exist in every single aspect of life, and it can really consume you and your passions.\n\n4) TIM APPLE 122C 11/20, LET'S FUCKING GO YOU ABSOLUTE FUCKS.",

I don\u2019t know that you can bet on tripling your investment, but I feel safe assuming that it\u2019ll grow considerably given that many people\u2019s current cost basis is based on the fire sale that the COVID recession brought at the beginning. And really the market is doing so bad right now because COVID cases are rising because it\u2019s winter, but once it starts to heat up and COVID cases aren\u2019t spiking the way they currently are I\u2019m sure the market will regain some territory - or at least not be pinned down the way it currently is. And it seems like his assessment was generally a response to the conventional advice that you can guarantee returns by investing in an index fund that follows the S&amp;P 500 or investing in the big tech companies (and there is definitely a concern that they could be harmed by anti-trust suits). But I think it depends on what you\u2019re investing in. Like if you\u2019re in airlines they\u2019re directly affected, probably more than any other industry, by COVID restrictions. Their earnings have been shit because of it and once people aren\u2019t afraid to travel I just don\u2019t see how their earnings and then share value don\u2019t go up. If you wanted to hedge against the sort of losses he talks about I would probably sell once they start announcing vaccines coming out because I\u2019d be surprised if the market didn\u2019t drive prices up with their optimism that that means everything is going back to normal. On top of that, when he says that the market in 2012 still wasn\u2019t above its 2000 peak it\u2019s a bit disingenuous because when you look at the S&amp;P over the past 20 years he\u2019s right, but 2000 was a peak (at about 1491), then after a dip, the market went to a high of about 1535 in 2007, then the market crashed in 08 and started recovering and he just picked an arbitrary point in that recovery that proved his point but which became irrelevant the very next year, in 2013, when the market DID exceed 2000 levels and then boomed over the next 7 years to more than double what it was in 2000 or 2006. \n\nRegarding what he said about big tech companies, yeah I would probably stay out of tech. Those companies already have such a high share price that I\u2019ve always been skeptical of jumping in anyway. He also says globalization is in retreat, and I think that\u2019s a bit of a hasty conclusion. I think we\u2019re definitely at a crossroads where we\u2019re trying to determine if we\u2019re going to dive headfirst into a more globalist orientation or retreat and be more isolationist, but I\u2019m skeptical that in the longer term we aren\u2019t going to be more globalist in orientation. But I do think we\u2019re in for a bit of identity seeking as it pertains to whether we\u2019re going to be more globalist or isolationist, because if you recall TPP had pretty steep opposition on both sides of the aisle - but not so much that Obama wasn\u2019t willing to pursue it. And I think the luster of isolationism has probably been tarnished a bit by Trump. Though globalism is really one of those things, just like anti-racism and shit like that, where this election seems to sort of serve as a referendum on it. Trump is certainly not a fan of globalism, but Biden seems at least more globally oriented and has at least in some cases shown an inclination towards reviving Obama-era policies that Trump dismantled because Biden was part of the Obama era so his legacy is sorta tied up in that as well, and one of those policies was TPP. As far as workers demanding a fairer split of capitalism, that\u2019s fair. I do anticipate things like wage hikes, but that could also result in people spending more because they have more (i.e. Keynesianism). I also think it\u2019s a fair point about the aging demographics thing. It makes sense that boomers would want to divest themselves of riskier stocks and people just haven\u2019t been having kids as much as they used to, so the working-age population is surely going to feel that bite at some point (though I\u2019m not sure when). However, the US has long been an exception to the rule of shitty population growth rates in the west. In general, we don\u2019t have a ton of kids, but where we have historically differed is that we attract a lot of immigrants so our population grows that way - and Biden has already stated that he\u2019s going to be reversing some of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",

        "selftext": "Hi, fairly seasoned investor here. I've done fairly well this year (up roughly 55% YTD and actively managing my portfolio daily). Honestly, I'm a bit bewildered by all the love for tech that still exists here. To me, it's pretty obvious that from here on out, the next 40-50% gains will come from the recovery stocks, not tech. \n\nWhat do I mean by recovery stocks? Retail, commercial real estate, airlines, casinos, cruise lines, financials.\n\nWhy? Allow me to borrow a couple minutes of your time.\n\n**Vaccine vaccine vaccine.** There is a widespread belief, which I agree with, that we will not have an approved vaccine available for the public to use until early next year. However, that is a dumb reason to not buy recovery stocks. The question you should be asking is: will we know that one of the many vaccines that are out there is effective and safe by the end of this year? Once we have a vaccine candidate that we know is effective and is safe, then the game is over. It does not matter if that vaccine won't be approved for a few weeks after, or won't be available for widespread use for a few months. The market looks forward. Once it becomes clear that a vaccine is ready and is coming sometime within the next 6 months, the recovery stocks will boom. \n\nSo, when will we know? Pfizer has said that they should know by the end of October whether a vaccine is effective, and will release some data around then. If their Phase 3 data is positive, then I expect a huge rally in the recovery stocks. I expect their phase 3 data to be positive, given the positive phase 1/2 data, the cloaked positive comments in the press by Pfizer execs, and my belief in mRNA's potential.\n\n**Ok well even if we get a vaccine approved we don't know if people will even take it, right?**. Of course they will. Sure, there will likely be only a small cohort of brave souls initially who take it, but once they take it and find it effective and low on side effects, they will tell their circle of friends/family, some of whom will then take it themselves, and then tell their circle, etc. etc. People want someone else to be one of the first to take it, but like with many things, once they hear it recommended from their friends who took it, they will themselves take it. Also, let's not forget that we won't need 100% vaccination rate for things to get back to mostly normal, and a lot of activities that were previously restricted (like international travel) will likely be available again only to vaccinated folks, which will further boost vaccination rates and create a self-reinforcing cycle.\n\n**Ok but things will never fully return back to the way things were, right?** Probably not 100%, but I think 80%, yes, and much more quickly than you think. There is so much fearful talk of remote work being the way forward, and that no one wants offices anymore, and why would you ever travel for business again. I think this is all blown WAY out of proportion. For God's sakes guys, this is the way we've been doing things for many decades. People's habits won't just change on a dime like that because of a 9-12 month situation that is temporary. People will still want to see each other face to face, people will still go to offices, etc. I mean, I work remotely for my job, and it sucks. Meetings are confusing, I find myself procrastinating and not being nearly as efficient/productive as I was when I was in an office, team cohesion is down. Many employers do not like remote work because productivity is decreased significantly, and it's employers who will set the policy. Now, sure, maybe we have more remote work than we did before. Maybe it's an option for some people, maybe you work 1-2 days remotely per week or something, fine. But I don't think this justifies a 300-600% run up in some of these work from home stocks, and I expect to see those absolutely crater once we have a vaccine.\n\n**Ok, but the stock prices of these recovery stocks won't return to normal for quite a while, right?** Not only will they, but they'll surpass their previous pre-covid levels. Why? The Fed, and short covering. The Fed has inflated the prices of all the 'hot' stocks. PTON, ZM, FSLY, etc. all have had huge run ups because tech was hot, and people had a lot of money to invest. Once the recovery stocks are hot, they will be inflated too. The Fed has committed to keeping rates low for at least another couple years (due to wanting inflation pegged at 2%), so rates will be low even after we have a vaccine. Short interest in some of the recovery names are also quite high, so short covering will drive these stocks even higher than you'd expect.\n\n**Ok, but, a second wave is coming, right?** Probably, but a second wave at this point should mean nothing to recovery stocks. It's all about the vaccine. If a vaccine is shown to be effective in November, but we get hit with a second wave in December, who cares? Yes maybe these companies will have 1-2 months of pain, but again, the market looks way forward, and once you have a vaccine, the light at the end of the tunnel will be blaring, and you'll ignore the bumps on the way.\n\n**Ok, so why not just buy the recovery stocks when/if they come out with positive data?** Yeah, you could I guess, if you're a very risk averse investor or not totally convinced. However, I would not be surprised to see some of the more hard hit recovery stocks up by 15-20% after positive vaccine data (for example, ALK was \\~$65 pre-covid, but is now at \\~$38. If a vaccine is shown to be effective tomorrow let's say, I don't think it'd be unreasonable to see that stock shoot up to $44 pre-market). Even then I'd still expect more upside though, so I'd be a buyer there. However, I'd personally prefer to cash in on those 15-20% gains as well as the future upside, which is why I'm a buyer here.\n\n**Ok, well, what are the risks?** The risks are mainly around a covid vaccine not being effective or being unsafe. If that happens, then recovery stocks will take a serious beating. You also may see some short term pain if covid cases jump before vaccine data is released, as some folks/algos in the market take that as meaning 'sell recovery, buy tech'. Also, make sure you buy companies with very strong balance sheets, as if there are any unexpected bumps in the road with a vaccine, you don't want to be stuck with a company you're worried about going bankrupt.\n\n**I would really really appreciate feedback on this.** I'm investing a lot of money in these stocks, and am by no means blind to the risks. I would really love hearing from everyone here about the things I missed or am not considering. If you have something I'm missing, and can potentially save me many many thousands of dollars, please please take a few minutes and just share that comment here. Thanks for your time reading this!",

But now, almost every carmaker has announced significant electric-vehicle ambitions for the coming decade.\n\nMake no mistake: Without Tesla, this wouldn't be happening. We'd still be asking the circa 2006 question, \"Who killed the electric car?\" if Tesla hadn't reset the EV race in the years before the financial crisis, narrowly avoided bankruptcy, and positioned itself to deliver half a million vehicles in 2021 (and gift investors with a 9,200% return).\n\nNow, the global EV market is poised to grow, especially in China, where auto sales are already millions more annually than in the US, with the potential to top out at twice what the US sees every year, around 16-17 million new cars, trucks, and SUVs.

        "selftext": "Just a quick estimate: the last two console cycles GME's market cap was 9.7bn and 6.6bn. If we go with a conservative 3bn target with 65m shares outstanding that would be a 46$ price target. 2019 revenue was 6bn already. Now take into the account the bubbly nature of today's account and the fact that Tesla's 2019 revenue was just 4x of Gamestop's (yes, that's right, 24bn vs 6bn) we have a pretty (realistically) optimistic thesis\n\nNow, I would argue that this console cycle could be even better for the company than any of the last two: \n\n* New management trying to turn the company around + Ryan Cohen who turned *dog food company* into a multibillion business\n* Gaming is going to only increase in popularity\n* Despite bearish arguments, GameStop actively tries to get into digital. Part of everything a person spends digitally on an xbox sold at GameStop goes to the company. I think that is a huge additional revenue stream.\n* CDs are declining only in a percentage of total sales compared to digital, but absolute numbers are not decreasing. I saw a data on that somewhere but am too lazy now to search for it so treat it as my personal opinion\n* (if you like crayons) GME formed two perfect cup&amp;handle patterns: on 1month and 1hr charts\n* If that was not enough there might be countless wildcard events: Sony sharing digital revenue (not that much of a stretch), any other partnership with major gaming entities, share buybacks (was in the past so not off the table), some new investors, or any of the ideas they come up to let GameStop live and prosper\n\n\nNow if we speculate that GameStop's market cap would only be 9bn (was one cycle ago) we have a share price of 138$ per share.\n\nThe short squeeze is just a cherry on top of that, propelling the price up faster and higher. But we can also play that. The new short interest data comes out on Oct 26th, so we'll have a more clear picture of what is happening on the short side.

        "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Puts on ZM, TSLA\n\nYou probably have heard the phrase or even shit posted it yourself: \"It's priced in\". Usually, it's used to easily dismiss someone else's well-crafted DD, however today let's use it to actually do something useful with it. Let's find out, how much growth is priced in in the current price of Zoom and Tesla. As a comparison I also included Microsoft and P&amp;G.\n\nNow follows the detailed description of how I calculated that. If you are only interested in the results, scroll to the bottom.\n\nHow would you even calculate something like that? I will do it with the so-called [Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow). The intuition behind it is that by buying stock you essentially lose out on the returns the cash you used to buy the stock could yield somewhere else, like if you invested it in bonds or an S&amp;P 500 ETF (or of course in FDs, whatever floats your boat). So, this model takes this into account by treating the cash you pay today (or more accurately, its current market cap) as a discounted cash flow of the future returns.\n\nTo be able to use this model, we need to make several assumptions. First, we need to decide on a time-frame in which we expected the company to completely earn its current valuation. I will use 10 years here as a very generous value.\n\nSecond, we need to decide what the cash flow actually will be. For this very simplified application of the DCF model I used the Net Income of the last quarter. I will call this N. In the end we want to have a growth rate as a result which tells us how much the quarterly earnings will need to increase every quarter to earn its entire valuation in the given time-frame. I will call this q.\n\nTo account for the equity a company already has, its current equity E must also be included in its future returns. Again, as a very generous estimation, I will assume that the equity will appreciate like the average returns of the S&amp;P 500 in the last 10 years which is 16.3%.\n\nFinally we need wee need the discounted cash value. This is the current market cap M of the company. We also need to decide on an interest rate to discount M. Again, very generously, instead of assuming that M should also be assumed to have the average S&amp;P 500 returns, we will instead only use the much lower, essentially risk-free returns of the 10Y US bonds, which currently is 0.75%.\n\nTo summarize, we made the following assumptions:\n\n* Time frame of 10 years\n* Equity E appreciates by average S&amp;P 500 returns of 16.3% every year\n* Cash flow is given by the net quarterly income N\n* Current market cap M is discounted by 10Y US bond yield, which is 0.75%\n\nNow, we can formulate the following equation that puts the expected growth of N into relation with the other variables:\n\n    E * 1.163^10 + N * (q^(4 * 10) - 1) / (q - 1) = M * 1.0075^10\n\n(Equity in 10 years plus quarterly earnings of the next 10 years that grow by q every quarter must equal discounted market cap )\n\nNow we only need to select a company and solve the equation for q. This can be done by using approximation methods like Newton's method, or just plug it into Wolfram Alpha.\n\nAs mentioned in the title, let's first start with Zoom and Tesla. All values are in Million USD:\n\n##Zoom:\n\n    E = 1198.81\n    N = 185.99\n    M = 160400\n\nThis gives us q = 1.12575 as a result. So, for Zoom, its current market cap has a yearly growth of q^4 - 1 = 60.61% priced in *for every year in the next 10 years*. Note that this already includes the Q2 earnings which were almost 7 times higher than Q1 earnings.\n\n##Tesla:\n\n    E = 9855\n    N = 11202\n    M = 1658500\n\nThis results in q = 1.17685. So, for Tesla, its current market cap has a even larger yearly growth of q^4 - 1 = 91.82% priced in *for every year in the next 10 years*.\n\n##Microsoft and P&amp;G:\n\nFor comparison, let's also calculate this for less meme-y stocks. I chose Microsoft and P&amp;G, let me know if you want to know the results for other stocks.\n\nMicrosoft:\n\n    E = 118304\n    N = 11202\n    M = 1658500\n    =&gt; q = 1.04679\n    =&gt; q^4 - 1 = 20.07%\n\nP&amp;G:\n\n    E = 46521\n    N = 2800\n    M = 358600\n    =&gt; q = 1.02179\n    =&gt; q^4 - 1 = 9.01%\n\n\nDisclaimer: This is a very simplified calculation which makes many assumptions: We only look at a companies net income of the last quarter, its current equity and its market cap, nothing else. Also, this looks at a rather large time-frame of 10 years, so is not that useful for short-term stock price predictions.\n\nTo summarize: By using the DCF model we can calculate that Zoom and Tesla have priced in into their current market cap outrageously high growth rates already for the next 10 years. Around 60% and 90%, respectively.\n\nPositions: [ZM](https://i.imgur.com/Rae9FzS.png), [TSLA](https://i.imgur.com/ybVcZ1M.png)",

As awesome as their team has proven over the years, there\u2019s no way they could meet the market\u2019s expectations anytime this decade.\n\n[NIO](https://www.bing.com/search?q=nio%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=nio%20stock&amp;sc=7-9&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=BA8D2A8B783F46319BE31B9956890EC8) is a Chinese electric car company. Note Chinese consumers are mostly poor and overwhelmingly prefer small personal transportation like scooters, motorbikes, ebikes. They have been losing money but that doesn\u2019t stop their price from rising over 1,200% in the past year.\n\n[Nikola](https://www.bing.com/search?q=nikola+stock&amp;qs=LS&amp;pq=nikola+stock&amp;sc=6-12&amp;cvid=DC098EE074A6496FACCDC7B02BFDCE2E&amp;FORM=QBRE&amp;sp=1) is trading below its IPO price being more and more revealed as a scam. They claim to have designed their own working truck, but all they have is CGI mockups and a faked video where they rolled the truck down the hill. Engineers have debunked a lot of the claims their founder Trevor Milton made, but in short he claims his stuff does literally double of everything Tesla does in spite having no product or design team or history of the long process of creating that. Plus Trevor Milton resigned in the face of lawsuits and investigations pending. And in spite Nikola itself saying they were \u201chighly dependent on their founder\u201d Trevor Milton, they are still on Robinhood\u2019s **100 Most Popular list!**\n\n[Arcimoto](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Arcimoto%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=arcimoto%20stock&amp;sc=6-14&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=8AB657D7B3D54A39BCE0C00777388A79) is a small company with 95 employees that makes small electric utility vehicles. They\u2019ve only been selling cars for a year, they\u2019re losing money, but they still have a market cap of 195 million.\n\n[Aryo](https://www.bing.com/search?q=ayro%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=ayro%20stock&amp;sc=6-10&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=C1CACD62DB384890B47989F02C5D2698) is an engineering sub-contractor specializing in EV. They have six employees, a revenue of zero the last two years, and a market cap of 68 million.\n\nThe trend extends to related industries, with nickel and lithium stocks rising alongside anticipation of contracts from EV companies (with disappointingly meager results). And consider that as large a market cap these companies have, they also compete with older motor companies that are making their own EV and hybrid vehicles. On the wind and solar side, they have seen similar growth over the same time period, which is even more telling.\n\n[SolarEdge](https://www.bing.com/search?q=SolarEdge%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=solaredge%20stock&amp;sc=7-15&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=881BEB5EA020452D8737355C25F7693B), an Israeli innovation company, has risen over 200% in the last year and has a PE of 74.\n\n[Vivent Solar](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Vivent%20Solar%20%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=vivent%20solar%20stock&amp;sc=6-18&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=EF6DB7BE434F4EFB9F3542386CA62018) has risen over 550% in a year, have under three thousand employees, are going into big debt with their investment, and have a market cap of 5.29 billion.\n\n[Vestas Wind Systems](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Vestas%20Wind%20Systems%20%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=vestas%20wind%20systems%20stock&amp;sc=7-25&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=D635DB0D4724467F9663C497DBAFF96B) has risen by 118% over the last year, has a PE of 57, a market cap of 32 billion, and only 25,541 employees.\n\nNote these are *utilities companies*, that have years long installation and maintenance contracts with cities who go into decades of debt to install these services. To show how slow the industry moves, my hometown still has a working coal power plant that was built in the late 1920\u2019s. Sure there\u2019s new windfarms being built, but this stuff was built to last and it costs a fraction as much to overhaul old stuff than buy new. Ergo the old stuff goes offline slowly, and new investments are made.\n\nThis means the rise of the wind and solar industry is **solely due to** **investor sentiment**, not the growth of the industry itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen science itself comes in.\n\nIn strictly performance and economic terms, gas is fundamentally better than renewables. [The main issue](https://youtu.be/Hatav_Rdnno) comes down to energy storage: A gallon of gas contains 13 times more energy by volume than the best lithium ion batteries Tesla has to offer. That same gas has 50 times more energy by weight than lithium ion batteries. Plus, gasoline just goes into a tank and sits there, while batteries are broken into many cells with connective wires and packaging that aren\u2019t space or weight efficient. Tackling this problem has been Tesla\u2019s greatest hurdle, as they\u2019ve had issue with [new batteries randomly exploding.](https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/a28687473/tesla-model-3-explosion/)\n\nOn top of that, electric motors offer a lot less horsepower for a given weight than a gas motor, along with a much lower top speed. Electric motors do offer instant torque, less maintenance requirements, and don\u2019t need to idle, but that means little to the average consumer. Altogether with current tech an EV user would be limited in the range, weight, and speed he can move things. Where I live I don\u2019t even have the garage to charge an EV in nor are there charging stations anywhere within 80 miles, and many people live likewise.\n\nThis is also why you don\u2019t see many electric airplanes. The range, speed, and payload are extremely limited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, you say \u201cBut the science is moving forward, and we\u2019re investing it that.\u201d Two problems:\n\nGas motor tech is also advancing as companies find ways to improve efficiency and reduce emissions. Of course they are, because not only is it a very good thing to do\u2026 It is a very Profitable thing to do. And why are we complaining when they raise efficiency on the type of vehicle that +95% of people drive?\n\nNext problem is that scientific progress is measured in decades and generations, not months and years. For instance, [projections](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/weve-long-waited-for-fusion-this-reactor-may-finally-deliver-it-fast/ar-BB19A6Xq) have put us 20 years away from fusion power\u2026 ever since the 1960\u2019s. Much progress has been made, like using giant magnets to force atoms together or complex math to compensate for instability issues, but they still only making marginal improvements when the problem is no one can make self-sustaining fusion. Fusion requires isotopes of hydrogen, the lightest gas in existence. Fusion requires ludicrously high temperatures and/or pressures to work. Fusion creates a nuclear flash. None of the above cooperate with each other at all.\n\nIn the case of solar panels, each decade has seen measurable improvement, but the base issues that were there over a century ago when it was just a laboratory novelty still exist. Namely, finite energy from sunlight even if they were 100% efficient (they aren\u2019t), and the fact each panel is a significant investment. Current research revolves around solving [mystery wear and tear](https://phys.org/news/2019-06-solar-cell-defect-mystery-decades.html) that makes panels lose productivity and also making the panels self-cooling so they don\u2019t lose efficiency at high temperatures. But still, the up-front costs are debilitating by any measure.\n\nSo not only has the market priced in a revolution in the car industry, it has priced in major revolutionary advances in science that can\u2019t happen anytime soon. I can\u2019t predict the future, maybe in 50 years new energy storage devises will hit the market using a currently unknown caveat of quantum physics.\n\nBut current scientific research reflects what will hit the market in 10-30 years. I mean it, even in military projects it takes that long for something to go from a concept to a weapon. Case in point, according to Ben Rich from Lockheed\u2019s Skunk Works, the experimental concepts of radar absorbing paint and a radar resistant shape of aircraft were known back in the 1960\u2019s. His book detailed some of the immense list of tricky technical issues involved in making an actual stealth plane, however.\n\nWhat generates this bubble? Look at 5 year charts of these stocks and you\u2019ll see the pattern. The started going up last winter, dipped with the Coronavirus crash, and then immediately soared. I ask Why?\n\n1. [Essentials.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/16/focus-on-essential-companies-that-can-get-through-to-the-other-side-jim-cramer-says.html) Institutional investors are looking for high growth stocks safe from Covid induced bankruptcy.\n\n2. [Autists.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/08/17/robinhood-valuation-soars-to-112-billion-with-new-funding-and-record-growth/#282f7699663d) Discount brokers, from Webull to TastyTrade to ThinkorSwim to Interactive Brokers, all have grown a lot, especially in the last year with quarantined and bored people looking for a way to make some money. Even r/wallstreetbets have seen their membership rise significantly over this period. Nothing wrong with that, but what do all these inexperienced investors consider good growth positions in ethical industries? That\u2019s right, tech stocks and renewables, and the average number of stocks held is two per account. In some circles I follow, I\u2019ve had to explain that day to day changes in the market price does not always reflect the business itself. And I\u2019ve literally seen this question: \u201cWhich should I invest in, Tesla or Apple?\u201d (FACEPALM)\n\n3. [Hedge Funds.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-fund-darlings-vs-tesla-204030211.html) These guys seek out high risk high reward schemes, and it is known that several capitalized in Tesla\u2019s meteoric rise and were among the first to bug out. While it varies wildly how these guys make money, the high volumes surrounding the \u201cmeme stocks\u201d would present them with many opportunities.\n\n4. [Venture capitalists.](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-is-a-billionaire-who-doesnt-care-about-money-2020-5) Rich people are no different, and several corporate heads in renewables said they were more concerned about science than making money. Nothing wrong with that, but you see where the market has gone with this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut not all hope is lost for those of you who want to invest in renewables; Nuclear energy is seriously undervalued! Again, this is due to public perception effecting investments, and not the science itself. Progress continued to be made in the science even after Chernobyl caused the total halt of reactor construction, and now as old reactors start going offline and new reactors are cheaper, safer, and come in conveniently smaller packages they look more tempting than ever.\n\nNamely, Microsoft and General Electric are partnering to make [NuScale](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200828005299/en/NuScale-Power-History-Small-Modular-Reactor-Receive), a small modular nuclear reactor that can be produced in bulk, shipped as one piece on a semi, installed into bunkers with a crane, and integrated with as many other reactors as you want. The streamlined process brings costs down, and the small size allows for small remote installations to cut their overhead power costs to near zero. So far, only the Pentagon is buying, but it is also just passed a rigorous certification process last week.\n\nAlso, [thorium nuclear reactors](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/could-thorium-revive-the-nuclear-energy-industry-1029624977) are becoming a thing. These are a lot less energy efficient, but physically can\u2019t break down in a lot of the ways uranium plants have historically (I.E. coolant leaks). Technical hurdles remain, but this has been in the works since the 1980\u2019s and only slowly has it been getting attention.\n\nAnd yes, nuclear is definitely a great option. From the perspective of energy density, kw per dollar, initial installation costs, and manning costs nukes lead all others by a ridiculously large margin. In fact, one of the biggest costs are actually the extreme safety and security requirements. And used parts have to be disposed of in lead containers and buried deep in a remote desert.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my autist opinion, I give an emphatic sell recommendation to the whole renewable industry.\n\nDo I recommend dropping everything and going into nuclear? No, I\u2019m saying the damage is done with this human error. Someone has already bought at the top, and when the selling starts someone will lose money. This doesn\u2019t mean renewables are doomed, either. Recall that Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon all weathered the Dot Com Bubble, because the bottom line is the stock market DOES NOT REFLECT THE ECONOMY, it reflects investor confidence.",

        "selftext": "Tuesday is the day. After many months of investor buildup, Apple is finally about to unveil the first generation of 5G iPhones, which likely will be called iPhone 12.\n\nThe details have been widely leaked. Apple \ufffc (ticker: AAPL) is expected to unveil four models. Here\u2019s how Raymond James analyst Chris Caso laid it out in a research note last month:\n\n\u2022 iPhone 12, with a 5.4-inch screen, priced at $699\n\n\u2022 iPhone 12 Max, with a 6.1-inch screen, priced at $799\n\n\u2022 iPhone 12 Pro, also with a 6.1-inch screen, plus higher end cameras, priced at $999\n\n\u2022 iPhone 12 Pro Max, with a 6.6-inch screen, priced at $1,099\n\nThere is also some speculation about new Apple-branded over-the-ear headphones called AirPods Studio, and perhaps a new product for tracking things with Bluetooth called AirTags. But there\u2019s no question that this event is all about the iPhone, and the expectations are sky high.\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives writes this morning that this will be the most important Apple iPhone product cycle since the iPhone 6 in 2014. That time, Apple finally moved beyond 4-inch displays\u2014the iPhone 6 was 4.7 inches and the beloved iPhone 6s a whopping 5.5 inches.\n\nAll of the new phones will run on 5G networks. (No coincidence that the tag line for the event is \u201cHi, Speed.\u201d) Ives notes that the Pro versions are expected to have Lidar sensor technology, useful for augmented reality applications, as well as enhanced rear-camera technology. Ives expects preorders to kick off in a few weeks, with two of the models shipping later this month and the other two in mid-to-late November.\n\nIves says the U.S. version of the phones will be capable of accessing speedy millimeter wave version of 5G, which he thinks \u201ccould be a game changer looking ahead as more infrastructure, technology and apps are built around this transformational 5G highway over the coming years.\u201d\n\nIves is particular bullish on the prospect for the new phones in China\u2014he thinks the country will account for 20% of upgrades over the coming year.\n\n\u201cWith 5G now in the cards and roughly 40% of [the]...iPhone installed base not upgrading their phones in the last 3.5 years, [Apple CEO Tim] Cook &amp; Co. have the stage set for a supercycle 5G product release, which should drive shares further,\u201d he writes. \u201cAlthough the soft macro and Covid backdrop will clearly dent some demand, we believe the underlying growth drivers for iPhone 12 success are unparalleled for Cupertino.\u201d\n\nIves maintains his Outperform rating and $150 price target.\n\nMeanwhile, RBC Capital analyst Robert Muller on Monday repeated his Outperform rating, while lifting his price target on Apple stock to $132 from $111. Muller writes that he thinks the new iPhone lineup will \u201ckick off a significant replacement cycle which we believe will be a multiyear process as new applications and spectrum become available over time.\u201d\n\nMuller is also bullish about Apple\u2019s push into the fitness category with the pending launch of the Fitness+ service. \u201cWe view Apple\u2019s upcoming Fitness+ offering as a worthwhile competitor within the Health and Wellness category, and expect the service will benefit from pandemic-related at-home spending trends,\u201d he writes. \u201cIn addition to meaningful revenue/EPS contribution, we expect notable synergy opportunities across Watch/TV/iPad/Services and view the offering as one more way that Apple can drive customer loyalty and, importantly, repeat purchases.\u201d\n\nAssuming a 20% adoption rate by Apple Watch customers, Muller estimates that Fitness+ could generate $3 billion in annual revenue by 2022. \u201cOur revenue estimates are stand-alone for Fitness+; however, Apple Watch is a requirement and unit sales could benefit from interest in Fitness+,\u201d he writes.  \u201cIn total, we view Fitness+ as an ideal candidate to drive additional Apple-related spend and, importantly, keep customers more engaged and immersed within the Apple ecosystem, which should drive future iPhone sales.\u201d\n\nSource: Barron's",

        "selftext": " **What is Happening?**\n\nActivist investor Dan Loeb is urging Disney to permanently suspend its dividend and use the funds to fuel growth at its streaming service, Disney+. Disney stock traded up 1.64% Wednesday. Loeb's Third Point owns less than 1% of Disney.\u00a0\n\n*Activist investors acquire stakes in companies with the intent to bring operational change. Warren Buffett started out as an activist investor.*\u00a0\n\n**Why does this Matter?**\n\nDisney's stock is down 16% for the year as amusement parks are still slow to reopen due to\u00a0restrictions. Also, last week Disney announced that it was laying off 28,000 workers, wiping out about a quarter of its U.S. theme-park workforce.\u00a0  \n\n\nRight now the company's only bright spot is Disney+. It\u00a0attracted more than 60 million subscribers and even won praise from the likes of Netflix CEO Reed Hastings.\u00a0  \n\n\nLoeb would like to use the $3 billion Disney dividend to double Disney+'s budget for original content, bring in additional subscribers, lower churn, and boost pricing power. He would also like to see Disney combine Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu, and Star into one powerhouse streaming service. That way Disney could increase pricing and start releasing all movies on the platform, cutting out movie theaters completely.\u00a0  \n\n\n**The Takeaway:**   \nInitially, it might seem scary to take away that 1.43% dividend yield from shareholders; however, Loeb is not completely crazy. Dividends are just one way a company can choose to \"allocate capital/profits\". As Loeb correctly points out, times are changing in the entertainment sector and Disney should capitalize on that by redirecting dividends\u00a0to this high growth project.\u00a0In the long-run, such a capital allocation decision might just\u00a0reward shareholders a lot more than the 1.46% dividend.\u00a0",

The drop in shares on Monday wiped 28 billion euros ($33.1 billion) off SAP\u2019s market value.\n\nThe drop-off in SAP\u2019s cloud revenue is a sign that companies are putting off making major decisions about updating their software, as the pandemic continues to limit any global economic recovery.\n\nSAP said it expects limited growth and margin improvement over the next two years, and moved expectations to meet its 2023 strategy plan out to 2025. Klein said on a call Monday he expects a conservative recovery into the first half of next year.\n\nThe previous outlook \u201cassumed economies would reopen and population lockdowns would ease, leading to a gradually improving demand environment in the third and fourth quarters,\u201d SAP said in the statement. \u201cLockdowns have been recently re-introduced in some regions and demand recovery has been more muted than expected.\u201d\n\nThe pessimistic short-term outlook from SAP risked a knock-on effect on the European software industry, warned analysts at Citi. Europe\u2019s Stoxx Technology index fell as much as 6.3%, its biggest one-day loss since March.\n\nSAP now expects adjusted revenue of 27.2 billion euros to 27.8 billion euros ($32.2 billion to $32.9 billion) at constant currencies in 2020, lower than the earlier guidance of 27.8 billion euros to 28.5 billion euros. SAP also said it no longer sees a boost from business-travel related revenue this year in its Concur business.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to find positive news in the results, Nicholas David, an analyst at Oddo BHF said Monday. \u201cThe warning on the mid-term ambitions was expected/feared by the market but the new ambitions are lower than the most pessimistic expectations,\u201d he said in a note.\n\nQualtrics IPO\n\nSAP said it is in the advanced stages of a listing for its Qualtrics software unit. It announced the decision in July to list the U.S. unit less than two years after buying the company for a record sum, a surprise u-turn signaling a strategic shift under Klein.\n\n\u201cWe are well advanced in the preparations of the Qualtrics IPO\u201d, Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said on a call Monday. \u201cQualtrics has had a strong quarter which will set it up for further growth into next year.\u201d\n\nNew Outlook\n\nAdjusted cloud revenue is expected to be 8 billion euros to 8.2 billion euros in 2020, down from a previous estimate of 8.3 billion euros to 8.7 billion euros.Operating profit will be 8.1 billion euros to 8.5 billion euros this year, down from expectations of as much as 8.7 billion euros.SAP updated its mid-term ambition for total revenue to more than 36 billion euros in 2025 compared to its previous estimate of 35 billion euros in 2023.The company sees more than 22 billion euros in cloud revenue and over 11.5 billion euros in operating profit by 2025.\n\nThird Quarter\n\nThird quarter non-IFRS operating profit decreased by 12% year over year to 2.07 billion euros. That compared to the 2.15 billion-euro average estimate from analysts in a Bloomberg survey.Revenue in the period declined 4% to 6.54 billion euros compared to analysts\u2019 average 6.89 billion euro estimate.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/sap-cuts-2020-sales-outlook-203149264.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNhLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAF_TaMgWyjSVtobIX4GleBfpxopa9L9TJPKsfacBFTYWfKsmRwIYgoXWKTsN9zxuDnWxbFmAOO_C0MoqBPECjfaDupuibcHiddhhuFflrSnOonBcL_HNEvw4VBScDkIZLzNmq6o7D-LBpS3t8eU_C32-pyOY2zz9QVNvDCuoJ3hT",

        "selftext": "Alright retards and autists,\n\nAs the 5 of you that listened to me last time will know, I am a pilot flying freight for AAWW. \n\nFor the third time I am posting DD as I have done or commented every quarter, and for those of you that have listened, you are probably buying your 3rd or 4th yacht by now. So here I go again:\n\nSo the business model most airlines, passenger airlines, follow is they want you retards to pay for their gas and us retards to fly you etc by buying tickets, and use the business traveler and belly freight to make their razor thin profit margins. Since demand has fallen off a cliff by as much as 90%, and there is an increased demand for freight capacity, the belly freight capacity normally used by the passenger carriers has now gone to the freight carriers, as well as a significant increase in e-commerce. Add to that that Atlas (AAWW) and Kalitta(privately owned) have pretty much been the go to to lead the charge to bring masks and other PPE over from Asia in addition to regular contracts, its provided a large tailwind to the freight/ACMI industry. Freight capacity is currently in such demand that freight prices have increased 10x normal rates. One charter flight of cargo from China through to Cincinnati nets 1.1 million in profit for AAWW, in addition to regular routes for DHL contracts. If you look at Q1 last year where we were at -29 million, which is a historically poor quarter for us with the impacts from chinese new year, and the Q1 swing to +29 million this year, that illustrates some of the impact. Our most profitable quarters are Q3 and Q4, due to increased demand during the peak holiday season and run up to it. Add to this the fact that our inability to staff due to labor issues (which will be resolved this year) is now solved because of thousands of pilots out of work, there is going to be a growth boom. We expect to hire another 1000 to a total of 3000 by end of year 2021, putting us at the same size in terms of pilot group, as UPS. ATSG and more importantly AAWW also have government contracts for the military, DoS, etc that provide other revenue streams. In summation: a pandemic, moms stress shopping on Amazon, and Wars all provide massive tendies for this sector.\n\nThe Play:\n\nAs I have mentioned before in various comment threads, the way to make money on AAWW earnings is to ride the run up wave to the earnings. Despite massive beats, there is maybe a 10% pop on earnings and then a pull back before it starts to push back up again at a nice gingerly pace throughout the ensuing quarter.\n\nPositions:\n\nAAWW 70C 11/20\nAAWW 75C 11/20\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk.",

        "selftext": " Alright Autists,\n\nYou've been hearing a lot about Gamestop. It is MASSIVELY shorted. There are roughly [\\~70 million shares](http://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/GME.htm) that have to be bought sooner or later.\n\nThere aren't many opportunities like this where a company is turning around, entering a new console super cycle with a healthy balance sheet, gaming and tech visionaries leading the turn around, and negative sentiment prevailing for years. This created one of the greatest short bubbles I've seen in the market. Rumor has it that a few Wall Street firms are on the short end of this trade.\n\nPeople have already posted about [Ryan Cohen](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-price-chewy-investor-plans-amazon-rival-ecommerce-2020-9-1029612504), [Reggie Fils-Aime](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/09/reggie-fils-aime-gamestop/), [Microsoft](https://www.businessinsider.com/xbox-deal-with-gamestop-includes-revenue-share-on-digital-sales-2020-10)...I'm going to talk a little about Gamestop's E-commerce. E-commerce is very important as it will massively increase its total addressable market and help continue optimizing its dense retail structure (increasing profitability.)\n\nNow that Gamestop is turning into an e-commerce gaming power house (\"Chewy of Gaming\"), it's good to track their e-commerce metrics. Gamestop's total addressable market went from purely relying on brick-and-mortar to include everyone with internet. Their website is very nice now and they also recently [updated the app](https://twitter.com/Reggie/status/1311802247114678273)\n\n. Covid has changed consumer shopping behaviors and forced companies to up their e-commerce games, subsequently putting [consumer loyalty up for grabs](https://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/articles/building-customer-loyalty-in-the-post-covid-19-retail-environment/) (Gamestop already has [55+ million loyalty members!](http://news.gamestop.com/fact-sheet-0))\n\nLet's see what their e-commerce has been doing. Referring to the charts below (data excludes the app; it's only web and mobile web traffic):\n\n1. [Gamestop web traffic is skyrocketing](https://www.similarweb.com/website/gamestop.com/)  \n from August to September. What's really interesting is that its Category Ranking (a measure against its own competitors) went from 83 to 38! This could mean that Gamestop is capturing market share from its e-commerce competitors (Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Newegg, etc.)\n2. Organic search is improving (less ad costs and means people are searching for Gamestop directly)\n3. Social media referrals are increasing (Twitter and Reddit leading the way)\n4. [Google searches](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=gme%20stock)  \n for Gamestop's stock are at all time highs! (Bonus...not directly related to Gamestop's e-commerce)\n5. Another big one that not many people know about yet is that Gamestop is penetrating PC Gaming Hardware. That is a [$40 billion industry](https://wccftech.com/pc-gaming-hardware-market-to-grow-by-3-6-billion-in-2020-thanks-to-covid-19/)  \n and growing! The overall industry is growing at roughly 10% a year and entry-level gaming hardware is growing at over 20%! I believe Gamestop has the advantage of being a dominant player in that industry compared to Newegg, Best Buy, Amazon, etc. As a comparison, roughly half of [Best Buy's revenue](http://s2.q4cdn.com/785564492/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/Best-Buy-Fiscal-2020-Annual-Report.pdf) (pg. 26) comes from Computing and Mobile (\\~$20 billion.) Gamestop is getting ready to attack that industry hard and get its piece of the pie. This could be a very fast growing and lucrative category!\n\nI've attached a screenshot of interestings graphs and metrics, and you'll find references to articles in the hyperlinks above. Enjoy :)\n\nTL:DR Gamestop e-commerce is killing it.

        "selftext": " \n\nAT&amp;T is a company that I'm sure doesn't need explaining. It is familiar to all of us as a telecom company that has branched out to providing internet, entertainment (HBO Max being one of their more recent ventures), and more.\n\n**Why this is being posted now &amp; the potential:**\n\n* Q3 reporting is set for 22 October.\n* At its current price AT&amp;T is in a position to provide significant growth prospects alongside a safe, high-paying dividend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at it current chart (16 October for reference) we can clearly see here that the stock is trading at its lowest levels since Q1. This provides a great opportunity to buy quality company at much higher yields to lock in superior long-term returns. It is unlikely they will drop much lower than this point due to the effect downward pressure has on dividend paying companies. If we look at the older charts, when AT&amp;T has reached these lows the stock has a strong tendency to rally from this 27-28$ support area. Additionally AT&amp;T has a lot going for it, let's quickly take a look.\n\n**What AT&amp;T has going for it:**\n\n* It has increased its dividend payout for the last 36 years and has the means to continue to do so.\n* Consistent revenue growth.\n* Lots and lots of cash on hand.\n* They are a leader in the US for 5G.\n* They are working to replace old top management (This is particularly important).\n* Warner Media and HBO Max\n\nWarner Media and HBO Max may be points of controversy here. Let's look at it from this perspective. These get AT&amp;T into new markets, HBO in particular into the saturated streaming market. Netflix has dominated this particular sector, however Disney and AT&amp;T are cracking Netflix's business model by pulling back their streaming to their own platforms. This is the reason Netflix is creating so many of its own shows/movies and increasing it's subscription price. This pressure is allowing AT&amp;T to slowly claw its way in. (Very slowly though, obv HBO Max is no Disney Plus). Additionally this will be the first full quarter of HBO Max on the books for AT&amp;T, with 36 million new subscribers reported it is likely to have a positive effect on the report.\n\nThe safe dividend is a strong factor to remain bullish on AT&amp;T. Even with the disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, AT&amp;T's balance sheets show recurring profitability and consistent cash flow generation can easily cover the quarterly payouts.\n\n**Two big issues:**\n\n* A lot of long-term debt (At extremely low rates, so fortunately it doesn't impact their cash flow)\n* Terrible acquisitions over the last 10 years (Direct TV, which they are looking to sell)\n\nIt could be a good sign that AT&amp;T is finally looking to sell the underperforming Direct TV. Sure they bought it for $67 Billion and would likely sell for $20 Billion but off loading legacy segments can allow them to focus on growth and expand into markets that are actually relevant for today and tomorrow while being less of a drag on their current debt.\n\n**Final Comments:**\n\nPlease extend my DD by doing your own research on top of everything else you have read here, there were many points only briefly touched on.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read!",

Are fucking serious right now Bob Swan? AND you  \nwont bring a 10nm desktop CPU to market until Q2 2021 while it was already 4 years late?  \nYour last earnings call was a fucking joke bobby boy. You tried to play it off like it was  \nall under control. So you went begging to TSMC to let you eat the cum from their sloppy anal  \nseconds. They made fun of you bobby. They even admitted that you're not shit and they are \"rescuing\" you and they  \n\"will not place extra effort to handle the CPU giant's orders\" \\[4\\]. You're fucking nothing.  \nFrom \"CPU giant\" to this?  \nTSM personally has each engineers cock massaged by a Taiwanese fuck-toy every morning before work.  \nTSM has the backing of the american government \\[7\\]. Yeah, a TAIWANESE chip fab is being backed and NOT  \nYOU. What the fuck do you offer bobby? A place so toxic to work that you can;'t even  \nfind a space nice enough keep Jim Keller safe\\[5\\]? Go fuck yourself, AMD is already on 7nm \\[4\\] and Lisa Su  \nis have her raging cock injected with even more erection enhancers AS WE SPEAK YOU FUCKING PISS DRINKER.  \nKeep buying Intel stock bobby \\[8\\]. Buy another 8,000 shares at $50. Your terrible excuse for an earnings call sent the stock  \nall the way down to the $40s immediately loosing you money. And guess what? I bought put options  \nat 11:46 AM today. Right before the dip. I have already broke even. I'm going to make  \nmoney of you losing money because a complete idiot and I know more about this business than you. Its so  \nfucking obvious how fucked you are swanny. You might as well stop fabbing silicone wafers and  \nfab a silicone butt for you to fuck during the next earnings call as that would be infinitely more valuable  \nthan whatever you could possible have prepared. What are you going to do, delay AGAIN? Or maybe  \nyou can get another one of your marketing goons to tell everyone on the call how great AMD is \\[9\\].  \nBuy Intel PUTS now and gather round to watch it burn.  \n\n\nINTL 53.5 PUT  \nReferences:  \n\\[1\\] https://www.extremetech.com/computing/289157-tsmc-completes-5nm-node-design-node-in-risk-production  \n\\[2\\] https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/07/19/tsmc-3nm-risk-production-in-2021-paves-the-way-to-2020-mass-production  \n\\[3\\] https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-says-first-10nm-desktop-cpus-land-in-second-half-of-2021  \n\\[4\\] https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-tsmc-not-long-term/  \n\\[5\\] https://www.anandtech.com/show/15846/jim-keller-resigns-from-intel-effective-immediately  \n\\[6\\] https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2020/07/intels-chief-engineer-out-amid-manufacturing-crisis.html  \n\\[7\\] https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/09/taiwan-semiconductor-secures-government-aid-for-us.aspx  \n\\[8\\] https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hznvk1/intel\\_ceo\\_bob\\_swan\\_just\\_bought\\_8000\\_shares\\_at/  \n\\[9\\] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFHBgb9SY1Y&amp;ab\\_channel=GamersNexus",

        "selftext": "I live in a hillbilly ish suburb about an hour and a half outside Chicago.  I had to run to grocery store just now about 7pm on a Monday. The prime truck was at the end of my street as I walked out. I watched it leave the first stop, then onto the guy across from me, then to my Next door neighbor, and literally stood there watching him proceed to hit 5 more houses on my block. Then he turned and appeared to stop at another house on a separate block as I headed on my way. How the fuck is any company going to truly compete with amazon. Unless Walmart plus or anyone just opens a online warehouse for delivery in every region that operates similarly I don\u2019t see how anyone can compete with them. \n\nI work for a chain retail auto parts company in hodunkville.  Cant even tell you how many customers a day try to have us price match amazon or rock auto).  Amazon rapes us on everything and many many people  already has prime so if we have to order something for a customer what incentive does customer have to order from us and not get it for literally 1/4 of price in many cases.  Auto parts are something a lot of people don\u2019t realize amazon sells if they aren\u2019t a DIY person already. \n\nMy point is that amazon will take no fucking prisoners and literally wipe the floor with anyone who tried to out innovate them. It makes me honestly think about getting a management position with them in the factory about 30 min from me.

        "selftext": "# If you find this interesting please follow my account for more DD.\n\n# I'm also working on an Excel file which will provide all fundamental data about a stock, more info about that on my account. TLDR at bottom!\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWith the change and progressing to extremer climates, global warming is coming our way. It has been shown world governments are incapable of properly taking action against this threat. Since it seems like global warming won\u2019t be stopped, we will have to start adapting to the new extreme climates. One way of ensuring a comfortable living/working space in this grim future is by making use of HVAC (Heating Ventilation &amp; Air Conditioning). **And that\u2019s what got me thinking**. My family has been hell bent on **NOT** getting air-conditioning. But with the summer temperatures ever more frequently reaching +40c with a humidity of +70%(Hup Holland Hup) it\u2019s becoming unbearable. Sleepless nights, overheated pets, fainting, old people dying and just losing your will to live. These are all issues more people around the world are starting to face. Every place on earth is getting more extreme. Every place on earth is getting more need for Climate control. And every company is looking to profit of that! This is why my next play is in the HVAC industry. \n\n**Finding our compatible companies.** \n\nI only want to invest in the best companies. Living in The Netherlands I personally don\u2019t know the best brands, luckily, I\u2019ve got great internet. So, after spitting through some review sites these are the 5 public companies that came out best when looking for \u201cBest HVAC/Air-conditioning companies/brands\u201d. (Not ranked) \n\n1. Carrier (Day&amp;Night, Bryant, Toshiba &amp; 15 more)\n\n2. Trane (American Standard, Thermo King &amp; 7 more). \n\n3. Daikin (Goodman, Amana). \n\n4. Lennox (Service Experts, Allies Air Enterprises). \n\n5. Johnson Controls (Hitachi, York)\n\n**Understanding the HVAC market.**\n\nBefore we continue to further analyze the companies, we first need to understand the HVAC market.\n\nSome facts: \n\n1. The HVAC business has been valued at $91.30B in 2020 and is expected to reach $173B by 2024 and $367B by 2030. That\u2019s a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of +/-15%. \n\n2. The most popular countries for Air Conditioning (AC) per household are: Japan 91%, USA 90%, Korea 86%, Saudi Arabia 53%, China 60%. \n\n3. Global stock of AC is expected to grow to 5.6B by 2050, up from 1.6B in 2018. (This is 1 AC sold every second for the next 30 years).\n\n4. Less than a third of the global households own an AC.\n\n5. 8% of the 2.8B people living in the hottest parts of the world own an AC (Brazil, Indonesia, India, African countries).\n\n6. AC demand is increasing every year going from 97,60M in 2012, up 111M in 2018.\n\nAs can been seen in the above statements the HVAC business is very well integrated in some large countries. But the most exciting prospects are those of the developing countries. In Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and India only 16%, 16%, 9%, 6% and 5% respectively of the households have AC. This is a MASSIVE market just waiting to be exploited.\n\n\\- The Indian AC market stood at $4,3B in 2017 and is expected to surpass 11B by 2023, that\u2019s a CAGR of over 17%. This rising growth is led by rising infrastructure development, growing demand for housing and the constantly rising temperatures and consumers purchasing power.\n\n\\- The Middle Eastern and African market is expected to have an CAGR of 4,9% during 2019-2024.\n\n\\- The Indonesian market is currently experiencing a 2% CAGR in AC demand over 2012 till 2018.\n\n\\- The US is expected to have a CAGR of 3.1% from 2020 to 2030.\n\n\\- Europe is expected to have a CAGR of 6% from 2019 to 2025.\n\n\\- **The global HVAC market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 5.5% from 2018 till 2024**.\n\n**Market share.**\n\nThis was actually really really difficult to find free sources on and I can\u2019t really make a clear picture out of it so here are the numbers:\n\n\\- 2013 North America market: Carrier 17%, Daikin 15%, Trane 10%, Johnson 9%, Lennox 6%, LG 5%.\n\n\\- 2013 Global AC market: Daikin 13%, Carrier 10%, Johnson 8%, Trane/LG 4%.\n\n\\- 2018 Indian market share: LG 17,7%, Hitachi 7,9%, Daikin 7,4%.\n\n\\- HVAC Used by construction firms in USA: Carrier 29%, Lennox 17,3%, Daikin 8,2%, Trane7,3%, LG 1,8% Johnson 1,8%.\n\n\\- 2020 global \u201cWall-Mounted Fan Coil Units\u201d market: Daikin 29%, Trane 26%, Carrier 12%, Johnson 7,5%\n\nMy conclusion from this and other information found online is that globally Daikin is the biggest followed by Carrier, Johnson, Trane, LG and Lennox. I accounted for all known acquisitions since 2013 in the market share.\n\n**An introduction to the Companies**\n\n**Carrier**\n\nCarrier products and related services include HVAC and refrigeration systems, building controls and automation, fire and special hazard suppression systems and equipment, security monitoring and rapid response systems, provided to a diversified international customer base principally in the industrial, commercial and residential property and commercial transportation sectors.\n\nEmployees: 53,000+\n\nCountries active: 160+\n\nMarket Cap: 25,959B\n\n**Key points:**\n\n\\- 85% of sales are in the USA or Europe, they are however planning to expand globally.\n\n\\- 51% HVAC, 29% Fire and Security, 20% Refrigeration.\n\n\\- Since April 2020 carrier has split off from Raytheon Technologies, allowing them to focus fully on the HVACR market.\n\n\\- Carrier is planning on cutting 600million in costs by 2022 (4% of current COGS)\n\n\\- Carrier has recently launched its \u201cBlueEdge\u201d platform, providing aftermarket service to customers and minimizing machinery downtime &amp; costs.

Also, Johnson had some fuckery going on in all their 10k\u2019s so these numbers might not add up, let me know if you found something.\n\nLooking at the company\u2019s financials and numbers it\u2019s a tough decision to make, all companies a pretty close to each other. There are however some things that stand out:\n\n\\- Carrier has a significantly higher NPM then the competitors.\n\n\\- Lennox might be in financial trouble.\n\n\\- Daikin spends the most on R&amp;D relative to its revenue, I see this as a big plus.\n\n\\- Johnson their revenue is growing the fastest on a 5Y CAGR.\n\n\\- Johnson their P/E is much higher than the competition.\n\n\\- Johnson their Dividend is the higher % wise\n\n\\- Daikin has increased sales in 2020 while other companies have seen a drop.\n\n\\- Daikin\u2019s NPM is stable at around 8% while Carrier\u2019s NPM has grown explosively. \n\n\\- Trane has a high debt/equity ratio\n\n\\- Both Carrier and Daikin have a very strong Interest coverage ratio.\n\n\\- Johnson's TTM would be better without an irregular expense of 602M\n\nNow on to the less financial aspect of the data.\n\nI really like the way Daikin presents their annual report, they have clear strategies on how to better engage the Indian market. They are also showing that they know where their market growth protentional lays and are willing to act on it. Furthermore, what really strikes me as interesting is that Daikin produces materials for semiconductor testing, this might be a goldmine in the upcoming tech revolution and Daikin has shown to be well aware of this upcoming trend. Carrier on the other hand has not properly breached the Asian/Middle eastern market yet, they have stated to expand their geographical presence but I have found no conclusive strategies in how to do so. What is impressive about carrier is their high net profit margin and willingness to act on a more digital environment, an area where Daikin is currently lacking.\n\nTo conclude this research properly, if I had to choose a company right now, I\u2019d being going for Daikin. Their well-presented data and goals for emerging markets, combined with their semiconductor products make me believe they are most suited for rapid growth. Their geographical location also puts them in a better position for Asian dominance. And their Goodman sub brand is well known in America and a direct competitor to Carrier. Carrier is a close second, with impressive brand recognition and attractive financials. One thing carrier does well that Daikin does not is transport refrigeration. In my opinion trucking is going to play a much larger role when self-driving trucks start to appear.",

        "selftext": "It seems alot of people dont know much about this company.\n\nI am up $11,000 in this company in gains, and i do plan to sell half of my shares once NIO reaches $43.\n\nThen i will keep the other half of the shares in the comany for long term\n\nI purchased NIO 100 shares at $6.30 in Apiril 2020, right before the EV hype but sold them at $7.30.  Do so speculations on EV hype tanking.\nNIO has been only buy and hold this year.\n \nAfter Months of research and opinions, and later i drove a Tesla this year for the first time. I purchased a Tesla Cybertruck $100 pre order. I think Electric vehicles are truly the future and ICE companies are long behind the trend. Even though these ICE conpanies are moving to EV. Many dont have the Tech and customer likeness that Tesla has. ICE companies will struggle getting their loyal customers to switch to EV vehicles. While Tesla never needed that switch. In fact Tesla is actually stealing ICE customers and has been for years.\n\nWe can go ahead and assume Tesla owners are not going to go back to a ICE vehicle unless it was for financial situations and vehicle space. \n\nIll be honest i, i wouldnt pay 45k for a small model 3 sedan when i could just buy a large crew cab luxury Ram for 40k.\n\nHowever, Tesla vehicles lose 10% value each year compared to 20% In ICE vehicles.\n\n\nBack to NIO\n\n1. They  have 3 vehciles right now with a recent model thst was released mid of 2020. They will have another vehicle released January 6th 2021, on NIO day. Thats 2 new vehicles released in one year span. Bring it to a total of 4 vehicles. This is relatively easy for them because they dont actually own a single factory. They pay JAC motors to build them vehicles.\n\n2. They are backed by the government. The chieese government i vested $1.1 billion dollars into their company 2 months ago if they agreed to relocate their headquarters in Hefei, China. Its about 200 miles west of Shanghai, China.\n\n3. They are the only other EV with actually reasonable vehicles for consumers.\n\n4. The CEO and founder is \"William Li\". He is a billionaire who also co-founded a publically traded company named \"BitAuto\" (BITA) its an auto review company in China.\n\n5. They have over 100 stations in China that swap batteries for new fully charged ones in 5 mins.\n\n6. Their negative quarterly margin is shrinking very fast and if the rate continues, they will have positive profitable margins by next year.\n\n7. William Li said october 10th, Nio's vehicle production target is 150,000 total sales and he wants to double that to 300,000 by end of 2021.\n\n8. They have an auto driving feature called. NIO pilot. \u00a0\n\nThe in-house developed NIO Pilot, empowered by Mobileye EyeQ4, boasts over 20 driver assistance features and supports firmware-over-the-air updates. Always evolving, always up-to-date.\n\n9. They have NIO SERVICE, which are vans with batteries that can charge an EV on the go, if you run out of Electricity on the side of the road. \n\n10. They are limited to 5,000 vehicles per month by JAC motors. JAC MOTORS is the company that actually makes the NIO vehicles.\n\n11. The Nio Es6 is a high comparable vehicle to the Tesla Model X with simalir pricing.\n\n12. NIO's reported customer loyalty referral is 3 times higher than Tesla's in China.\n\n13. NIO BASS (battery as a Service) is a subscription-based battery service where you will be able upgrade copacity in the future. It includes the battery swaping stations they have placed around cities. \n\nSo there is all the main info i found about this Car Company. I really think if it will thrive in the future, as long as they dont screw it up. Its risky of course. Just like Tesla. \n\nBut the main reason i think we will see NIO reach Tesla in China is because the Chineesr culture is just like American culture. We love seeing made in USA products, just like they love seeing Made in China products.\n\nI think that people were forced to buy Tesla in China because the chineese people didnt have a choice. But now that NIO is starting to look like the next Battery started EV company, we can see them overcoming Tesla in China in the next 5 years.\n\nBut i will also say that Tesla vehicles are more efficient in their vehciles in many ways, I still think NIO will thrive in China.",

That presents a massive opportunity for those who are paying attention. Are you paying attention?\n\nThis massive short position is coupled with extremely low sentiment in the bond markets generally. In fact sentiment has just bounced off of 0%. These sort of excessive conditions are exactly what veteran traders look toward for opportunity. Typically when we see sentiment this low, we see a move upward in prices.\n\n[Source: http:\\/\\/jayonthemarkets.com\\/](https://preview.redd.it/phenn5k4omv51.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25d17db5b997acde7e4a5d5a2109207a024ca01c)\n\nThe hedge funds are betting on interest rates rising. They are betting on inflation. They are betting on a weak dollar. And they will be wrong on every count.\n\nThis bet stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Fed and QE operates. Let's discuss this now.\n\n# Money Printer Does NOT Go Brrrrr\n\nThis can be a complex topic, so I'll keep this as simple and brief as I can.\n\nQuantitative Easing is not Cash. In fact, QE is deflationary.\n\nHere is how QE works, in a nutshell. The Fed buys bonds from the big banks. Except the Fed isn't buying them with cash. In exchange for the bonds, the Fed puts funds in a reserve account held by the bank. These reserve funds CANNOT BE TOUCHED by the banks. All the banks can do is use this account as collateral to lend against. Which means if the banks aren't lending, QE funds are not entering the economy. And the banks are not lending, because they would have to risk their own capital to do so.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.stlouisfed.org\\/open-vault\\/2019\\/august\\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained](https://preview.redd.it/ep5o34n6omv51.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85ee20a6a61a6070561d2977f6fea4e44ee98437)\n\nIn fact, it's much worse than that. Because the Fed is removing bonds from the open market, and not paying cash for them. Those bonds could be sold for actual cash, which would provide actual liquidity in the market. Despite all the Fed's talk about \"creating liquidity,\" what the Fed is actually doing is REMOVING liquidity from the system.\n\nWhy would they do this? Answer: To lower interest rates. Don't take my word for it, the Fed explains this itself.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.stlouisfed.org\\/open-vault\\/2019\\/august\\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained](https://preview.redd.it/bfojuyh8omv51.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e0d6943fe4d61fc98cb9d5d022e35bcf1c4f697)\n\nSee, the Fed has to follow the laws that govern its actions. Despite what the public believes, the Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print money and hand it out. The Fed knows that the true source of inflation in a debt-based economy is through credit expansion. So the Fed does everything it can to reduce interest rates, both by setting reserve rates near zero and by using QE to drive rates down further.\n\nOnly when credit expansion revives will we begin to see inflation and a true recovery. The Fed knows their hands are tied, which is why they keep hammering Congress to pass more stimulus.\n\nPerhaps the greatest strength of the Fed is in \"forward guidance.\" The Fed simply uses words to convince the public that money is being printed, that inflation is coming, so that people go out and spend and buy assets. They are playing a trick on the public, and the trick is working. People actually believe inflation is coming, that stocks are being held up by the Fed, that money is pouring into the system. The public is wrong on every count.\n\n# For Every Seller, There is a Buyer...\n\nWe all know that every seller needs a buyer. So who is buying the bonds that the hedge funds are shorting in record numbers?\n\nAnswer: The big commercial banks, both foreign and domestic. In other words, the Smart Money. Commercial banks have accumulated a whopping $4.464 TRILLION in securities.\n\nThe Banks are setting up a huge trap for the hedge funds, buying up their bonds for cheap and waiting for the inevitable cover. The Smart Money knows how the Fed works. They know deflation and falling interest rates are coming. And the banks are buying up bonds left and right.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/releases\\/h8\\/current\\/default.htm](https://preview.redd.it/u27ezj8vomv51.png?width=1225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c74ac7de6f1c1f50bed9d3b7c270b034bb53419b)\n\nIn the last 20-year treasury auction, there were $53 billion in bids for a $22 billion offer. That's called DEMAND, folks. Foreign investors bid $16 billion and primary dealer banks bid $31 billion. The banks, both foreign and domestic, want more bonds.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.treasurydirect.gov\\/instit\\/annceresult\\/press\\/preanre\\/2020\\/R\\_20201021\\_3.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/9fbudvqxomv51.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f508a93a891b0e0b1e95abc916e9295da1cc0fa)\n\nThe banks also control lending standards. They are not showing much willingness to open up business and lend. They know that would be risky, because the economy still has not truly recovered. They likely also know that stock prices are inflated, and are prepping for the next leg down.\n\n# The Day WSB Beat the Hedge Funds?\n\nWe have a real opportunity here... An opportunity to bet WITH the Smart Money, and to help squeeze the hedge funds out of their irrational position. Also an opportunity to profit off all the ignorant speculators (looking at most of you) who don't understand how QE works, who think Powell is \"printing money\" and holding up stocks, who think inflation and higher interest rates are just around the corner, when the opposite is true.\n\nAn alliance between the high and the low, the rich and the poor, the smart and the...retarded. All to take money out of the hands of these leveraged dopes on Wall Street.\n\nInterest rates are going to zero. And bonds move inverse to yields, so we will go long bonds. Lucky for us, there is a convenient ETF that allows us to trade the long-term bond market: TLT. And yes, this ETF has options...\n\nI know what you are thinking. \"Bonds? Ok grandpa.\" TLT is no TSLA. But if you want to survive as a trader long-term, you want to look for safe, high-probability plays exactly like this one.\n\n**Position: $TLT 162c 2/19**",

I have found one for my fellow gamers, one for the work-from-homers, one for the anti-socials and for the cocaine and hookers indulgers. **I have found CORSAIR CRSR. This is my top pick for the next six months. Stock options released yesterday. It will only take $10k to make over $100k easily.**\n\nHere's the S-1 for the real mofuckas..mofucka mofuckaaahhh: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312520227100/d507744ds1.htm#toc507744\\_4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312520227100/d507744ds1.htm#toc507744_4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCorsair is a consumer hardware company. They make money from PC components, Xbox and PS controllers and streaming components so your daughter could show off her mosquito bitten chest for the Chad's on twitch. They basically have monopolized the power supply market for the DIY gamers and is how they've built their brand.  Their memory cards are also respectable in the field because memory doesn't compete the way AMD and INTC do for CPU performance. They also make fans, cases, headsets and mice for computers, all of which are starting to become very popular. They acquired SCUF Gaming so they  have a foot in the console space, which is going to see the growth that will be off the charts in Q4 and FY2021 as the printer brrrrs and everyone stays home.\n\nMy DD will include two of the most important things you should seek: **Catalysts and Undervalued Fundamentals**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd because no one seems to give a fuck about fundys these days, we'll start with\n\n**Catalysts:**\n\n**Generally Speaking:**\n\n* **Gaming is making your fatass, cant-run-a-lap-without-stopping, son cool in school. Look at all the stocks of gaming companies. Hard to find a loser.**\n* **Twitch has made it cool to build your own PC**\n* **25 day Quiet period expiration expires Monday**\n* **Economies of scale and catch-up effect (for my econ majors)**\n\n**Q2 2020:**\n\n* **Two high demanding FPS's** in Call of Duty and Valorant release\n* **WFH stipend** employees have been receiving for their WFH conversion; people bought herman millers and your wife's bf built her a new PC with corsair case, fans, PSU and memory cards\n\n**Q3 2020:**\n\n* **Nvidia's 3000 series released in September and sold out immediately.** The GPU is twice as efficient as the next best and for the same price. THIS literally makes people more willing to go big and build a new rig.\n* **Valorant** was released in June, so CRSR really starts benefitting in Q3\n* **Summer,** which means dad has to buy son the PC he built because that idiot got straight C's in school. I heard they hand out medals for every idiot who participates these days.\n* **WFH Stipend** again, as the unemployment rate falls, the amount of money new employees receive increases, incentivizing gamers to build a new PC to watch porn at 240hz ofc.\n* **Market realizes the growth in DIY computer builders because of Twitch and WoM marketing. DIY computer builders -- it has been a long time coming.** I built my first computer when I was 15, over 10 years ago. It's easy as lego's and you get more value out of each dollar spent. It is 100% the trend as well.\n\n**Q4 2020:**\n\n* **AMD** releases and **NVDA supply chain** improvement this quarter will make and have made a lot of people orgasm, more so than previous years.

        "selftext": "Disney is restructuring its media and entertainment divisions, as streaming becomes the most important facet of the company\u2019s media business.\n\nOn Monday, the company revealed that in order to further accelerate its direct-to-consumer strategy, it would be centralizing its media businesses into a single organization that will be responsible for content distribution, ad sales and Disney+.\n\nShares of the company jumped more than 5% during after-hours trading following the announcement.\n\nThe move by Disney comes as the global coronavirus pandemic has crippled its theatrical business and ushered more customers toward its streaming options. As of August, Disney has 100 million paid subscribers across its streaming offerings, more than half of whom are subscribers to Disney+.\n\n\u201cI would not characterize it as a response to Covid,\u201d CEO Bob Chapek told CNBC\u2019s Julia Boorstin on \u201cClosing Bell\u201d on Monday. \u201cI would say Covid accelerated the rate at which we made this transition, but this transition was going to happen anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are tilting the scale pretty dramatically [toward streaming],\u201d Chapek said on \u201cClosing Bell,\u201d noting that the company is looking at all investments, including dividends, as it seeks to increase its spend on new content. Chapek said the board of directors will have the final say on Disney\u2019s dividend payouts.\n\nOnly last week, activist investor Dan Loeb called on Chapek to end the company\u2019s annual $3 billion dividend to divert more capital to new Disney+ content.\n\nLoeb\u2019s Third Point Capital is one of Disney\u2019s largest shareholders and bought more shares earlier this year in support of Disney\u2019s repositioning around Disney+, its flagship subscription streaming service.\n\nLoeb told CNBC, \u201cWe are pleased to see that Disney is focused on the same opportunity that makes us such enthusiastic shareholders: investing heavily in the DTC business, positioning Disney to thrive in the next era of entertainment.\u201d\n\nChapek said the reorganization could result in some reduction of staff, but not likely at the same scale as was seen at the company\u2019s parks division last month. Disney was forced to lay off around 28,000 workers after it became clear that its Disneyland parks in California would not be reopening soon.\n\nAs part of this reorganization, Disney has promoted Kareem Daniel, the former president of consumer products, games and publishing. He will now oversee the new media and entertainment distribution group.\n\nHe\u2019ll be in charge of making sure streaming becomes profitable, as the company continues to invest heavily in its various streaming products. Daniel will hold the reins to all of the company\u2019s streaming services and domestic television networks, including all content distribution, sales and advertising.\n\nDisney is becoming more reliant on Disney+ as movie theaters have been unable to recover after being shuttered in March due to the outbreak. Ticket sales have been particularly lackluster at domestic cinemas since the industry attempted a large-scale reopening in late August.\n\nIn recent months, the company pushed back a number of its theatrical releases including its Marvel blockbuster \u201cBlack Widow.\u201d The much anticipated Pixar film \u201cSoul\u201d has also been postponed. It will now arrive on Disney+ in December.\n\nAnalysts are still awaiting word from Disney about how \u201cMulan\u201d fared after Disney removed it from theatrical release and sold it through Disney+ for $30. It is expected the company will share more details about its performance during its next earnings report in November.\n\nDaniel will be responsible, in part, for making big decisions about Disney\u2019s theatrical and streaming release schedules going forward.\n\n\u2033[Consumers] are going to lead us,\u201d Chapek said on \u201cClosing Bell.\u201d \u201cRight now they are voting with their pocketbooks, and they are voting very heavily toward Disney+. We want to make sure that we are going the way the consumers want us to go.\u201d\n\n**Reorganizing Disney\u2019s media business**\n\nAlan Horn and Alan Bergman will remain in charge of the company\u2019s studios, Peter Rice will continue to head the company\u2019s general entertainment group, and James Pitaro will stay as head of the company\u2019s sports content.\n\nAll will report directly to CEO Bob Chapek. The company\u2019s parks, experiences and products segment will remain under the leadership of Josh D\u2019Amaro, and Rebecca Campbell will remain on as the chairman of direct-to-consumer and international operations. Campbell will report directly to Chapek for all things related to international operations but will report to Daniel when it comes to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.\n\n\u201cGiven the incredible success of Disney+ and our plans to accelerate our direct-to-consumer business, we are strategically positioning our Company to more effectively support our growth strategy and increase shareholder value,\u201d Chapek said in a statement announcing the reorganization. \u201cManaging content creation distinct from distribution will allow us to be more effective and nimble in making the content consumers want most, delivered in the way they prefer to consume it.\u201d\n\nUnder Horn and Bergman, the studios segment will focus on creating content for theatrical release, Disney+ and Hulu. Walt Disney Studios, Marvel Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures all fall under their purview.\n\nRice\u2019s general entertainment segment includes 20th Television, ABC Signature and Touchstone Television, ABC News, Disney Channels, Freeform, FX and National Geographic.\n\nAs for Pitaro\u2019s sports segment, that will focus on live sports programming, sports news and original and nonscripted sports-related content across ESPN, ESPN+ and ABC.\n\nDaniel\u2019s media and entertainment distribution group will manage all distribution, operations, sales and advertising across the three content groups. Daniel has spent 14 years with the company in a variety of positions. He helped transform Disney\u2019s Star Wars property into the two Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge lands in Disney World and Disneyland as well as aided in bringing Toy Story Land, Pixar Pier and Avengers Campus to the parks.\n\n\u201cKareem is an exceptionally talented, innovative and forward-looking leader, with a strong track record for developing and implementing successful global content distribution and commercialization strategies,\u201d said Chapek.\n\nThis new structure is effective immediately. The company currently expects to transition its financial reporting to reflect these changes beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nAdditionally, Disney announced that it will hold a virtual investor day on Dec. 10. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/12/disney-reorganizes-to-focus-on-streaming-direct-to-consumer.html",

They terminated the contract which can be due to one of two reasons: 1 - They don't get paid or 2 - The product does not sell which means Ignite doesn't have any money (but we already know that).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo sum it all up:\n\nIgnite is completely out of assets and massively in debt,  business partners recently cut ties with them and they are hiding their Q2 results that would expose all of that have been overdue for months now.

Instead of trying to justify a higher PT, we review our long term investment thesis based on our bullish top-down sector view, introduce 2025 earnings projection and draw implication to the current stock price.\n\nWe come to the conclusion that Nio remains attractive from a long term perspective.\n\nWe project the company to earn a ~7% market share in passenger EV market by 2025 or specifically ~30% share in the premium space which Nio focuses on.\n\nIn the near term, key catalysts would include:\n\n1) anticipated solid 3Q results in mid-November, where we forecast GPM to further expand to ~12% vs. 8% in 2Q20.\n\n2) Robust order backlog, in particular, the newly launched EC6 crossover model for which the wait time is around eight weeks due to initial productionramp and very strong demand.\n\n3) A new sedan model scheduled to debut on \"Nio Day\" in December which should further enhance the company's current product portfolio (of two SUVs - ES8 and ES6, and one crossover - EC6).\n\nFollowing the introduction of our 2023-25 earnings forecasts, we lift our Jun-21 PT to USD40 based on 3.0x EV to 2025E sales, the same valuation approach (of 3.0x EV to 2025E sales) we apply to Xpeng Auto, another Chinese EV start-up.\n\nThis also presents a meaningful discount to Tesla's current 5.1x EV to 2025E sales, which we believe is reasonable considering Tesla's technology leadership globally and market share momentum especially in China.\n\nPreviously, we followed average of three approaches in Nio's valuation analysis including EV/sales, PER and EV/EBITDA, which gives us a PT of USD36.\n\nConsidering consistency of valuation methodology across EV OEMs under coverage, we now move Nio's approach to EV/sales.\n\nInvestment Thesis, Valuation and Risks\n\nNIO Inc. (Overweight; Price Target: $40.00)\n\nOpportunities in 2021:\n\n(1) Rising NEV penetration with an emerging and structural shift from \"B\" to \"C\" \u2013 with Tesla's localized Model 3 and aggressive pricing; we see an increasing (and unexpected) trend where more EV buyers are individuals, rather than corporates or individuals living in cities with purchase quotas \u2013 this structural wave could broaden EVs' addressable market, but lead to faster concentration in the EV business; NIO could benefit as long as it stays within the top 10 by market share.\n\n(2) The extension of the NEV subsidy program toward 2022, where the battery swap business model is covered by the government's subsidy scheme, is encouraging.\n\n(3) We project a meaningful pickup in new model launches, especially in 4Q20, along with the new model, EC6.

Gold and currency speculation hurt the Allies and eventually West Germany gives up on defending the dollar, abandons Bretton Woods, followed by Switzerland and France (again!). This is a very short summary of multiple ructions and currency crises between the 60s and early 70s. We forget very quickly.   \nIn  France, the Bretton Woods system was called \"America's exorbitant privilege\" as it resulted in an \"asymmetric financial system\" where non-US citizens \"see themselves supporting American living standards and subsidizing American multinationals\". As American economist Barry Eichengreen summarized: \"It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries had to pony up $100 of actual goods in order to obtain one\".  \n\n\nUS reserves of gold had dwindled  from over 20 000 tons to just over 8100 tons. All spent defending the dollar. The Vietnam war is costing an absolute fortune and bleeding the US dry. Literally and figuratively. Unemployment is running at about 6% and inflation at 5.84%. Both seen as uncommonly high since WWII.   \n\n\nIn 1971 Richard Nixon had two choices: either take steps to balance the books, I.e. drastically  cut government expenditure, increase taxes,  reduce US inflation by increasing interest rates, and restore faith in the dollar, or suspend the convertibility of the US dollar into gold. He chose the latter and did it without consultation with Allies. The announcement on 15th August 1971 was accompanied by a mandated freeze on all wages and prices for 90 days. Imagine that today! In addition, an additional import tax on all items of 10% was thought necessary to protect American products against cheaper imports.   \n\n\nOn 15th August 1971, I was just over 12 yrs old. I remember my father, a normally typical restrained British chartered accountant (when that meant something) going absolutely nuts. He opened champagne, started singing and danced with my mum. Guess he knew it was coming but not when.   \n\n\n1971 marked the end of any pretence at backing currencies with gold. We now have fiat currencies backed by nothing but \u2019full faith and confidence\u2019 in the issuing authority. The establishment of fully fledged fiat currencies has enabled all the debt based financial engineering we see around us today. It has worked as long as increase in money supply has been matched by increase in GDP: balanced growth. Problem is GDP growth cannot continue indefinitely without consequences for the environment and planet.   \n\n\nSo what now?",

        "selftext": "Earlier back in early summer this year the US had a \"second wave\" which I think was probably just an extension of the first wave because of re-opening measures.\n\nHowever, the real second wave is starting to show its teeth now in Europe. Granted Europe has been open for a few months and life was far closer to normal than over here in the US yet they are now facing more cases than they did in the first initial wave (particularly in France, Spain, and the UK).\n\nThis actual delay in rising cases is what can be justified as a different wave because it was not a direct result of government measures or policy changes.\n\nNot to mention Paris and the UK are working on second lockdown procedures which should take place in the coming week or two.\n\nNow as I'm sure most of you remember from the time cases went parabolic in Italy to when they reached the United States was about a 3 week delay and I would anticipate around the same thing this time. Yes I know there are travel restrictions, but there were last time as well and clearly things got through.\n\nI also have some close personal DD from a friend of mine who said his hospital got slammed with cases for the first time in months within the past week.\n\n***The point is I'm about as big a bull as you'll ever meet but can't help ignore the fact that there is the possibility of a second wave in the United States, larger than the first one as seen in Europe, with almost the exact same time as a very important political event.***\n\nNow I don't think smart money in blindsided by what is going on Europe here, but you don't have to get caught off guard if it plays out again too. I don't want to go into lockdown as much as the next guy but we all know that New York and California will not be afraid to pull the trigger if there is a surge in cases a few weeks from now which could lead to other states choosing to do the same.\n\nTruthfully I think this is the perfect time and actual legitimate reason to hedge your bets with SPY puts or SQQQ calls because **if there's one thing the FED can't out-print it's the fear behind a second lockdown.**\n\nTl;dr: Europe is going into a second lockdown soon, actually a good time to buy SPY puts or SQQQ calls imo.",

EV vehicles on the other hand AUTOMATICALLY get a Shanghainese license plate. This policy in effect is a strong push for EV vehicles and to solve traffic issues in Shanghai.

        "selftext": "As somebody who works in an organization that does work incredibly similarly to Palantir (data science, analytics, and management for organizaitons), I'd like to share my perspective on why I think PLTR is a future 10-bagger. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What does Palantir do?\n\nIn a nutshell, what Palantir does is data science, management, and analytics in big data. They started off working with government agencies, while recently expanding to non-governing entities. As a technology, this is invaluable to both organizations and private/public companies. Most every organization collects data (obviously, right?)\n\nOne of the many types of organizations that I've personally worked on are correctional facilities (e.g. - a prison). Prisons collect **fuck loads** of *your information*. For example: \n\n*Demographics &amp; characteristics*: height, eye color, race, age, number of family members, married vs. non married, education level, aliases (names you go by), mental illnesses, current and past places of residences, who you work for, how long you've worked for them, etc.\n\n*Criminal History:*  current and past offenses, where the offense was committed, against whom the offense was committed (and the same above information for the victim), the sentencing judge, how long you were sentenced for, when you are to be released, etc.\n\n*Prison Behavior:*  did you get in trouble in prison, how was it handled, by which CO handled the situation, did you lose credit for good time, take college courses/classes in prison, how much money do you have in the commisary? what do you spend it on?\n\n*Other stuff:*  weather, recent institutional policy/procedure changes, changes in legislation/law, and other random shit that seems unrelated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe above examples are only a fraction of the data that say, a prison were to collect from you. Like i said, they collect **fuck loads of data.** They also store fuck loads of data over large periods of time. \n\n# Everyone collects tons of data. So what?\n\nWhile yes, most if not all organizations collect crap loads of data, a lot of times are just for record keeping purposes. A lot of organizations analyse their data, but use sub-standard and less advanced methods across few areas of data because of the limitations of the data: data linkages, definition of a case, unstandard formatting, etc.\n\nMost organizations that collect their data also do a **garbage** job doing it. Sometimes, using conventional techniques on garbage data gets you zero inferential value (i.e. what decisions should be made from the data). I can't tell you how many times i've worked with data that looks like it was done by a boomer who never took a class on BASIC excel. you would think most orgs/companies know how to collect/work with data, but many don't!\n\nMost organizations also dont LINK their data across different areas or within themselves. Different data are usually seperate and independent from each other, and within like data they don't keep track of what record belong together. While it would be helpful to keep all this data in the same place, for organization purposes they keep things seperate - except this also makes it harder to piece them together if they wanted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Here's where PLTR comes in.\n\nPLTR essentially wants to interconnect **all** the data sources that were collected by an organization, and use big data analytics, machine learning, and algorithms to help drive decisions. By using machine learning and algorithms, you can link together data to &gt;99% accuracy levels. \n\nNow that you've linked data sources and streamlined them across and within each other, you can explore with greater accuracy/clarity/statistical power, questions such as: how has global warming over time affected purchasing behaviors for automobiles. \n\nHowever, with more pieces information across databases, as well as information over time, you now can link different (maybe unrelated, maybe not) pieces of information to that question to account for any spurious (unrelated) correlations (such as, for instance, the majority political party at the time), to be able to say whether or not a correlation is ***causative****.* Causative means that we can say, with confidence, one thing affects the outcome of another thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What does this mean?\n\nNow that a company/organization has all of their data sources being constantly linked together (presently and over time), is standardized, an is being programatically driven by machine learning, PLTR's software can say with certainty: \"we know we need to do X thing to produce more tendies,\" or \"we know we need to do X thing to arrest more people,\" or \"we need to do x thing to save more tendies.\"\n\nHaving a resource that simplifies what decisions around profit, efficency, is bullish AF for any company that would choose to use it, and in turn is bullish AF for Palantir. PLTR is going to tap into an un-tapped market that isn't doing this with their data already (so i'm not talking about AAPL, GOOGLE), but the medium sized and smaller sized corporations in the country that are **absolutely not doing this with their data.** \n\nIt also can tap into the tens of thousands of government agencies (state, county, local) that are in my professional experience, are **not doing this with their data.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe market for the technology is huge and are the implications. I'm all in on PLTR.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: 1/2022 10C",

My number one rule is no holding overnight, but this time I disregarded that rule. \n\nI typically daytrade AMD, and overall I\u2019m extremely bullish in regards to the stock itself. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t play both sides based off recent activity of the stock. \n\nNow, speaking strictly with September and AMD it follows the market, and futures fairly respectively. Not this week though. I could get into the insane amount of DD that I\u2019ve put into this fucking stock, but let me honest nobody gives a fuck.  \n\nLong story short bought puts Tuesday at the opening high, didn\u2019t sell on the first dip, and ever since then I\u2019ve done nothing but watch this stock defy everything it\u2019s ever done. I was seriously looking for just one downward decent dip over the past few days that I could sell these puts and switch bullish for more then what they opened as. But that hasn\u2019t happened. \n\nAfter today I\u2019m officially done. My money is completely gone, there is a 0.001 % chance that I\u2019ll recover more then basic change on a hundred dollar bill, because I\u2019ve never once got lucky in the market over the past seven years I\u2019ve been trading, that\u2019s why I only use data, and I don\u2019t normally hold overnight. This time I did though, and now I\u2019m officially done. I\u2019ve worked my fucking ass off on a daily basis making money, even through September making money. I went against my rules and went with instinct one single time and now my entire life is over. Held over night Tuesday, stock defied the overall market every single day since then. I\u2019m down over 100k, lost my day trading rights, and now I\u2019m officially done, I\u2019ll be going all in on $.380 five minutes after close today. \n\nTo those of you holding AMD calls this week congrats, and I wish you all the best, hope that you make millions in the future, and hope that you make better decisions then me in regards to accepting losses, because if you don\u2019t you\u2019ll lose everything. \n\nThe reality of the situation is that my girlfriend will 100% be gone once she finds out I\u2019ve lost all my savings, I support my mother and now I can\u2019t, the one thing I thought I was good at ruined my life, and soon I\u2019ll have nothing left to even somewhat enjoy life with. \n\nThe only reason I got into day trading was to support those I cared about. When I was younger I thought if I ever made the money I would go to college and get a degree so I could get steady income. But I chose to just keep trading. Now I\u2019m just staring at the wall realizing I\u2019m just me at 19 only this time I\u2019m 26. No progress in life, just another lowlife fucking idiot who thought he was more then what he was.

        "selftext": "The general bear sentiment I see here is \"hurr durr another Blockbuster\" without much arguments besides that. Some even compare it to NKLA (a fraud company with business under it besides pretty renders). \nI'm very bullish on GME, mainly for the short squeeze of a lifetime, but a solid argument could still be made for a company itself.\n\nHere I'll try to list main bear points, comment if I forgot something, I'll add it to the post. My goal is to build the most precise model of what is happening and I do not want to blindly follow the hype train, so please criticize what you think is wrong and together we'll find the truth.\n\n**1. The squeeze already happened, from 5 to 15**\n\nFacts: most shorts were in a 7$ and therefore were slightly underwater at 9. Yes, we've had huge volume during Thursday and Friday and one may say that all shorts covered already. However, half the volume (about 50m) during those couple of days were new shorts (source: http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html). So if we even accept the premise that all 60m shorts covered we still have 50m shorted which is close to 100% float again. The reality is that there are probably quite a number of old bears still holding the line and who are heavily underwater.\n\nThis is what REAL short squeeze looks like: VW Oct 2008 The Great Squeeze\n\nAlso, look at shares available to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME\n\n**2. Gamestop has a dying business model and is not going to last long-term**\n\nWell yes, but you're looking at what Gamestop was. They are actively trying to turn the company's course around right now with a help from Ryan Cohen who at the very least has an excellent experience in managing and growing retail business. In itself it might be a questionable bullish case, but the market has a GameStop bankruptcy priced-in at 7$ and a perspective of a turn-around is a massive deviation from that common sentiment.\n\nAbout the long-term thing: go to fucking /r/investing for that. Nobody's telling that this company is going to be a beast in 20 years time. The main point is that they're not dying, possibly growing somewhat and have an enormous potential for a huge squeeze. The following year or two after the consoles release are going to be explosive as it has every time before, which is also enough time for management to come up with new ways for a company to live besides selling games and consoles.\n\nMy wild guesses: PC bangs, e-sports involvement, gaming stuff (I know they already are, but there is a lot of space to grow in that direction)\n\nMichael Burry involvement is also a somewhat convincing argument.\n\n**3. Strong balance sheets **\n\nYou are seriously telling me that a market cap of 700m$ is adequate for a company which generated 6.5b$ revenue in 2019, having 2.3b$ in assets and 700m$ with cash on hands? And a company during the new console season which historically drive the price up to the tits\n\n**4. Physical sales are decreasing compared to digital **\n\nYes, in percentages. But you should also account for the overall growth of the gaming market, and an argument can be made that total numbers are not decreasing that much. Now excuse me on this one, I can't manage to find exact stats in numbers and not in percentages (I've seen it a while ago somewhere on this sub), so if anyone has it please post.\n\nSummary: \n\n* Gamestop isn't going to go bankrupt anytime soon \n\n* It is being overshorted with the premise that it is going to be bankrupt \n\n* The company actively tries to change it's course, so we would have a lot of positive news incoming \n\n* Every tiny piece of positive news is being multiplied tenfold by the short-sellers being underwater \n\n* Shares are heavily underpriced on what GME has right now in cash and revenue, and we're not even talking about possible company's revival \n\n* We're at wsb, not at fucking /r/investing. I always thought wsb was all about high-risk high-reward calculated bets. And here we have a perfect storm waiting to happen",

It may look like nothing lines but I don't think they are... \n\nFor this theory to be considered, the 20 EMA needs to climb up the middle and the 55 EMA needs to hug the bottom of the bullish channel - but not over extend past the triangles. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxrqa606t1s51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a11a6899cf4f61b3f0f78685ef397bfbef8795a\n\n[High and lows on the 3m chart](https://preview.redd.it/62clmm8dr1s51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f856182afcd1b40ef75d9aff1c4439c02f4f432)\n\n[High and lows 1D chart](https://preview.redd.it/4eiwws1ns1s51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79f77e8ced3c1e740206cdbeed326f11e8a34018)\n\n\\*\\*CURRENT PLAYS\\*\\*\n\n[current plays](https://preview.redd.it/tovu13a9u1s51.png?width=2158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1b07b250418b2ba5cfa9d06c1425bd492c75ea8)\n\nAt open, I plan on buying 96c with 10/16 expiration and am going to diamond hands until next week. I will also look into buying put with 11-27 since I believe AMD may crash (*maybe even the entire stock market*) I will trade in the AM during market open and not look at it until this weekend since if been up for about 24 hrs straight. \n\nGood luck boys and girls. AMD to the moon.",

        "selftext": "*It's ya boy Milt who wrote those Tendie Stimulus DD's. This is only meant to be political insomuch as it has a direct connection to market behavior.\u00a0 Please don't have a political debate in the comments and get me banned lol. I'd send polling numbers and shit, but don't have time to look it all up before I start work.\u00a0 The info is out there, though.*\n\nIf you're like me, you were confused last week as DT tweeted for and against the Stimulus, and volatility didn't move with it.\u00a0 We also saw a ton of COVID cases hit the administration, which caused overnight futures depression, but didn't have the staying power to move SPY during trading hours.\u00a0 The DOW is coming off one of it's only good monthly runs of the year, and volatility is at absurd lows heading into an election.\u00a0 What gives?\n\nIn the daily threads I see a lot of people attribute the stubborn upward movement to Stimulus hopes, and this is true.\u00a0 Importantly, however, is that this is not hope Stimmy will get done before election--it is abundantly clear that won't happen.\u00a0 It's also not market hopes that DT wins and makes good on his promise to deliver checks--the market follows pundits, and smart money, and all those have on a Mango loss (I'm not picking a side; I'm saying this is the information that is out there).\u00a0 Lastly, it definitely ain't hope that Trump's tweet about a \"bigger Stimulus than Democrats or Republicans want\" will lead to a larger amount--Senate Republicans who are not McConnell have made it clear they won't sign off on a large package, potentially not even the 1.8 trillion that the WH floated last week.\n\n**The market is preparing for a probable \"Blue Wave\"--Dem control of the WH, Senate, and House--and the massive stimulus that would pass as a result.**\n\nThe initial HEROES Act the Dem House wanted to pass was over 3 trillion, which was brought down to 2.2 trillion in recent negotiations to make it at least seem like a good starting point for GOP discussions.\u00a0 IF--and i do mean IF--pundits are correct in their predictions of a Dem sweep, then the House and Senate would have complete control over the amount and dispersion of funding for the next Stimulus.\u00a0 The initial 3.4 trillion the Democrats wanted to pass could easily rise to a spiteful 4 trillion with zero obstacles from another party.\u00a0 This explains a few obvious market trends recently, like SPY's continued rise, but also less obvious ones like:\n\n-The continued rise in tech even as valuations reach new heights and lockdowns ease: Dem wins would mean more stringent protocols, which benefits big tech (obviously) as stay-at--home stocks could have prolonged relevance.\u00a0 Couple that with the upcoming earnings season, and you got a nice tech stew going.\n\n-Absurdly depressed volatility: A \"blue wave\" would mean financial policy consistency and shared vision, meaning that whatever happens in congressional decision-making would be without a certain level of conflict and therefore, increased expedience.\n\n-Solar and weed stocks mooning: this one is pretty obvious.\n\nI'm not saying any candidate--or congress--is better than the other.\u00a0 I'm saying that the bulk of predictions are on Dem wins across the board, and MMs are acting accordingly, riding the wave up before *we* get there with surprised Pikachu face when a Joe win doesn't tank the market.\u00a0 We saw how wrong polls can get it in 2016, but the numbers right now are pretty scathing.\n\nPlays:\nIn the event of a sweep, I wouldn't expect Dems to move slow, since winning across the board would be considered a \"mandate\", and the Supreme Court nominating process will have them clamoring to clap back.\u00a0 I'm looking at calls slightly OTM, one to three months out, for the stimulus winners on dips this week:\n\n**Recovery retail:** Small business closures, more stringent protocols and having had another quarter to integrate online systems will be good for:\n**WMT** 11/27 155c\n**TGT** 11/27 170c\n**M** 1/15 9c\n**LOW** 11/27 185c\n\nRUN is my solar play, they've taken a little bit of a beating but are in takeover mode via smart acquisitions and should head back up:\n**RUN** 11/20 75c\n**RUN** 12/28 80c\n\n**Airlines:** JETS leaps for January, and SAVE 22c 3/19.  I really like SAVE cause its focus is domestic travel, so even as business and international travel die with the larger changing trends, SAVE is in position to profit off of people getting Stimmy money to go visit their parents, etc.\n \nAuto: had a big run during COVID, likely due in part to UI backpay giving folks a down payment ability who didn't have it.\u00a0 Obviously KMX and CVNA, but I am very bullish on auto insurance because they haven't gotten a lot of attention.\u00a0 I believe PGR is going to knock earnings out the park and I have (these are up 50%-70% since I bought this morning but that's also partially IV)\n**PGR** 10/16 100c\n**PGR** 10/16 105c\n**PGR** 11/20 110c\n\nAgain, I really am not trying to say one candidate or party is better than the other, it's just a logical explanation of what could be happening on a macro level, and I've worked in political fundraising for many years.  Do your own research, because I bought UVXY calls last week.  So, ya know.",

Big Auto was happy to sit back and watch Tesla try to create a new segment. But now, almost every carmaker has announced significant electric-vehicle ambitions for the coming decade.\n\nMake no mistake: Without Tesla, this wouldn't be happening. We'd still be asking the circa 2006 question, \"Who killed the electric car?\" if Tesla hadn't reset the EV race in the years before the financial crisis, narrowly avoided bankruptcy, and positioned itself to deliver half a million vehicles in 2021 (and gift investors with a 9,200% return).\n\nNow, the global EV market is poised to grow, especially in China, where auto sales are already millions more annually than in the US, with the potential to top out at twice what the US sees every year, around 16-17 million new cars, trucks, and SUVs. A large percentage of those new sales could be electric, and automakers don't want Tesla to capture them all.",

        "selftext": "What should you buy?\n\nIdeally, RDSA or other oil major Calls 6-12 months out. You can go for short term calls, but you have to deal with the short term volatility in the market. Either way, this shit is going up.   \n\n\nWhat happened and why are Oil majors so low:    \n\n\nOil majors got hit very hard this year and lost a lot of value due to a combination of momentum, COVID, and short dicks.     \n\n* Oil obviously got a huge hit by COVID, mostly because it's the most obvious thing to short when traveling stops. \n\n* Oil is very unpopular due to the trend in green investing, this moved institutions to unload their bags in the last years. [example](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=nl&amp;u=https://nos.nl/l/2354349&amp;prev=search&amp;pto=aue)\n\n* Oil was considered boomer stuff by the new influx of retard investors who mostly invested in tech.\n\n* Oil got hit harder because Saudi's with short penises who wanted to go measure dicks with Putin and US shale. [Source](https://sex-with-sander.blogspot.com/2013/05/average-penis-size-per-country-world.html)\n\nToday, all this shit is priced in fundamentally and Oil majors are oversold by almost all TA. The market was kind of pricing in one of the majors to go down. They won't tho, oil is our drugs and we need our hits. \nThis is one of these moments you look back at in a year and it will be so obvious in retrospect.\n\n\nGood for Oil Majors:\n\n\n**COVID Recovery**\n\nCOVID will end and we will be in a worldwide race to recovery. Oil is the most important input for this process and demand will be too big. Price can seriously accelerate to the upside:\n    \n* Demand will rise due to worldwide recovery\n* Production will be lower due to cuts in many big projects with relatively high costs per barrel earlier this year.  \n* Production will be much lower if Biden will stop US fracking.\n* Overpopulation and the rising energy usage will just make us more addicted. India currently uses 2.5 bbl per day per 1000 people. China 6. Western countries use 40-60 bbl/day. Imagine yourself how these numbers will develop in the next 10 years. [source](https://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=91000)\n\n**Price war ending**\n\nSaudi Arabia is realizing that they did a very stupid thing and are now feeling the consequences, they are in the biggest financial trouble of the big oil countries and they pissed everybody off. The lack of foreign interest in the Aramco IPO was already a sign, but they also fucked up that and promised way too high dividends in order not to lose face. They need some kind of solution and higher oil prices are exactly that.\n\n**Shift in Holders**\n\nPrices are so low now that it will appeal to retards like us, you will see more people here talk about oil in the next months. It's one of the obvious sector rotations once we start looking forward. \n\nInstitutions like pension funds made bad decisions by dumping at low prices due to social/green pressure but this was mostly a luxury hobby which they can't afford past COVID and with the low ratios they are facing. \n\n**And most importantly:**\n\nWe are addicted to oil, we continue to increase the average usage per person, and the world population keeps growing. [Source](https://www.worldometers.info/oil/#:~:text=World%20Oil%20Consumption&amp;text=Global%20oil%20consumption%20per%20capita,gallons%20per%20capita%20per%20day.)\n\nEV's and green energy are cool, but governments won't have money to pay for these luxuries for a long time past COVID and we need a lot of cheap energy to recover. There is no scenario where this won't happen, Oil, in general, is the most undervalued industry in the market right now, and its our drugs. \n\nI would stay away from companies who are very into US fracking, but for the rest you should be fine with anything in the industry.\n\nShell (RDS.A) is the one which looks the best for me. They cut dividends earlier this year which strengthened their balance sheet, it made institutions sell, but they are now increasing dividend again (they reported decent profit this week) and said they want to continue to increase it from now on. \n\ntl;dr: Calls RDSA 15-30% OTM 6 months out.

        "selftext": "For those doubting stocks as decent investment (bets) vs options, here's my 1 year gains from 90% stock 10% options. \n\nI mostly buy stocks, specifically looking at IPOs, M&amp;A targets, and high growth companies. 90% of my portfolio is in stocks with the other 10% in option plays. (https://imgur.com/FcSPC94)\n\nI'll place small bets on risky options plays, but never yolo big into any one bet. Right now have options plays in NKLA, GM, BLL, XOM, FIT, PSTH, and OZK. All calls except for OZK. The gains potential is much higher for calls vs puts, so if I'm going to make a high risk bet, I at least want the gains to be worthwhile.\n\nWhen an options play turns out well, I rebalance into some more stocks to generally maintain the 9 to 1 ratio.\n\nFor stocks, I use stop market orders to prevent huge losses when the market tanks or bad news spreads. Depending on the stock volatility, I'll set the stop market trigger just below my cost basis or 90% of the stock price.

        "selftext": "#  1. Introduction\n\n[Proof that I'm lucky](https://preview.redd.it/aissk31uiir51.jpg?width=961&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b40b7364962c3383a1dbb4010c5f5cfd41ffb54f)\n\nThe way I am going to structure this post isn\u2019t with **elliot waves** or **reverse chicken-leg hambone formations** and things that nobody understands, although if anybody smarter than me wants to talk **crayons** in the comments, you are more than welcome.\n\nI\u2019m going to start by explaining why Nike popped, not *exclusively* because I want to **jerk myself off** for being **smart** and predicting it, but because we are going to see how the two stocks display a similar pattern. While I can\u2019t **guarantee that CROX will pop 10% in AH** like NKE did after earnings, I can say with reasonable surety that CROX is going to have an outrageous quarter.\n\nFinally, and I cannot stress this enough, saying Company X will outperform because it is like Company Y, in and of itself, is **TERRIBLE** DD. I am **RETARDED** and you **WILL** lose all of your money, but the meme potential here is so strong I cannot keep this one to myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2. Nike\u2019s 1st Quarter Earnings\n\nSo Nike reported first quarter earnings on September 22, blew every analyst\u2019s expectations out of the water, and made the true believers rich. It was an absolutely perfect storm, and I\u2019m going to explain why:\n\n1. **Motherfuckers sleeping on the GOAT**: I don\u2019t sell shoes really but I am designing software to help secondhand sellers on GOAT, StockX, etc. As a consequence of this, I became very familiar with certain aspects of the sneaker industry. Nike had a terrible June report, lost like 800 million dollars, had to withdraw products from stores, and was generally a disaster. But during the summer, I was paying close attention, and two narratives were simultaneously playing out. The first is that delivery times were getting much better, which implied that they had figured out their COVID logistical issues, and the second is that the emphasis on online sales was wildly successful.\n2. **Ubiquity:** Nearly every non-general release shoe would sell out in seconds, and we are talking about production runs of a few thousand to 100k. It did not matter; everything was selling out. And then it would appear on StockX and other resale sites and start selling there for well above MSRP; this pattern was so reliable that StockX itself posted record sales in the BILLIONS of dollars in 2020, buttressed mostly by Nikes. The more I paid attention to releases, the more I saw Nikes everywhere. And I\u2019m not talking about regular general release Air Monarchs from Costco, I would see very specific spring and summer releases all over feet in NYC. Quarantine be damned, by the time summer rolled around, consumer spending on dumb shit was back in a big way, and new, limited Nikes were hitting pavement everywhere.\n3. **Price patterns**: I was autistic enough to follow NKE basically every few minutes every day in August and September. It climbed with the market, and started getting really frothy in September, hitting record highs over and over again both before and after the Great Crash of September. As a component of the S&amp;P, its price was strongly correlated to SPY, but its lows were higher and highs were much higher. There was a reliable gravity established around 115, and any time it swung below, I bought.\n4. **Analyst sentiment:** The analysts didn't really know how well Nike was doing obviously, because they were measuring it against the broader retail market, which was meh. Meanwhile, being autistic, I was measuring it against other outperforming high-end sports equipment stocks like LULU and PTON. While frothy, sure, it never really had any sort of breakout. And so the perfect storm was created, where analysts were asleep at the wheel (only \\~60% expected a beat at all!), prices were constantly hitting and then dipping below ATH, and a strong center of gravity near the peak. And then earnings came out and everything was great.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 3. Crocs Third Quarter Earnings (Scheduled for 10/27 premarket)\n\nLet\u2019s compare:\n\n1. **Motherfuckers sleeping again:** Crocs is having a renaissance moment. Crocs is also recovering after a terrible midyear, but the stock price has only barely made it back above even. That same exact StockX resale momentum that carried NKE is now picking up for Crocs. Crocs, like Jordans, are now a commodity. All of their recent crossovers, such as Bad Bunny, Grateful Dead, KFC, etc are **selling out** IMMEDIATELY and they are selling out **ONLINE**, only to reappear on StockX. Not only that but their supply chains are tightening up and deliveries are getting quicker. These retail analysts aren\u2019t trying to queue up for Crocs or timing deliveries because who the fuck on Wall Street wears Crocs? Which brings me to part two, ubiquity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[For every dollar you could have put into these Crocs, you would have gotten 3 back. Better returns than TSLA for the same period.](https://preview.redd.it/z8qi4fdyiir51.jpg?width=577&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3da45758b7c076cb81e4dc6fca1ba6cdca717bb)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Ubiquity:** Yes, you read that first part right. KFC Crocs were one of the most **fire** drops of Summer 2020, and I was devastated that I was not able to secure a pair during the drop. But these retarded things are still going for way over MSRP on StockX. People love these crossovers! And with each sold-out release, it only builds hype for the next one. While I don\u2019t personally see as many Crocs on feet as Nikes (no shit), their ubiquity in the medical field cannot be downplayed. I know tons of folks in the NYC, NJ, and PA hospital systems and nearly all of them own Crocs. Not only that, but there have been thousands of donated shipments of Crocs, which fucking somebody has been paying for somewhere. More hardworking doctors dealing with **Covid = more Crocs on feet**. Not only that, but Crocs retail stores are opening back up aggressively and general releases are still doing great.\n2. **Price patterns:** CROX in late September/early October is behaving the exact same way NKE was behaving in late August/ early September. Getting reeeeaaaaal **frothy** around ATH, spiking up and back down, finding gravity somewhere in the 40-45 range (although it appears to be settling even higher). Compared to the broader market, the lows are higher and the highs much higher. HOWEVER analysts are clearly making up for missing NKE and as such, it\u2019s unlikely it will be as mispriced ahead of earnings.\n3. **Analyst sentiment:** This is the biggest divergence. Analysts are upping their targets because they know they fucked up last time. Not only that, but CROX is making unusual headlines lately with share prices surging, especially regarding the Justin Bieber collab rumors (yep, this is a real sentence). This means that while there is still an earnings beat in the works, it\u2019s more likely to be **pRiCeD iN** unless it\u2019s absolutely bonkers nuts, which it still can be, especially if we get some more **retarded** collabs before the end of the year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Look at these LINES. I don't even know what stock this is. Are you still reading this?](https://preview.redd.it/rl3wyy50jir51.jpg?width=948&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b9276c6d176561c6a6a2294af792cf50ce56d5e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 4. Conclusion\n\n**Strategy**\n\nAlright boys, the position is simple. Earnings is late October. Options play is November 20th, which as of writing is all that\u2019s available nearest to that date. I\u2019m going to snatch up 50c in batches of $5k on any day it closes below 45, and as it starts to find gravity in the 45-50 range, adjust up and start grabbing 55c.\n\n*Current position:*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Read it and weep nerds. If I spent 1 dollar a day, it would take me AN ENTIRE YEAR to spend these profits.](https://preview.redd.it/yuec4692jir51.jpg?width=932&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99cc6ed32a1e3cb996908a0cbe1e1353a494f7a5)\n\n**Words of warning**\n\nGiant beats and price pops only work when nobody is expecting it, and price action here suggests that analysts are anticipating positive movement. It is **UNLIKELY** that CROX will be as mispriced as NKE going into earnings, but there is still a lot of room for a **hella runup**. It nonetheless bears repeating **PAST RESULTS IS NOT AN INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE.**\n\nWith that in mind, it may be a better move to let anticipation bake into the price and then sell off before the earnings. That really only depends on the next \\~month of macro, so I will probably be posting updates as I move along.\n\nAnd as always, I feel like it\u2019s pretty obvious at this point but please keep in mind that I am **A+ retarded**.\n\nBut hey, don\u2019t take my word for it. Here is a [real testimonial](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j62ihd/daily_discussion_thread_for_october_06_2020/g7wrapy?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from a satisfied customer.\n\n**In summation**\n\n1.

        "selftext": "I played COSTCO call options since May and made about $200k. COSTCO is a stock with low intrinsic value options and rewards you well if you are patient. This is not a swing trade or a 10 bagger but in my opinion, it was always a sure thing, hence I was able to buy 100 or 200 call options. I've played other tech options, NVDA, AMD, AMZN, TSLA but it always felt like pure gambling. I made about 40k on NVDA but got burned for 20k on TSLA and AMZN. I don't recommend playing options on tech stocks unless you're YOLOing stimulus money or a paycheck.\n\nOption trading on WSB has become exactly that but there are still handful savvy people that are playing smart. Sure, in the beginning when you have less than $10k, you can take higher risk for higher reward. But when you accumulate over 50k or 100k, you can invest on plays like this that gives you 10-15% return consistently without having to risk losing 80%.\n\nMy advice is once you hit 50k, don't chase option plays like ZOOM or obscure meme plays like PRPL.   \nPlay monthly options on lower intrinsic value call options like WMT or TGT. Don't hold for earnings unless you have options that are over 1 month till expiration.\n\nIf you manage to get past 100k, then put 75k in APPL or AMZN or NVDA and you can do whatever you want with the 25k. This has worked for me and hopefully this inspires this community to play smarter and make money.\n\nNow I will go to local Costco and get some rotisserie chicken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fevp23hboiq51.png?width=1053&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcc0b91dfe2ccfcd8c5ee0ea0eefd0ab2d28a254\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbst9qwgoiq51.png?width=972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0891a965f84b59a91b7341b519bf5588fbe61c7d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpj57o7loiq51.png?width=941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c49437265d557ea40dc8cbc7446a68df76a36c3e\n\nIt wasn't all glory and there were days when my unrealized loss was 30k or 40k but you have to set a price target or an exit date and be discipline. I took this screenshot to remind myself to always be humble and disciplined. I'm still holding some of these and they are now 20k unrealized gain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3o38stz9piq51.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6b3da0b4825d1543c15e1c91996bd1e00480107",

        "selftext": "\\#**WHY #AMD #IS #GOING #TO #THE  #MOON**  \n\n\n\\#1\n\n**Heavily Rumoured New CPUs (including 16 core gaming CPU).**\n\nThis would be revolutionary and will put investors into a complete frenzy. The slide was leaked and confirmed by [videocardz.com](https://videocardz.com) which is a very authentic source for tech news. A 16 core CPU that pulls 105w at a reasonable price will be GAME-CHANGING, and everyone will want to get their hands on it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4y8kvv3blq51.png?width=1569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0e772c7f4963cb569eb0024dcee84fb63b4697e\n\nAlong with this game-changing chip, 3 additional CPUs are rumored to be released.   \n\n\n\\#2\n\n**Big Navi having possibly better performance**  \nThere have been leaks off Newegg of Big Navi being better than the 3080. Even if the cards are neck in neck AMD will be able to paint the 6000 series cards as better due to minor discrepancies.\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\t5,120\t1,500\t16GB GDDR6\t512\t256-bit\t300  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\t3,840\t1,500\t12GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t200  \n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6700 XT\t2,560\t1,500\t6GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t150  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0zjsju2clq51.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14551f974837dfc21662c24da268d5284287d169\n\n  \n\\#3\n\n**NVIDIA 3rd Party Card Catastrophe**\n\n*(this section is from my previous post)*\n\nSo most GPUs are made by a 3rd party. AMD and NVIDIA make the actual \"brain\" of the GPU but 3rd party partners add onto it for better performance (very basic explanation). Don't ask me why this is, it is just mainly because of logistical reasons.\n\nBut that is not the point, the point is that the great majority of GPUs are third-party cards meaning that they get to change around the design of the PCB. The issue here is that some of these third-party partners cheaped out on little capacitors.\n\nBy cheapening out it is leading to bad power delivery. The only way to fix this rn is to downclock the card which the normal person doesn't know how to do and doesn't expect is necessary when they are buying a 500$+ piece of hardware.\n\nI feel like if there is a mass callback that will be bad PR. NVIDIA could always release drivers that make the cards run below their listed spec but i'm not sure if people will really want that even if the performance loss is marginal.\n\nEVGA already confirmed the suspicions that these cards were crashing because of capacitor issues. It may be different for other companies but at least for EVGA this is what they are saying currently.\n\n**But why does this matter??**\n\nPeople who were looking to pick up a next-gen GPU right away are now hesitant and will wait for AMDS offerings. The people who did return their GPUs will also possibly wait. Faulty cards will most likely get a down clock which will make Big Navi look better. It supposedly already is better and this 3-5% difference could really change people's minds.  \n\n\n\\#4 \n\nLisa Su is an absolute unit. She will for sure talk about their timeline and plans for 5nm/3nm. I am guessing that this will rally investors to invest because they will see shinny 5nm/3nm while Intel is just getting to 10nm.  \n\n\n**POSITIONS:**  \n\\+95 call  (exp 12/18)  \n\\- 100 call (exp 12/18)\n\n(*call me a pussy for using a debit spread but I think its the best for my case)*  \n\n\nif you have something else you want to share comments below and I will add it!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu)\n\n[https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications)\n\n*This is not financial advice just me presenting the facts and the possibility of a callback.*  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2ciqo9vdlq51.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d0fa79a87e74390c112a07e8d93a82c5a8476e",

Would graciously appreciate someone with maybe some more knowledge opinion.\n\nWould love any insight you guys have on these tickers. Thanks again any constructive thoughts are GREATLY appreciated.  \n\n$NEE - Amazing Long term growth. Attempting to buyout other companies. Dividend has been rapidly increasing. Is the growth potentially done or near done?\n\n$AVGO - Amazing long term growth. Dividend has been RAPIDLY increasing. Can't imagine Broadcom getting smaller but just like NEE how much more growth is there still?\n\n$NVDA - INSANE long term growth. Big player in the market. Doubtful they are going anywhere in the future\n Trash dividend. And once again they have grown so much idk how much more they are likely to grow.\n\n$PYPL - Amazing long term growth. PayPal rumored to be moving into Ecommerence. Huge player for electronic transactions. I forsee them continuing to grow into the future.. No dividend \n\n$PENN - Amazing long term growth. Analysis put a $100 PT. I dont see gambling EVER going anywhere in the future. \n\n$COST - Decent long term growth. I feel like Costco is going to continue to grow as a super giant into the future. Dividend is slightly lacking. \n\n$U - New IPO. Unity is a huge player in the mobile app industry. If expect growth with them branching out. Not to mention I dont see mobile app using another company to this degree.\n\n$T - Mainly for the dividend. 10yr growth is a mere 2% on average. I feel like HBO MAX and the casual dividend increase will make up for this long term. \n\n$JPM - Decent long term growth. Bad PR recently but I dont see that holding it back. Dividend is pretty prime and the banking sector will grow once interest rates are settled. \n\n$CRSR - New IPO.HUGE player in the ESports community. Doesn't seem to be slowing down at all. Big on Twitch.tv with sponsorships and the streaming industry. Esport is a rapidly growing industry. Sadly no dividend as of now. \n\n$KIRK - There site is a overstock wayfair look alike. In the future I can see them rapidly growing just as those did. Even to some degree the growth potential would be massive.\n\n$JMIA - Essentially the amazon of Europe/Africa. Branching out into the African market. The growth on this seems like it could be exponential.\n\n$AGO - New IPO. Sells camping gear as well as GUNS and AMMO. Comparing it to camping world [$CWH] seems like there's alot of potential growth in the market.",

        "selftext": "AMD will explode next week.\n\nFollowing these [directional plays](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1312026909002231808?s=21) I really think we will see big moves in AMD next week. \n\nThe reason es very simple. \n\nTheir cpu leaked. It has better perfomance than intel and will likely be cheaper in price. \n\nhttps://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-9-5900x-leak-suggests-12-core-cpu-is-a-huge-leap-forward-from-3900x\n\nNVDA, the long competitor, is currently unable to stock more chips. AMD can keep up with demand. \n\nThe new consoles havebAMD chips in them and will boost sales come earnings.\n\nAMD will fronteun this news so get in now.",
