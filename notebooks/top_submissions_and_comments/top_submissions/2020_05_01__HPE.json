        "selftext": "A lot of people act like the market has left everyone behind but there are still great companies on extreme discounts in a variety of sectors, including tech. Here are some stocks from my watchlist that are still well below highs:\n\n**Brookfield Asset Management - BAM** (26.17% down from 52w high) - a diversified asset manager company involved in real estate, renewable power, infrastructure and private equity assets. As safe a real estate play as you can make because of the wide moat. COVID-19 was the first snag they hit since 2008.\n\n**Workday - WDAY** (26.56% down from 52w high) -  provides enterprise cloud applications to  help its customers to manage critical business functions and optimize their financial and human capital resources. Beat Q1 earnings by a big margin and are still down.\n\n**Bruker Corp - BRKR** (28.32% down from 52w high) - makes scientific instruments and analytical/diagnostic instruments for a wide array of fields. Missed earnings this quarter, but this was a stock that grew 1200% from 2008 til pre-COVID.\n\n**Disney - DIS** (29.75% down from 52w high) - yes their parks are in limbo and many of their stores worldwide are shut down and their movies are suspended. But Disney has the resources to weather this storm, and Disney+ has been a lifesaver. If looking long-term, this price may never be seen again once they announce reopenings.\n\n**Exact Sciences Corp - EXAS** (32.29% down from 52w high) - Makes cancer screening tests. COVID-19 has temporarily slowed cancer screenings, but this could bounce back and has grown immensely the past 5 years. Additionally they acquired Genomic Health last year, which focused on genomic based genetic research for cancer detection.\n\n**Hewlett Packard - HPQ** (35.6% down from 52w high) - Strikes me as one of the most underrated large caps right now. They make great products, and it's highly likely an increase in remote work led to increased sales of laptops and printers. \n\n**JP Morgan - JPM** (36.26% down from 52w high) - The best run of the investment banks imo, as they are highly diversified. For a company hammered this hard, they are bound to come out of this even better positioned for the future. \n\n**Conoco Phillips - COP** (37% down from 52w high) - Has already shot way up the past month (I regret selling more than half my shares), but still far below it's highs so plenty more room to rebound. They struck me as one of the better positioned oil companies to make it through this and bounce back given their rock solid financials.\n\n**Raytheon - RTX** (38.64% down from 52w high) - whoever is President, it's hard to bet against the military-industrial complex. Pre-COVID, up 400% from the 2008 trough. Commercial and business aviation connections have definitely hurt them in the short term, but their military applications give them a broader moat, and they seem to be much better run than Boeing, for example.\n\n**StoneCo - STNE** (41.89% down from 52w high) - basically the Square of Brazil, from what I understand, and traded on Nasdaq. Develops fintech solutions for electronic commerce across in-store, online, and mobile channels for small and medium sized businesses. Unlike Square, it is apparently still accurately valued in a time of concern for small and medium size businesses. The added long-term benefit of being in a developing economy also seems to be a good selling point.\n\n**Pinterest - PINS** (49.42% down from 52w high) - has been considered a loser financially for a while, but it seems with the arrangement with SHOP  they are finally figuring out how to better monetize their platform -- which has an extremely loyal following among women especially. The potential for future growth for a stock that has surpassed Snapchat as the #3 social media site in domestic users (47% of internet users in the US, 2/3rds of those female) is enormous. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on these and their future potential for growth? How soon do you think they bounce back to ATHs?",

        "selftext": "Previous to covid, approximately 7,700 people died every day in the US from whatever the fuck. \n\nSo let\u2019s say 150 people per state, per day even though that is skewed as fuck. For simplicity, let\u2019s go with it. \n\nWe began lockdowns in March 16th. 65 days ago.\n\n65 days x 150 people = 9,750. \nCovid-19 deaths = 1,369 deaths in 65 days so far in TX\n\nCurrent non-recovered cases in Texas is 19,184 plus whatever people don\u2019t know they have it.\n\nThese stats are from google.\n\nNow let\u2019s go to the CDC website updated 15 mins ago. \n\n59,747 people died from non-covid shit since this started. \n\n876 are confirmed Covid, 5,331 is the aggregate all of sickness deaths (pneumonia, influenza, covid). \n\nWe are open at 50% now for a day, and have been open with limitations for approximately 3 weeks now. \n\nI am still taking precautions and not being some of those idiots facefucking in front of the county buildings, but shit, a typical year has 3,500+ motor vehicle deaths in this state alone. \n\nTL:DR= the worst is definitely over, and 876 confirmed CDC deaths from Covid-19 for a population of approximately 30 million seems? The death rate is very low in this state. Second largest state by population. \n\nPositions: Both HPQ and HPE slightly OTM calls, $LL 8c 6/19, MARK $1c 6/19 and further, T $32c 7/17 or whatever, and leaps in oil since negative day.",
