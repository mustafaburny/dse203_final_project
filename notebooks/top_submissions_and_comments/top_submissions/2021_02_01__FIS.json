        "selftext": "*Edit: There's a lot of great responses and info about my questions in the comments! Will try to incorporate that into the post as I go, or make a followup tomorrow!*  \n\n\n  \nFirst off, my position: 1900 shares of GME @ 30, plus 5 calls @ $250. Peak value was nearly 500k.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/96g5d07z45f61.png?width=1007&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e983f8d1a6b56bcf4201d32a56b0c2535886d5b\n\n*This is not financial advice, I'm not an expert, etc*\n\n\\*\\*WHY SHOULD WE STILL HOLD?\\*\\* I know there's a lot of sentiment around solidarity, and sticking it to the man, and 'fuck it, I'm down so much anyway'. NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD REASONS TO HOLD. I'm here to talk about the actual reasons to hold.\n\nHere's our biggest problem: **Misinformation**\n\nThere is a lot of information being spread around like manure. Mostly unread, mostly un-disseminated, basically just a whole bunch of positive sounding claims meant to serve as confirmation bias.\n\nHow do we ensure we're not just buying into bullshit? **By determining exactly what data we have available to make decisions as of right now**. That is what I intend to review (and hopefully gather from you apes) here today.\n\n**A REVIEW OF THE FORCES ACTING ON GME**\n\n1. **Fundamental Value:** This isn't relevant right now. GME is presently a $20/share company, even with Ryan Cohen shooting magic rainbows out of his ass it's not worth more than $60 until they actually start changing their business model. When that happens the value will go up, for now 30% above expected online revenue growth doesn't mean shit in the bigger picture.\n2. **Momentum:** This is the biggest reason we hit $500/share, and the biggest reason we're still at $90, way above fundamental value. Here's something to consider: **Momentum, not the squeeze, is why the share price is where it is -** rather, the growing global awareness of the squeeze provided the evidence needed for everyone to rush to get onboard.  But, people are also idiots. Momentum can change directions quickly from an upward to downward pressure, and can be easily manipulated, as we've seen.\n3. **THE SHORT SQUEEZE:** What actually causes the high short interest to result in raised share prices? Short sellers who are actually (not theoretically) pressured into closing their positions at an overall loss, and en masse. If most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions, then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price. *Do you actually think Melvin Capital was at any point margin called?*  If/when they exited, they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest, to the point that they were straight up given a multi-billion dollar bailout by their competitors! These people don't play by the same rules as you, you fucking braindead monkey.\n4. **The Gamma Squeeze:** Last Friday, for the second Friday in a row, a vast majority of calls expired In The Money, and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today (T+2 rule). The theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didn't have good risk models and didn't hedge their calls well enough, and so didn't actually  own enough underlying shares to hand over, and now need to rush to buy them at market price. Could that be why there was a massive spike from 80 to 150 this afternoon? Maybe. **But a gamma squeeze can also backfire**. All those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy, or the margin to borrow. That means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace.\n5. Straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationOh, best believe it happened, and is still happening. Just to review the hits:\n   1. DTCC and/or Retail brokers prevent buying, artificially suppressing demand for Thu price drop and locking up people's money till they could transfer elsewhere.\n   2. Sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling\n   3. A massive media campaign to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in Silver\n   4. Retail brokers cancelling orders, restricting limit prices, enforcing unwanted stop losses (eToro),\n   5. Illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OK, BUT YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS**\n\n***WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY?***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo, really, I'm asking. Our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information. I will edit and update this list as information is shared. Meanwhile I'll try to flesh out a framework as best I can.\n\n**Argument #1: The Squeeze is not Squoze because Short Interest is still high**\n\n* Claim: As long as the Short Interest exceeds the Float, there is a supply problem for short sellers. This *may* translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time, driving the squeeze.\n* Evidence needed: What is the current short interest?\n   * S3 partners provides estimates using a model, and as of today claim it is only **51% of free float**:Source: [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7e4mes1qf5f61.png?width=277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfb3da83d0aaaeb2256e11bf7a3e3eaf8b31de90\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Ortex data provides another estimate using another model, and as of yesterday claims it is only 27 mil shares, only a million shares difference from S3Source: [https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yo2s5e2cg5f61.png?width=1691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d83701a452b5aaa079e3a3948cecbbb3feb77b5a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **REAL DATA:** The SEC releases reported short interest twice a month. The most recent data we have is from Jan 15, and wasn't released to the public until Jan 27.\\*\\*On Jan 15 the SI was 131%.\\*\\*The next report for Jan 31 won't be available until Feb 9.Frankly, we can't rely on the REAL data, because it's delayed too long to be relevant.\n* Evidence needed: What is the actual free float?\n   * I still need help finding this. I know 71 Million shares have been issued overall, but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within 3 days. If 27 million shorts still need to close, how many shares are readily available?\n   * Yahoo Finance puts Float at 46.89 mil shares, FWIWSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)\n\n**Argument #2: There hasn't been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close**\n\n* Claim: assuming \\~27 mil shorted, not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions.\n* Evidence: Someone explain to me how this isn't enough volume for shorts to cover. Mark Cuban said pretty much the same thing in his AMA today.\n\n|Date|Trade Volume|\n|:-|:-|\n|2/2 Tue|77.8m|\n|2/1 Mon|37.3m|\n|1/29 Fri|50.5m|\n|1/28 Thu|58.5m|\n|1/27 Wed|93.3m|\n\n**Argument #3: Short Sellers will are under pressure to close, so the squeeze is coming**\n\n* Claim: Short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions, and will eventually prefer (or be forced) to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze.\n* Evidence needed: Shorts are (on average) in a losing position at current share price ($90), and can't just close right now at profit\n* Evidence needed: Any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Argument #4: Market manipulation shenanigans didn't work, and retailers didn't sell off en masse, creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply.**\n\n* Claim: Price dips happened during low volume trading (short ladder market manipulation etc), and the longs are holding fast.\n* Counterevidence: THE MOTHERFUCKING $300 PRICE DROP YOU DUMB FUCKING NUGGETS\n* Evidence: This popular screenshot of Fidelity's order ratio:Source: [https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5jnmtl00l5f61.png?width=1021&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9e676fbd3e0811f826463f14d4b9c12971ed6b2\n\n* Counterargument: Order counts don't mean shit. For every share traded there is a buyer and a seller. So 100k buyers buy one share each, and 40k sellers sell 3 shares each. Or 20k buyers place 5 buy orders for one share each, and there are less buyers than sellers overall. WHO KNOWS? This strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness, serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders.\n* **Evidence needed:** Something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold.\n* Evidence needed: other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders. Fidelity is just one broker, and a retail broker at that. Hedgies don't trade with Fidelity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Argument #5: The biggest dips were driven by short-ladder attacks during low volume periods**\n\n* Claim: the decrease in price from 500 to 90 is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling (short ladders), and not so much by change in momentum.\n* Evidence: At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors. Essentially, round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices\n   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual\\_representation\\_of\\_a\\_short\\_ladder\\_attack\\_4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/)\n   * [https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg)\n* Counterargument: short ladder attacks are straight up not real, conspiracy theory confirmation bias invented by WSB itself: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short\\_ladders\\_are\\_not\\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short_ladders_are_not_real/)\n* Evidence needed: I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts (100 shares at a time), could use that. \\\\\n* Counterargument: The artificially reduced volume from Robin Hood and other brokers limiting access has now been largely removed, as RH allows 100 shares and by now people had time to transfer funds to another broker. Damage to momentum was done, but if there is still a valid thesis it should just mean people can buy the dip, right?\n* Evidence needed: That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume. I'm seeing a lot, especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77a0euotp5f61.png?width=1884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62b0af04608cb5fb235895d8bbd03b9e19a00588\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Argument #6: 'You are here on the VW short squeeze chart'**\n\n* Claim: See how the famous VW short squeeze also had a massive price drop before it blew up? That's us right now.\n* Evidence: A single, solitary chart\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mx6fs2f5r5f61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60cc9096c46097b7328c59c2572b3466e5241131\n\n* Counterargument: the VW scenario was not the same as the GME play. VW share liquidity plummeted literally overnight when it was revealed that Porsche had bought up 90% of the float (check me on that fact, I'm repeating secondhand info). See the big dip AFTER the squeeze? How do we know we aren't *there*?\n* Evidence needed: IDK, some kind of coherent explanation of why VW dipped like that, and why a similar dip would be expected in the GME Play\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill edit with more, my primate fingers are hurting from trying to press the keys and my handler needs to readjust my helmet.",

Secondly if they would\u2018ve closed and therefore bought shares, the price wouldn\u2019t be where it is atm. It would be way higher.

With a team that includes clinical veterinary professionals, it is Zomedica\u2019s mission to provide veterinarians the opportunity to lower costs, increase productivity, and grow revenue while better serving the animals in their care.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Investors\n\nZomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. (US:ZOM) has 45 institutional owners and shareholders that have filed 13D/G or 13F forms with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). These institutions hold a total of **54,381,501 shares**. Largest shareholders include Cambridge Investment Research Advisors, Inc., **Vanguard Group Inc, VTSMX - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares, BlackRock Inc.**, Millennium Management Llc, FSMAX - Fidelity Extended Market Index Fund, Geode Capital Management, Llc, Citadel Advisors Llc, Northern Trust Corp, and Winton Capital Group Ltd.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Team\n\nI checked their employees who are on LinkedIn, I can confirm they are all top notch workers.\n**Newly appointed CEO, Robert Cohen (former Pfizer exec) has taken three different biotech companies from $0.30 to $8.00/share.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#What is Truforma\n\nZomedica's flagship product, TRUFORMA commercializes March 30th, 2021. TRUFORMA is a point-of-care machine that uses bulk acoustic waves (BAW) technology to detect &amp; diagnose adrenal diseases (in dogs) and thyroid diseases (in dogs and cats). This compact machine delivers results in ~18 mins and carries 70+ global patents.  TRUFORMA does not require pre-market regulatory approval for use with companion animals in the United States.\n[Link](https://zomedica.com/truforma-2)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Major competitor\n\nThe current competition is IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ: $IDXX). It's worth noting that vets currently have to send off samples to these guys and not only is it expensive, but it causes delays in diagnosis (days). TRUFORMA allows for the same tests to take place, on-site at a fraction of the price within 18 minutes. Key members of the IDEXX team have left the company to join Zomedica.\n[Link.](https://investors.zomedica.com/node/7636/html)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#News and upcoming catalysts\n\nZomedica had 2 fantastic weeks, it's price is rising since they announced truforma will be launched at the end of March.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nWhen the stock price was at almost $3 they announced a *BOUGHT DEAL* to rise 173.5 millions dollars at $1.90 per share. Surprisingly this happened just 2 days ago and the price already recovered and is now around $2.55 per share.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nZomedica announced that the money will be used to speed up the research and launch of new products.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n As of today Zomedica is **DEBT FREE**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe upcoming financial annual report that will be published at the end of this month, the announcement of a new big potential investor who bought the offered shares, and certain news about Truforma when close to launch could really trigger an unprecedented rise of this stock.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nBy investing today you could easily have a share worth up to $8 on product launch, or even double digits when they'll be announcing new incoming products and patents. This is a stock that has common sudden bull runs and a community of retailers who are expecting to hold their shares for years.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nMore technical data can be found at: https://fintel.io/s/us/zom\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nP.S.: This is one of the few stocks that realized gains today. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nTldr: This company has no flaws, it's backed by huge investors, has no debt, a lot of cash reserve, and just made a machine that in 18 minutes could tell if your dog/cat is a paper hand or diamond hand \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nLast weekend I created a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?), in which I documented which brokers stopped people from purchasing specific securities, and which ones didn't.\n\nBefore it gets forgotten, I want to bring that list back again, and insist that you get a new broker if yours is one of the bad ones.\n\nThis is a much, MUCH bigger issue than you think, and this can and WILL affect you eventually, if you stay with a broker that decides that you cannot trade a security that they don't want you to trade. Note that the securities affected were not just meme stocks, several large stocks some of you might own or have heard about were restricted and their price was thus manipulated, including:\n\n- General Motors\n- Rolls Royce\n- Trivago\n- Workhorse Group\n- Jaguar Health\n\nAnd [many more](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html).\n\nWhen boomer stocks get affected, this means the entire free market is at risk and the next time this happens you might be the one unable to trade your favorite stock if you continue using a bad discount broker. \n\n**Whether this is the broker's fault or their clearinghouse's fault is irrelevant, the result is your inability to engage in the free market.** This behavior needs to be punished to ensure other brokers don't start doing the same thing.\n\nHere is my list of brokers which I will continue to update, as per the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?):\n\n\n### Horrible Brokers -

        "selftext": "**EDIT: I am not claiming that the squeeze will be squoze tomorrow (prepare to hold for weeks). My claim is that another gap up this week is guaranteed if we hold $300.**\n\n**EDIT: you diamond hands really need to step up. If we break today, past two weeks will be all for nothing. As another post pointed out, shorts will do anything to break the 13-day failure to deliver chain, as otherwise the SEC will immediately force them to cover.**\n\nWith GME pushed above $320 Friday, a huge wall of calls were exercised. Anyone who sold calls is now deeply, deeply underwater.\n\nThe longs haven\u2019t won the battle yet though: holders of the short calls (largely Citadel at this point) have **two days** to deliver the shares. (See source below).\n\nIf I was in their position, would I start covering today  and therefore trigger a gamma squeeze? HECK NO. \n\nInstead, If I was a short, I would kick the can one more day while I try one more hail mary. I will attempt a large short-ladder attack to at least push the price down (if not outright induce panic-selling). At the same time, I would approach a large institution with shares (think Fidelity or Blackrock), and make an offer for a large volume of shares.\n\nBy pushing the price down, I can reduce my losses, and at the same time strengthen my hand in negotations with institutions that can offer shares.\n\nIf the hail mary works, shorts can at least get away alive tomorrow without even incurring \u201cfailure to deliver\u201d\n\nHowever, if retail is able to kill them at $300-$320 by open tomorrow, there will be a gamma squeeze the likes we have never seen this week (probably not THE squeeze yet, but a squeeze nonetheless). \n\nPanic-buying will start. Not all firms will do this panic buying, but I figure there are enough smaller HF shorts who don\u2019t have a legal team to temporarily stonewall failure-to-deliver lawsuits. Those have no choice but to start covering.\n\n\n**TLDR: no squeeze today because shorts still have one day of breathing room. Don\u2019t just \ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83e\udd32, BUY until we are at $300**\n\nGME\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEDIT: \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83e\udd32\ud83e\udd32 = \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEDIT: for those asking for source on that GME is a physically-settled option: see this: The SEC only granted cash-settlement on a specific set of ETF tickers  (https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nyseamer/2020/34-88131.pdf)\n\nFor info on the T+2 settlement days on see page 9 of 42 (or 15/48 for whole document) of this: https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/filings/orgrules/17/06/rule061417occdco001.pdf\n\n\u201cRule 903 governs the obligation of a Clearing Member to deliver when either a Delivery Advice or OCC directs that settlement be made on a broker-to-broker basis. It currently specifies the delivery date for physically-settled options as the third business day following the day on which the exercise notice was, or is deemed to have been, properly tendered to OCC. Rule 903 also generally specifies the delivery date for physically settled security futures as the third business day following the maturity date. Under the proposed rule change, these references in Rule 903 to the \u201cthird\u201d business day would be changed to the \u201csecond\u201d business day.\u201d",

        "selftext": "I am not new to the risk of penny stocks,  been playing with pennies for about 8 years now. Luckily, I have had a lot more success than fails but do not take this as \"financial advice\" and more something to think about.\n\nLets talk $HCMC.. the most hyped stock in my opinion over this past weekend and is being pushed for it to still have momentum. If you truly believe this stock will hit a $1 you need to take a step back and learn how much is needed to move a stock with 105.1B Outstanding shares... to put it in perspective, Apple for example has 16.8B.. Apple the Trillion dollar company. I am not saying you can't take a quick gain but read on what share dilution is and how it effects the stock price. When the court decision does occur with HCMC, expect some movement but to move toward $1 the company needs to do a reverse split. I am sure there is a lot more into how a company can reduce its outstanding shares but that is a common one I have seen in pennies. I won't go in-depth in what a reverse split is but look up on that. This stock will move if truly everyone actually throws some cash in it but don't expect a full dollar with 105 B Outstanding shares.\n\nI understand  it can be challenging to filter on what will be the next 30% plus gain in one day. Maybe you have seen 100% - 1000% gains on stock websites. Some of you I see asking for recommendations on a $100 to play with on your first investment. You got to know what would be considered a \"pump and dump\" and a legitimate company.  Let's take $INKW for example, this stock had increased close to 80% today. A good amount of people have posted about this stock the past few weeks, and today it moved roughly 80%,.  Deals with Walmart, selling out on Amazon, and moving toward Hemp water. There is actual PR (Press Release) with recent information on the stock. It takes 10 mins to learn all this about the company, or what you will see people call DD (Due Diligence).  10 mins of my day before thinking hmm  should I jump in? Am I missing the ride? or is this a long term play for me?\n\nThe market for me is just a bunch of hype and speculation. ESPECIALLY PENNIES. I personally don't see pennies as long-term investments. I get in and get out like my wife's boyfriend when I go to work. but you got to know what works best for you and if you truly believe in the company. Lets take some other popular stocks I have seen posted here: $OZSC, $ILUS, $HITIF (admitting I own this one for my weed play), $TSNP. I have seen these stocks have solid PR but would not jump in unless DD was made.\n\nAs you grow to be an experience trader, learn how to read candlestick graphs. It can be a snoozer learning but if you understand it, it will help a good amount if you want to buy in dips or see when you want to sell. ITS OKAY IF YOUR STOCK GOES RED. Yes, pennies are more risk. I had days losing everything when I first was trying to invest in them but I also had days with huge gains. Its okay to hold but hold knowing your risk tolerance. Remember, you thought long-term because you believed in this company and it has solid potential. Long-term is long-term so don't let a bad week make you take a big lost only to see it rise again the following.\n\nI am in no way an expert in investing nor trying to give you investing advice. This is more for people who really want to understand how to invest, but the high from one of your stocks performing at a 100% and letting your emotions get to you can be a rough lesson to learn when you expect it every time. I didn't understand how to play pennies at all firs starting and for me losing even $100 was a big deal at the time.\n\nThere is a lot of pump/dump post on here I been seeing from day old accounts. I even look at the companies they are trying to pump. If there is no website, social media is terrible, or real product ... it is a P/D.\n\nI ask all experience traders to share their advice on this post so we can combat the bots we have been seeing for the crowd.\n\nGood Luck to all the new investors. I consider pennies as a daily gamble more than a long-term. I am sure others view it different.\n\nEDIT:\n\nJust scrolling through frequent questions -\n\nI use TD Ameritrade as my broker. Look into how to use their thinkorswim platform. \n\nI recently opened a Fidelity account to avoid OTC Market trading fee\u2019s though. \n\nFound an article that gives a good summary of some major brokers for pennies:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.timothysykes.com/blog/best-broker-for-penny-stocks/amp/\n\nI never been a fan of Robinhood. I opened an account when it was up and coming but didn\u2019t like the layout and lack of stocks that were available to invest in. So not sure how it is today but I do know you can\u2019t invest in the OTC Market through this broker. \n\nAsking for my thoughts on a specific stock -\n\nI really don\u2019t know about some of the stocks that were posted on the comments so I have no thoughts. \nI see some popular come up, like $OGCN. But I don\u2019t know anything about that company besides it being popular on this subreddit. \n\nMessaging me to ask on what company you should \nInvest in -\n\nSorry, I don\u2019t want to answer that. Awesome how you took this post but again I am not an expert. Just sharing my years of experience. I invest with confidence but the risk will always be there. I don\u2019t want you to jump in a boat I wasn\u2019t aware had a hole in it.\n\nWhat I do when I find interest in a stock but unsure on it is put it on my watchlist. With Ameritrade I am able to keep tabs on its performance, press release, and most of all the dip!  But my watchlist consistently change. \n\nAdvice on learning  to read candle sticks -  \n\nMan, this for sure was challenging for me. Probably because it is boring to learn lol. YouTube taught me. I don\u2019t have any sound advice besides looking there. I can\u2019t find the video that I saw repetitively anymore but just searching for it, I see a good amount of people teaching. \n\nWhen I got comfortable, I experimented with $20 often to see if I had it down. I am sure some people just catch on to it, I wasn\u2019t one of them. But now it is crazy easy to read.",

        "selftext": "Honestly don't think its market manipulation like what WSB claims (i.e short ladder attacks). I already mentioned this here, but there are probably hedge funds who haven't shorted Gamestop who gauged the insane market sentiment of retail investors. So they rode the BB/AMC/NOK/GME wave, and then pulled out leaving retail as the bag holders.\n\nBut unlike AMC, NOK and GME, BB finally broke out of the correlation, and traded upward today. Which is a good sign and maybe due to the common sentiment that it's very undervalued and potentially has a very bright future with the IoT and EV market.\n\nFidelity Research gives it an average analyst score rating of 8.9/10 (9-10 is in the very bullish range), with the most notable analyst being Zacks Ranking. Seeking Alpha seems to place it at a fair value price of around $15-17. It's now around $12. Let's see how this plays out.\n\nMy current cost basis is $15.",

These retail accounts (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) are not counted in the institutional share reporting, as these are not institutionally managed assets.\n\nMy assumptions are as follows:\n\n* 10% of these accounts own shares of GME\n* An average of 3 shares per holder\n\nSince it seems that retail owners are still buying (from my own perspective) this seems to be a safe assumption that r**etail ownership stands at 38,595,000 shares** in total.\n\nInstitutional Ownership\n\nAccording to the Finra-Markets.Morningstar website, under the Shareholders tab, **ownership of Institutions is approximately 151,000,000 Shares** as of the most recent filings.\n\nFund Ownership\n\nAccording to the Finra-Markets.Morningstar website, under the Shareholders tab, **ownership of Funds is approximately 40,000,000 Shares** as of the most recent filings.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nAccording to the [Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/) website, under the insiders &gt; insider trades tab, **ownership of Insiders is approximately 23,704,787 Share**s as of the most recent filings.\n\nPrice Basis:\n\nA post on the WSBN subreddit, authored by [u/joethejedi67](https://www.reddit.com/u/joethejedi67/) on the 10th of February, 2021 showcased a closing of 7,056,150 shares resulted in a price increase of $327.09/share by the end of the day. This is based on the FINRA reports and dates from 1/13/2021 - 1/27/2021.\n\nAs a Floor: If we assume a linear increase with a direct ratio of short coverage to price increase ($0.0000467/short), then coverage of 219,091,451 shorts would directly increase the price of GME by $10,231.57. This is not inclusive of the current price.\n\nI am aware that direct ratios are not indicative of how markets work, so a floor of 75% of the above number is **$7,763.68** personally seems reasonable.\n\nAs a Ceiling: I will refer to an AI on the ceiling, as I am not intelligent enough to create a formula on something with this much potential data. The price would increase by approximately $130,000. This might not be unreasonable, as Tulip Mania raged on,\n\n&gt;\u201cthe best of tulips cost upwards of $750,000 in today's money (but with many bulbs trading in the $50,000 - $150,000 range). By 1636, the demand for the tulip trade was so large that regular marts for their sale were established on the Stock Exchange of Amsterdam, in Rotterdam, Harlaem, and other towns.\u201d\n\nI will take the same rule as the floor pricing, and take 75% of the above price. My personal Ceiling arrives at $97,500.\n\nTaking an average of the two numbers, weighting the floor at 66% and the ceiling at 33%, **brings my personal target price to $37,675.79.** With the outstanding shares sitting at 69,746,960; the market cap would theoretically be $2,627,771,818,098.40.\n\n**$2.627 trillion would make GME the most valuable company by 6.88%.** ($169 billion difference.)\n\nThe top 5 most valuable companies in the world are as follows:\n\n1. Saudi Aramco - $2.458 Trillion\n2. Apple - $2.213 Trillion\n3. Microsoft - $1.653 Trillion\n4. Amazon - $1.596 Trillion\n5. Delta Electronics - $1.435 Trillion\n\nThis would put GME in line with the VW 2008 short squeeze, where **VW became the most valuable company in the world by 7.87%** ($27 billion difference.)\n\n***ETF Shorting***\n\nRecently, we have learned that certain ETF\u2019s are being shorted to short GME by proxy.\n\nSPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (XRT) currently has Institutional ownership of 25,662,569 shares compared to 6,700,000 outstanding shares. This is 383.02% of issued shares.\n\n\u2022 [u/aah\\_soy](https://www.reddit.com/u/aah_soy/) posted the original DD for this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ljwo3v/serious\\_researchers\\_needed\\_now\\_i\\_think\\_i\\_know/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ljwo3v/serious_researchers_needed_now_i_think_i_know/)\n\n\u2022 [u/jeepers\\_sheepers](https://www.reddit.com/u/jeepers_sheepers/) discovered that on 02/01/2021, XRT short float peaked at 800% -

        "selftext": "Look, I get that some of you genuinely tried to transfer to another broker, but that legitimate gambling addiction that you have to the stonk market prevented you from closing out all your positions and letting your trades settle (even though if you did you probably wouldn't have lost 80% by FOMO'ing into weed).\n\nBut by staying in Robinhood, you scream \"Oh please daddy Vlad Tenev, please impale my asshole one more time like you did with Geee Emmm eeeEEEEE!!!\" \n\n# Why you should use a real broker and stop using Robinhood:\n\n**Not being glued to a chart all day**\n\nHow many of you have your eyes glued to a fucking chart all day long because Robinhood is mobile and looks cool? This seriously is not helping any of your positions. You're more likely to dump what might be a solid play too early because you're staring at the ticker and have TP hands and panic when SPY is down 1% for the day. Think about all the times where if you held a position for a little while longer you would've printed. Robinhood looks amazing as an app and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. If the sell button is right in front of you at all times, you're gonna be more likely to dump when you shouldn't. Get a broker with a shitty looking UI so you aren't glued to a chart all day. Trust me, your relationships and work will thank you.\n\n**Access to penny stocks**\n\nEver want to trade OTC penny stocks and make some real bank? It might be a good thing that some people don't have access to them given the inherent risk. But for some unknown reason, RH makes it easy to yolo your whole life savings into 0DTE so penny stocks are pretty safe compared to the options you can trade.\n\nI wrote a DD on a penny stock on another subreddit and I got DMs about how to buy it on RH. Bruh please stop. Use a real broker.\n\n**Actual customer support**\n\nI haven't used Robinhood customer support for anything, but I've heard it's god awful. I'm gonna sound like a shill, but I've been using Schwab for the past six years and the customer support is amazing.\n\n**Instant transfers**\n\nAgain, gonna sound like I work for Schwab or something (I wish). Schwab and many other big banks allow you to instant transfer from your checking/savings to your brokerage account with no limit. \n\n**Huge assets under management**\n\nVanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab have 6.6, 3.3, and 3.23 trillion AUM. That's a lot of focken money. These brokers had no issues with the clearinghouses and did not limit trading on meme stocks. Gee Em Eeeeee would probably be 2000 if everyone used them.\n\n**Cool desktop/web apps**\n\nWanna look like a cool badass trader to pickup bitches at your local library? Schwab has a FREE trading platform with many cool features like the dark pool block trades. Add fancy crayons and lines to your charts too! Not gonna lie this app probably makes it harder to stop looking at stonks all day thus defeating point number 1. \n\n[Stolen from google images](https://preview.redd.it/kco97ssy16i61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccb7623017890bb5a0ea17d471ea54bec64c0f19)\n\n**Cons of not using Robinhood**:\n\nI'm not blind to the pros of Robinhood. \n\n\\- Looks cool\n\n\\- Options are free (Schwab charges $0.65 per option contract)\n\n\\- Easy to use\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo please, do yourself a favor and use a real broker :)",

        "selftext": "I'm using two accounts to try and buy a bunch of contracts and just ran across some major fuckery. One account is with Robinhood (I know, I know, but I'm waiting on options approval with my Fidelity brokerage account) and one account is a Fidelity Traditional IRA where I already have options enabled. I've started by buying these contracts on RH and have been paying an average of .14 or even .15 just to get filled. I've had a few .13 filled, but the bid in the quote below are my 7 for my Robinhood account. I'm very eager to buy these contracts, so while I wait for that to fill, I started buying on Fidelity in my IRA.

It also suggests the issue is due to the account I was attempting to withdraw to.\n\nSo, I tried withdrawing to the other one of my two linked bank accounts, only to receive an \"unexpected server error.\" The error message suggests trying again later. Well, I've tried about 10 different times today and get the same message every time.\n\nIt appears to me that RH is making it as difficult as possible for me to move my own money off their shady platform. Is anyone else experiencing this?",

Bottom line: if you have a **MARGIN** account with level 3 or 4 options approval, **THEY ARE LENDING OUT YOUR SHARES**. \n\nHowever, you can request that they **DO NOT** lend *specific shares*, or even *all of your shares*. You just have to call them. It will go through a 3-5 day adjudication process, and they will either approve it 1) with no changes to your options approvals, or 2) approve it and lower your option level. \n\nRetirement accounts: mine are at level 2 options approval, and the rep told me my shares are **NOT** being lent out to shorts due to these being IRAs and the level 2 options approval I currently have. \n\nNon-qual accounts: if you have level 3/4, they may downgrade your account to level 2 if you request your shares to be \"un-shortable.\" This ultimately comes down to the adjudication process. \n\nI hope this is helpful to someone holding shares, and I hope it hurts those cocksucker hedge funds. \n\nNot financial advice / I like the stock / GME &amp; AMC to the \ud83c\udf16\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "#How this perfect opportunity came about. \n\n\nFirst, I'll start with a primer on why $ALUS isn't already trading around $15+, which would be standard a newly announced merger for a company in the EV battery/energy storage sector (think QuantumScape $QS/ChargePoint $SBE/Stem $STPK). For those of you unfamiliar with the inner workings of SPACs, several hedge funds put their cash in a trust to get units @$10. Once a target company is announced, these arbitrage hedge funds often sell off their stake to new buyers to lock in profits. There are several arbitrage hedge funds that do this as their entire investment plan. That's why you'll often see a massive pop, followed by a minor selloff after almost every DA announcement.  **Here's how that's relevant, and why it created a perfect buying opportunity for $ALUS.** $ALUS announced a merger with FREYR Battery on January 29, 2021. Why is that date significant? This is when retail traders were entirely focused on meme stocks (which I shall not name), and the market-wide short squeeze was at its peak. It's also when hedge funds were selling off any profitable positions to short-cover as they needed to generate massive amounts of cash (this is what caused the broader market wide selloff). $ALUS got caught in this crossfire and sold off to $12 after opening at $15+ as hedge funds were selling heavily and retail/new buyers weren't buying as they were focused elsewhere. On Monday, Feb 1st eight SPAC mergers announced, and traders began focusing on them, leaving $ALUS severely overlooked. **These all created the perfect storm, resulting in an incredible buying opportunity at current levels.** \n\n.\n\n#**About FREYR Battery, and why my price target is a conservative $30**\n\n\n* FREYR has a $600 million fully committed Private Investment in Public Equity (\u201cPIPE\u201d) anchored by strategic and institutional investors, including Koch Strategic Platforms, Glencore, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, Franklin Templeton, Sylebra Capital, and Van Eck Associates Corporation. This PIPE is absolutely massive. **Why is a large PIPE important?** It conclusively proves that the valuation is fair and attracts further institutional interest. Historically, the mergers with a PIPE perform best, and mergers with a PIPE that is 2x larger than the trust value have inevitably gone above $20, with most hitting the $30+ mark. **FREYR fills both of these criteria easily.** \n\n* 100% of FREYR\u2019s existing shares will roll over into in the combined company. This is very bullish. By rolling over their entire equity, existing investors are holding. This can't be said about most other SPACs. \n\n* Siemens energy, the biggest renewable energy company in Europe, [will be using FREYR as their battery cell provider](https://www.electrive.com/2020/10/26/mou-siemens-energy-to-purchase-freyr-battery-cells/) for their energy storage solution. According to the agreement, Siemens Energy intends to purchase the volume from a fast-track production line that will be complete this year (2021). The volume is to be significantly increased again when a second fast-track line is planned to open at the end of 2022 or early 2023. Both companies are planning to cooperate on the development of the construction of stationary storage systems. **The Siemens deal alone is approximately $3 billion in revenue that is already booked.** \n\n* Speaking of energy storage, remind you of another SPAC winner? Stem ($STPK) is in the energy storage business and is currently trading at $35. Stem has an enterprise value of $5.5 billion at the existing share price. FREYR has an enterprise value of $1.5 Billion at current share price, and **energy storage is only one part of their business**\n\n* FREYR is moving fast. [Just yesterday, they signed a deal with Glencore to supply 3,700 tonnes of Cobalt.](https://www.mining.com/glencore-inks-ethical-cobalt-deal-with-norways-freyr/) FREYR is also building a giga factory with a capacity of **[43 GWh per year](https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/2021/01/new-battery-factory-northern-norway-list-nyse-world-switch-green-transport) (Twice the capacity Tesla's Gigafactories)** and has the full support of the EU, which is investing heavily in battery production. Recently, the European commission released a strategic action plan that commits to investing $1 Trillion ($1,000 Billion) into their battery manufacturing/energy storage capacities. The FREYR giga-factory is part of that initiative to [end EU reliance on Asia](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Europe-contender-electric-vehicle-batteries/98/i27), which currently has 80% of the world's battery manufacturing capacity.\n\n* And guess what, as /u/idunn0rick pointed out in the comments, 24m, FREYR's technology partner whose platform they're using,  has achieved [400-500 Wh/kg](https://24-m.com/markets/) cell energy density which surpasses what QuantumScape has advertised, and that Freyr is in talks with a [large, undisclosed Asian battery cell producer (minute 11:45)](https://youtu.be/efAIg5ZJ6Vk) that\u2019s keen on coming to Norway. \n\n\n* [Electric Vehicle \\(EV\\) battery manufacturing and marine applications](https://investorplace.com/2021/01/freyr-spac-merger-14-things-for-alus-stock-investors-to-know-about-the-clean-battery-play/) are the other two parts of FREYR's business. Based on their capacity, this alone should give them an enterprise value of several billion compared to similar battery manufacturers on the public market. For example, Microvast is valued at $6 billion currently, and their expected capacity is 9 GWh vs FREYR's 43 GWh expected capacity.  \n\n* Again, because I can not emphasize it enough, FREYR is still valued at a **shockingly low** $1.5 Billion at the current ~$12 share price. Between the energy storage business that is expected to be larger than STEM ($STPK, $5.5 billion EV) and with a battery manufacturing capacity that is expected to be 7x that of Microvast's ($THCB, $6 billion EV), FREYR's bull case valuation ranges in the $10s of billions. \n\n* And finally, the Technical Analysis. $ALUS was consolidating today after the original pop. Once this breaks out of the upper $12 range, expect explosive movement. \n\n[Investor presentation here.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1781115/000121390021005200/ea134163ex99-2_alussaenergy.htm)\n\n\n.\n\n**Positions**: [$500K+ in $ALUS commons.](https://i.imgur.com/CmcK8dB.png) This is my largest position to date.",

        "selftext": "A quick update on new information for all my fellow bag holder apes.\n\nWhat's the case with AMC? Is the run over? Has the squeeze squozed?\n\nNo.\n\nAMC's price jump back on the 27th of Jan was due to a high demand in the stock following the GME squeeze. People who did not want to miss out on an another opportunity wanted to jump on the next trend that was hot on WSB.\n\nThis, also explains the sudden drop in price of AMC. A lot of new members of WSB and novice traders who were looking to make a quick buck out of the momentum. Those who saw GME explode in a matter of days perceived that the same may happen to AMC. That, accompanied by numerous false expectations built up by Stocktwats and some WSB members, caused for all of those who had entered at the peak of AMC to suffer cognitive dissonance - i.e. FUD.\n\nThe number one rule of marketing is \"never create high expectations that you cannot meet\". Why? Because, while it may drive a lot of new clients in the short term, it will damage your brand and your company's success in the long-term. The same rule applies to practically everything else. In AMC's case, high expectation was created, dates were given, and when those expectations were left unmet - novice traders got spooked and closed their positions and sold their shares.\n\nAccompanied by constant media bombardment of fear mongering news left and right, data manipulation, etc. I personally believe that this is what drove the price down. Some form of market manipulation could have had a play here, but I'd rather base my DD on more tangible reports rather than speculations.\n\nHedge funds are notorious for using media coverage and PR to influence the price of a security.\n\nWith all of that being said, why do I believe that AMC has an incredible potential to explode?\n\nUtilization rate was 91.4% on the 8th of February:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img vfzin8lg31h61...*\n\nAnd has since dropped to 88.4%, which is still quite high.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98vvwidh31h61.png?width=353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743a2c23504fc1414b8a7e234d32274a4083a1d6\n\nWhat this shows us is that about 89% of the stocks available to be borrowed have been borrowed. However as you can see the total number of shares on loan has increased - from 81.7m to 82.3m.\n\nThis just shows that the drop in utilization rate has dropped as more shares have been qualified as suitable to borrow - recently bought shares.\n\nWhat else do we know?\n\nWe now know, thanks to Fidelity, that retail ownership of the stock is 87.5%!!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ew7hb2i31h61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16392e7dc6020f44715041681e16bb374d8d8dff\n\n**Why's this exciting? Well, if we look at the exciting case of VolksWagen (VW):**\n\nThe short interest of the stock was about 13%. The main reason why it exploded was because there were no stocks available for short sellers to buy back was and cover their positions was very low as Porsche had increased its stake in VW to over 74%. Short sellers were forced to buy the stock back at what the supply (holders) were willing to give for it. Simply because they can do that.\n\nSo hedges have two options, accept defeat and buy back to close their positions and hedge their risk by buying some of those stock. Or, keep paying a hefty premium based on the floating APR, which changes literally everyday based on the volume.\n\nInstitutional investors are increasing their portfolio holding of AMC:\n\nVanguard - 55.46% increase worth, I dunno but they have bought 2.7M new shares.\n\nBlackrock - 69% increase worth $13.17M\n\nNorthern Trust Corp - 41% increase worth $2.12M\n\nAnd many more who bought into the stock recently:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cwuglgpj31h61.png?width=1209&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74a91d31604f67497b7ced308e400eda66035f3a\n\nWe're also seeing a lot of people reporting that when they attempt to short the stock they are receiving error messages telling them **\"This stock is hard to borrow\".**\n\n**Such as Etrade:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xj13u0ck31h61.jpg?width=566&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e443aa0ce20eb70bf67584db89ba4950b54f5ee\n\n**And the lightspeed platform:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img hxn7536l31h61...*\n\nWhich also reported that the available shares to short are 460k with a borrow fee of 4.5%.\n\nAnother report from NakedShortReport\n\nshows us that the short volume of AMC was 40% yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9151j3io31h61.png?width=993&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88f7e43c8e61ec57990b88419c777ad2fe842ae8\n\nNaked short report collect their data from FINRA. But it's interesting to see that Fintel is reporting a 21% short volume. I've genuinely lost all hope in them by now.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nWhat this leaves me to believe is that AMC is turning into a bubble for hedgies that is ready to burst any moment now.\n\nDon't lose hope and hold your positions if you can. If you can't that's fine. Look after yourself first.\n\nThis is an extremely important lesson for newbie traders and investors for the number one rule of - Do not let your emotions control your investment decisions. This is probably the best stock to train that element.\n\nInvest what you are willing to lose - especially when dealing with highly speculative and volatile stocks such as GME and AMC.\n\n**For all of us who are still holding - stay strong. This might prove to be beneficial.** However, this is no guarantee, obviously.\n\nTake everything I've said with a grain of salt and do your own research. I just wanted to share with you my personal speculation.\n\n**Let me know what you think!**\n\nP.S Again, I ain't no financial expert nor advisor but I sure af have \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c",

        "selftext": "Not usually one for betting on all time highs, but ON provides extremely well priced options despite its current upward trend and momentum.\n\nThe biggest thing with ON is institutional ownership. So if you don\u2019t want to take my word for it, take the over ten-billion down that vanguard, fidelity, Blackrock and a number of large brokers collectively have on this company. \n\nI\u2019m a big fan of Hassane, this dude is making some moves to better position the company marginally to capitalize on the majorly emerging EV, Alternative Energy, Aerospace, and 5G markets. With demand currently outweighing supply, semiconductors whether ON or not will be strong investments, and are key to most alternative energy methods, so both markets will grow and evolve in tandem with each other. \n\nON in comparison to the other semi stocks is much lower priced, and with institutions holding a majority of the float, a large amount of 2023 convertibles, and still increasing their share positions, once a majority of the general public moves to semi\u2019s it will explode similar to PLUG power, which was a near identical situation. Although there may be some convertibles causing a degree of share dilution, with the increases in broader market investment the impact should be fairly small. \n\nMost importantly to all of this the options are cheap as absolute shit. I believe we are going to see a large spike in Theta value by April, making calls now a much better deal then the near future. You can get ATM contracts for $250, meaning it only has to cross 42.5 by April to break even, which is a fucking joke, and what I\u2019d call a great options deal. \n\nNote: I don\u2019t provide sell points, so don\u2019t ask.

        "selftext": "Edit 1: More ARKQ buying today (~50k shares). Thank you everyone for the positive feedback and discussion! \n\nBottom Line Up Front (BLUF) or TL;DR for the non-military types:\n\nLMT is a good target if you want to literally go to the moon, and my PT is $690.26 in two years (more than 2x from current levels). Justification and some possible trade ideas are listed below, just CTRL-F \u201cTrade Ideas\u201d. I hope you guys enjoy this work and would appreciate any discussion or feedback. I hope to catch you in the comments.\n\nTeam,\n\nWe interrupt today\u2019s regularly scheduled short squeeze coverage to discuss a traditionally boring stock, LMT (Lockheed Martin), with significant upside potential. To be clear, this is NOT a short squeeze target like many reddit posts are keying on. I hope that this piece sparks discussion, but if you are just looking for short squeeze content, all I have to say is BUY, HOLD, and GODSPEED.\n\nThe source of inspiration for me writing this piece is threefold; first, retail investors are winning, and I believe that we will continue to win if we continue to identify opportunities in the market. In my view, the stock market has always been a place for the public to shine a light on areas of innovation that real Americans are excited about and proud to be a part of. Online communities have stolen the loudspeaker from hedge fund managers and returned it to decentralized online democracies that quickly and proudly shift their weight behind ideas they believe in. In GME\u2019s case, it was a blatant smear campaign to destroy a struggling business. I think that we should continue this campaign by identifying opportunities in the market and running with them. It may sound overly idealistic, but if reddit can take on the hedge funds, I non-ironically believe that we can quite literally take good companies researching space technology to the moon. I think LMT may be one of several stocks to help get us there.\n\nSecond, a video where the Secretary of State of Massachusetts argues that internet boards are full of a bunch of unsophisticated, thoughtless traders really ticked me off. This piece is designed to show that \u2018the little guy\u2019 is ready to get into the weeds, understand business plans, and outpace analysts that think companies like Tesla are overvalued by comparing them to Toyota. That is a big reason that I settled on an old, large, slow growth company to do a deep-dive on, and try my best to show some of the abysmal predictive analysis major \u2018research firms\u2019 do on even some of the most heavily covered stocks. LMT is making moves, and the suits on wall street are 10 steps behind. At the time of writing this piece, Analyst Estimates range from 330-460 (what an insane range).\n\nThird, and most importantly, I am in the US military, and I think that it is fun to go deep into the financials of the defense sector. I think that it helps me understand the long-term growth plans of the DoD, and I think that I attack these deep-dives with a perspective that a lot of these finance-from-day-one cats do not understand. Even if no one ever looks at this work, I think that taking the time to write pieces like this makes me a better Soldier, and I will continue to do it in my spare time when I am feeling inspired. I wrote a piece on Raytheon Technologies (Ticker: RTX) 6 months ago, and I think it was well-received. I was most convicted about RTX in the defense sector, but I have since shifted to believing LMT is the leader in the defense space. I am long both, though. If this inspires anyone else to do similar research on other companies, or sparks discussion in the community, that is just a bonus. Special shout-out to the folks that read more than just the TL;DR, but if you do just read the TL;DR, I love you too!\n\nNow let us get into it:\n\n**Leadership**\n\nI generally like to invest in companies that are led by people that seem to have integrity. Jim Taiclet took the reins at LMT in June of last year. While on active duty, he served as a C-141B Starlifter pilot (a retired LMT Aircraft). After getting out he went to work for the American Tower Corporation (Ticker: AMT). His first day at American Tower was September 10, 2001. The following day, AMT lost 13 employees in the World Trade Center attack. He stayed with the company, despite it being decimated by market uncertainty in the wake of 9/11. He was appointed CEO of the very same company in 2004. Over a 16 year tenure as CEO of AMT the company market cap 20x\u2019d. He left his position as CEO of AMT in March of last year, and the stock stagnated since his departure, currently trading at roughly the same market cap as to when he left.\n\nJim Taiclet was also appointed to be the chairman of the board this week, replacing the previous CEO. Why is it relevant that the CEO came from a massive telecommunications company?\n\nRightfully, Taiclet\u2019s focus for LMT is bringing military technology into the modern era. He wants LMT to be a first mover in the military 5G space, military application of AI space, the\u2026 space space, and the hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) space. These areas are revolutionary for the boomer defense sector. We will discuss this in more detail later when we cover the company\u2019s P/E multiple and why it is absolute nonsense.\n\nIt is not a surprise to me that they brought Taiclet on during the pandemic. He led AMT through adversity before, and LMT\u2019s positioning during the pandemic is tremendous relative to the rest of the sector, thanks in large part to some strong strategic moves and good investments by current and past leadership. I think that Taiclet is the right CEO for the job.\n\nIn addition to the new CEO, the new Secretary of Defense, Secretary Lloyd Austin, has strong ties to the defense sector. He was formerly a board member for RTX. He is absolutely above reproach, and a true leader of character, but I bring this up not to suggest that he will inappropriately serve in the best interest of defense contractors, but to suggest that he speaks the language of these companies effectively. I do not anticipate that the current administration poses as significant of a risk to the defense sector as many analysts seem to believe. This will be expanded in the headwinds section below.\n\n**SPACE**\n\nCathie Wood and the ARK Invest team brought a lot of attention to the space sector when the ARKX, The ARK Space Exploration ETF, Form N-1A was officially filed through the SEC. More recently, ARK Invest published their Big Ideas 2021 Annual Report and dedicated an entire 7-page chapter to Orbital Aerospace, a new disruptive innovation platform that the ARK Team is investigating. This may have helped energize wall street to re-look their portfolios and their investments in space technology, but it was certainly not the first catalyst that pushed the defense industry in the direction of winning the *new* space race.\n\nIn June 2018, then President Trump announced at the annual National Space Council that \u201cit is not enough to merely have an American presence in space, we must have American dominance in space. So important. Therefore, I am hereby directing the Department of Defense (DoD) and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a Space Force as the sixth branch of the Armed Forces\". Historically, Department of Defense space assets were under the control of the Air Force. By creating a separate branch of service for the United States Space Force (USSF), the DoD would allocate a Chairman of Space Operations on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and clearly define the budget for space operations dedicated directly to the USSF. At present, this budget is funneled from the USAF\u2019s budget. The process was formalized in December of 2019, and the DoD has appropriated \\~$15B to the USSF in their first full year of existence according to the FY21 budget.\n\nAmong the 77 spacecraft that are controlled by the USSF, 29 of them are Lockheed Martin GPS satellites, 6 of them are Lockheed Martin Space-Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS), and LMT had a hand in creating and/or manufacturing for several of the other USSF efforts. The Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared Missile Warning Satellites (also known as Next-Gen OPIR) were contracted out to both Northrup Grumman (Ticker: NOC) and LMT. LMT\u2019s contract is currently set at $4.9B, NOC\u2019s contract is set at $2.37B.\n\nTangentially related to the discussion of space is the discussion of hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs). HGVs have exoatmospheric and atmospheric implications, but I think that their technology is extremely important to driving margins down for both space exploration and terrestrial point-to-point travel. LMT is leading the charge for military HGV research. They hold contracts with the Navy, Air Force, and Army to develop HGVs and hypersonic precision fires. The priority for HGV technology accelerated significantly when Russia launched their Avangard HGV in December of 2019. Improving the technology for HGVs is a critical next-step in maintaining US hegemony, but also maintaining leadership in both terrestrial and exoatmospheric travel.\n\n**LARGE SCALE COMBAT OPERATIONS (LSCO)**\n\nThe DoD transitioning to Large-Scale Combat Operations (LSCO) as the military\u2019s strategic focus. This is a move away from an emphasis on Counter-Insurgency operations. LSCO requires effective multi-domain operations (MDO), which means effective and integrated strategies regarding land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. To have effective MDO, the DoD is seeking systems that both expand capabilities against peer threats and increase the ability to track enemy units and communicate internally. This requires a modernizing military strategy that relies heavily on air, missile, and sensor modernization. Put simply, the DoD has decided to start preparing for peer or near-peer adversaries (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) rather than insurgencies. For this reason, I believe that increased Chinese and Russian tensions are, unfortunate as it may be, a boon to the defense industry. This is particularly true in the missiles/fires and space industry, as peer-to-peer conflicts are won by leveraging technological advantages.\n\nThere are too many projects to cover in detail, but some important military technologies that LMT is focusing on to support LSCO include directed energy weapons (lasers) to address enemy drone technology, machine learning / artificial intelligence (most applications fall under LMT\u2019s classified budget, but it is easy to imagine the applications of AI in a military context), and 5G to increase battlefield connectivity. These projects are all nested within the DoD\u2019s LSCO strategy, and position LMT as the leader in emergent military tech. NOC is the other major contractor making a heavy push in the modernization direction, but winners win, and I think a better CEO, balance sheet, and larger market cap make LMT the clear winner for aiding the DoD in a transition toward LSCO.\n\n**SECTOR COMPARISON (BACKLOG)**\n\nThe discussion of LSCO transitions well into the discussion of defense contractor backlogs. Massive defense contracts are not filled overnight, so examining order backlogs is a relatively reliable way to gauge the interest of the DoD in a defense contractor\u2019s existing or emerging products. For my sector comparison, I am using the top 6 holdings of the iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF (Ticker: ITA). I hate this ETF, and ETFs like it (DFEN) because of their massively outsized exposure to aerospace, and undersized allocation to companies like LMT. LMT is only 18% smaller than Boeing (Ticker: BA) but is only 30.4% of the exposure of BA (18.46% of the fund is BA, only 5.62% of the fund is LMT). Funds of this category are just BA / RTX hacks. I suggest building your own pie on a site like M1 Finance (although they are implicated in the trade restriction BS\u2026 please be advised of that\u2026 hoping other brokerages that are above board will offer similar UIs like the pie design\u2026 just wanted to be clear there) if you are interested in the defense sector.\n\nThe top 6 holdings of ITA are:\n\nBoeing Company (Ticker: BA, MKT CAP $110B) at 18.46%\n\nRaytheon Technologies (Ticker: RTX, MKT CAP $101B) at 17.84%\n\nLockheed Martin (Ticker: LMT, MKT CAP $90B) at 5.62%\n\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation (Ticker: GD, MKT CAP $42B) 4.78%\n\nTeledyne Technologies Incorporated (Ticker: TDY, MKT CAP $13B) at 4.74%\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation (Ticker: NOC, MKT CAP $48B) at 4.64%\n\nAs a brief aside, please look at the breakdowns of ETFs before buying them. The fact that ITA has more exposure to TDY than NOC and L3Harris is wild. Make sector ETFs balanced how you want them to be balanced and it will be more engaging, and you will likely outperform. I digress.\n\nBacklogs for defense companies can easily be pulled from their quarterly reports. Here are the current backlogs in the same order as before, followed by a percentage of their backlog to their current market cap. All numbers are pulled from January earning reports unless otherwise noted with an \\* because they are still pending.\n\n**Boeing Company** backlog (Commercial: $282B, Defense: $61B, Foreign Military Sales (FMS, categorized by BA as \u2018Global\u2019): 21B, Total Backlog 364B): BA\u2019s backlog to market cap is a ratio of 3.32, which is strong, but most of that backlog comes from the commercial, not the defense side. Airlines have been getting decimated, I am personally not interested in having much of my backlog exposed to commercial pressures when trying to invest in a defense play. Without commercial exposure, their defense only backlog ratio is .748. This is extremely low. I understand that this does not do BA justice, but I am keying in on defense exposure, and I am left thoroughly unsatisfied by that ratio. Also, we have seen several canceled contracts already on the commercial side.\n\n**Raytheon Technologies** backlog (Defense backlog for all 4 subdivisions: 67.3B): Raytheon only published a defense backlog in this quarter\u2019s report. That is further evidence to me that the commercial aerospace side of the house is getting hammered. They have a relatively week backlog to market cap as well, putting them at a ratio of .664, worse off than the BA defense backlog.\n\n**Lockheed Martin** backlog (Total Backlog: $147B): This backlog blows our first two defense backlogs out of the water with a current market cap to backlog ratio of 1.63.\n\n**General Dynamics Corporation** backlog (Total Backlog: $89.5B, $11.6B is primarily business jets, but it is difficult to determine how much of their aerospace business is commercial): Solid 2.13 ratio, still great 1.85 if you do not consider their aerospace business. The curveball here for me is that GD published a consolidated operating profit of $4.1B including commercial aerospace, whereas LMT published a consolidated operating profit of $9.1B. This makes the LMT ratio of profit/market cap slightly in favor of LMT without accounting for the GD commercial aerospace exposure. This research surprised me; I may like GD more than I originally assumed I would. Still prefer LMT.\n\n**Teledyne Technologies Incorporated** backlog (Found in the earnings transcript, $1.7B): This stock is not quite in the same league as the other major contractors. This is an odd curveball that a lot of the defense ETFs seem to have too much exposure to. They have a weak backlog, but they are a smaller growing company. I am not interested in this at all. It has a backlog ratio of .129.\n\n**Northrop Grumman Corporation** backlog ($81B): Strong numbers here. I see NOC and LMT as the two front-runners in the defense sector. I like LMT more because I like their exposure to AI, 5G, and HGVs more than NOC, but I think this is a great alternative to LMT if you like the defense sector. Has a ratio of 1.69, slightly edging out LMT on this metric. LMT edges out NOC on margins by \\~.9%, though, which has significant implications when considering the depth of the LMT backlog.\n\nThe winners here are LMT, GD, and NOC. BA is attractive if you think anyone will have enough money to buy new planes. BA and RTX are both getting hammered by commercial aerospace exposure right now and are much more positioned as recovery plays. That said, LMT and NOC both make money now, and will regardless of the impact of the pandemic. LMT is growing at a slightly faster rate than NOC. Both are profit machines, but I like LMT\u2019s product portfolio and leadership a lot more.\n\n**FREE CASH FLOW**\n\nDespite the pandemic, LMT had the free cash flow to be able to pay a $2.60 per share dividend. This maintains their \\~3% yearly dividend rate. They had a free cash flow of $6.4B. They spent $3.9 of that in share repurchases and dividend payouts. That leaves 40% of that cash to continue to strengthen one of the most stalwart balance sheets outside of big tech on the street. Having this free cash flow allowed them to purchase Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4B in December. They seem flexible and willing to expand and take advantage of their relative position during the pandemic. This is a stock that has little downside risk and significant upside potential. It is always reassuring to me to know that at the end of the day, a company is using its profit to continue to grow.\n\n**HEADWINDS**\n\n**New Administration** \u2013 This is more of an unknown than a headwind. The Obama Administration was not light on military spending, and the newly appointed SecDef is unlikely to shy away from modernizing the force. Military defense budgets may get lost in the political shuffle, but nothing right now suggests that defense budgets are on the chopping block.\n\n**Macroeconomic pressure** \u2013 The markets are tumultuous in the wake of GME. Hedgies are shaking in their boots, and scared money weighed on markets the past week. If scared money continues to exert pressure on the broader equity markets, all boomer stocks are likely weighed down by slumping markets.\n\n**Non-meme Status** \u2013 The stocks that are impervious to macroeconomic pressures in the above paragraph are the stonks that we, the people, have decided to support. From GME to IPOE, there is a slew of stonks that are watching and laughing from the green zone as the broader markets slip deeper into the red zone. Unless sentiment about LMT changes, I see no evidence that LMT will remain unaffected by a broader economic downturn (despite showing growth YoY during a pandemic).\n\n**TAILWINDS**\n\n**Aerojet Rocketdyne to the Moon** \u2013 Cathie Wood opened up a $39mil position in LMT a few weeks ago, and this was near the announcement of ARKX. The big ideas 2021 article focuses heavily on satellite technology, deep learning, and HGVs. I think that the AR acquisition suggests that vertical integration is a priority for LMT. They even fielded a question in their earnings call about whether they were concerned about being perceived as a monopoly. Their answer was spot on\u2014the USFG and DoD have a vested interest in the success of defense companies. Why would they discourage a defense contractor from vertical integration to optimize margins?\n\n**International Tensions** \u2013 SolarWinds has escalated US-Russia tensions. President Biden wants to look tough on China. LSCO is a DoD-wide priority.\n\n**5G.Mil** \u2013 We still do not have a lot of fidelity on what this looks like, but the military would benefit in a lot of ways if we had world-wide access to the rapid transfer of encrypted data. Many units still rely on Vietnam-era technology signal technology with abysmal data rates. There are a lot of implications if the code can be cracked to win a DoD 5G contract.\n\n**TRADE IDEAS**\n\n**Price Target:** LMT is currently at a P/E of \\~14. Verizon has roughly the same. LMT\u2019s 5-year P/E ratio average is \\~17. NOC is currently at a P/E of \\~20. TSLA has a P/E Ratio of 1339 (disappointingly not 1337). P/E is a useless metric because no one seems to care about it. My point is that LMT makes a lot of money, and other companies that are valued at much higher multiples do not make any money at all. LMT\u2019s P/E ratio is that of a boomer stock that has no growth potential. LMT\u2019s P/E is exactly in line with the Aerospace and Defense Industry P/E ratio standard. LMT\u2019s new CEO is pushing the industry in a new direction. I will arbitrarily choose a P/E ratio of 30, because it is half of the software industry average, and it is a nice round number. Plus, stock values are speculative and nonsense anyway.\n\nShare price today: $321.82\n\nShare price based on LMT average 5-year P/E: $384.08 (I see this as a short term PT, reversion to the mean)\n\nShare price with a P/E of 30: $690.26\n\n**Buy and Hold:** Simple. Doesn\u2019t take much thought. Come back in a year or two and be happy with your tendies (and a few dividends to boot).\n\n**LEAPS Call Debit Spread (Based on last trade prices):** Buy $375 C 20 JAN 23 for $26.5, Sell $450 C 20 JAN 23 for $12. Total Cost $14.5 for a spread width of $75. Max gain 517% per spread. Higher risk strategy.\n\n**LEAPS**: Buy $500 C 20 JAN 23 for $7.20. Very high-risk strat. If the price target is hit within two years, these would be in the money $183 per contract for a gain of 2500%. This is the casino strat.\n\n**SOURCES**\n\n[https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/2020/james-taiclet-from-military-pilot-to-successful-ceo.html](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/2020/james-taiclet-from-military-pilot-to-successful-ceo.html)\n\n[https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/in-response-to-senator-warrens-questions-secretary-of-defense-nominee-general-lloyd-austin-commits-to-recusing-himself-from-raytheon-decisions-for-four-years](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/in-response-to-senator-warrens-questions-secretary-of-defense-nominee-general-lloyd-austin-commits-to-recusing-himself-from-raytheon-decisions-for-four-years)\n\n[https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2019-08-30-Lockheed-Martins-Expertise-in-Hypersonic-Flight-Wins-New-Army-Work](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2019-08-30-Lockheed-Martins-Expertise-in-Hypersonic-Flight-Wins-New-Army-Work)\n\n[https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/hypersonics.html](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/hypersonics.html)\n\n[https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1\\_Download\\_Files\\_ARK-Invest/White\\_Papers/ARK%E2%80%93Invest\\_BigIdeas\\_2021.pdf?hsCtaTracking=4e1a031b-7ed7-4fb2-929c-072267eda5fc%7Cee55057a-bc7b-441e-8b96-452ec1efe34c](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ARK%E2%80%93Invest_BigIdeas_2021.pdf?hsCtaTracking=4e1a031b-7ed7-4fb2-929c-072267eda5fc%7Cee55057a-bc7b-441e-8b96-452ec1efe34c)\n\n[https://www.deseret.com/2018/6/19/20647309/twitter-reacts-to-trump-s-call-for-a-space-force](https://www.deseret.com/2018/6/19/20647309/twitter-reacts-to-trump-s-call-for-a-space-force)\n\n[https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2021/fy2021\\_Budget\\_Request\\_Overview\\_Book.pdf](https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2021/fy2021_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf)\n\n[https://www.airforcemag.com/lockheed-receives-up-to-4-9-billion-for-next-gen-opir-satellites/](https://www.airforcemag.com/lockheed-receives-up-to-4-9-billion-for-next-gen-opir-satellites/)\n\n[https://spacenews.com/northrop-grumman-gets-2-3-billion-space-force-contract-to-develop-missile-warning-satellites/](https://spacenews.com/northrop-grumman-gets-2-3-billion-space-force-contract-to-develop-missile-warning-satellites/)\n\n[https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/directed-energy/laser-weapon-systems.html](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/directed-energy/laser-weapon-systems.html)\n\n[https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/lockheed-martins-ai-applications-for-the-military/](https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/lockheed-martins-ai-applications-for-the-military/)\n\n[https://www.defenseone.com/business/2020/07/new-ceo-wants-lockheed-become-5g-player/167072/](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2020/07/new-ceo-wants-lockheed-become-5g-player/167072/)\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/defense-firms-expect-higher-spending-11548783988](https://www.wsj.com/articles/defense-firms-expect-higher-spending-11548783988)\n\n[https://www.etf.com/ITA#efficiency](https://www.etf.com/ITA#efficiency)\n\n[https://s2.q4cdn.com/661678649/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q4/4Q20-Presentation.pdf](https://s2.q4cdn.com/661678649/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/4Q20-Presentation.pdf)\n\n[https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/dfd94ff7-4cca-4540-bc4b-4e3ba92fc646](https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/dfd94ff7-4cca-4540-bc4b-4e3ba92fc646)\n\n[https://investors.lockheedmartin.com/static-files/64e5aa03-9023-423a-8908-2aae8c7015ac](https://investors.lockheedmartin.com/static-files/64e5aa03-9023-423a-8908-2aae8c7015ac)\n\n[https://s22.q4cdn.com/891946778/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q4/GD\\_4Q20\\_Earnings\\_Highlights-Outlook-Final.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/891946778/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/GD_4Q20_Earnings_Highlights-Outlook-Final.pdf)\n\n[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/teledyne-technologies-inc-tdy-q4-2020-earnings-cal/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/teledyne-technologies-inc-tdy-q4-2020-earnings-cal/)\n\n[https://investor.northropgrumman.com/static-files/6e6e117f-f656-4c68-ba7f-3dc53c2dd13a](https://investor.northropgrumman.com/static-files/6e6e117f-f656-4c68-ba7f-3dc53c2dd13a)",

        "selftext": "## Market Close, and all the attacks so far.\n\nThis has been a rough week so far. GME is closing at around 90, and either you are seeing massive losses, or the unrealized gains you had evaporate right in front of your eyes. The media is spewing out 200 articles per day saying 'Gamestop is over', and that anyone who stays in the stock is retarded.\n\nBut it's simple. As Mark Cuban himself said,  \n\n&gt;If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of.\n\nAnd ask yourself, **what WSB is really made of?** Is it just plain autistic and retarded traders? Yes, but we also have our Diamond community. People that are actively trying to beat the market, that do their due diligence, and that want to bathe in chicken tendies.\n\nAnd we have seen post after post of their DD, reinforcing over and over what we were always here for.   \nAnd let me tell you: **Nothing has changed.**\n\n# The short term plan (SHORT SQUEEZE)\n\nAlright, I'll bust out the numbers quick:   \n[https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&amp;submit=Short+Quote\u2122](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&amp;submit=Short+Quote\u2122) says that the Short Interest is stil  61,780,000 shares, or 120%. The shorters have obviously refilled their shorts, knowing that their **market manipulation has driven the price down wonders.**\n\n**Their greatest hope** to **avoid** the *Squozening* is to scare off everyone who is holding. They won't stop dumping the stock using everything they have to keep the price away from execution princes, and **avoid getting gamma squeezed again.**\n\n**But,** this doesn't change that 120% of short interest is still insane. They have RELOADED their own failure, failing to acknowledge the power the retail trading community posseses. \n\nIn fact, the stock has been put in the NYSE restricted list of Short selling. They quite literally can't short this stock anymore. So once this rises again, the MMs have NO REASON to start dropping the price again, as they can't benefit once more from shorting on the way down.\n\nThis week we are extremely weak as a community due to the immense number of traders having to transfer to Fidelity/Schwab/other brokers, and the MMs have clearly made great use of this. Hell, Drivewealth, one of the biggest clearing brokers for international traders (such as myself), restricted buying GME, and have said to be able to clear buying GME very soon\n\nBut as the fund transfers are complete, and Robinhood acquires more capital to realize their trades, and the other brokers lift restrictions, GME will MOST DEFINITIVELY skyrocket. Once the rocket starts going off again, ALL THE FOMO FROM PEOPLE WHO MISSED 300+ WILL SHOW!\n\n**So the SHORT SQUEEZE STILL CAN HAPPEN.** \n\n# The long term plan (RYAN COHEN IS GOD, Q4 is still coming)\n\nDon't forget that we still have Ryan Cohen on board, and with expected record sales from this console cycle, Gamestop is very far away from going bankrupt. \n\nRemember: The ideal situation for shorts is a bankruptcy/delisting.\n\nRyan Cohen is still in, the Quarterly report for GME is still coming, and the long term prospects of the company are still FUCKING BULLISH.  Even if we can't force a squeeze in february, long term changes done to the company can still trigger a short squeeze. In fact, most of the rise of GME so far has been done through investors buying in, not through short squeezes. \n\nYes, it is fact that many shorts have covered (At BILLIONS of losses), but this doesn't change our fundamental thesis: *Gamestop + Ryan Cohen = Rokit mun*. The VW squeeze happened after DAYS of red, you better believe we can end up waiting for a month for the squoze.\n\n# TLDR: HOLD OR BUY MORE, YOU FUCKING APES. IT'S NOT OVER. You know why? BECAUSE\n\n# WE. LIKE. THE. STOCK.\n\nPositions: 100 @ 15.8",

        "selftext": "Fellow retards, bag-holders, u/Lansman grandma and paper-hands,\n\nlets look at the facts:\n\n1) Short % according to S3 is still at 122% ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\\_this\\_they\\_are\\_screwed\\_numbers\\_dont\\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/))\n\n2) Robinhood is still not allowing users to trade securities freely. These include $GME, which artificially creates selling pressure. They are currently raising money to have capital on hand, or liquidity, to allow users to freely trade all positions again. As soon as this happens $GME will \ud83d\ude80, similar to Friday.\n\n3) All users who transferred their accounts from Robinhood to other brokerages still need time, it takes 3-5 days on average. Meaning eow the first users will be able to buy stocks freely again, those will include $GME. This will create another spike in GameStop. I heard fidelity is great, I personally use TDA &amp; eTrade.\n\n4) Volume is low. Meaning all the restrictions they placed on users to exclude them from free market access obviously worked, but the real diamond hands aren't selling. As soon as people realize they made a mistake, people will pile in. This will happen latest eow as brokerages allow users to trade the stocks again AND call options expire. Another spike will probably trigger HF's to finally cover their short positions again, as they currently believe they have \"won\" the fight and successfully diverted our attention.\n\n5) They got you right? They destroyed your believe in the short squeeze? See how you feel? That's exactly what they wanted. Don't call the fight yet, this is round 4 of 12, we will knock them out soon. Just hold tight and buy what you can. This dip will not last long and you will bite your \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b ass when $GME rockets to $1000.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advise, I am retarded. $GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPositions: GME @ average $128.44 and $AMC Calls.",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR:**\n\n**1. Check all of your credit and debit cards for fraudulent charges. There are reports of a tidal wave of fraudulent charges across different banks and payment networks.**\n\n**2. Let's get to the bottom of this and buy the puts that will send us to Valhalla. Currently, there is no mainstream reporting of these fraud charges. I have puts on BBVA, FIS, and FISV**\n\nAgain, check all of your debit cards and credit cards for unauthorized transactions. Some of the more common ones are \"coloadtest,\" \"Angela Singleton,\" Spotify, \"sumup,\" \"wfxb,\" and \"amzn\\[.\\]com.\" Report the transactions as fraudulent so that your card gets locked instead of simply disputing the charge.\n\n# Tidal wave of fraud charges\n\nIn the links below, you will find pages of people reporting small and large fraudulent transactions.  I've read 300+ comments of affected people. Many of them note that customer service has told them that a lot of other people are disputing similar fraud charges. Moreover, these charges are bizarre in their diversity of payment networks, banks, and \"workarounds\" that they use. E.g. Some fraudulent charges are on prepaid gift cards. Some fraudulent charges are on cards that were cancelled, re-sent, and fraudulently charged while still in the mail. Some fraudulent charges posted to cards that were closed (possibly by manipulating a recurring charge mechanism). Below are links to some of the data points, I broke the links because my previous submissions were autospammed, sorry. There is also a table below where I summarized some of the data before I got tired of data entry.\n\nMost data: *doctorofcreditDOTcom/widespread-unauthorized-transactions-check-your-accounts-coloadtest-com-sumup/*\n\n[reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lnb1yq/coloadtestcom\\_charge/](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lnb1yq/coloadtestcom_charge/)\n\n[reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/lms5u5/unrecognized\\_charge\\_from\\_coloadtestcom/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/lms5u5/unrecognized_charge_from_coloadtestcom/)\n\n[reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lmdbq9/my\\_bank\\_account/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lmdbq9/my_bank_account/)\n\n[reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/lppyi3/reports\\_of\\_widespread\\_unauthorized\\_card/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/lppyi3/reports_of_widespread_unauthorized_card/)\n\ndoctorofcreditDOTcom/al-fl-tx-az-co-ca-nm-bbva-select-credit-card-500-bonus/\n\n*bogleheadsDOTorg/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=340580&amp;p=5827773*\n\n*early-retirementDOTorg/forums/f27/unauthorized-charge-from-coloadtest-com-108007.html*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is only from the more recent data on the doctorofcredit link](https://preview.redd.it/aov4c1axz9j61.png?width=1798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=520608861f616b63a254c98b9e587ecce19c8a7a)\n\nCollaborator [u/Wise\\_Hope\\_3654](https://www.reddit.com/u/Wise_Hope_3654/) made this spreadsheet for the Reddit data points: megaDOTnz/file/bggQxARK#haADas8e1JTmMKufpzXWM6RgHn7fR3I-d27Ec4nrYPg\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo summarize the table, almost all major credit card issuing banks and almost all major credit card payment networks have been hit. Mastercard has been maybe less affected. Some cards have only been used once. One card was never used. Some cards were gift cards. Some cards were cancelled and then charged when a new card was sent but before it was received in the mail.\n\nOne of the most interesting leads is the commenter who said this data is being shared on the dark web and he got that from a source called idx (I have no idea what that is).\n\n**Inferences:**\n\n1. This was probably not an attack on a retailer's database because many cards were only used once.\n2. This was probably not an attack on issuing banks since so many were affected. One possible exception is BBVA, since their cards were the victims of the earliest attacks and have been attacked in relatively large quantity.\n3. Likewise, Amex and Visa are more sus than other payment networks, but still not high on the list of suspects.\n4. Some agent that many banks and payment networks use is the most likely culprit. This could be a software vendor. It could be a faulty pipeline to a credit report company (TransUnion, Equifax, Experian) that is adding payment info.\n5. This breach is deep in the system if they are able to hit cards that are ostensibly locked and that are being sent in the mail after the first is cancelled.\n6. Likewise, this is probably not a stale breach from long ago since the fraudsters are able to update their card info to these newly mailed cards.\n7. Many are reporting the same fraudulent charges e.g. coloadtest, Angela Singleton, cfxb, and sumup, so we know these are part of the same breach or set of breaches by the same hacker.\n8. The sumup charges are being sent to Brazil. That's a good place for international financial crimes since Brazil does not extradite citizens.\n\n# Suspicions\n\nI think the most likely source of the quantity and variety of breached cards is a deep attack on a \"acquirer processor.\" An acquirer is the bank that handles the transaction for the merchant. Merchant acquirers are the banks that handle transaction risk. Acquirer processors actually process the transactions. Some banks do both, for example, Chase (JPM). Some banks do not, for example Wells Fargo (WFC), hands off the processing to Fiserv (FISV).\n\nA processor is the most likely to be able to generate the kind of data needed for this attack. They would see data from across many banks and payment networks. They would have the ability to collect new card data after reissues and data from cards that were never used. In the 2011 hack of FIS, the hackers were able to get into prepaid debit card (vanilla gift card) data. That hack led to a sustained 35% downturn in the FIS stock price; I suspect a similar breach will do the same.\n\nkrebsonsecurityDOTcom/2013/06/fdic-2011-fis-breach-worse-than-reported/\n\nI collected data below from people who only ever used their card at a very small number of retailers to get a sense of which acquirer processor is most likely to have been hacked, The data is unfortunately not very conclusive.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65ya90kc2aj61.png?width=2281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51aadd82f159f196b5ccc483901f4878abcec3b3\n\nThere's also a possibility that there were multiple breaches and these attacks are being mixed to obscure the origin.\n\n**I'm hoping some of you know more about the innards of the payment network system or legacy software that banks use to support it. I'm hoping that we can put together a case for a most likely suspect company and make a killing with our early DD.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positions:**\n\nI have a small quantity of OTM puts in BBVA, FIS, and FISV. I'm not ready to YOLO the account until I have more confidence the right targets are selected.\n\n**Edit 1:**\n\na. Be sure to check out the comments below on a potential BIN attack.\n\nb. I got in contact with Angela of the photography business that is supposedly charging some of the payments. They haven't compromised her accounts and are just posing as her so she has no info.",

        "selftext": "So Ive been a traditional investor for a very long time, and been penny stock trading for a bit now, and I can say I have a very high risk tolerance, so I know risk varies from person to person. But here are some simple techniques to mitigate risk. I understand many people want to make money, and fast and that is what penny stocks are essentially for.   \n\n\nSo how do I pick up the nerve to drop down 10,000 on penny stocks? I mean you can lose everything! And yes, very easy to do so. One key thing here....be diverse! like VERY diverse with penny stocks only. Ill explain why.  \n\n\nI have multiple brokerage accounts, but I use WeBull for penny stocks only. I know many people dont like WeBull, but use something you like and comfortable with. But I never mix normal stocks with penny stocks. this is solely only for penny stocks. My bigger brokerage like fidelity and TD are for actual long term/swing trade stocks.   \n\n\nAnyhow, I usually keep my number to about 8 to 10 penny stocks. Why this magic number? Penny stocks are a gamble, but you can make it an actual investment if you use multiple tools. For me, reddit and how often it gets talked about is a tool. Also, search for catalysts, phases, contracts, debt free, new partnerships. Then my biggest thing is investing in penny stocks that analysts are bullish in. Chances are if analysts are bullish on it, has catalysts, and comes up a lot on reddit, it will shoot up. So 10 is my magic number. 1000 on each \"trending\" penny stock. on average most will give you maybe 0 - 5% return, some will be - 50% return, but 2 or 3 will be a 100 - 500% return which even if all 7 or 8 fail, you can possibly still get high profits by 50% when accounting all your losses, which to me, 50% is better than -50%.   \n\n\nI have been doing this with 8 - 10 penny stocks at a time and I essentially havent had any \"loss\" as a whole. Sometimes I break clean even, but more than often, penny stocks will usually give -5%  to -20% when going south while the other winners can give you 50% - 500% which greatly takes out the risk. I unusually try to sell at the analysts price point since I only invest on what is trending with analysts. I sell once I reach that point and reinvest the profits. One of my biggest tools is the brilliant people of reddit who do DD, so a huge thank you for that!  \n\n\nSo example, if I am in KTRA because I see its trending on reddit, analysts are bullish on it and also has a pretty high price target with a catalysts. good sign. I am going to wait till it reaches $4 - $5. so I dropped 1k on it while it was $1. so this will be a $4k profit, sell it, then reinvest that 4k into 3 or 4 other penny stocks and try to keep my entire portfolio around 8 to 10 penny stocks only, if not ill keep that profit in my wallet until the trend is over.  \n\n\nhope this helps!!",

        "selftext": "Okay, I know the latest fabs have been weed, pharma, and GME is still rocking it, but hear me out. As an ape, I have been reading the articles on RH because I want to know what they're saying about GME, NOK, BB, and others. Turns out they started posting positive articles on NOK. Yet, NOK has been dropping like a fly below price levels from Nov 2020, even though it had an outstanding earnings report??? To top it off, it outperformed it's market competitors, yet the price continues to jump off cliffs?\n\nObviously it's the hedge funds being dicks. It has to be. The company is doing better than most startups because it actually has cash flow. It had 2.5B Euros in net cash flow, which is up .8B from last Q4.^(1) Cash on hand has increased by 2.1B Euro from last year as well. This is by all means a relatively \"safe\" company to invest in, as it is stockpiling cash and generating it as well...\n\nFrom my ape brain, it looks like they don't always do dividend payouts, which is weird but that's the EU for you. I don't know shit about stocks except that I was a finance major and now I do consulting because of this crap. The fundamentals don't matter when you have a bunch of rich people piss their money on Hedge fund managers trying to scrap by pretending they are the messiah. Cucks.

It's cause Fidelity and Schaub propose to buy and sell at bids and asks. It's not rocket science. All the shit they teach you in school is a fucking lie. Only small dick brains care about fundamentals. It's a rich man's game and I want to take it down by putting my money in the mouth of Nokia and other potential companies.

        "selftext": "**Current Conditions of the Market:**\n\nLet me be clear: this is not the typical conditions of the market where stocks fluctuate double and triple digit percentages per day. There\u2019s a place for that - the casino. In recent weeks, herds of new traders are pouring into the trading scene hoping to get a piece of the volatile market that has turned the rags to riches, or the other way around. The stock market as a whole, under normal conditions, moves gradually in both directions, guided by trends, innovation, speculation, earnings report, and financial changes. What we are in right now is a hysteria-filled environment that is risky for both veteran traders and novices. Any uninformed, reckless decision can produce different results - by chance. Be wise and do not let chance underlie your success or bankruptcy stories. Please do your research first before investing into anything and whatever you do, do not make the mistake of over-extending yourself with margin (brokerage-provided capital) that you cannot repay should things go south. People have and continue to make this fundamental mistake that will ruin them financially for years. Stock investments should be about long-term growth, stability, and supplemental to your income. Investments should give you access to the opportunity of financial freedom, but should not be your primary source for income. Do not listen to stock gurus and paid-only discord groups - they don\u2019t make money from stocks, they make money from you. Lastly, this atypical market condition is the perfect storm for spontaneous \u201cpump and dumps\u201d where stocks become inflated, and based on fool\u2019s theory or musical chairs (whichever you prefer), the last one that gets out gets burned. Be smart, be patient, do the research.\u00a0\n\n**Basic Stock Jargons &amp; Short/Long Positions:**\n\n*Long* \\- you\u2019re buying and holding a stock with the intention for it to increase in value.\n\n*Short* \\- you\u2019re borrowing shares from a lender (brokerage, investment firm, individual investors), selling it to someone, and hoping to buy it back at a lower price. Your profit is the difference in the sell and buy back price. I\u2019ll provide a real world example because this concept it a bit more complex:\n\n* Person A is a share lender. They want to lend the share and get paid a small interest rate as compensation.\n* Person B asks Person A to lend him that share temporarily. Person B does not pay anything upfront, but he promises to pay Person A in the form of interest over time.\n* Person B finds a buyer Person C. Person C wants to buy a stock so it can go up. Person C is \u201clong\u201d on this stock. Person B, however, is short on this stock because he wants the value of the stock to go down.\n* Person C pays Person B $10 for the stock. Now, Person C has spent $10, and Person B has gained $10.\u00a0\n* Two hypothetical situation happens now:\n   * Scenario 1: Stock value increases to $15. Person C is now up $5 and he sells because he\u2019s making nice gains. Person B needs to buy back that share at $15, but he only gained $10 profit initially. Now he needs to fork up $5 to buy back the share, and then return the share back to the lender + any interest accrued. In this scenario, the \u201cshort\u201d lost money, the \u201clong\u201d gained money, and the \u201clender\u201d made interest money.\u00a0\n   * Scenario 2: Stock value decreases to $5. Person C is now down $5 and he sells to cut losses. Person B needs to buy back that share at $5, but he already has $10 in profit initially. Now he pays $5 for the share, leaving him still with $5 profit, and returns the share back to the lender + any interested accrued. In this scenario, the \u201cshort\u201d made money, the \u201clong\u201d lost money, and the \u201clender\u201d made interest money.\u00a0\n* The above scenarios help to show why \u201cshorts\u201d (typically hedge funds or experienced traders) might want to manipulate the stock price to go down. Hedge funds have an incredible amount of power in the market, which I will explain in a bit, and can often create serious price movements to invoke price action that benefits themselves. Shorts, therefore, have the opposite intention of longs. They want share prices to go down, and in the process, can bankrupt certain companies that rely on the stock market liquidity to stay afloat. In other words, when investors leave a stock because it is dropping in value, the company loses that money that they could have used to pay off debt, grow the business, develop new products, pay for expenses, etc.\u00a0\n\n**Market Manipulation:**\n\nMarket manipulation is not new to the scene. Investors have long known of the existence of stock market manipulation tactics, and every day, we may observe some levels of manipulation in specific stocks, specific categories or industries of stocks, or the entire market. Market manipulation is defined as any actions performed with the intention of moving a certain stock price in favor of the manipulator. In this case, these are the wealthy \u201cwhales\u201d or hedge funds, both of which have enormous capital capable of shifting stock prices at alarming speeds. Keep in mind, not all hedge funds do this and not all hedge funds are \u201cshorts\u201d. Some are \u201cneutral\u201d and act as lenders to make money, some are \u201cgrowth-based\u201d and invest just like everyday traders with the intention of raising share prices, and others are \u201cshort\u201d which are probably perceived to be the sadistic groups of the bunch. Below, I will be discussing how manipulation occurs and on different scales.\n\n**Manipulation Tactics on a Spectrum:**\n\nMarket manipulation can happen in certain stock, sectors, or the entire market. There are probably far more types of manipulative tactics than we know, but I will describe the most basic types and the strategies behind it.\n\n*Scenario 1:*\n\nLet\u2019s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. Hedge funds are not too excited about this increased share value, so they can \u201chedge\u201d or protect themselves, by selling put options. When they sell puts, they are anticipating that the stock will continue to surge, which causes the puts to become worthless at expiration, but on the contrary, they will be collecting the \u201cpremium\u201d or money paid upfront by traders that bought the put. At the same time, this hedge fund will slowly \u201ccover\u201d, or buy shares of Stock X, so that the increased value of the shares will offset the short position which is losing money. The manipulation here is by using the sheer amount of capital in hand to bolster the stock, both creating favorable conditions for the puts that they sold and the share that they purchased as cover. If they want to add another level of manipulation to this, they can also purchase call options, which will result in profit if the stock price goes up. In this scenario, hedge funds make money at the expense of put option buyers and other shorts that do not have manipulative power or capital to recreate this same strategy.\n\n*Scenario 2:*\n\nLet\u2019s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on Stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. This hedge fund does not want to risk extra capital to cover their short position (by buying shares, selling put options, or buying call options), so they try a different route. Keep in mind that hedge funds are typically heavily invested in many stocks and assets, meaning they have a lot of power in deciding the direction of many stocks that have potential to instill widespread fear across the entire market if it drops. Take for example, if Apple and Google began to hurl downwards, this can create panic in the market where everyday traders might sell their shares at a loss. This in turn might ripple through the market as other investors in other stocks are predicting a downward trajectory across the market since these big name stocks are losing value so rapidly. Conveniently enough, hedge funds own a lot of these big name \u201cFANG\u201d stocks.\n\n\u00a0If I am a moderately sadistic hedge fund, I can sell off a large holding of shares (in the scale of multi millions or billions) that are in the same sector as Stock X, which would incite fear across the sector, creating panic sell offs. The price will drop sharply across the board, including Stock X, and the short position will produce big profits. Because this hedge fund sold off a large chunk of their shares at a good price, they can now cover their short position (essentially getting rid of it), and then buy up these same stocks that were let go earlier, only this time at a much cheaper price. The hedge fund has now made money not only on the short position, but now they got into the stock at a cheap price in which they can explore other manipulative tactics to bolster the price again. This can be done by encouraging analyst upgrades, publicizing \u201cnewly\u201d purchased positions without disclosing the fact that they previously owned it, etc.\u00a0\n\n*Scenario 3:*\n\nThis one involves technology: algorithm trading (commonly referred to as algo trading). This one is a really intricately designed manipulative tactic that investors really have no way of getting around. Algorithm trading is the process of using high-speed super-computers and a team of traders to constantly monitor market activity and trade when opportunities arise. In this case, the hedge funds do not have to do any direct manipulation of the market, which makes this 100% legal. How this works is by taking advantage of how trading works and the time it takes for a trade to be made. For you general investors, we have mobile apps and web-based trading platforms to trade. When we like a stock, we have to go through the motion of inputting the stock ticker symbol, the amount of shares, the price we are willing to pay, hit submit, and confirm the trade. For hedge funds using algorithm trading, all this is done autonomously, which makes submission of an order several magnitudes quicker. When an order is submitted, it goes through a brokerage (Fidelity, Webull, ETrade, TDA, RH, etc.) and the data is rerouted to a clearing house (intermediate party that verifies and processes the trade). Clearing houses are responsible for making sure your orders are filled, but they take it on a first come first serve basis. So if a stock is moving quickly, hedge funds have a serious edge in getting in cheaper and faster as well as getting out higher and faster.\u00a0\n\nAlgorithm trading is integratable as part of the buying and selling strategies mentioned in the two previous scenarios, which is why they can almost guarantee profit. Algorithm trading also uses a lot of data in their backbone to determine the trades that have a high chance of profitability, and it acts on various factors such as volatility, volume, interest activity, news, etc. In some cases, these algorithms can be set to do some extremely sadistic things. I\u2019ll start by talking about \u201cmarket orders\u201d vs \u201climit orders\u201d. Before you make a trade on your brokerage, you will notice an option that says \u201cmarket order\u201d or \u201climit order\u201d. Market orders are an agreement that you will purchase the stock or option contract at the best price in the market in the momentary space in time. There is of course a huge risk to that because in that short moment in time, there may not be anyone selling at a good price, and instead, some people might set sell limits at ridiculous prices. For example, some people set a sell limit at $1000 for GME. If you did a market order, and you get really unlucky, you might end up snagging a share for $1000 each, when the actual share value might be $300. However, when you set a \u201climit order\u201d, you are agreeing to buy a share at a maximum price that you designated.\u00a0\n\nIn the event that a hedge fund siphons a ton of shares of a company, the algorithm can be set to sell these shares at a ridiculous sell limit. Remember, when they buy or sell, it\u2019s processed significantly faster at the clearing houses, so if you\u2019re that one unlucky trader that went for a market order on a stock, you might end up purchasing it at a huge premium set by the hedge funds themselves. Moral of the story: DO NOT PURCHASE AS MARKET ORDER - ALWAYS PURCHASE AT LIMIT ORDER.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m am not a financial advisor, so take everything I said as gibberish.",

        "selftext": "***TL/DR: Richard Branson's SPAC is rumored to be merging with 23andMe. 23andMe has an invaluable set of over 10 million human DNA sequences that are used to create ground-breaking drugs. Cathie Wood is VERY bullish on genomics, ARKG buying is highly likely. Beginning to add commons in the $13s; will add more once rumor is confirmed.***\n\nYou probably know about 23andMe, the popular Christmas gift where you spit in a tube and they tell you ancestors are from. A recent [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/23andme-is-said-to-be-in-talks-to-go-public-via-branson-spac) rumor has said that VG Acquisition Corp (VGAC) is in talks to take them public. If confirmed, **I believe that this deal has a proven management team and both short term and long term catalysts, including a likely stake from Cathie Wood and ARK in their ARKG fund.**\n\n**VGAC Background**\n\nSize in trust - $480M\n\nCommons - $13.46\n\nWarrants\\* - $3.28\n\n\\*Warrants are 1 for 1 and can be redeemed on a cashless basis\n\n[VG Acquisition Corp](https://vgacquisition.com/) ($VGAC) is a SPAC led by the Virgin Group and its famous billionaire founder, Sir Richard Branson. They IPO'ed on October 2nd with $480M in trust.\n\nYou may remember that Branson was involved in the deal that arguably helped kick off the SPAC  movement when [he took Virgin Galactic public](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/24/virgin-galactic-set-to-trade-on-the-nyse-on-monday-as-the-first-space-tourism-stock.html) at the end of 2019 with Chamath's first SPAC, IPOA. SPCE became the first publicly traded space company and has fared well since it's public debut, currently trading at $48.50 with a 52 week high of nearly $60.\n\nVirgin already has a foothold in the healthcare space through [Virgin Care](https://virgincare.co.uk/), which partners with the NHS and has quickly become the [UK's largest healthcare provider](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/05/how-virgin-became-one-of-the-uks-leading-healthcare-providers). As of 2018 they were already profitable and pulling in over $300M in revenues. Its safe to say they understand the healthcare space already and how 23andMe can fit into it.\n\nBranson and the Virgin name will naturally bring a lot of hype to VGAC. Virgin has previous experience with successful and wide-ranging businesses and multiple large mergers, including:\n\n- Virgin Mobile being acquired by Sprint\n- Virgin Media being acquired by Liberty Global\n- Virgin American being acquired by Alaska Airlines\n\nBranson and Virgin are innovators, savvy investors, and take early stakes in challenging industries like space travel, aerospace, telecom, and media. The man literally got knighted because of his \"services to entrepreneurship\". If identified 23andMe in only 4 months, clearly its a business they are highly interested in and see a lot of potential for the industry.\n\n**23andMe**\n\n23andMe was founded in 2006 by current CEO Anne Wojcicki as a direct to consumer genetic testing agency (for what it's worth, Wojcicki is also on the the [star-studded AJAX SPAC](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/kagnl9/ajax_is_going_to_clean_up/) search team). They were most recently valued at $2.5B in 2020 when they raised an $800M funding round.\n\nThey became popular for their ancestry platform, providing users with their ancestral background information. They also expanded to provide testing for an array of genetic diseases or pre-dispositions, including; late onset Alzheimers, Parkinson's, Type 2 Diabetes and Celiac Disease.\n\nWhile the DNA test is their consumer flagship product, the real opportunity is in the data. **23andMe has the world's second largest genetic dataset with over 10 million tests performed** (behind their competitor Ancestry at 16 million).\n\nThey are currently and will continue to utilize this massive genetic data, with a dedicated therapeutics team. Wojcicki said recently in a [60 minutes interview](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/at-home-genealogy-testing-risks-60-minutes-2021-01-31/) that **\"100% of revenues are going into our therapeutics\".** This is not a direct to consumer testing product, this is a drug company that has a MASSIVE amount of genetic data. The therapeutics team is growing rapidly, showing [16 open positions](https://www.23andme.com/careers/) in therapeutics research at 23andMe, easily the most at the company.\n\nThey have already had some success on the therapeutics front. Last year they used their genetic data to create a protein that is able to block autoimmune diseases, this one targeted to psoriasis. They then were able to [license this drug to Spanish drug company Almirall](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060456/23andme-licensed-drug-developed-genetic-database-autoimmune-psoriasis-almirall).\n\nMore importantly, they also secured a $300M investment and 4 year partnership with massive pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to use genetic data to develop new drugs, in particular for Parkinson's disease.  GSK now has a major equity stake in the company and has the scale and expertise to utilize this data set.\n\nIn 2009, 23andMe started the world's largest Parkinson's trial with over 11,000 participants using their DNA.\n\nThis type of research is groundbreaking for genetically pre-disposed diseases that were previously difficult or impossible to treat. Their main focus at the time is Parkinson's disease and bi-polar an major depressive disorder.\n\n**Investors and Partners**\n\nTheir value hasn't gone unnoticed. As mentioned they were last valued at $2.5B in 2020. Their major investors include Sequoia Capital ($250M), GlaxoSmithKline ($300M), Fidelity, and the National Institute of Health. They also have key partnerships with Pfizer, Biogen, Stanford University, University of Chicago, and Parkinson's foundations including Michael J Fox foundation, National Parkinson Foundation, and Parkinson's Institute and Clinical Center.\n\nFor a reference on their valuation, Blackstone bought a majority stake in their competitor Ancestry for $4.7B last year. Note that Ancestry is not focused on on therapeutics research the way that 23andMe is, so while they compete on the DTC DNA testing front, they don't seem to compete on a therapeutics front.\n\n**Momma Cathie**\n\nCathie Wood of ARK has been clear in multiple [interviews](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/episodes/tip334-disruptive-innovation-w-cathie-wood/) and [articles](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kg5x44/cathie_wood_thinks_that_the_genomics_sector_can/) recently that **she is VERY bullish on genomics** as the industry with the most room for growth in the next 10 years, even more so than electric vehicles and Tesla.  Cathie directly [tweeted](https://twitter.com/cathiedwood/status/579243812314202112) about 23andMe back in 2015 when they only had 850,000 samples collected, so I'm sure she's even more excited now that they're over 10 million.\n\nARKG already has a number of direct DNA sequencing and therapeutics companies in its top holdings like Twist Bioscience, Pacific Biosciences, and Crispr Therapeutics. Cathie also frequently talks about how the companies with the best and earliest data set have a massive advantage (i.e Tesla autonomous driving because they have the most data on miles driven). She will view the massive mine of DNA data as a gold mine for the genomics revolution.\n\nARK has not shied away from SPACs in the past, with investments in OPEN, LGVW, DMYD and OAC all being pushed higher with ARK investments in them. In my opinion, 23andMe is a shoe-in for an ARKG investment once DA is confirmed and will send the stock higher and give it an \"ARK\" floor wherever they enter at.\n\n**Risk factors**\n\nThere are risks associated with VGAC as with every stock and SPAC.\n\nFirst, the initial reaction to this was muted. It popped from $12.90 to $13.90 on the rumor, and is now in the low $13s. It's possible that 23andMe simply doesn't generate a lot of investor attention as a target. I feel that this actually provides us with a buying opportunity that is being overlooked. With confirmation of a deal and a hopeful ARK buy, investors will begin to see the value of the data they have and this will run up similar to other SPACs have.\n\n23andMe was highly popular in 2018, but their DTC DNA product has suffered recently with sales suffering in 2019 and they were forced to do layoffs in 2020. Ancestry also had to do layoffs as well as the whole at-home testing market was down.\n\nAlso important to note that in 2018 they were able to do nearly $500M in revenue (most recent revenue number I could find), but are **not yet profitable as of 2020**.\n\nPrivacy remains a main concern as well when you're dealing with millions of people's genetic code. When pressed on this in the 60 minutes interview, she states that users need to \"opt-in\" to share their data for this research and that nothing is ever used without consent. 80% of their users opt-in to share their data, which is about 8 million samples that are usable...still a very sizable genetic database to research from. Whether there will be legislation around how this data can be used is yet to be seen.\n\nAnother risk stems from the way in which they collect genome data. They use genotyping which is cheaper but less accurate than next gen sequencing technology.\n\nLast, it is over 30% above NAV and is only a rumor. Bloomberg has generally been accurate on these rumors, but its important to note this is not an official announcement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Play**\n\nI currently have a starter position in VGAC commons here in the $13s. It may hover in the 13s or lower between now and the time rumor is confirmed, and I'll be adding heavily if it drops. On LOI and investor presentation, I'll likely add more and I conservatively expect this to hit $18-$20 pre-merger, higher with an ARK purchase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nu/HowDoesIStonks also provided a [great DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/l75kxu/vgac_23andme_dd/) here 5 days ago\n\n*Disclaimer: I have a starter position in VGAC commons at $13.50. I will look to add more on any dips and will potentially add more once structure of deal is known. This is not financial advice.*\n\n*Edit 1: Added a risk factor and Cathie Wood tweet*\n\nEdit 2: Thanks everyone for all the feedback and commentary on this! I\u2019ve learned a lot from the comments. \n\nI still strongly stand by my bull case and believe that there is plenty of upside here, both for short term swing traders and long term investors. However I think it\u2019s important to update if I learn something new. After reading [this article](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/caveat-emptor-beware-of-direct-to-consumer-genetic-testing/) and learning about the different types of genetic tests, I\u2019ll change my stance on ARKG from \u201clikely\u201d buying to \u201cpossibly\u201d buying. 10 million+ DNA tests is impressive and I imagine ARK will certainly consider a position, but it\u2019s important to know the differences between genotyping done by 23andMe vs NGS testing which is more thorough and what ARK prefers.\n\nGood luck everyone!",

        "selftext": "  \n\n\\*First off, this is my opinion based on the facts available. This is by no means financial advice. I am not a financial advisor\\*\n\nIf you are not familiar with EDGAR, it is the SEC\u2019s database for various types of company filings. One of those filings is called the 13G. \n\n\\*\u201cThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Schedule 13G form is an alternative filing for the Schedule 13D form and is used to report a party's ownership of stock which exceeds 5% of a company's total stock issue. Schedule 13G is a shorter version of Schedule 13D with fewer reporting requirements.\u201d\\*\n\nWhen a company decides to dispose of beneficial ownership of stock, and holds more then 5% of shares available, they are required to AMEND the filing 13G, making it the 13G/A. When these documents are submitted, they are filed under both the beneficial owner and issuer of stock in EDGAR. \n\nIn the case of GameStop\u2019s \u201cshort squeeze\u201d, and understanding the exchange of shares during that time period, BlackRock Inc. (BLK) was the only institutional holder, owning over 5% of shares, that liquidated their position SO FAR. BlackRock Inc. liquidated 9,217,335 shares of GameStop on 1/26/2021.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&amp;ciks=0001364742&amp;entityName=BlackRock%2520Inc.%2520(BLK)%2520(CIK%25200001364742)&amp;startdt=2016-01-26&amp;enddt=2021-01-27&amp;page=5](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&amp;ciks=0001364742&amp;entityName=BlackRock%2520Inc.%2520(BLK)%2520(CIK%25200001364742)&amp;startdt=2016-01-26&amp;enddt=2021-01-27&amp;page=5)\n\n\\^control-f: GameStop\n\nBlackRock is the SECOND largest institutional holder of GME, behind FMR LLC with 9,534,090 shares, according to Yahoo Finance. So\u2026 you are probably wondering, \u201cHow many shares of GME do The Top 10 Institutions hold combined ?\u201d\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME)\n\nLet\u2019s Count:\n\n\\*FMR LLC\\*   9,534,090\n\n\\*BlackRock Inc\\*    - 9,217,335 (According to 13G/A)\n\n\\*Vanguard Group Inc.\\* 5,288,507\n\n\\*Susquehanna International Group LLP\\* 4,444,128\n\n\\*Dimensional Fund Advisors LP\\*  3,948,114\n\n\\*Senvest Management LLC\\*  3,225,740\n\n\\*State Street Corporation\\* 2,609,487\n\n\\*Morgan Stanley\\* 1,995,842\n\n\\*Paradice Investment Management LLC\\* 1,832,526\n\n\\*Norges Bank Investment Management\\* 1,811,792\n\nTotal: 25,472,891 Shares of GME or 25.473/46.89 = **54% of Float Shares**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the same Yahoo Finance page where we found \u2018Top Institutional Holder\u2019 data, if you scroll down, you can see \u2018Top Mutual Fund Holders\u2019. Combined, these funds hold 18.75/46.89 = **40%** of float shares.\n\n\\*Note that two of these mutual funds own over 5% of shares, meaning they would need to file with the SEC if they were to sell. These two mutual funds hold **22%** of float shares. \\*\n\nAccounting for BlackRock\u2019s liquidation, **54**% of shares are held by the Top 10 Institutional Holders at the moment. Lets say, worst case scenario, only the two biggest mutual funds are left holding shares, making that **22%** of float shares. So far, we have accounted for **76%** of all shares. \n\nThe last data we have on short interest is \\~**122%** of float shares. The media has reported numbers as low as **33%** short interest post squeeze**,** according to S3 partners. Mathematically, this is impossible. \n\nIf short interest is truly **33%,** that means these institutional holders would have filed a 13G/A\u2026. But they didn\u2019t\u2026..meaning they did not sell. This means that there is still, **at a minimum, 76% of float shares shorted.**  This is VERY high and could cause another squeeze.\n\n**TL:DR**\n\nAs you know, lots of bagholders around the world are not selling. It just so happens that we are not alone. We have some of the BIGGEST institutions bagholding with us; **minimum** **76% of float shares in fact**. If you thought that we were the only greedy and vengeful mfs out there, you are sorrily mistaken. These institutions (i.e. Fidelity, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley) want to see this second squeeze just as much as you. Until then, HOLD THE LINE!!!",

Fidelity and other trading platforms that allowed GME trading because they weren't tied to clearinghouses that had short interests but have long interests in GME will now have a motive to make retail investors the bag holder while they cash out on the short squeeze.

        "selftext": "Follow up to the DD I posted when $CBBT was trading at $0.011.\n\nFor the record I am invested in this, with a cost avg of $0.008. \n \nLong post, TL;DR at the bottom \n\n$CBBT has already been a game changer for a lot of peoples portfolios and I think it still has a lot of room to grow. Here's why:\n\n- CBBT is about to acquire PKG manufacturing, A privately owned company with an estimated 2020 revenue of 14.9mm during the pandemic, down from an estimated $30mm in 2019. \n\nhttps://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.pkg_inc.d156b80f100a783756cde91e55815d5c.html\n\nThis acquisition has been confirmed by both companies. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/PKG_UIS/status/1315845090556801026?s=19\n\nhttps://twitter.com/CerebainBiotech/status/1355915206824775680?s=19\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/pkg-user-interface-solutions_cerebain-biotech-on-twitter-activity-6761851877358403584-beMj\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200903005085/en/PKG-Inc.%E2%80%99s-CEO-Excited-With-the-Potential-Acquisition-by-Cerebain-Biotech\n\n\n\n-PKG Inc has been in business since 1989 and is the key manufacturer of the only FDA approved ClearMask, the revenues tied to this could be anywhere in the $20mm to $40 mm range for 2020, and in the $40mm to 100mm range in 2021. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/theclearmask?s=09\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201125005429/en/Cerebain-Biotech-Announces-PKG-Inc.-to-Become-Key-Manufacturer-for-ClearMask%E2%84%A2-and-Xometry\n\n- Cerebain Biotech is looking to get FDA approval in 2021 for their Omentum implantable (patent pending) ALZHEIMER'S treatment device. A revolutionary , non invasive day surgery that is the first of its kind.\n\nhttps://cerebain.com/technology/\n\n\n To battle a disease that affects over 5,200,000 families worldwide, costing an estimated $305bn in 2020 for the U.S alone.\n\nhttps://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures#:~:text=conditions%20to%20society.-,In%202020%2C%20Alzheimer's%20and%20other%20dementias%20will%20cost%20the%20nation,trillion%20(in%202020%20dollars).\n\nhttps://cerebain.com/disease/ \n\n\"Unless a treatment to slow, stop or prevent the disease is developed, in 2050, Alzheimer's is projected to cost more than $1.1 trillion (in 2020 dollars). This dramatic rise includes more than four-fold increases both in government spending under Medicare and Medicaid and in out-of-pocket spending.\"\n\n$1.1 Trillion! \n\nAs many already know, and others will soon find out, Alzheimer's treatments are becoming a focal point of the medical field and governmental bodies. Most recently, Joe Biden has stated publicly in one of his speeches that he will increase government spending in this field. \n\nIn a letter to shareholders by $CBBT CEO Eric Clemmons, he stated that they will update the companies financials and become current immediately following the acquisition of PKG INC in order for reflect their current revenues. This would be a huge catalyst as users of Fidelity and institutional ownership will have access to the stock. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/CerebainBiotech/status/1348671894615191554?s=19\n\nThey also have plans to uplist to a major exchange, NYSE, NASDAQ in 2021.\n\nOn January 27th, 2021 EMA Financial LLC filed a SEC 13G/A to increase share ownership of Cerebain Biotech to 70,920,235 of common stock, or 9.9% class of securities. Translation: Institutional investment. \n\nhttps://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-004597/\n\nCBBT and PKG has also stated that they are actively pursuing additional acquisitions and that there will be more transactions announced \"right after\" the acquisition of PKG INC. \n\nA good overview of this email can be found here:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/5555academy/status/1346672835268231169?s=19\n\nOther companies with Alzheimer's treatments have seen a huge increase in market cap and stock price upon FDA approval. Look to \n\n$SAVA- Casava Sciences Inc  who's shares jumped from a low of $1.11 on OCT 5th 2020 to a high of $138.50 on January 31st 2020 (+12,400%) upon FDA approval, which the data shows wasn't all too promising,  to and \n\n$BIIB- Biogen INC who's market cap increased by $15bn $15bn upon FDA announcement, with controversial treatment. \n\n$CBBT's device is thought to look much more promising than either of the aforementioned.\n\n\nMany have wondered as to how PKG, a private company with real revenues, could be acquired by a micro cap biotech company in CBBT. It has been speculated that PKG has wants to go public and instead of an IPO, is doing so under the $CBBT umbrella. As to why they would be doing this, again out of speculation, PKG has seen CBBT's omentum Alzheimer's device, thinks it will be massive and is going to manufacture it. They have wanted to get into the medical field as well. Along with PKG's government &amp; aerospace, medical, industrial and fortune 500 contracts along with the omentum Alzheimer's device, Cerebain Biotech looking to become a powerhouse in the field. \n\nOne of the things I love about $CBBT and one that I believe will draw the eye of many investors is that, no matter what your investing strategy or niche is, CBBT has it covered. They fall under all categories including, Acquisition, SPAC, Biotech, financials, revenues, Updating financials, Uplisting, FDA approval and fundementals. \n\nI understand the people who are going to say it's already up 4000% since October and therefore doesn't have much room to grow. To those people, I would encourage you to read the entirety of this DD, check the resources, do your research and come to your own conclusion. In my opinion, this company has so much potential and the run has barely started. \n\nAs of this post $CBBT is trading at $0.35, up 52% on the day.\n\nI am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. Always do your own DD and invest with caution. \n\nThanks for reading.\n\nTL;DR: $CBBT has been in fire but through multiple catalysts expected a major acquisition and promising medical applications, this still has a ton of room to grow. \n\nP.S. Don't say I didn't warn you before the run up, as I have been posting about $CBBT since October.",

If you are new to investing and jumped in with Robinhood, WeBull, Fidelity or other brokers in GME, AMC, BB, NOK or any other stocks, don't forget to file your 1099-B next year. Or the IRS WILL come for dat ass and if you think investing in risky plays is tarded, wait until you're served with a crisp penalty you can't afford to pay. Your broker will send the 1099-B to the IRS so they already have it and are waiting on you to file it to make sure it matches their records. Don't think that because you lost money, or \"diDn'T mAkE enOuGh\" you don't have to file it. \n\nYou can file yourself or if you're feeling lazy, use TurboTax and most brokers have an auto-import option there. I know Robinhood and Fidelity do, not sure about others. \n\nI won't link to them on here but you can find many stories on Reddit by people who didn't file taxes, did wash sales and all sorts of things that raise red flags with the tax man and you'll see it's all fun and games until it happens to you.

        "selftext": "**FINAL EDIT**: There are critical support levels of retail buying points. Those are 143 (which was unbroken at the tie of writing), 68, and 38. 68 (8:10 - 8:25 AM today, Feb. 4 '21) has clearly broken as people closed off positions at breakeven and the flood gates down burst open. Another sell off between 10:00 &amp; 10:15 AM coincided with another sell wall at 64-62. I think we'll make it all the way to 30-40 before it'll make sense to start buying long again (you saw what happened at 64-68; the same will likely happen at 34-38 but I don't know where the exact floor is).\n\nThe data has been showing, since the 140s, that retail isn't holding. ***The data presented as the cornerstone and namesake of this DD is no longer relevant***. The ratio of volume of shares per sell order relative to buy order appears to be higher than the ratio of buy orders to sell orders. In other words, there may be a 3:1 distribution of raw orders, but the sells are so much more packed that it breaks the ratio anyway. *The situation changed and as more data came to light, I now know I was wrong.*\n\n*I used to be a HODLer* ***until the situation changed***. I lost out on a lot of profit by holding through waning evidence at the 300s, 200s, and 150s, and only pulled at 111\u2014I was able to secure a little bit of profit to make this obsession a bit more worthwhile. At time of writing, the price is 52.60. Even with bullish conviction, this was still a directionally correct move as I can now buy double as much as I had before.\n\nThat being said, I think we're in for more downside, and I will not be buying back until we hit the bottom, wherever that may be. ***I'm still long-term bullish on the company transformation and will re-enter a moderately sized position after the volatility settles down.***\n\n**Here's the original DD so you can see how I had brought up good data, but was directionally incorrect in my sprinkled analysis of it. Learn from this like I did, and you'll be more successful in the future.** Furthermore, I will not stop writing DDs because I think the data here is sound and makes sense. What was wrong was the analysis, which can happen to anyone with this many unknown variables. Future DD will take confirmation bias into account and will have higher probability of being on the money.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nToday's most traded retail assets on Fidelity were $AMC &amp; $GME.\n\nAnd you know what people did? They bought a metric fuckton of shares. Contrary to what some of the Reddit Daily thread sentiment (which may or may not be bot-infested hell at this point) &amp; news outlets claim, retail has seemingly not lost any interest in the stock and possibly prevented it from diving further.\n\nObligatory disclaimer: Mods, for the love of god please let this through it took a lot to write and I know for a fact it hasn't been discussed sufficiently / didn't get a dedicated post yet. Also, I'm a \ud83e\udd8d and am not financial advisor and this isn't financial advice. This is a synthesis of public available information with autistic analysis like sprinkles on a birthday cupcake.\n\nDisclaimer 2: I am extremely long $GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19\n\n**UPDATE**: my stop loss got triggered and I am no longer long $GME until data changes. The information here has not changed, but the impact and its magnitude may have.\n\nWith that out of the way, I present to you,\n\n# Exhibit A: Order Distribution\n\n\\~***75%*** of all $GME orders on Fidelity *today, on 2/1* were to *buy* the asset, rather than sell it. Each order can have however many shares.\n\n[https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)\n\nThat's just Fidelity. If you're able to check the order distribution on other brokers (like Vanguard or Schwab) please post it below and I'll update this post with your info. Usually this information is displayed on Top Traded Stocks or on the stock page itself under some tab.\n\nThere's more:\n\nWeBull is showing a 45/55 distribution on the entire order book. Total Outflow (sells) was quoted at 1099, and total inflow at 996. While this may seem useless at first, consider this: the share price lost ***30***% today, but the order book is split ***45/55***, not ***35/65***. Just 10% of the outflow accounted for the 30% collapse in share price.\n\n# Exhibit B: Volume\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/)\n\nToday's volume was half of the daily average. *Half of the daily average*. And while the price 30% movement may seem scary at first, trending down on low volume is actually a bullish sign. Courtesy of u/weedcomet:\n\n\"[https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html](https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html) 'After a strong-volume upward move, if the market moves sideways in conjunction with lower volume for several days in a row, it is a bullish sign indicating that all overhanging selling pressure has been relieved and any buying could spark a strong price rise.'\"\n\nIn other words, flat or even *declining* on low volume often precedes \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d. Literally any form of significant buying can move the price by a very high magnitude.\n\nThere's also been studies done on this phenomena, and correlation was established between sideways or negative movement on low volume and a subsequent increase in price. Feel free to research this on your own accord and post your findings below for all of us autists to read.\n\n# Exhibit C: Why Retail Buying May Return Soon\n\nI'm not a financial advisor, and even less so Nostradamus. I don't know when we'll be able to take advantage of this sideways movement to our benefit. What I do know is that that time is approaching. Considering two major events:\n\n1. Transition from Robinhood &amp; other affected brokers to mainstream solutions\u2022 This was likely started en masse on Thursday, before RH transfer restrictions kicked in. It takes 2-5 market days to transfer an account to another broker, and about the same for just slushing cash around. That means, a solid chunk of trades will be able to buy into the market beginning tomorrow and throughout the remaining week.\u2022\u00a0Many are also in the process of opening up new accounts. These were probably started en masse on Friday, when transfer restrictions prevented people from taking the plunge. A solid chunk of brokers need settlement time for instant deposits.- The instant deposits are capped, meaning whale accounts aren't able to kick in yet. Regular deposits takes 1-2 business days to clear. Beginning tomorrow, we'll start seeing larger retail accounts com online and regain their impact on price delta.\n2. Robinhood bottleneck may or may not disappear this week. Robinhood just raised another $2.4 billion on top of their previous round, which is more than enough to clear DTC's collateral requirements. According to their own statements as of late, this was the primary reason why Robinhood restricted asset purchases in the first place. If you're willing to trust them on that, it means that we shall see a resurgence in volume from remaining Robinhood users in the coming days.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nPutting 1+2+3 together we get a potential recipe for another green EoW. Retail sentiment being positive can translate into higher volume once logistical bottlenecks are cleared and resume ass-ripping activities. HOWEVER, it is by NO MEANS guaranteed, and only the tippy top of the world know exactly what these mfs might pull off in the coming days. Get yourselves ready for either a positive or negative scenario this week / beginning of next.\n\nGME to moon.\n\n**ANOTHER EDIT:** Welcome to the end of the post. I\u2019m proud of you for making it this far in literacy class. I want to respond to all of your comments and questions but automod deletes all but a couple of them. I\u2019ll answer them as soon as they show up.\n\n**UPDATE:** Ok automod deleted a bunch of negative feedback which is WRONG. Also some FAQs that got blocked. The questions were valid so here\u2019s the best I could do:\n\n1\u2013Retail made no dent so what to expect now?\n\n* I don\u2019t know what to expect. What I do know is that retail made no dent because of the bottlenecks mentioned in Exhibit C above.\n\n2\u2013Should I buy now or what?\n\n* I want you to make your own conclusion based on available evidence, not seek confirmation bias. I don\u2019t want to be liable for your money and neither does anyone else.\n\n3\u2013Smart money is leaving and you\u2019ll be left holding the bag\n\n* I have yet to see credible evidence in either the trading volume, SEC reports, or formal announcements from any major institutional shareholder of GameStop that indicates they\u2019re leaving. If you have this information please relay it to me (don\u2019t use comments, you\u2019ll get blocked by bot). BlackRock had to adjust due to internal requirements AFAIK correct me if I\u2019m wrong\n* **UPDATE**: this post shows that more instutitional shares flowed out than in. But, more funds bought in than exited. Make of that what you will. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laum38/for\\_the\\_scared\\_little\\_baby\\_apestake\\_a\\_look\\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laum38/for_the_scared_little_baby_apestake_a_look_for/)\n\n4\u2013AMC?\n\n* I have no data on AMC. You should do your own research and make a thread like this.\n\n5\u2013When selling then?\n\n* I have an emergency exit plan like everyone else should. I don\u2019t have the financial capability to let GME go to 0. I\u2019ll keep a small position post-exit just in case. Make an exit plan that aligns with what loss or gain you can stomach. Don\u2019t invest more than you\u2019re willing to lose. Nothing on this sub is financial advice. You don\u2019t have to sell if you can lose everything. I\u2019m probably liquidating my options and doing shares only until further trend confirmation.",

As a way to hopefully reduce my upcoming financial burden, I've been learning more about finance and investing and retirement accounts. \n\nI currently have about $2000 in a Roth IRA through Fidelity and want to put that money into some good ETFs. Ideally I'd like to maximize my returns via a mix of high and low risk investments, but based on my understanding, it's more beneficial for me to go for high risk because I have several decades until retirement. Please correct me if I'm wrong. \n\nI've selected 14 ETFs that have interested me and now need help deciding which to actually invest in. I understand 14 investments would lower my risk, which is why I want to simplify my portfolio to maybe 5 or more ETFs. \n\nThank you in advance! \n\nList of ETFs: https://imgur.com/a/OwwaCvB",

Beachbody management and shareholders are rolling over 100% of their equity stake and will own approximately 84% of the pro forma business at close.\n\n**Combined Company Overview**\n\nAs a leader in digital fitness streaming and nutrition solutions, Beachbody is well-positioned to capitalize on the increased demand for at-home health and wellness offerings and will further invest to drive accelerated customer acquisition, expand internationally and pursue attractive, high-return M&amp;A opportunities.\n\nWith brands such as P90X\u00ae, INSANITY\u00ae and 21 Day Fix\u00ae, Beachbody has consistently expanded its market share over the past two decades through its proven model of integrating the most comprehensive library of premium fitness content with easy-to-follow nutrition guidance and supplements. Through the BOD and Openfit platforms, the Company has developed a diverse offering of live and on-demand content as well as nutrition solutions that reach a passionate and loyal community, including more than 2.6 million paid digital subscribers.\n\nWith the addition of Myx, the Company's portfolio will expand to include a connected fitness offering that provides a holistic and innovative on and off-bike solution with workouts that are personalized based on machine learning and heart rate data. With an attractive price point of $1,299, Myx sold over 27,000 bikes in its first year of operation, and has a highly engaged customer base of users who complete an average of 15 workouts each month. In addition, the merger with Myx will further leverage the scale of The Beachbody Company's platform as it unlocks synergies across distribution, marketing and content creation for all three of its brands.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with Forest Road and Myx Fitness, and are humbled by the proven team of executives and industry icons who have stepped forward to support our shared vision,\u201d said Mr. Daikeler. \u201cWe have seen incredible digital growth in recent years, which was further fueled in 2020 by a structural and lasting shift in how people embrace health and fitness. With the acquisition of Myx, cutting edge technology meets best-in-class streaming content -- and we will continue to redefine the at-home fitness experience as we pair the integrated hardware, science-based heart rate coaching and personalized smart recommendations behind Myx with Beachbody and Openfit\u2019s best-in-class content libraries, track record of content innovation and vast network.\u201d\n\nMr. Mayer commented: \u201cBeachbody\u2019s rapid subscriber growth is grounded in the concept of community and accountability with a mission-driven focus that capitalizes on the huge growth in the health and wellness space. The Company's engagement and retention metrics validate the quality and depth of its content library and direct-to-consumer (DTC) technology capabilities. I see many parallels at Beachbody with the work we did at Disney, where we aggressively accelerated our digital transformation and leveraged our content to build Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. In addition to its significant organic growth potential, the scale and differentiation of Beachbody\u2019s platform will allow us to pursue attractive M&amp;A opportunities in this highly fragmented ecosystem, which will enable us to increase our market share globally and diversify our product offering. I\u2019m excited to join the board to help further fuel growth and value creation for the company and its shareholders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we raised our SPAC, we were determined to find a company with a strong, proven business model and significant growth potential where we could add value from our experience in the creation and monetization of premium content. Beachbody is a perfect fit with those objectives,\u201d said Tom Staggs, former COO &amp; CFO of Disney and Forest Road board member and strategic advisory committee chair. \u201cWe are fortunate to have identified a business poised to benefit from three powerful market trends: digital subscriptions, connected fitness and growing consumer demand for health and wellness. These trends give us even more confidence that we have found an extremely attractive investment for our shareholders. Beachbody has always leveraged its fitness content to acquire customers profitably and with the proceeds of this transaction, Carl and his team at Beachbody can invest to significantly accelerate customer acquisition and financial growth for years to come.\u201d\n\n**Combined Company Highlights**\n\n* A diverse portfolio that appeals to a broad consumer base through a holistic approach that brings together at-home, digitally enabled fitness, nutrition and community\n* Generated 2020 pro forma revenue of $880 million across BOD, Openfit and Myx, which achieved $30 million of revenue in its first year of operations\n* 2.6 million paid digital fitness subscribers with 96% month over month retention\n* Industry-leading 89% gross margins on digital subscription revenue across all three brands\n* The deepest library of premium fitness content in the industry that generates more than 180 million views annually\n* A premium portfolio of branded nutrition products that are scientifically developed, clinically tested and strategically paired with fitness content for a holistic health and wellness experience\n* Scalable platform that enables synergies across distribution, marketing and content creation\n* Management team with over 22 years of experience creating content, acquiring customers and delivering substantial revenue and EBITDA\n* Well-positioned to unlock accelerated growth and expects to achieve compound annual revenue growth of 30% over the next 5 years\n\n**Transaction Overview**\n\nIn addition to the approximately $300 million held in Forest Road\u2019s trust account (assuming no redemptions), institutional investors, including Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC and Fertitta Capital, have committed to a private placement (\u201cPIPE\u201d) of $225 million to purchase shares of Class A common stock of the combined company that will close concurrently with the business combination.\n\nThe transaction implies a pro forma enterprise value for Beachbody of approximately $2.9 billion, or 2.0x 2022 estimated revenue. It is anticipated that the combined company will have over $420 million of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet, assuming no redemptions from the trust account, to fund its future growth plans.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Forest Road, and the Board of Managers of each of Beachbody and Myx have unanimously approved the transaction, and holders representing a majority of Beachbody equity interests and a majority of Myx equity interests have signed voting and support agreements agreeing to vote for the transaction. In addition to Beachbody and Myx equity holder approvals, the transaction will require the approval of the stockholders of Forest Road, and is subject to other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals.\n\nAdditional information about the proposed transaction, including a copy of the merger agreement and investor presentation, will be provided in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and will be available at[ www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&amp;esheet=52377017&amp;newsitemid=20210210005414&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.sec.gov&amp;index=1&amp;md5=2a2b6d59952233adec2575bebad8a0d5).\n\n**Advisors**\n\nThe Raine Group LLC (\u201cRaine\u201d) acted as exclusive financial advisor to Beachbody.

        "selftext": "I said this in a comment but I\u2019ll post it here as well because I have had LOTS of friends ask for help and I want to make sure we have the least amount of BagHolders possible. \n\nOTC means over the counter. A lot of penny stocks mentioned here are not approved to be traded on the Nasdaq. Robinhood very rarely if at all allows traders to trade on OTC positions because they\u2019re such high risk.\n\nRight now everything is great and any blind monkey is making money, but sadly, a lot of people in these positions will over leverage, \u201cbuy the dip\u201d, then be down thousands of dollars wondering what went wrong.\n\nOTC\u2019s are incredibly volatile often swinging 30-50% a day.\n\n#OTC STOCKS WILL VERY COMMONLY DO PUBLIC OFFERINGS TO RAISE CAPITAL FOR THEIR COMPANIES THIS CAN BE VERY COMMON CAUSE FOR LOSS OF MONEY AND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS HAPPEN TO OTC STOCKS THAT SEE VERY LARGE SURPRISE JUMPS IN VALUE BUT IF YOU TRUST THE COMPANY YOU CAN BUY THE DIP WHEN STOCK FALLS BELOW OFFER PRICE. \n\nI use A broker (not advertising for anyone) for them and pay the $6.95 on trades because it makes sure I\u2019m confident when I want to buy or sell and they update quickly and don\u2019t have reading or cash restrictions like fidelity does for a lot of their OTC stock.\n\nIf you invest in an OTC stock have a plan because if you just yolo buy dips you could be looking at a destroyed position.\n\nSource... learned a lot from trial and error\n\nAlso another thing I\u2019ve seen migrate onto this sub is diamond hands and paper hands.  Here in PennyStocks there is no such thing.  You sell when you are happy with your profits and watch that moon rocket go off without you.  If you want to chase the high sell back for most of your money and let the rest fly.  \n\nThere will literally almost always be another winner in this world and it\u2019s better to ride in first class 100x then to fly on a G6 once that crashes into a mountain.",

Hold your belt !!!\n\nLast data shows 110% of Institutional Share = 110%/48,89 = 53,779MM institut (lower as I think is higher)\n\n38,93MM + 53,78 MM = 92,7MM Shares detained within Institutions and Retailers while only 48MM are available\n\n==============&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; GME is detained at 193% TOTAL !!!!!\n\n\u200b\n\nShorts = 73% so 73% of 92,7MM = 67,6 MM Stocks are shorted\n\n67,6MM but 48,89MM is the real Float = 138% real short Number !!!!\n\n\u200b\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-amc-reddit-investing-213609595.html\n\nIn this article it said 4,5% of Americans detained at today GME Stock , let's take just 2% with only 5 GME share= 2% x 5 x 329MM = 32,9MM detained by Americans and let's say just 20% extra for rest of the world.\n\n32,9 + 20% = 39,5MM shares by retailers remember up when I said 38,9 MM ??? Quite close right??\n\n\u200b\n\nTNDLR\n\nRetailers hold 39MM Shares = 80%\n\nInstitutions hold 113 %\n\nTotal= 193 % shares are on the market\n\nSO the real Shorts number is 138%\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nAlright , I am going to serve myself a Gin Tonic ! do you even realize what s that means? it is even worst for HF that we even dreamt about!!!!!! they will have to buy any fucking shorts available twice!!!!

Options are with termination dates. You can check here and click on strike to have the higher amount.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME\n\nMeaning they are expecting the stock going way up that 800 so they are taking contract to protect their shorts.

        "selftext": "\u201cIf you **know** the **enemy** and **know** yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you **know** yourself but not the **enemy**, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you **know** neither the **enemy** nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\u201d  - Sun Tzu\n\nWe're in a war with the hedge funds and with wallstreet and basically the root of corruption in America with our GME short squeeze proxy war, and if you autists want to win this war, you need to know the enemy, and know yourself.Firstly, education is KEY, so if you're new, you DEFINITELY need to go learn at least what a short squeeze is and a short ladder attack is.\n\nWhat the enemy is doing:\n\n1. ***Price manipulation:*** With short ladder attacks, they use high frequency trading to make the price artificially lower.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4pji/gme\\_volume\\_still\\_low\\_with\\_positive\\_cmf\\_which/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4pji/gme_volume_still_low_with_positive_cmf_which/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont\\_panic\\_and\\_just\\_look\\_at\\_the\\_fucking\\_volume/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont_panic_and_just_look_at_the_fucking_volume/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laak53/for\\_those\\_of\\_you\\_getting\\_scared\\_look\\_at\\_that\\_tiny/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laak53/for_those_of_you_getting_scared_look_at_that_tiny/)This can be seen with sizeable price movements that have tiny amounts of volume. There are several reasons why they are doing this:\n   1. Scare off paper hand bitches: They prey on people who jumped on GME without even knowing what a short squeeze is; they see price fall, they paper hands and they get out.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall\\_street\\_plan\\_trying\\_to\\_psychologically\\_scare/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/)\n   2. Make it cheaper for them to cover their more costly short positions.\n   3. Price manipulation will fail ultimately because while they are able to drive prices lower with their short attacks, when they eventually have to cover their short positions and buy, they will again drive prices up due to purchases of almost none existing stock (cuz we be holding), sending prices up as high as before they shorted or even higher. All the while hedge funds will continue to eat fees and interest on their short positions, making this cycle not doable indefinitely.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme\\_mms\\_have\\_until\\_tomorrow\\_22\\_to\\_buy\\_shares\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme_mms_have_until_tomorrow_22_to_buy_shares_it/)\n2. ***Media manipulation***\n   1. Most if not all American main stream media is clearly serving corporate and wallstreet interests, simply by the false narratives they are reporting.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1022/hmmm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1022/hmmm/)They are not to be trusted and if seen, can dishearten and shake the will of those who don't have diamond hands. Best to avoid if you are a paper handed bitch. Some examples of false narratives are:\n      1. Reddit is made up of alt-rights, or idiots, or gamblers, etc. -&gt; We're not idiots, because we're the ones who were able to grab wallstreet by the nutsack. We're retards and autists who love the stock and the company. That is all.\n      2. Reddit is moving on to silver. -&gt; SILVER CANNOT BE SQUEEZED!!!!! With a market cap of more than $1.5 Trillion, there is NO WAY for retail investors to be able to make a dent in that. The only possible short squeeze play is GME because it's a small cap company with a market cap of only $250 million as of July 2020, so it is definitely doable for a bunch of retards on WSB to affect the price of a small cap company stock. Literally all the posts on reddit promoting SLVR are from bot accounts that have sus creation dates and karma and post counts. Plus, Citadel owns a giant amount of silver so silver prices going up higher is gonna benefit them and give them more fuel to fight this GME war. You're shooting yourself int eh foot if you buy SLVR.

NOTHING can be the next GME, because NOTHING is shorted as much as GME, which is STILL over 100% shorted. GME IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY GAIN FOR US, AND LOSS FOR THEM!\n      4. Shorts have covered their position. -&gt; Another false narrative. Short interest is still over at 100%, and there are multiple WSB posts that explain this. Another metric that correlates to short interest is cost of borrowing for opening short positions, which would increase if it is harder to find shares to short.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7d94/no\\_more\\_shares\\_to\\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7d94/no_more_shares_to_short/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laaai8/gme\\_short\\_interest\\_is\\_currently\\_sitting\\_at\\_12297/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laaai8/gme_short_interest_is_currently_sitting_at_12297/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5d6sk/gme\\_short\\_interest\\_increased\\_to\\_7141m\\_after\\_jan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5d6sk/gme_short_interest_increased_to_7141m_after_jan/)\n3. ***Breaking the law:*** Some if not all of the things posted above are pretty much border line illegal, but there has been clear signs of breaking the law and market manipulation, IE: freeze buying of select stocks and only allow for selling. They can spin it however they want, but as far as I know, it has been unprecedented for a majority of brokerages to simultaneously alter the way a stock can be traded with cash. And if the situation is desparate enough, they'll break the law again and again if it ends up costing them less than to just let the price get to $69.420. Expect them to fight dirty until the bitter end.\n4. ***Social Media Manipulation:*** Hedge Funds now employ bots to spread doubt and misinformation in order to weaken your hands. Some places they target is WSB itself, other stock trading subreddits, facebook, and on sites / apps like Webull and Yahoo Finance. Don't believe in random comments. Always believe in WSB posts with huge amounts of likes (top posts are vetted by the 8 mil users here / by mods too to make sure they're factual)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in\\_case\\_you\\_needed\\_proof\\_that\\_there\\_are\\_imposters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in_case_you_needed_proof_that_there_are_imposters/)\n5. ***Their Current Strategy:*** Wallstreet calls us \"dumb money\", because they think we are unsophisticated and just chase after a quick buck, and we have short attention spans. They'll try and continue to manipulate the price so that the stock will trade sideways, or continuous short ladder attacks, trying to scare paper hands into selling, and bore diamond hands into selling as well. They will also try to tempt us with other \"NEXT GME\" type plays and may even artificially raise prices of a stock or two (IE: SILVER) to try and get people to hop off the GME rocket. They'll use media to continue to push narratives that the GME short squeeze is over, short positions are covered, and redditors have moved onto something else. If this fails, then they may simulate a \"SQUEEZE\" by suddenly letting the price go up to $700 or $800, then unleash a short ladder attack unlike which we have ever seen, to simulate the sell off, so idiot retards will be scared into thinking they missed the top, so they will all sell. But if people just look at the volume, they'll know it's all a ruse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat we're doing, our advantage, and why the enemy can't win.\n\n1. ***This is a movement:*** This has become more than a few people of a subreddit trying to make a quickbuck off of a short squeeze. This has become a movement that represents the struggle between the corruption of wallstreet and the 1% vs the 99%, the common people. News agencies from all over the globe are reporting on this and have their eyes on this. We have ape brothers and sisters all over the world buying and holding this stock together. We even have a few outspoken whales on our side as well, as well as politicians from both sides of the spectrum speaking out for our side as well. We have billboards being bought all over the country, airplanes flying banners about GME. A global movement will crush any hedge fund.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5mt6n/gme\\_short\\_squeeze\\_the\\_whales\\_have\\_arrived/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5mt6n/gme_short_squeeze_the_whales_have_arrived/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qtey/kjetill\\_stjerne\\_is\\_da\\_real\\_mvp\\_he\\_his\\_friends\\_are/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qtey/kjetill_stjerne_is_da_real_mvp_he_his_friends_are/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rf4k/times\\_square\\_right\\_now/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&amp;utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rf4k/times_square_right_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n2. ***We are holding, and we're continuing to buy:*** We are getting smarter, tougher, and slowly but surely paper hands are turning into diamond hands. We managed to hold during the short attack to \\~$110 on Thursday, and that was when they froze our ability to buy across many brokerages. They will never have another chance to do this again now with everyone watching. The volume trading these days is getting smaller and smaller. Any price decrease is strictly from short ladder attacks, and not us selling, due to tiny tiny volumes. Also, we are continuing to buy calls on GME to increase upward pressure. No one here has stopped buying.

We know this because the volume of shares bought is not nearly enough to show the shorts have bought enough to be covered.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1q9hy/l2\\_nyse\\_quotes\\_for\\_gme\\_volume\\_the\\_squeeze\\_hasnt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1q9hy/l2_nyse_quotes_for_gme_volume_the_squeeze_hasnt/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l66kcl/gme\\_volume\\_is\\_low\\_shorts\\_arent\\_covering\\_hold/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l66kcl/gme_volume_is_low_shorts_arent_covering_hold/)\n4. ***Enemy loses money everyday, we don't:*** It costs the hedge funds billions to continue to fight this war of attrition becauase they continue to eat insanely high fees and interest on their short positions because the cost of borrowing remains high because the short interest are remaining high. Melvin down over 50% just this month alone. You think they can hold on much longer and keep eating fees?[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labq1a/this\\_is\\_so\\_satisfying\\_to\\_look\\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labq1a/this_is_so_satisfying_to_look_at/)Meanwhile we don't have to pay anything for holding our stocks. We can literally just hold and not have a short squeeze and just from the cost of borrowing alone the hedge funds will run out of money, so that's why there will come a time where it's cheaper for them to cover their positions rather than just keep on bleeding until they die out. I don't think they can hold out for another month of trading sideways with no progress. I believe in Feb we will see some major action. It could even start as early as tomorrow, because that's the last day shorts have to cover their 1/29 puts that expired.\n5. ***We're not breaking the laws, they are:*** Recent rumor mills are saying that there are a lot of [counterfit stocks](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) circulating and the hedge funds and clearing houses are all in on it, and once they need to start to find shares to buy to cover their short positions, things are going to explode in a way that is unprecedented. Basically by taking advantage of a situation wallstreet has set up (insane short interest set up for short squeeze) we may have uncovered one of the biggest financial crimes in the history of the stock market. You bet that the government and SEC will be involved soon if this is true, and things will explode to the stratosphere. Read the following and ponder yourself, I'm not a financial advisor, just a dumb ape.

We've just hit 8 mil subs; our subs are going exponential. We've recovered from the RH fiasco and we're primed and loaded on other brokerages like Fidelity. We are more ready than EVER to continue this war and this fight.\n7. ***An Ape's Move this week:*** Again, not financial advice, but hypothetically if there was an autistic ape, the autistic ape would buy the dips, ESPECIALLY at this insane discount price of around $100. The autistic ape knows that basically it is paying $100 for a ticket to ride the GME train past $1k, easily 10x their bananas. Those apes who bought in at $300 will only get to 3x their bananas at the end of the month. The autistic apes will also understand that this is not a 1 day thing, but the events leading up to the squeeze can take weeks. But the autistic ape will ask itself, is it willing to wait a few weeks to at least 3x their bananas? Most apes will answer yes. But the ape knows if they buy it, they should be prepared to see red in their banana tracker for a month. But those red number are just fake numbers generated by HFT short ladder attacks, and not due to other apes actually selling their bananas, because apes together STRONK. \n\nTL;DR =  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc35 =   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83c\udf19PS: You only lose if you sell.

(formerly known as DOR BioPharma, Inc.), headquartered in Princeton, N.J., is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing products that treat rare diseases where there is an unmet medical need. As a rapidly growing company, Soligenix supports a robust pipeline of innovative drug candidates through two business segments: a BioTherapeutics segment and a Vaccines/Biodefense segment.\nSoligenix has two areas of focus:\n1) A) therapeutics platform dedicated to the development of products for life-threatening conditions such as gastrointestinal Graft-versus-Host disease and cancer\n2) a biodefense platform to develop vaccines for military and civilian applications.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n###In Depth Overview (From Yahoo Finance)\n\nSoligenix, Inc., a late-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on developing and commercializing products to treat rare diseases in the United States. It operates in two segments, Specialized BioTherapeutics and Public Health Solutions. The Specialized BioTherapeutics segment develops SGX301, a novel photodynamic therapy, which has completed Phase 3 clinical trial to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma; and SGX942, an innate defense regulator technology that is in Phase 3 clinical trial to treat oral mucositis in head and neck cancer. This segment also offers proprietary formulations of oral beclomethasone 17,21-dipropionate, which is in Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the prevention/treatment of gastrointestinal disorders characterized by severe inflammation, including pediatric Crohn's disease and acute radiation enteritis. The Public Health Solutions segment is involved in the development of RiVax, a ricin toxin vaccine candidate, which has completed Phase 1a and 1b clinical trials; SGX943, a melioidosis therapeutic candidate that is in pre-clinical stage for the treatment of antibiotic resistant and emerging infectious diseases; and ThermoVax, a technology in pre-clinical development for thermostabilizing vaccines. The company was formerly known as DOR BioPharma, Inc. and changed its name to Soligenix, Inc. in 2009. Soligenix, Inc. was incorporated in 1987 and is headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Investors\n\nSoligenix, Inc. (US:SNGX) has 55 institutional owners and shareholders that have filed 13D/G or 13F forms with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). These institutions hold a total of 3,939,552 shares. Largest shareholders include Vanguard Group Inc, Knoll Capital Management, LP, VTSMX - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares, First Wilshire Securities Management Inc, VEXMX - Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund Investor Shares, Geode Capital Management, Llc, California Public Employees Retirement System, Gsa Capital Partners Llp, BlackRock Inc., and FSMAX - Fidelity Extended Market Index Fund.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Major Competitors\n\nSoligenix competes with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, WUXI BIOLOGICS, Novo Nordisk, and Seattle Genetics; as well as few others. Those are some of the best pharmaceutical companies in the world with decades of operation. Right now they are dealing with different fields from those of interest to Soligenix, in fact Soligenix could become a pioneer on new technologies.\u00a0\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Potential of growth\n\nSoligenix have now 5 analysts covering the stock. The analyst consensus points to a rating of \u2018Buy\u2019. The range between the high target price and low target price is between 15 and 2 with the average target price sitting at 6.45. Now with the previous closing price of 2.74 this now indicates there is a potential upside of 135.4%. The day 50 moving average is 2.12 while the 200 day moving average is 2.01. The market cap for the company is $41m.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#News and upcoming catalysts\n\nSoligenix will commercialize SGX301 in the U.S. on its own. The company has submitted its proposed brand name, HyBryte, and logo for SGX301 to the FDA for review and approval. CTCL's small, orphan market will not require Soligenix to build out a massive marketing and sales force. The uniqueness and ability to serve an unmet medical need are the key selling points in the CTCL treatment space.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSGX301 has already been granted fast track designation and orphan drug status. As a result, the FDA will have six months from the date that Soligenix officially files the NDA.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\ud83d\udd25 President and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher J. Schaber, PhD, will deliver a corporate presentation at the BIO CEO &amp; Investor Digital Conference taking place **February 16-18, 2021.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Personal Thoughts\n\nSoligenix right now has a market cap of less than 70 Million, 20 Million in cash reserve, and a very clear and precise scheduled path to follow. It looks promising and strong, next week we are guaranteed some news will come both before and after the Digital Conference.\nThe price right now is steady and i still think there's an occasion to enter the game.\nThis company is giving hope to people who have brutal diseases with no cure, companies like these when delivering good news skyrocket!\nRight now i expect a 100% by next week if we get some good news on the conference!\nThis stock could be one of the trending ones this long weekend building hype for next week, we may see a strong opening on Tuesday.\u00a0",

You\u2019re most likely well aware of them through the plethora of recent SPAC mergers (SBE, CLII, TPGY, NBAC). They all do only one thing, charge your car. I mean that\u2019s all they can do right? Well today\u2019s DD is on Volta Charging, in short these guys have found, in my opinion, a superior business model that provides three strong streams of revenue.\n\nLet\u2019s start off with what these streams are :\n\n***Charging*** \\- Almost all EV charging station companies have one thing in common \u2014 either a company hosting the chargers has to pay for them or EV drivers who use them have to pay for them. Volta does things differently. It uses the Google method, or the cable TV method \u2014 the station is free to use, while advertisers pay to get their product or story in front of you.  Volta says on its website that customers on average spend $54 per visit (at locations where the charging points were installed) and they stay there for around 92 minutes.\n\nWhilst being free to use for the EV owner, there is no cost for the business owner to install a Volta Charger either. This is a key point as it drives an incentive for businesses to choose Volta over competitors like Chargepoint, where they would have to purchase it at their own capital expense. The free charging that Volta provides can attract previously unwilling customers towards a business without the business having to be at expense, which occurs in other free charging offerings. This alongside the [unit economics](https://imgur.com/a/NRyFl8T) that are second in revenue to only EVGo provide a competitive advantage that will help them take market share for retail charging. One thing to note is that the payback period per unit averages to 3.6 years.\n\nVolta are the first to provide free DC fast charging (L3) in North America \\[1\\] for up to 30 minutes. If this wasn\u2019t good enough, then after those 30 minutes are up the price per kwH is $0.26 which is even cheaper than Electrify America on it\u2019s membership plan ($0.31 with, $0.43 without). This is followed by free L2 charging for up to 3 hours (depending on the location). Volta\u2019s $0.26 per kWh L3 Charging is cheaper than Blink\u2019s L2 Charging which costs $0.39 - $0.79, in fact the level 3 charging per kWh is cheaper than that of Tesla, EVbox, EVGo and Electrify America \\[2\\].\n\nQuick takes :\n\n* Volta has the highest utilization of any EV charging network in the United States.\n* Volta charging stations already deliver IRR\u2019s in the mid 40%.  As they grow significantly and the network scales, economics should improve even more as EV charging demand increases.\n* Volta currently has over 450 sites, 1,500 stations and 3,000 screens installed \u2013 and a further 470 sites, 1,100 stations and 2,200 screens contracted and in construction.  In addition to this footprint, Volta has developed a pipeline of over 5,000 sites, 10,000 stations and 20,000 screens.\n* Volta does not manufacture their own chargers.\n\nDrivers get free charging, and businesses get more business.\n\n***Advertising*** \\- The reason why Volta undercuts its competition is through it\u2019s ad based revenue. The company operates a network of free charging stations through brand sponsorship that wants to reach highly coveted audiences and local brick and mortar businesses to attract new customers; benefiting brands, consumers, and real-estate locations by providing valuable advertising space to businesses and free charging to drivers.  They are strategically placed in front of essential businesses such as grocery stores, pharmacies, banks and hospitals. Volta\u2019s EV network supports a larger consumer trend towards vehicle electrification by placing fueling stations in parking lots directly where consumers already spend their time and money.\n\nVolta has already signed agreements with retail corporations such as Albertsons, Giant Food, Regency Centers, Wegmans, Amazon, Walgreens, Stop&amp;Shop, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Topgol.  Advertisers have included Netflix, Facebook, Smartwater, Chase, Starbucks, Hulu, Nestl\u00e9, Polestar, Porsche, and Unilever. Some of these agreements are locked in with 10 year contracts.\n\nThese agreements also encourage the upkeep and maintenance of Volta Chargers in order to keep the integrity of the brand image for not only Volta but the advertiser they\u2019re representing. This cannot be said for other free charging solutions whose landlords see no incentive in maintaining something they themselves do not gain profit from.\n\nAd-supported growth is a demonstrated and PROVEN business model.\n\n***Data, Behaviour and Networking***  \\-  The final stream of revenue is through behavioural data that\u2019s collected relative to the location, this can include length of stay, model of car, stores nearby, frequency of visits etc. This data can then be sold off to companies who require the customer data whilst also helping to improve Volta\u2019s own predictive algorithm which allows them to estimate the current and future demand for certain locations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 4cuimn1zfhh61...*\n\n**Management, Transaction, Valuation and Revenue :**\n\nThe management for Volta is strong. How? Well for starters ***the co-founder and former president of Chargepoint is the CTO*** \\[4\\]. This alongside the ex Tesla and Amazon employees that can provide potential leeway for future deals, shows that the management is used to disruption and highly familiar with the industry. The variety in backgrounds can provide multiple perspectives allowing them to become agile in this fast and booming market. This can be seen on their site where they highlight who in their team are EV drivers and who aren't.\n\nEven in 2020, with the pandemic disrupting the economy, Volta ended the year experiencing \\~50% revenue growth, underscoring its diversified and resilient revenue stack. Multiple revenue streams include Pay Per Use, Idle Fees, Managed Services, &amp; Fleet.\n\nBiden has made electrification a focal point of his plan to combat climate change, including a plan to invest $2 trillion into electrification and renewables, which includes the installation of 500,000 public charging stations in the next four years. Furthermore, states are also making a push for electrification.CA, MA, &amp; NJ all have announced plans for new car sales to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035. Furthermore, NY approved $700m to fund EV charging infrastructure for multiple utilities and CA created a $436m Charge Ready infrastructure program.\n\n* Unlike competitors, strong unit economics will allow Volta to reach positive EBITDA in the near term (by 2023).\n* $300m PIPE anchored by long term holders including Fidelity, Blackrock, &amp; Neuberger Berman.\n* Deal to close Q2 (most likely late Q2)\n* Based off the 2024E or 2025E rev multiples of $CLII, $SBE, $TPGY looks like[ $SNPR](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SNPR&amp;src=cashtag_click) could settle in the $35 area - u/apan-man seen below :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/368mveoidhh61.png?width=1099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55ed8d23a596495570447563072d05124b4ea97a\n\n* ChargePoint has 73% of the entire L2 charging market share, Volta has 2%. Chargepoint is generating $130 million in revenue vs Volta\u2019s $25 million.\n* 17% minority ownership stake which is higher than SBE\n* 100% 5 year CAGR\n\n**A few bear cases to consider :**\n\nThe first and most obvious one is the fact that their charging network isn't as big as it's competitors, most notably Chargepoint who has benefited greatly from the first mover advantage. This results in the relatively low revenue of $25m in 2020.\n\nSecondly, the market for EV chargers is saturated, not just the public ones but the countless private companies that are available such as EV connect, Flo, Recargo etc. This could result in the EV effect where not all companies will survive. When considering the broader market there is the very real possibility of a sell off in the EV sector, SNPR will most  definitely be impacted by such an event, with its current price of writing hovering at around $15.04 this proposes a 33% loss worst case scenario.\n\nDue to the fact that Volta does not manufacture their own chargers, it could also lead to the potential case of poorer quality control. After some digging through Plugshare and Reddit I haven\u2019t found this to be the case so far, with generally positive reviews throughout ([other than that one dude who had his Tesla Adapter melted](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/caetp7/stumbled_across_these_new_volta_chargers_never/et8n8mb?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) but it\u2019s still a possibility that should be considered. Another related idea is that free chargers won't be treated as well as ones paid for, this could lead to neglect/misuse of the product.\n\nFinal note, there is a lack of a defined moat. This obviously can be said for any EV charger but it still applies here, more so with the fact that the screen based advertising that Volta offers hasn't been patented yet. The application is still pending. This could lead to potential clones of this model by competitors.\n\n**References :**\n\n\\[1\\] Volta debuts America\u2019s first FREE fast-charging station this Friday\n\n[https://electrek.co/2019/10/08/volta-debuts-americas-first-free-fast-charging-station-this-friday/](https://electrek.co/2019/10/08/volta-debuts-americas-first-free-fast-charging-station-this-friday/)\n\n\\[2\\] 30 states allow kWh pricing, but non-Tesla EV drivers mostly miss benefits\n\n[https://electrek.co/2019/08/12/kwh-pricing-ev-drivers-miss-benefits/](https://electrek.co/2019/08/12/kwh-pricing-ev-drivers-miss-benefits/)\n\n\\[3\\] Investor presentation\n\n[https://www.datocms-assets.com/32330/1612781257-volta-tortoise-ii-investor-presentation-02-08-21.pdf](https://www.datocms-assets.com/32330/1612781257-volta-tortoise-ii-investor-presentation-02-08-21.pdf)\n\n\\[4\\] Volta Welcomes Praveen Mandal as Chief Technology Officer\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191105005450/en/Volta-Welcomes-Praveen-Mandal-as-Chief-Technology-Officer](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191105005450/en/Volta-Welcomes-Praveen-Mandal-as-Chief-Technology-Officer)\n\n**Past DDs :**\n\nDD #1 DMYD :\n\n[DMYD : Own the Big Data Provider that Powers DraftKings and Fanduel](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/k449gf/dmyd_own_the_big_data_provider_that_powers/?sort=confidence)\n\nDD #2 LGVW :\n\n[Bill gates backed play : Butterfly and LGVW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jz0i2d/bill_gates_backed_play_butterfly_and_lgvw/)\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nCredit to [the International Spac Station](https://twitter.com/IntlSpacStation) discord and u/robe-'s great DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/lfjtod/snpr_volta_merger_dd/)\n\n**Positions : 2150 commons.**\n\nI am not a financial advisor, as a shareholder I may hold a bias towards this stock do your own DD before considering the stock.\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\n**TLDR : Volta provides a different take upon the charging space, through it's use of advertising and data collection that allows it to have multiple streams of revenue.

This is imperative since it's attrition when buying and a payout when selling. [ https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta](https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta)\n* DTE: Days till expiration/expiry\n* Understand delta in general and how delta changes with ITM and OTM options.\n* Understand all the Greeks at a high level, as you get better understand them well.  The Greeks: [https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/)\n* Options positions with respect to price:\n   * ITM: In the money; strike is below stock value.\n   * ATM: At the money; strike is just at or above the stock value, often very highly traded.  Can be very effective with moderate - long term expiry.  If the stock moves favorably, an ATM option\u2019s delta will rapidly increase.\n   * NTM: Near the money; strike is above the stock value, but fairly close.  Slightly unofficial term.\n   * OTM: Out of the money; price is at least a few strikes from the current stock price.  I would say 10-30% over stock price.\n   * Very OTM: Not a real definition, this is essentially a lottery ticket.  Cheap, but almost certain to expire worthless unless there is explosive movement.\n* IV, IV crush, and how IV affects pricing.  In general, you want to sell when IV is high and buy when the IV is low.  Increasing  IV is good for held calls/puts.  IV drop or crush is generally good for sellers.\n* Selling options can be quite beneficial.  Once you have a good general understanding, lookup r/thetagang .  Kamikaze Cash has good YouTube videos on most theta strategies (linked above).  I personally believe selling options (especially cash secured) is much safer and can consistently make you profits.  \u0398 Gang 4 life.\n* FOMO and how to avoid chasing a dangerous trend.  DO NOT CHASE FROM FOMO!\n* What intrinsic and extrinsic value are.  Know how they are affected by being exercised/assigned and how theta affects them.\n* Understand that some WSB recommendations are straight up high-risk gambling and factor in that information accordingly.  Be careful with Meme stocks and the survivor-ship bias on YOLO plays.  However, I love the sub and think it\u2019s hilarious.  It has a lot of valuable information / DD if you are comfortable with the \u201ccolorful\u201d language.  It\u2019s also great if you like rocket ship emojis.\n\n## Basics / Mechanics\n\n* Understand the 4 \"main\" option types.  Buying or selling a call and buying or selling a put.  Spreads and more complex multi-legged option strategies are based off these in some way (see below)\n* You can sell calls with 100 shares of stock or if you own an underlying longer term option; see LEAPS and PMCCs later.  Selling calls naked is incredibly risky and often requires Level 4 (very advanced) permissions and usually a lot of capital.  I will literally never sell calls naked since I don't want to ruin my life and end up living in a dumpster eating saltine crackers.\n* Puts can be sold/written cash covered (cash secured), which means you have the cash in your account to buy 100 shares.  Your broker will put this money on hold until the trade is closed.  Puts can be sold \"naked\" using Margin and Level 3 (with most brokers).  Your broker will hold a percentage of cost of 100 shares (often 30-40%, 100% on meme stocks) allowing you to sell more puts.  This increases your available capital/power as well as increasing risk.\n\n# General Tips and Ideas:\n\n* Don't EVER leave (short) spreads open on expiration day, close them.  (more details below)\n* Start off trading very small.  Slowly build up over weeks / months.  You need to get accustomed to a fifty dollar swing a day, then a few hundred, then a few thousand.  You need to ensure you don't get emotional (see below).  I started trading options with 5k, then 25k, 50k, and later over 100k.  I added my own funds over time and used my gains to build my account.  Don\u2019t go all in immediately, that\u2019s dangerous and unwise.\n* Especially as you build up the amount of money you have invested, keep it diversified among several stocks.\n   * Don't go all in on one thing, ever.  Be able to take a hit from one stock and not mortally wound your portfolio.\n   * A company may be doing great, then there's a major product issue out of nowhere.  If you are overexposed in one stock this can really hurt you.\n   * I had to roll options I sold that were about to expire completely worthless because FDX's CEO changed and the stock took a hard dip.\n* Don't trade emotionally.  If you realize you are emotionally trading for vengeance, you should probably exit the trade and cool off for several days with that stock.  Same if you get caught up in a wave of hysteria.\n* Planning Trades:\n   * Have a plan for every trade, ideally with entries / exits that are specific values, ranges, or a set condition.  This helps remove emotions.  This is super important for strong movements and high volatility (see later). \n   * Hedge fund guy on YouTube stated that trading should be 90% planning and 10% execution.  I agree with this more and more.\n   * My rough trading outline:\n      * Make a list of potentially viable stocks.\n      * Perform research.\n      * Set up a watchlist of stocks you want to trade.\n      * Have entry and exit plans for your trades.  Setting stock price alerts for entries is my personal preference.\n      * Market opens / event occurs.  React according to your plan.\n      * Based on new information, adjust, open, or close positions accordingly.\n* Use an options profit calculator from your broker or an online one before entering a \"new\" trade, especially a complex multi legged trade:[ https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)/\n* \u201cRolling\u201d an option:  \n Closing your existing option and opening a similar one at a different strike and/or expiration.\n   * Rolling a call \u201cUp\u201d would be selling a call you own and buying a cheaper call at a higher strike.\n   * Rolling a put \u201cDown and out\u201d closes your original one and buying or selling one at a lower strike at a longer expiry.\n   * Better broker interfaces have a literal \u201cRoll\u201d button.  I know E-trade does.  You can manually do it by selecting relevant contract legs.\n* If you have a losing trade, re-evaluate it.  If your initial assumption is definitely incorrect, close it.  Don't stay in losing trades forever and lose the entire value of the option over stubbornness.  If you re-evaluate and you think your assumption was right, hold, potentially consider adding another cheaper option (or buy another call / put).  Rolling out sold options can help here.\n* Don't try to day trade, especially with options.  It's statistically unlikely to be profitable.  Day-trading with options introduces extra liquidity risks and is dangerous, especially with spreads.\n* Try not to over-trade, you'll likely mis-time the market over time.  When I get emotional I over trade, then lose additional money on wash sales.  If you scale your entries into positions it should help alleviate your desire to exit positions when they turn badly against you.  Whenever I buy calls I do it at larger increments after W almost made me lose my hair; luckily it eventually came back.\n* NEVER enter a position on a stock you have no idea about, especially when you read about it online or heard about it from some rando.\n* At market open options contracts are often volatile and inflated.  Buying during this time can be more expensive.  Options are usually cheaper mid-day, I read somewhere 2-3PM is cheapest.  I\u2019ve had success around 12-1PM EST after prices settle.\n* Try wheeling on cheaper stocks once you get all fundamentals down.\n* When selling puts if you are very bullish consider \"doubling down\"; note this is higher risk.  Use the credit from your put sale to buy shares or a cheap call.  This can be roughly inversed with puts, except I wouldn't ever recommend shorting shares.\n* Learn from your mistakes.  You can\u2019t go back in time and beating yourself up (to a point) is useless.  Make a physical &amp;/or mental note of it so you don\u2019t do it again.  If you don\u2019t learn from it, then beat yourself up so you won\u2019t do it again.\n* If you have friends that like to trade, I find it helpful to discuss strategies and planned plays.  I talk openly with my close friends about my current holdings and planned trades, it helps keep me accountable.  If I get a wide-eyed look, I might be doing something excessively risky or stupid.  I\u2019ve over-leveraged myself in calls twice and I knew I shouldn\u2019t have done it both times.  When I tell my friends what I did and I\u2019m embarrassed, it exemplifies the face that I shouldn\u2019t have done it in the first place.  You will also get ideas for new strategies or plays from them.  It\u2019s good to stay versatile and use multiple strategies when appropriate.  \n Beware of group-think/echo chambers. \n* I recommend NEVER telling someone what to buy/sell and when.  I\u2019ll tell people MY plays or what I like and why, but I will not encourage them to emulate what I do.  Depending on the audience, I\u2019ll tell them my exact positions along with my exit and entrance strategy.  With closer friends I\u2019ll offer my thoughts on their trades (if asked).  If my friend is doing something really risky (one of my friends does some scary stuff) I may ask them if they want my advice, and provide it, especially if they overlooked a risk/event.  I will not encourage someone to execute/enter a trade since it has a high potential for hurt feelings or animosity all around.\n* Don\u2019t fall in love with a stock.  \n Just because something made you money before and you have high confidence in it doesn\u2019t mean it will keep performing.  I joke that FDX betrayed me when it started dipping and losing me money.  I was over-confident of its bounce-back and sold too many puts too quickly.  I\u2019m in several losing trades because of it.  However, I will keep good stocks in my roster/tracking list or try different strategies or re-enter trades when they change their behavior.\n* As you start to both buy and sell options and get more experience in general, you'll start seeing the two sides to every trade.  You will likely start adjusting your strategies or trying new trades out because of this.  Things will likely click one day.  Most/all the Greeks and options concepts will become almost second nature.  For me this was when I could build an Iron Condor from scratch, which was a watershed moment involving a good understanding of many strategies.\n* Understand Liquidity and volume.\n   * Trading in low volume, low open interest contracts results in wide bid/ask spreads and difficulty having your contracts filled.  Look at all the data for a contract, not just the strike and price.\n   * Monthly Expiration dates typically have better liquidity.\n   * Multi-legged trades (Common examples are 2-legged vertical spreads or 4-legged iron condors) have more difficulty being filled, especially on bad brokers like Robin Hood.  Having very liquid options for all legs is extremely helpful in obtaining timely and well-priced fills, which maximize your potential profits.\n* Time in market vs timing the market:\n   * It is extremely difficult to time the market perfectly.  If you wait for the perfect opportunity forever, history has proven you will miss out on gains.  Keeping all your money out of the market has proven to be ineffective.  Now if there is something serious happening with a stock/the market (like say a new pandemic), don\u2019t go all in.  I recommend entering incrementally at dips.  If the stock has huge upside potential it may never go down, so it might make sense to partially enter at the current price.\n   * IMO selling puts is a great strategy to get into a stock you like, or at least make money off it.  I think buying stock in lots of 100 is usually for suckers.  Selling an ATM or ITM put (assuming the math works out) on a stock you were going to buy and hold is ALMOST free money.\n   * I recommend keeping some cash available regardless. If you have a very large account or expect a downturn, hedging with indexes like QQQ, SPY, or VIX or calls/puts may be wise.\n* Every trade can't be a winner.  You will take some losses, you must get used to it.  I don\u2019t like having a realized loss of 1K or more on any trade.  However, this will happen, especially with larger accounts.\n   * As long as you win more often and beat the S&amp;P that year I consider it okay.  I\u2019m kind of aggressive, so I consider 20%+ annually good.  30%+ annually is great.  40%+ and I\u2019m dancing.  After trading options I am almost baffled by my old belief that 5% annual returns (mostly from dividend ETFs) was \u201cgood\u201d.  That\u2019s nothing to me now since I\u2019m willing to take risks.  \nNote: While lots of people danced in 2020, realize that\u2019s an insane Bull Run year and is atypical. \n   * Adhere to your own risk tolerance and never over-extend yourself, especially with margin use.  Don\u2019t make huge gambles leaving you uncomfortable.  Only gamble with money you are willing to lose.\n   * My personal strategy is to make safer gains for the year and then enter slightly riskier strategies using those gains.  I can be slightly-moderately more aggressive and compound my gains.  For me I often sell puts to make money, then when I see a big opportunity I\u2019ll sell a put and buy an OTM or moderately ITM call.\n* Understand it\u2019s not safe to try and get rich overnight.  However, once you hit big \u201csteps\u201d things may start to snowball.  You can enter more positions and take more risks if you choose to.\n   * For me this when I hit 50k, then 100k.  I was able to balance low and moderate risk positions to more significantly grow my account.  I\u2019ll even do a high risk thing now and again because my gains can absorb it (assuming I have them).\n   * I can\u2019t wait to get to 250K, then 500K.  I know it\u2019ll take quite a long time, but I am confident I\u2019ll eventually be able to have 500K and (hopefully) 1M in my non-401k trading account with gains and additions from my job.  I can only imagine how \u201cdangerous\u201d I will be with that kind of capital.\n* If you missed \"the next big thing\" like AAPL, TSLA, or the time machine I\u2019m building in my basement.  Don't get upset, learn from it.  Adapt and become a better trader for next time.\n   * Figure out why a company was so promising, before they mooned.  Determine how you would have traded differently in hindsight.  Apply those lessons to the next company you believe has long term growth prospects.\n   * For me that's putting in 1-2.5k towards shares and/or buying LEAPS on it.  Depending on my bullishness I may buy \u201ccheap\u201d, fairly far OTM calls.  The far OTM options are sort of lottery tickets.  If I'm right the (relatively) low cost will have explosive profits; if I'm wrong, they didn't cost that much so it's a calculated loss I\u2019m willing to accept.  For more serious bets I\u2019ll buy ITM LEAPS to run PMCCs on.  I also like to buy 1-2K in my 401k for very long-term plays.\n* The stock market hates uncertainty, it seems to crave the status quo.  A shakeup can potentially tank a stock, even if it's nothing.  With shares you can wait it out, but this can be problematic for options.  If you see volatile/uncertain times ahead (politics, disease, manufacturing, earnings, etc.), you might want to reduce your overall portfolio risks or hedge.\n* Brokers:\n   * Find a good broker.  This article outlines good brokers that didn\u2019t restrict trading during the GameStop squeeze craziness.  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbzkbi/reminder\\_whether\\_you\\_own\\_gme\\_or\\_not\\_change\\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbzkbi/reminder_whether_you_own_gme_or_not_change_your/)\n   * I have personally used the following and here are my ratings:  \nE-Trade &gt;&gt; Fidelity &gt;&gt; Ally &gt;&gt; Robin Hood.\n      * The &gt;&gt; denotes they are significantly better.  Fidelity is reliable, but their interface isn\u2019t good.  The app / site both work, but they are clumsy, \u201cweak\u201d, and outdated.  It\u2019s been described as \u201cboomer-friendly\u201d by a Fidelity employee on Reddit.  Fidelity does have a \u201cpro\u201d type desktop software, it is geared toward more professional traders.\n      * Ally Invest has bad tools, is generally trash, and is unreliable, don\u2019t use it.\n      * RH is free, but has bad fills.  It is super unreliable and has had huge stock buying restrictions in stocks and quantities for multiple days.  I don\u2019t trade in their app anymore, but I do like using their wish lists for quick chart glances at daily activity.\n   * I really like E-Trade (and you\u2019re about to hear why).\n      * E-trade has Power E-Trade on both desktop and mobile.  These are fantastic tools for options trading.\n      * The mobile app destroys (most/all) other mobile apps in terms of organization, data available, and effectiveness.  I think it\u2019s phenomenal.  I can throw together a 4-legged trade in seconds.  I can easily see all Greeks, intrinsic/extrinsic value, volume, and every other trade parameter I need through their option chain screen by swiping left / right.\n      * *Note, I have not tried Schwab, just watched YouTube videos of their app.  From watching those, Power E trade looks better.*\n      * The desktop version also has a trade analyzer (extensive P/L calculator) and a strategy seeker.  The strategy tool gives you suggested trades based on your expected movement direction, expiry date, and amount invested.  Both are well done and powerful.\n      * These tools are so intuitive and powerful that I would have a hard time going to another broker, even if it\u2019s slightly cheaper.  Even if E-Trade drops the ball again, I might keep my main account with them and set up my secondary / backup account with Schwab; that\u2019s how much I like Power E-trade.\n      * **Noteworthy downsides.**  They restricted GME buying for \\~2 hours during market hours (\\~2-4PM) and all after hours on Thursday 1/28/21 when the GME craziness was happening.  This was the only restriction on buying I\u2019m aware of.  \nThe following week there was a day where I couldn\u2019t execute a trade for an hour at open.  This was during very high volume, but still no excuse.  These issues made me very angry with them.  These were the first big problems I\u2019ve had in several months of active trading through them.\n      * My biggest annoyance.  Power e trade sometimes shows spreads incorrectly arranged on mobile.  On desktop you can adjust / fix the spread groups with the \u201cCustom Groups\u201d button, but mobile sometimes mixes two spreads or condors with the same symbol and expiry.  This shows you different things than what you set up, but doesn't actually change what you own.  For example I could open a 170/175 put credit spread and sell a 180 put.  It might get confused on mobile and say 170/180 spread and 175 put.\n      * They are usually very reliable, but they are not perfect.  I\u2019m staying with them unless they have more major issues.\n      * Their options fees go from $.65 to .50 a contract once you trade enough, 30 trades / quarter I think.  They\u2019ll give you further discounts if you trade a lot for months, then call to ask for an option fee reduction/negotiation.\n      * If you decide to open an E-trade account and put enough money in, there is a new account incentive.  It scales up depending on your contribution.  If you feel like it, you can use my referral link.  PM me for it if you\u2019re interested.\n   * Rock Solid Brokers:\n      * Fidelity: Mediocre-bad tools, very reliable.\n      * Vanguard: Expensive.  Reliable.\n      * Schwab: OK prices.  Second hand, tools look okay-good.  Very good reputation and reliable.  If I ever decide to switch / diversify from E-trade, I\u2019m trying them.\n* Don\u2019t over leverage yourself, understand your own risk tolerance.  Don\u2019t use up all your cash or margin buying power.  Leave funds available to react if the market turns against you.  If you use margin maintenance, ensure you have a cushion to prevent a potentially costly margin call.\n\n# Profit Retention / Loss Mitigation\n\n* If selling options, it is a viable strategy to close early after a large gain with many DTE left until expiry.  See TT videos / strategies on this.\n* Don't hold options through earnings unless you literally want to gamble.  I like playing on earnings run ups, but that can be risky.\n* If you hold options through earnings, IV crush will happen immediately afterwards, devaluing the option.  However, if the option is profitable enough, IV crush won\u2019t matter, which will still make money for a call buyer.  A sold put sufficiently far OTM will benefit from IV crush, even if the stock dips after slightly bad or lukewarm earnings.\n* Don't throw good money after bad.  Don't gamble on a recovery if your assumption appears to be wrong or the market is flat out tanking.  If you are wrong and still believe in the company, wait twice as long as your original plan (wait for your 2nd entry point vs 1st) before adding to your position.\n* Consider using stop losses to lock-in profits on rides up or sometimes use them to prevent losses.  Note, stops can be easily triggered in volatile options.  Now when I'm up a lot on calls (especially around earnings or large momentum run-ups) I always set stop losses.  I have been burned too many times.  \n In December 2020 I didn't set a SL on several thousand dollars of FDX calls I was already up on and I \"lost\" \\~$5K of unrealized gains.   If you're up big, don't get too greedy.\n* A possible strategy if a stock is on a tear and you have multiple options open:  \nClose some positions (I prefer to do this incrementally if the stock has momentum), but leave 1+ open in case the stock goes into outer space/the floor.  Next, set a stop loss with a little buffer below its current movement / range so it doesn't get hit unless the stock falls hard.  Finally, watch the stock closely and if it keeps rising, keep moving the stop loss up in little bits incrementally.  This will let you keep more profits on a hot streak, but give some protection and secure more gains.  It will also help eliminate FOMO if a stock exceeds your expectations.\n* Have rules when to roll out, down &amp; out, or up &amp; out.  I like TT\u2019s roll at break even or at 1x loss and to always roll for a credit (or for me a very minor cost).  Obviously these rules need some monitoring.  Know your stocks, the news, and technicals so you don\u2019t jump the gun.  \n   * If you roll early for a credit and you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not the end of the world.  You\u2019ll just need to hold longer, which will obviously tie up capital.  Sometimes it\u2019s better to tie up some money (especially if you aren\u2019t paying interest) than eating a huge loss.\n   * Rolling too late can be worse though.  I currently have a very underwater FDX put I sold that is over 2x loss, rolling it does almost nothing unless you want to pay a debit or extend it extremely far out.\n* On huge options gains, **I strongly recommend taking profits by rolling up/down** or incrementally sell your contracts at several different prices (this is why having multiple contracts is nice).\n   * Rolling up involves selling your initial call, then using a fraction of your proceeds to buy a cheaper, further OTM call with the same expiry; puts are inverse this.  When rolling up I like to ensure the new option\u2019s cost is 15-40% of my realized gains.  I\u2019ll buy a more or less expensive replacement option based on my conviction in the stock and predicted movements.  You can also roll up and out to get a further expiry and strike.\n   * This is monumentally important if you are playing with incredibly high rising stocks or during a short squeeze.\n   * **Sad story time:**  \nI completely screwed up when I forgot to roll up, twice, during the GME gamma/short squeeze.  I didn\u2019t take my own advice; I didn\u2019t have a real exit or transition plan and I got emotional.  It all happened so fast and I was at work; the insanity of the run up and subsequent gamma squeeze caught me off guard.  I should\u2019ve clocked out and thought through the situation for 15-30 minutes to form an impromptu plan, then executed trade(s).  My moderate risk tolerance coupled with my desire to take profits took over.  When the stock partially cratered after a run up, I sold to retain gains.  In the heat of the moment I thought the squeeze was squoze and it was going to plummet into the ground and I wasn\u2019t being rational.\n      * On 1x 4K call I would\u2019ve made an additional 15-25K if I rolled up to a cheaper contract with some of my profits.\n      * I know I missed out on significantly more with a 2nd call I had.  Depending when I rolled it, it would likely have been an additional 25-50k in profits.\n   * I talked about learning from your mistakes above.  **This mistake is branded into my brain due to the massive gains I missed out on** **by not rolling up****.**  I\u2019m furious with myself as I write this 1 week after the GME gamma squeeze, I\u2019m a planner and I didn\u2019t plan.  If anything I own is significantly up ever again, I\u2019m rolling up (or at least setting a stop loss).  If necessary, I\u2019ll roll up a trade multiple times to keep extracting profits.\n   * Learn from my mistake so you don\u2019t miss out on gains too.  I strongly recommend rolling up when you are up big on a call / roll down when you are up big on a put.  This enables you to take profits, stay in the game, and keep extracting more gains.\n* If you trade a lot of options, talk to your broker about a discount.  I was getting the standard $.50/contract with E-Trade, but I traded over 300 contracts a quarter and was able to get the fee reduced by over $.10 by just asking.  I am now doing more spreads and condors, so once my volume gets very high, I\u2019ll ask again.\n* If you have a broker that isn\u2019t great and you want to switch, leverage your current trading fees to the new broker.  Tell them you\u2019ll move over $### thousand if they beat your current options trading fee per contract.\n\n# Trade Planning &amp; Position Management Tips\n\n* As you gain experience, start monitoring what kind of Delta, OTM, DTE, etc. you are most profitable with.  Use it in your future trades.  You'll often see the tasty trade 30-45DTE .3 Delta strategy for selling.\n* Having rough rules to close trades early can be a smart strategy.\n   * A common rule is if you hit 50% max profit in 1/3 of the contract length, close it early.\n   * A slightly more aggressive rule, that I roughly adhere to, is if you hit 66% max profit in \\~1/3 the contract length, close it early.\n   * If you sell \u201cnaked\u201d / on margin it may make sense to keep huge winners open, especially with sold/written puts.  I sometimes keep these big winners open with only 10-20% of the value left.  I let theta slowly bleed them dry to get extra money.  I\u2019m using my (free) naked put margin maintenance to get extra profits.  If other trades start to go bad, I\u2019ll close these big winners to free up capital.\n* Before entering a trade, look at rough technicals like resistances and supports to consider your relevant strikes as well as entry/exit points.  Look at upcoming earnings &amp; dividend dates as well as stock/market news.\n* Consider staggering strikes and expirations for safety and diversity; it\u2019s nice to avoid assignment on 3 puts at once because you used the same strike for all 3.\n* Incrementally enter positions on large rises/falls.  One of my favorite strategies is to buy dips after over reactions.  By doing this slowly in large price \"steps\" it helps combat FOMO and helps you avoid getting slaughtered.\n   * This will also help you avoid \"chasing a falling knife\".  It also ties into having a plan.\n   * I set alerts at several predetermined prices and I REALLY try not to enter new trades unless I hit my preset points.  It makes me less emotional and usually more effective.\n* Don't buy far expiration options with poor liquidity for shorter term plays.  I bought 1x GME 1-year+ LEAPS call before the 2021 short squeeze.  That was stupid, I should've bought 2-3x 60-120 day calls to have better liquidity.  I also paper-handed it and missed out on my lambo.\n* If selling options, consider rolling (for a credit) to avoid assignment when it makes sense / meets your plan.  Rolling closer to expiration can be a valid strategy to get theta on your side.  On the flip side, if the stock moons or plummets it could've been better to roll before it got crazy deep ITM.  See rolling \u201crules\u201d above.\n* Covered Calls:\n   * If a stock has a large movement range, I think it can be worthwhile to wait to open a CC after the last one is closed/expires.  I have been more successful waiting for another opportunity vs. opening one immediately on the Monday after the second the last one expires.\n   * Consider selling covered calls at all time highs/peaks.  If you sell a CC and the stock dips significantly, and you think it\u2019s temporary, you can buy to close your CC for a quick profit, then reopen it later.\n   * If you own Meme stocks, selling covered calls runs the risk of missing out on large gains.  On these stocks I typically only sell them further OTM than I normally would or not at all.  If I do sell CC on a Meme stock I try to ensure I have 25-100 other shares that won\u2019t be called away.\n* Dead cat bounce.\n   * After a huge price drop sometimes a stock will pop or partially recover temporarily.\n   * It could be a reversal or a false flag.  Be aware of this so you can react accordingly.\n   * [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/101700.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/101700.asp)\n* Finding stocks:\n   * u/swaggymedia publishes great lists of stocks at various price points with high and low IVs.  See r/SwaggyStocks, the new subreddit.\n   * Here are a few examples:\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kx6oh6/iv\\_report\\_high\\_iv\\_tickers\\_with\\_share\\_price\\_under/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kx6oh6/iv_report_high_iv_tickers_with_share_price_under/)\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l3yzo0/weekend\\_iv\\_report\\_tickers\\_with\\_low\\_iv\\_and\\_cheaper/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l3yzo0/weekend_iv_report_tickers_with_low_iv_and_cheaper/)\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/l3yxn5/weekend\\_iv\\_report\\_stocks\\_with\\_high\\_iv\\_and\\_more/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/l3yxn5/weekend_iv_report_stocks_with_high_iv_and_more/)\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kz5soi/iv\\_report\\_stocks\\_with\\_high\\_iv\\_and\\_more\\_expensive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kz5soi/iv_report_stocks_with_high_iv_and_more_expensive/)\n   * I recommend building a large roster of stocks you want to trade with and check it at least daily.  My \u201cwheel candidate\u201d list is 26 \u201csolid\u201d stocks plus 20-25 I\u2019m lukewarm about.  I want it to be at 100-200.\n   * With a large stock candidate list it makes it easy to find targets to buy dips on and exploit opportunities.  I like selling puts at dips with some downside protection.\n* Below is another reddit user's more aggressive theta gang variant.  I think this has merits, I'm trying it myself with a few stocks.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/lgt314/55k\\_to\\_475k\\_in\\_4\\_months\\_using\\_theta\\_wsb\\_techniques/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/lgt314/55k_to_475k_in_4_months_using_theta_wsb_techniques/)\n\n* Buying calls or puts with more DTE than you need is a very smart strategy IMO.\n   * Buying extra time becomes progressively cheaper after \\~1 month and keeps theta from hurting you as much.  See LEAPS later.\n   * I started off buying 30-45 DTE calls, then moved to 45-60 DTE.\n   * Now I am tinkering with only buying calls/puts that have 90-120+ DTE (monthlies).  I plan to close these with at least 30-45 DTE left since theta starts to really depreciate your contracts at 45 days, especially at 30 days.  If I\u2019m playing an event or a specific date, I ensure I have at least 30 days past that with whatever I purchase.\n   * Buying longer dated contracts, while more capital \u201cefficient\u201d, is more costly.  I couldn\u2019t do this when I had a small account.  There is also more downside risk; since the contract is more valuable, you can lose more.  I try to only have 1-3 calls open at a time in one stock so if I\u2019m wrong I don\u2019t get destroyed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI\u2019m not a financial advisor, I\u2019m not an engineer.

        "selftext": "**Positions: FTOC shares, average price $13.24. Not financial advice.**\n\n**What is FTOC/Payoneer?**\n\nFtac Olympus Acquisition Corp (FTOC) is a SPAC led by Betsy Cohen that has a definitive agreement to merge with Payoneer.\n\nPayoneer is a payment platform that offers a way for businesses to pay and receive money, for a low fee. Payoneer believes that the total addressable market (defined as global e-commerce volume) is $26 trillion a year. Payoneer processed over $44 billion in 2020 alone.\n\nPayoneer also offers:\n\n* Accounting integrations\n* Capital to small businesses\n* Regulatory and compliance infrastructure\n* Physical debit cards\n* Tax solutions\n\n**Management Team**\n\nScott Galit - CEO of Payoneer, previously a senior VP at MasterCard. Serious financial services pedigree.\n\nMichael G Levine - CFO of Payoneer, ex-City VP and ex-CFO of Maler Technologies. MBA from Wharton.\n\nBetsy Cohen - CEO of FTOC. Tons of finance related experience, including founding Bancorp. Should be able to give Payoneer great advice for future growth.\n\n**Customers**\n\nPayoneer has some big name clients, including but not limited to:\n\n* Amazon Europe\n* Google\n* eBay\n* Walmart\n* Upwork\n* Fiverr\n\nPayoneer works with 9 of the top 20 most valuable companies. Alongside these big names, Payoneer also has 5 million+ marketplaces and businesses, across over 190 countries.\n\n**Switching Costs**\n\nIntegrating, setting up, and teaching staff how to use a new payment platform can be time-consuming and expensive for businesses. Therefore, when a client is set up on Payoneer, it is unlikely that they will switch to another provider. This is best seen by the &gt;100% volume retention that Payoneer has (i.e. customers stay and increase their payment volume).\n\n**Brand**\n\nPayoneer, from what I have seen, has a strong brand (though this is obviously a subjective factor). This idea is reinforced by the presence of their big name clients. Branding is really important in FinTech, businesses need 100% confidence when money and payments are involved. This offers not only stops entrants into their market, but should also facilitate future growth and customer acquisition.\n\n**Network Effect**\n\nImagine company A is on Payoneer and wants to pay company B. Company A suggests payment through their usual payment processor, Payoneer. Company B now signs up to Payoneer and decides to do all their payments through it etc. This is the network effect that Payoneer enjoys. This is a very powerful barrier to entry - very difficult to overcome, while also hard to create yourself.\n\n**Geographies**\n\nUNSUBSTANTIATED: Conversations on Reddit leads me to believe that Payoneer has a strong presence in Asia. If anyone has evidence, please put it in the comments.\n\nIf this is true, it should give Payoneer an edge in capitalising on the future growth of the emerging markets.\n\nSome evidence:\n\n* The CEO has gone on record saying Korea is one of their big market focuses.\n* Achieved triple digit growth each year in the asian markets from 2012-2016.\n\n**Valuation and Financials**\n\nAll numbers are based on original deal multiples (i.e based on when FTOC was $10 a share).\n\nEnterprise Value: $3.27 billion\n\nProjected 2021 revenue: $432 million\n\nEV/2021 revenue multiple: 7.6x\n\n2019-2020 revenue growth: 8.8%\n\nThis revenue growth is admittedly lower than one would desire for a FinTech company, and is often a criticism leveled against FTOC. However, considering the low EV/Revenue multiple (7.6x) compared to payment processing industry peers (36.5x), means the valuation more than compensates. Another FinTech going public through a SPAC, PaySafe, actually reported a 0.8% decrease in revenues from 2019-2020, but it recently hit $18 a share. (Nothing against PaySafe at all). Moreover, Payoneer\u2019s payment volume increased by 51% in the same timeframe, which will surely result in higher revenues in time. This should mean they reach their long-term target of yearly 20% revenue growth.\n\n**Institutional Ownership**\n\nPayoneer has some institutional giants already invested, including Wellington Management, Dragoneer Investment Group, Fidelity Management and Research, Temasek, and Franklin Templeton.\n\n**Speculative Catalyst**\n\nIn ARK\u2019s Big Ideas 2021, FinTech was mentioned as a big theme that will prevail in 2021. If ARK were to add this cheap, promising FinTech firm to one of their funds, Payoneer will get the respect it deserves and will rocket upwards.\n\n**Risks**\n\n* There are many entrants in the payment processing industry, potentially driving down fees and increasing competition for customers\n* Revenue did not increase very much during 2020, despite a huge e-commerce boom\n* Big clients (which could be a large percentage of revenues) may drop Payoneer for some (hypothetical) reason\n\n**Personal Note**\n\nI use Payoneer as a contractor for Appen. I like it, it always has good customer service, quick payouts and low fees compared to other providers.\n\n**Price Target**\n\nBull Case: $26\n\nMain Case: $21\n\nBear Case: $16\n\nHow did I get these numbers? Just educated guesses.\n\nAs always DYOR, I have linked the investor presentation in the sources, 100% worth a read.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nPosting sources that have been posted before gets this post taken down, so unfortunately I can't add them.

        "selftext": "KEY POINTS: (Please read) thank you\n\n1. Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the \"cause\" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers.\n2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying \"lets get this to $30\" or \"let get this to 100\". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.\n3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video &gt;&gt;&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY)\n4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)\n\nFamiliarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.\n\n\\- They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.\n\n5. Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.\n\n6. Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.\n\n7. Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.\n\n8. What is short selling: &gt;&gt; [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)\n\n9. Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp)\n\n10. Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.\n\n11. Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.\n\n12. Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.\n\nI hope this helps many.",

        "selftext": "I've noticed a lot of new people in here asking some obvious questions to those of us who have been around for a while. So to generate new and better discussion I want to answer some of these frequently asked questions.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1\\. **Where can I find information about these companies**\n\nI hope you haven't bought any of these names before you did research and before you even know where to start looking. First place you should go to is Google and type in \"&lt;company name&gt; investor relations\". If this is too much you can shorten it to \"&lt;ticker&gt; IR\". It should be the first link in every case and if it's not then that's already a red flag.\n\nRead about the companies products, how they operate. Read their MD&amp;A, read their financial statements from the last few years. Maybe look at product reviews or review the products yourselves. Watch interviews with the CEO. Find out what makes this company unique, operationally effective and worth buying for consumers. You should quickly figure out that APHA is NOT a cannabis company, but a consumer packaged good company. They own Cannabis, Alcohol, and Pharma businesses (plus hemp after the TLRY merger).\n\nDoing your DD should take time. Don't be in a rush to buy the stock because it's run up 100% in the past few weeks. If you look at the chart, 2 years ago these companies rocketed upwards to ATHs, you could have waited another year or so and bought lower. Are we taking off to the moon and never coming back? Probably not.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2\\. **Where can I buy these companies? Are they on Robinhood?**\n\nFirst, ditch Robinhood a get a broker that won't go under in the next few years. Pay a trading fee if you need to but just buy enough stock to make the tade worth it. Don't buy $20 of Apha on investorline or you're immediately taking a 50% haircut with a $9.95 trading fee.\n\nSecond, you can buy these companies on most/all legit trading platforms. I won't name them all but all of the big Canadian banks self-directed platforms have them. I'm not American so I can't speak for them but I've heard good things about Fidelity and Vanguard.\n\nOh, did you also mean what exchanges can I buy them on? Big Canadian names are on the major exchanges like TSX and Nasdaq. Smaller names are on the CSE and OTC markets. US names can't list on the big exchanges because your government decided cannabis was bad like 50 yrs ago so those are only on the OTC and CSE markets. MSOs is a fund on the NYSE (I think) that hold some sort of swaps on the US names but I personally just buy the names myself. Again, do you own DD, even if you're buying a fund.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3\\. **This stock went up x% in the last y time, should I buy it or wait for a dip?**\n\nThis ties into point 1 above, so if you've done your DD you should know if the company is worth what it is priced at. The market does wacky shit all the time (see Gamestop, morgage crisis, great depression) so it'll go up and down, but generally follow along the trajectory of the company profits. If the profits increase by 5x in 10 years, the stock price will do the same. If you're asking for predictions in the short term consult a fortune teller, roll dice or find one of those pets that pick stocks.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n4\\. **What stocks should I buy? How do you feel about x company?**\n\nSee 1, then 3. I can't tell you what companies are good in the space better than your own research. Especially since you don't know what my plans are. Maybe a poster says buy \"Apha\" but they're only holding until the TLRY merger closes. They'll never tell you when they're selling so if it drops you'll be scratching your head. Do a bunch of research on the main players, then some smaller guys and figure out what you can stomach. Maybe a cannabis ETF is right for you or maybe 1 or 2 strong picks or maybe you like gambling with penny stocks. Just do your own DD.\n\nPopular names and good places to start are:\n\n* Canadian names: APHA/TLRY, CGC/WEED, ACB, CRON\n\n* US names: CURA, TRUL, CL, GTII\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n5\\. **Should I buy leaps or warrents or calls or puts? Also what are derivatives?**\n\nIf you have to ask, no. I'm also not going to explain because I don't know either.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n6\\. **I bought Gamestop at all time highs and I sold and lost 90%, is cannabis good?**\n\nNo, kindly take your paper hands and go back to WSB. We don't want investors in this space who sell at the first 10% drop after an 100% run, or after a 50% drop from ATHs, or after a short report from some short selling parasites. We hold because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity of a product moving from the illicit market to the legal market. There is no need to build up demand, merely move the consumer from buying from their dealer to our dealer. This will take time, regulatory changes, perception changes and most importantly, your patience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n7\\. **Any small companies you can reccomend?**\n\nBeing a small company in this space comes with distinct disadvantages. Price compression in Canada will kill small/medium sized growers since they can't achieve postive margins without scale. Add in some mould on even 1 harvest and the losses have destroyed your business. On the US side, regulations are weird and vary across different states. Califonia is a dumpster fire, Florida requires you to be vertically integrated, and other states have limited licences for retail and grows. Think about how hard it would be to get a foothold in Florida as a small business. Think about how valuable a licence is in limited licence states. Maybe your small player is looking for licences and gets NONE. That's devastating. Curaleaf misses 1 licence? Not great, but they have other applications in multiple states.\n\nIf you're buying a small company or penny stock, know the risks and do extra DD. \n\nTHERE HAVE BEEN COMPANIES THAT ARE FRAUDULENT IN THIS INDUSTRY. \n\nCOMPANIES HAVE GONE BANKRUPT IN THIS INDUSTRY. \n\nCanntrust was legit but had fake walls with more plants behind them. Ignite was run by Dan Bilzerian. YOUR PICKS ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM GOING BANKRUPT.\n\nLet me repeat the most important point: THERE HAVE BEEN COMPANIES THAT ARE FRAUDULENT IN THIS SPACE.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n8\\. **I wanna buy because of US legalization! When will Cannabis be legalized in the US?**\n\nAsking for a specific date is dumb and assuming that it's going to pass is dumber. Yes, Democrats control all 3 branches of government and yes, they are more cannabis friendly than Republicans and yes, some Republican states also recently legalized cannabis. THIS DOES NOT MEAN LEGALIZATION WILL PASS THIS YEAR, OR EVEN UNDER THIS CONGRESS OR PRESIDENT. Some Republicans in the house voted for cannabis regulation under Trump and some Democrats voted against it. We have no idea how the senate will vote and it doesn't take many votes to torpedo any legislation. \n\nIf you know the US Cannabis space right now you'll know that descheduling and getting access to lower tax rates, access to capital and ability to cross state lines are some of the most important regulatory changes that need to happen. Look up the ~~208e~~280e tax code. Seriously do it. Full legalization is nice but also unlikely.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf I've missed any questions post them below. and I'll add them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL:DR: Do your own DD. Start here:\n\n* Canadian names: APHA/TLRY, CGC/WEED, ACB, CRON\n\n* US names: CURA, TRUL, CL, GTII\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Adding in some resources for those who want more. These are my own resources I use/used to get started. If you have resources to share please do so but don't self promote you ding dongs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Resources**\n\nNew to Investing:\n\n* Most people think Warren Buffet is the GOAT but [Peter Lynch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Pq5zKEi_g) is also a GOAT in his own right and a better speaker.\n* People also think you need to read through all of \"The Intelligent Investor\" before you can start investing but that's bs. Read \"One up on Wallstreet\" by Peter Lynch. It's like 300 pages shorter and more fun. Then read Intelligent Investor if you want but if you get 20 pages in and fall asleep or feel stupid then I told you so.\n* Martin Shkreli is an asshat but he knows the finance side of valuing companies. [His finance lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VI_riscmviI&amp;list=PLJsVF3gZDcuTxcdH5FmQRTd6MiJ29X_OQ) are awesome if you stand him  for a few hours at a time. Follow along with your own companies.\n\nCannabis Resources:\n\n* The sidebar has great resources. ~~Stateside cannabis investors~~(EDIT: Currently down) is awesome for the US side.\n* The OCS releases a [quarterly report](https://ocs.ca/pages/insights-publication) you should read for Canada. Hell, go to OCS.ca and see what products are available and prices. Go to the BC page, the quebec page etc...\n* Statscan has a [cannabis hub](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/13-610-x/cannabis-eng.htm). It's updated super rarely and it might be archived but it's good to look at to start.",

        "selftext": "**TLDR: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan are Melvin's main Prime Brokers. All three firms privately own and sit on the board of the DTCC. If naked shorting occurred in GME, there's good reason to believe the three named prime brokers and the DTCC may have shut down 1/28 for nefarious reasons beyond the sudden and potentially arbitrary \"collateral requirements\" stated**\n\nIf you\u2019ve read my\u00a0[last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lma1ev/illegal_tactics_and_dtccprime_broker_complicity/), I hypothesize that if naked shorting is present in GME, prime brokers and the DTCC (which is privately owned by the prime brokers) would need to be complicit in it, which adds another dimension to whether the retail shutdown 1/28 to stop the squeeze was done for nefarious reasons.\n\nOn the question of whether DTCC was right to shut down trading on 1/28 based on collateral requirements, I'm not an expert on this subject but I've seen many compelling arguments against it, including how did they arrive at the 3 billion number for Robinhood and why were they able to get negotiated from 3 billion to 700 million (per following DTCC's special requirements) and why was cash customers restricted vs just margin? And why was selling allowed but not buying, why not shut off both? Another interest point is that the DTCC has often been implicated and accused of enabling naked short selling over the years and that the DTCC is privately owned by Prime Brokers/Banks.\n\nOne question posed to me by a reporter was \u201cwho are the prime brokers involved\u201d? So I decided to do some digging and found this disclosure form\u00a0[https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf)\u00a0which shows that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan are Melvin Capital\u2019s three largest prime brokers (based on assets held under custodianship). As a reminder, if these prime brokers did allow naked shorting and the short squeeze had occurred, pushing prices to thousands per share, the hedge funds would likely not be able to pay that and prime brokers would be left holding the bag to cover (which would also suggest they would be disincentivized to margin call)\n\nAll three firms own and sit on the board of DTCC\u00a0[https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board](https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board). (Note that National Financial Services (Fidelity) is also a prime broker they use but only 6 million in assets under custodianship as compared to a 1.16 billion each for Goldman Sach and Morgan Stanley, and 265 million for JP Morgan at the time of the disclosure snapshot (03/2020).) I found this to be an interesting data point and wanted to share with the board.\n\nNote, the same Goldman Sachs that has been repeatedly implicated in naked shorting cases (Source:\u00a0[https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html)) and given nothing but slap on the wrists for enforcement. Also the same Goldman that accidentally leaked it\u2019s own emails (while defending a naked shorting lawsuit) that implicated itself and other banks in participating in naked shorting, including quotes like \u201c**We are NOT borrowing negatives... I have made that clear from the beginning. Why would we want to borrow them? We want to fail them...\" and \u201c\\[stock is\\] trading at negative rebate with non-paying customers\u201d (naked short). In one email Goldman Sachs tells a client** \u201cWe will let you fail.\u201d (FTID, trade a stock without locating it) and an email from a Goldman, Sachs hedge fund client, who remarked that when wanting to \u201cshort an impossible name and fully expecting not to receive it\u201d he would then be \u201cshocked to learn that \\[Goldman\u2019s representative\\] could get it for us.\u201d (Source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20201028054857/https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/](https://web.archive.org/web/20201028054857/https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/))\n\nAnother interesting datapoint is that Goldman was chosen as the firm to take Robinhood public\u00a0[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-robinhood-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-trading-app-robinhood-hires-goldman-sachs-to-lead-ipo-sources-idUSKBN28I328](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-robinhood-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-trading-app-robinhood-hires-goldman-sachs-to-lead-ipo-sources-idUSKBN28I328), so alongside with the Robinhood Citadel relationship (As it relates to selling order flow and RH making making 40%+ of their total revenue from it) there\u2019s also a relationship between Robinhood and Goldman Sachs, who they would do well to have on their good side ahead of the IPO.\n\nThe thesis of whether there were more nefarious reasons to the 1/28 shut down (which short squeeze was set to occur, and when Interactive Brokers CEO projected price would\u2019ve been in the thousands\u00a0[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmagzp/today\\_interactive\\_brokers\\_ceo\\_admits\\_that\\_without/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmagzp/today_interactive_brokers_ceo_admits_that_without/)) is tied to whether or not naked shorting occurred in GME, because if it did then the Prime Brokers involved and DTCC would likely have been complicit, they would likely be holding the bag if a short squeeze did occur as well as blow back for allowing naked shorting.\n\nAs long documented by counterfeitingstock.com, \u201cthe short hedge funds,\u00a0**the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC)**\u2014make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated\u2026 The counterfeiting of shares is\u00a0**done by participating prime brokers or the DTC, which is owned by the prime brokers**. A number of lawsuits that involve naked shorting have named about ten of the prime brokers as defendants, including\u00a0**Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch; UBS; Morgan Stanley and others. The DTCC has also been named in a number of lawsuits that allege stock counterfeiting**\u2026 Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is\u00a0**carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC**\u00a0and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail. The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. (Source:\u00a0[http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html))\n\nA former economist who worked in operations at the DTCC, Susanne Trimbath, even came out in this\u00a0insightful [article](https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/)\u00a0and blew the whistle on naked shorting being allowed to happen within the DTCC, I highly recommend you read the full article. Just to highlight one part of it, Timbath says \u201cThe Securities and Exchange Act of 1933 specifically gave the clearing house the right to require that shares and securities be delivered for settlement. It allows them to punish those who don\u2018t deliver by refusing to have them in the system\u2026 **The DTCC has for years ignored that\u201d** (Source:\u00a0[https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/](https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/)). In laying out the case of whether naked shorting exists in GameStop, the nature of naked shorting means it's not easy to prove and there have been hundreds of lawsuits for naked shorting that are often settled out of court because of that, but if you\u2019re an investor in the trade you\u2019ve probably noticed that in the past three weeks GME has had a lot of strange things happen to the stock, including seeing a precipitous drop in price starting 2/1 and onwards while short interest supposedly dropped. These things all make sense if you consider naked shorting occurred. In the case of GameStop there are several very strong signs/indicators that naked shorting has occurred.\n\n**I will list some of the indicators that Naked Shorting occurred in GameStop below:**\n\n1. One indicator is GME's extremely high number of Fail to Delivers ([www.wherearetheshares.com](http://www.wherearetheshares.com/)), which are one of the top in the stock market over a sustained period of time. The website\u00a0[www.wherearetheshares.com](http://www.wherearetheshares.com/)\u00a0shows extraordinarily high FTIDs extending from 2020 to years back. Michael Burry tweeted that in May 2020 when he lent out his GME, it took weeks for his brokers to locate the shares\u00a0[https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en). FTIDs can happen for a number of reasons, but to have this high number of FTIDs over a sustained period of time is highly unusual, and a stock with a high number of FTIDs is one potential indicator that counterfeit shares are in circulation and naked shorting occured.  \n \n2. Short Interest in GME has been extremely high at numbers significantly over 100% of float. As of January 15th short interest was 226% ([https://imgur.com/fN4fVQl](https://imgur.com/fN4fVQl)) of the entire float. While it is theoretically possible for short interest to be over 100% with brokers repeatedly leading to each other, short interest this high at 226% of the total float is highly unusual and an indicator of naked shorting occured, which is a far more feasible scenario because naked shorting enables short interest to rise quickly as you do not need to determine the shares exist before you short.  \n \n3. Institutions alone have held a staggering 177% of float as of 1/31 according to Bloomberg Terminal\u00a0[https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)\u00a0which is highly unusual and could be a strong sign that GME is rampant with counterfeit shares. Another interesting datapoint is Fidelity's calculation of retail ownership is only 0.1% float ([https://imgur.com/a/FtSOiCW](https://imgur.com/a/FtSOiCW)) which is highly unusual and unlikely to be true -- any potential indications that counterfeit shares are in play because number of shares to ownership potentially cannot be conclusively determined\n\nOn Monday 2/1 there was a momentous price drop, and that drop continued through the week. Given the continued high short interest and retail interest to force shorts into a short squeeze, the price drop made little sense, especially because short interest remained high and even if shorts had covered there should've been an upward price pressure. What makes the most sense to me is that the price drop was facilitated by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares in a short down ladder, described below:\n\n*\"Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit... By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of \u201cstrategic fails-to-deliver\u201d and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand\" (Source:* [*http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html*](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)*)*\n\nIn an ordinary scenario with short interest dropping and shorts needing to buy back to cover the price is anticipated to go up. As of 2/1 with GME's reported short interest declining with price also dropping, there are signs pointing to shorts artificially covering or lowering their short interest via the generation of synthetic longs using options to cover, which is in regulation of Reg-SHO -- and again, this assertion is supported by the high numbers of FTIDs GME has consistently reported.",

        "selftext": "Trying to setup my Fidelity account and it\u2019s been a nightmare to say the least. I have tried authorizing my bank account twice in the past week without luck. The times I\u2019ve been able to get through with customer service I was just told \u201clooks like your bank statement you sent for authentication isn\u2019t going through, try sending it again\u201d if it wasn\u2019t accepted the first time I didn\u2019t get notified anyway. In fact, if I didn\u2019t call, I would have never known.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a week now and my bank has told me that they have not received any notices from Fidelity at all, nothing.\n\nI was told else where to print out the EFT form and send it in with a voided check to try and verify that way...so in 2021 I need to print out a form, fill it out manually, attach a voided check, mail it and wait 7-10 days after they receive it to hopefully get verified then? In a digital world that sounds like the most backwards thing ever.\n\nI get Fidelity is awesome for some people but this is asinine. Fuck Robinhood but literally everything else about them besides their business ethics and lack of OTC\u2019s are great (UI, ease of use, setup, deposits etc...)\n\nTD or Schwab for OTC\u2019s?

        "selftext": "I am doing this to lay out some of the facts that I see as the main reason I am still holding.  There is a bull and a bear case in my opinion, seeing that I am still holding I think there is a much stronger bull case though.\n\nBull Case:\n\n\\-Another round of stimmy will give us all a boost\n\n\\-Short interest as of 2/2 is growing.  [https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme) 16 Milllion shorted today and a massive Short ratio, and I don't see them covering any time soon.  So the short squeeze story is there.  Also, most of those are a bunch of new paper handed boomer bears from Twitter shorting this, so that's an easy squeeze. As well, since we are now on the short restriction list, that's LITERALLY WHAT HAPPEND TO US.  They cant short, only close positions, similar to us not being able to buy.  (I think that's what that means?)\n\n\\-We have diamond hands, and we can remain stupid longer than they can remain solvent.  We have millions of people switching to fidelity and vanguard, and new members joining everyday to join the fight.  Even 1 diamond handed retard doing their part helps.  We gained 6 million people in a month.  If even 1 million of them each bought 1 share, and held.  At 100$ a share, that's alot of money and shares.  IDK math.  (100 Million dollars?).  It helps anyway.  This will ramp up, and just as we had some random paper hands on the way down, they will have paper hands on the way up.\n\n\\-We just got a whole bunch more people, at a whole lot cheaper price.  Sure, we have alot of people at 300 and 350, but we have ALOT of people.  Getting all these new people able to reload at 100$ a share is a godsend.  I doubled my shares on the way down, and will probably buy more as money clears.  Diamond hands are the way to go.  IF you are scared, don't want a loss, etc etc. It is literally so simple.  Buy, put in the highest sell order the brokerage will let you, and don't worry about it other than to buy more.  8 MILLION people even with 1000$ each, COULD LITERALLY BUY  GAMESTOP AT ITS CURRENT PRICE.  We already have an edge with people like DFV having .5% of gamestop.  I don't know what his plan is, but if it keeps dropping, and he decides to buy more, or exercise those options, that position will only grow. We have several millionaires in here as well buying and holding.  So, if you have 1-2 shares, they will help make up for it.\n\nBear Case:\n\n\\-Honestly, the only way we lose this is if you sell, or people lose confidence. Have a plan, don't doubt, stick to it, chin up, buy more, live life in the mean time.",

        "selftext": "Transcript of earnings call published today -Bill Foley: \"BFT, which is we've now gone through, we just finished our third round  of comments on BFT, we're hopeful that we'll be going effective with the  SEC sometime in the next 10 days or so. And then the shareholders the  proxy we file we go through the shareholder vote and we will de-SPAC.\n\n\"In  our target date, for that if we hit our milestones, and who knows,  sometimes you get hung up on various things, Paysafe should be or BFT  should be de-SPAC sometime before the 31st of March.\"\n\nFoley describes Paysafe and Alight as, \"examples of companies that  serve multi trillion dollar industries, which offer tremendous potential  for future growth through continued scale and transformation led by  technology initiatives.\"\n\n\"We are confident in our approach to  sourcing transactions, demonstrating our discipline, value-based  approach, which we believe ultimately delivers superior long-term  returns to our shareholders over market cycle.\"\n\nSome highlights on BFT/Payafe for those unaware:\n\n\u2022 Proprietary scalable electronic payment platform used by Draftkings, Roblox, Youtube, Coinbase, Visa, Fortnight, Amazon, ApplePay, Twitch, Microsoft, Xbox, Spotify, Amelco, William Hill, Golden Nugget, Ceasar\u2019s Entertainment, Betfair, PayLease, Vanilla Direct, MindBody, ESL Gaming, Luckbox etc.\n\n\u2022 $1.5Billion revenue / $103Billion transactional volume (2021E)\n\n\u2022 $560 Million EBITDA (2021E) \u201cforecast to rise significantly by 2023. Its projections show $744 million in adjusted EBITDA on 2023 revenue of $1.881 billion. That represents an EBITDA margin of 39.55%.\u201d (21% CAGR)\n\n\u2022 10-15X growth projected in iGaming (currently 34% Paysafe revenue). US iGaming continues to be legalized state by state, growing revenue by 234% in just the last year. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Recently launched Paysafecash in US. Now in 40 currencies and 30 global markets for easier cross border payments\n\n\u2022 Enabled for cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ether, Litecoin, EOS, XLM, XRP etc.)\n\n\u2022 Paysafe owns Openbucks, Neteller and Skrill, 2019 winner \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for best consumer take up and most innovative technology with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems\u201d. \u201cDigital wallet and mobile payments operator Skrill, part of Paysafe Group, has also enabled an instant crypto-to-crypto feature. Skrill users no longer have to convert their crypto holdings back into fiat currencies before buying another cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Highly differentiated B2B and B2C global network\n\n\u2022 Strong 80% adj. cash conversion business model with no significant capex or balance sheet requirements\n\n\u2022 2017-2019 revenue grew from $800 Million to $1.4Billion (27%CAGR- including impact of acquisitions)\n\n\u2022 2019 Gross profit of $909 million (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n\n\u2022 High profit margins with significant operating leverage. (Adj. EBITDA margins above 30% with path to 35%+) Expanding margin projections offers flexibility and plays into Bill Foley\u2019s strength of pursuing inorganic growth.\n\n\u2022 Merger deal eliminates 2/3 debt, leaving increased margins and strong cash buffer for Foley to initiate M&amp;A plans\n\n\u2022 Bill Foley, who drove value creation in Fidelity National Information Services from $2.5Billion MC to over $91Billion, says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Foley, a sophisticated dealmaker known for under-promising and over-performing, has led five separate multi-billion dollar public market platforms to complete over 100 acquisitions. In just the last five years, Foley and his team have grown Ceridian from $4.2B to $14B, Dun &amp; Bradstreet from $2B to $11.3B and Black Knight from $1.6B to $14B.  Foley\u2019s consistent M&amp;A track record in generating synergistic growth indicates Paysafe\u2019s current growth projections are conservative. Foley and his investors also own a large portion of SPAC shares which aligns his motives with the common retail shareholder. Foley says Paysafe may be his \u201cbest investment ever.\u201d\n\n\u2022 CNBC Pundit coverage: Steve Grasso says BFT will triple. \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there\" \u201cBFT. It\u2019s the most excited I\u2019ve been about a stock in a long time. I\u2019m looking for a triple and I think I\u2019m going to get it.\u201d   Cramer calls BFT/Paysafe \u201cterrific\u201d, \u201csmart\u201d with \u201cgood bloodlines.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Paysafe price targets based on recent EV/EBITDA ratios of sector peers :\n\n    \u2043 Nuvei : 54x &gt; Paysafe = $42\n    \n    \u2043 PayPal : 59x &gt; Paysafe = $45\n    \n    \u2043 Shift : 39x &gt; Paysafe = $30\n    \n    \u2043 Repay : 77x &gt; Paysafe = $60\n    \n    \u2043 Affirm: 89x &gt; Paysafe = $69\n    \n    \u2043 Square : 218x &gt; Paysafe = $169\n\nPost-merger analysts\u2019 12 months price targets will look to 2022-23 projections with 35% higher EBITDA sending fair valuations higher.  Combine this with the type of inorganic growth potential represented by Foley\u2019s track record along with the fact that most institutions can only invest once the merger is complete and you start to get a sense of how far this can run.\n\n\u25aa Bill Foley, Chairman of the Board Fidelity:\n\n    \"Whether it\u2019s a lottery or slot machines or sportsbetting opening in a state, it\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate. We\u2019re focusing on gaming, particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and we\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d - \u201cI have a vision that we should be the \\\\\\[digital\\\\\\] wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody. That\u2019s why I got so excited about Paysafe Group Holdings Limited as its position in iGaming is really second to none.\n    \n    Paysafe has an attractive combination of payment assets including a leading digital wallet platform in Skrill, one of the fastest growing eCash businesses, and a merchant business focused on high growth vertical markets\u2026We believe we can further enhance Paysafe\u2019s growth trajectory through accelerated operational transformation and M&amp;A, enabled by our de-levered balance sheet. Paysafe delivers a unique value proposition in large and high-growth markets, such as gaming and e-commerce, enabling the company to generate strong organic revenue growth and margin expansion. With a proven strategy and an experienced management team and our newly formed partnership, we believe Paysafe has significant long-term growth potential\u2026We have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\u201d",

        "selftext": " There has already been a decent amount of DD on this increasingly watched company, but I found most of it was copied from other sites, so I wanted to do some proper, original DD and explain why I think this stock is significantly undervalued, some potential upcoming catalysts, and why I bought Sonasoft Corp. (financial disclosure: holding 22,601 shares)\n\n**Flagship Product NuGene**\n\nThis is the key differentiator for Sonasoft. They have created a product that can autonomously find opportunities for automation and create AI bots that reduce their customers costs. They have literally created a product that can replace an internal data scientist! They recently **secured a** [**patent**](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-Files-Key-Patent-That-Will-Improve-AI?id=287849) **on this technology announced on 1/28 giving them a strong competitive moat**. They have consistently reduce AI deployment time from the typical 2-6 months to 2-6 weeks.\n\n**Quality of Leadership Team**\n\nCEO: [Mike Khanna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-khanna-882a6/) has over 20 years of experience primarily with Sonasoft creating continuity of vision and execution. He was responsible for the launch of SonaCloud, SonaSecure, and SonaVault. Notably, his hire of Rob as CFO and acquisition of Hotify via Ankur shows his their successful pivot to focusing more exclusively on AI company last year.\n\nCFO: [Rob Baumert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robbaumert1/), joined a year ago and has helped reshape the companies direction. Rob has a serious track record of success over his 25 year career, holding CFO/COO positions in startups since 2004, working for Grattan Group Capital, Redbubble, and X-Company. He grew Redbubble sales from $3M to $143M, gross margins from 25% to 35%, buyer retention by 50%, NPS by 20 points.\n\nChief of AI: [Ankur Garg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankurdinesh/) joined 18 months ago and has been the chief architect of NuGene's and was leading Hotify prior to Sonasoft acquiring it. He is on the board of the Forbes Technology Council.\n\n**Customers and Catalysts**\n\nJune 2020: Sonasoft submitted 2 highly relevant SEC 8-K filings. 1) [deal with $FIS](https://www.otcmarkets.com/filing/html?id=14151883&amp;guid=RktKUqJE71_MX3h) for the development of AI solutions, and 2) [deal with Google](https://www.otcmarkets.com/filing/html?id=14212370&amp;guid=RktKUqJE71_MX3h) to develop Google Cloud Learning Systems. We don't have details revealed yet on the size of these contracts and therefore only the speculation was priced in back in June. With no new news on either (likely due to NDAs), the price eroded the speculation spike since June.\n\nCatalysts: As soon as we learn any more details about either of these contracts, hopefully in the Q4 20'investor report you should expect the price to rocket.\n\n**Price Target Analysis (1200% conservative upside)**\n\nVolume has been increasing as this stock gets more and more attention. With some recent profit taking this week, now is an exceptional entry point prior to the catalysts mentioned above.\n\nLooking at AITX as a comparable, who has recently shown a massive run up and taking a Market Cap/Revenue at only 5% of the multiple, we get a price target of $3.11. This doesn't even include the fact that SSFT has 500% more cash than AITX and literally a fraction of the debt (4%). Their revenue is +4,000% of AITX who does not have the same quality of customers either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2k72kqgxdnh61.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c6223342b12fea1873af51c27dc25f2ed77141e\n\n**Risks**\n\nI have seen a fair bit of posting by new accounts or old accounts with limited to no post history about this stock which makes me suspicious it previously was a P&amp;D target. However, given this company's recent pivot, the updates on their website to reflect this, the increase in daily trading volume, and their financials showing strong revenue growth, I believe P&amp;Ders will be more challenged to manipulate the price.  \n\nSSFT was also hit fairly hard with COVID from client's reducing discretionary spend on services, which explains the expected decline in known revenues up to Q3 20'. However, given the timing of the 8-Ks, I do not believe the GOOG or FIS revenues have been included yet, but we will know soon in their next financial report out.\n\n**TLDR: SSFT made a pivot to AI via their product NuGene which is being used by Google and $FIS. They are expecting massive revenue growth, are led by a quality management team, have low debt, and compared to competitors are significantly undervalued. My conservative price target is $3.11 a (1200% upside).**\n\nBest of luck to everyone who invests and thanks to the community for the continued quality DD. I am not a financial advisor, trade at your own risk.\n\n**-Nautique**",

        "selftext": "We\u2019ve all seen tons of shit going down with Robinhood, lots of obvious stuff that has affected many many people. But there\u2019s even more shady stuff that\u2019s been going on the past few weeks that I haven\u2019t seen anyone mention. So let me share with you my GME timeline.\n\nI\u2019d been watching GME since it was around $30. The weekend that it closed at $60 I decided I was going to buy in and spent most of the weekend preparing that. I started by reinstalling Robinhood which I hadn\u2019t used since 2018, and funding it with $300. I did this to keep it separate from my main portfolio. I chose $300 because I was almost positive it would fail and I was willing to watch $300 go to zero with no skin off my back.\n\nOn Monday I bought in at $95. I traded it once that day to increase my principle to about $350, then bought back in around $90. After spending most of that night lurking wsb I bought into the hype and decided I was going to invest more. \n\nTuesday morning premarket, around 3-4 am, I initiated another transfer to Robinhood for $550. I chose this number because it made my initial investment stay below the $1000 instant deposit limit, meaning I could invest it at market open. However, this same thought process led me to believe it may be a longer play, and I might want to invest more. So at that same point in time I upgraded to Robinhood gold, to increase my instant deposit limit to $2500.\n\nI proceeded to return to Reddit for a few hours, with an idea of what price point I was looking for (i was hoping to get at least 4-5 more on a\nDip). Since I knew how much I had I didn\u2019t spend much of that time on Robinhood til around 9. At that point I go to set my limit orders for open and I see that none of my funds are available to trade. \n\nAfter the initial run around, I find out a few things. \n\n1) the $550 deposit I made was put on margin , and since my other principle was less than that it restricted me from trading it. It also allowed Robinhood to charge me fees for the time that it was on margin. To clarify, I did not have margin trading enabled, which was shown clearly on the same exact page that showed I had $550 on margin. \n\n2) My instant deposits were restricted. So even though I paid to get Robinhood gold, and even though I still hadn\u2019t deposited the initial *FREE*  $1,000 instant limit, they decided they didn\u2019t want me trading instantly. \n\n3) My withdrawals were restricted. My $300 principal settled that same morning, meaning I shouldn\u2019t have had any restrictions on withdrawing that or any profits that it made. \n\nSo what do I do? I bitch to Robinhood. They tell me they\u2019ll get back to me in 2-3 days. Fuck that. I call my bank and reverse the $550 deposit (I put it in fidelity later that day). I sell the dog coin and free stock I\u2019d had since 2018 and prepare to liquidate the account at first chance, aside from the GME which I didn\u2019t want caught in limbo for Wednesday. Wednesday comes and goes and I stare helplessly as the price continues to rise, unable to buy more. \n\nAnd then Thursday happened. We all know most of the details of that, and what has happened since, so I won\u2019t put too much time there. But guess what, Friday Robinhood emailed me back!\n\nThe very courteous and official sounding email informed me that my account was restricted due to a failed deposit of $550 (the reversal).\n\nSo now I\u2019ve got official correspondence from these guys telling me that they can see into the future, and that they restricted my account for a reversed payment before it was reversed. Said restriction being what lead to the reversal in the first place. \n\nAt this point I felt pretty hopeless, and have been kinda sluggish all week, but have tried to stay optimistic and continue to hold. After all, I was Prepared to lose the money from the get go. Sometime during this period I discover that selling the free Robinhood stock creates a 30 day period with which you can\u2019t withdraw your money. \n\nSo after playing sundial on Tuesday, tilray on Wednesday, (At this point I made about $80 on sundial which allowed me to buy 4 tilray stocks at $42 when added with the rest of my floating power. Made another $80 on that the next morning. ) and staring at the market Thursday, I sold all but one of my gme for a 40% loss, and put the rest of my purchasing power into PLTR at the dip yesterday. Figure I\u2019ll try to play with it on Robinhood if they\u2019re forcing me to keep it there for a few weeks.\n\n*But then*, this morning I wake up and check my email to find [These two lovely messages](https://imgur.com/gallery/vP5eSss) from Robinhood. As of a few hours ago they have officially restricted all of my securities to sell only, and restricted my withdrawal capabilities. The reason given was because of a failed deposit...\n\nSo now they\u2019ve basically taken away from me everything that the app offers, except the ability to sell my positions. But if I sell my positions, not only can I not withdraw the money, I can\u2019t reinvest it into other positions.\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot I can do. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about it, and I realized that just about the only thing that I *can* do is to make sure that other people know; this wasn\u2019t just some simple market manipulation, and it didn\u2019t just start on that Thursday. They are literally in the process of stealing from people in any way that they can. \n\nPlease do not let this issue fade from your radar. The extreme and constant news over the past 5 years has tamed us, making us indifferent and more likely to move onto the next issue. Let\u2019s not drop this issue people, for the sake of our average citizen, the tax payer, the working people, the people that actually run this country with their blood sweat and tears. Don\u2019t let Robinhoods assault on our free market fade to obscurity.",

        "selftext": "This was over the minute billionaire grifters and media got in on it. After RH got hobbled last week, that was the last nail in the coffin. It resulted in 6M people joining this subreddit that refused to listen to anything that wasn't confirmation bias. Every single post was the same \"This is not advice, I'm retard [rocket]\". Every DD that didn't support that narrative was considered a bot post (even though they had long post history). When people start putting up billboards, that's when you know it's squoozed.\n\n\n\n1) The short interest is still \"121%\" \"226%\" \"53% is fake!\"\n\n\n- the actual short interest is published 2x per month with a huge delay when between the reporting date and the publish date\n- this means you are always getting either stale data (like the ones referenced in media) or modeled data (Ortex, S3)\n- with this much volatility within a few days, there is almost no way to accurately model this\n\n2) Shorts have to cover in 1.8 days!!!\n\n\n- shorts are not options, they don't have an expiration date\n- shorts pay interest payments to the issuer, at an annualized rate, NOT a daily rate\n- this means, if the interest rate is 60% for a $300 share, the interest payment per day is only $0.50/day\n\n\n\n3) Short interest is indicator of time to squeeze!\n\n\n- no, short interest does not tell you the average price it was shorted at\n- those that shorted &lt; $50 likely had to cover early but they reentered short positions at the top\n- this means that the net short interest is the same, but the average short price increases from say $50 to $250\n- as long as they have buying opportunities below the current price, they can remain short\n\n\n\n4) The VW Squeeze!\n\n\n- completely different situation where 75% of the outstanding shares were unavailable \n- the squeeze wasn't triggered by retail, it was triggered by porshe's announcement\n- 77% of GME ownership is by institutions, they can also sell OTC to shorts\n\n\n\n5) All the Calls are ITM, Gamma Squeeze!\n\n\n- most of the calls were sold as covered calls by institutions like Blackrock Fidelity etc. that were going to make money regardless of what price they sold it at\n- even if some of the calls were uncovered, they likely delta hedged throughout the week, not wait until Friday afternoon to buy\n\n\n\n6) Melvin is still in!\n\n\n- Citadel and Point72 didn't hand over $2.75B so they can lose more money, they did it with an exit plan in mind\n- MMs don't look at trades emotionally, they have customers to appease\n- trade volume was far more than they needed to exit over a period of 5-7 days, they likely also shorted more on the way up",

Today I found out in the coming weeks us disposable workers are about to get a shit more work, responsibility and stress going forward. After layoffs, paycuts, tightening our builts, closing offices permanently and working from home permanently I get to experience more suffering.\n\nSo that brings me to GME and the hedgefunds. I like you jumped on this movement, because that's what it is at this point, and bought one GME share because I suck and don't have the nerves of you seasoned monkeys when it comes to stocks (rip my 4 TSLA shares circa 2017). I saw what hedgefunds were trying to do and how us normal people, gamers, boyfriends, degenerates could capitalize and actually win for once in this shitty rigged system that fucks us over every day from work wages to healthcare and taxes. I was amazed at how mainstream media said fuck me when I tried to make money and was calling for bullshit regulation and peddling silver because me a guy almost 30 who has done nothing but go to college to get a worthless price of paper following the 08 crash and be told just work hard and you'll get ahead. I've been exploited by shit jobs, government who doesn't give a shit about me (hey here's two measiy still checks to compensate for another 10 years of no wage growth) and now a fucking financial system so fucking rigged that even criminals like Pablo Escobar would in awe if he were alive. Robinhood suddenly locking out of my account that has been dormant for two year, fuck you Vlad by the way, hope you go to prison. Fidelity fuck the world.\n\nSo I'm holding my 1 share. I've debated on selling to cut my losses but who the fuck cares. If this destroys a hedgefund fucking good! If I have to hold until it's worth $5 I will.

Got it? Now to the post.\n\nThis is the sequel of my previous DD, if you read it just skip till the rockets. I know many of you retards are broke, so i include it here again anyways to let you save some data.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img i4hjpdkyfwh61...*\n\n# Zomedica Overview\n\nBased in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Zomedica (NYSE American:ZOM) is a veterinary health company creating products for companion animals (canine, feline and equine) by focusing on the unmet needs of clinical veterinarians. Zomedica\u2019s product portfolio will include **innovative** diagnostics and therapeutics that emphasize patient health and practice health. With a team that includes clinical veterinary professionals, it is Zomedica\u2019s mission to provide veterinarians the opportunity to lower costs, increase productivity, and grow revenue while better serving the animals in their care.\n\n\u00a0\n\n# Investors\n\nZomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. (US:ZOM) has 45 institutional owners and shareholders that have filed 13D/G or 13F forms with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). These institutions hold a total of **54,381,501 shares**. Largest shareholders include Cambridge Investment Research Advisors, Inc., **Vanguard Group Inc, VTSMX - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares, BlackRock Inc.**, Millennium Management Llc, FSMAX - Fidelity Extended Market Index Fund, Geode Capital Management, Llc, Citadel Advisors Llc, Northern Trust Corp, and Winton Capital Group Ltd.\n\n\u00a0\n\n# Team\n\nI checked their employees who are on LinkedIn, I can confirm they are all top notch workers. **Newly appointed CEO, Robert Cohen (former Pfizer exec) has taken three different biotech companies from $0.30 to $8.00/share.**\n\n\u00a0\n\n# What is Truforma\n\nZomedica's flagship product, TRUFORMA commercializes March 30th, 2021. TRUFORMA is a point-of-care machine that uses bulk acoustic waves (BAW) technology to detect &amp; diagnose adrenal diseases (in dogs) and thyroid diseases (in dogs and cats). This compact machine delivers results in \\~18 mins and carries 70+ global patents.  TRUFORMA does not require pre-market regulatory approval for use with companion animals in the United States. [Link](https://zomedica.com/truforma-2)\n\n\u00a0\n\n# Major competitor\n\nThe current competition is IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ: $IDXX). It's worth noting that vets currently have to send off samples to these guys and not only is it expensive, but it causes delays in diagnosis (days). TRUFORMA allows for the same tests to take place, on-site at a fraction of the price within 18 minutes. Key members of the IDEXX team have left the company to join Zomedica. [Link.](https://investors.zomedica.com/node/7636/html)\n\n\u00a0\n\n# News and upcoming catalysts\n\nZomedica had 2 fantastic weeks, it's price is rising since they announced truforma will be launched at the end of March.\n\n\u00a0 When the stock price was at almost $3 they announced a *BOUGHT DEAL* to rise 173.5 millions dollars at $1.90 per share. Surprisingly this happened just 2 days ago and the price already recovered and is now around $2.55 per share.\n\n\u00a0 Zomedica announced that the money will be used to speed up the research and launch of new products.\n\n\u00a0 As of today Zomedica is **DEBT FREE**\n\n\u00a0 The upcoming financial annual report that will be published at the end of this month, the announcement of a new big potential investor who bought the offered shares, and certain news about Truforma when close to launch could really trigger an unprecedented rise of this stock.\n\n\u00a0 By investing today you could easily have a share worth up to $8 on product launch, or even double digits when they'll be announcing new incoming products and patents. This is a stock that has common sudden bull runs and a community of retailers who are expecting to hold their shares for years.\n\n\u00a0 More technical data can be found at: [https://fintel.io/s/us/zom](https://fintel.io/s/us/zom)\n\nTldr: This company has no flaws, it's backed by huge investors, has no debt, a lot of cash reserve, and just made a machine that in 18 minutes could tell if your dog/cat is a paper hand or diamond hand \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sqi0lba4gwh61.png?width=1112&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e0a7bdaae49388f8be9f8d65e9189d0aa2b8b4f\n\n# Fucking Chapter II\n\nToday Zomedica announced the closing of the $173.5M bought deal; the money will be used to accelerate the development of their diagnostic equipment.\n\nIn the last DD i talked only about Truforma and many thought it\u2019s the only product Zomedica will be offering.... Hooooooold up, i have great news for you.\n\nTruforma on launch will be able to detect only a few diseases, but right now Zomedica disclosed it has more than 50 additional patents in the works, as u/Faraday27 said a myriad of new assays being formulated. If they manage to toss in cancer screenings and more basic rapid diagnostics such that the machine is a one-stop diagnostic shop, then they'll be an incredibly valuable company.\n\n Zomedica has added a new section to their website specifically for TRUFORMA called \"TRUFORMA Resource Center\" where they have added full documentation of their product, I read them and damn that machine may be able to tell if my girlfriend is a bitch (or is it me?) .\n\n  \n \n\n*Processing img f9e9cze6gwh61...*\n\nAs you can see Zomedica is just one of 8 products in the pipeline, their annual report is due in 10 days. This will give us a clear view of when to expect to see the new products. ZM-020 has a lot of potential right now, on Friday it came out that Zomedica filed a patent application for it, and apparently they hired the team that made the product in 2016 in the next image. Apparently testing this technology in a veterinary setting is the first step in bringing it to human use! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yrap5rxbgwh61.jpg?width=805&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=518dbca8d6b0a950b6cf234d38eccd67ae5df8e7\n\n*Processing img r44k2sxbgwh61...*\n\n \n\nThis weekend a news came out confirming that the Vanguard Group doubled it\u2019s position in Zomedica.\n\nSo right now these are the major institutional owners of Zomedica:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bm2dn3ujgwh61.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9446158b4a25da6a89924bc1ef3de6b24095567\n\n# The Experiment \n\nI\u2019ve seen an interesting post here on WSB showing a way to predict dips in stocks using short data, here\u2019s the result on $ZOM.

        "selftext": "**Should you buy Amazon stock or has it run out of growth opportunities? What is my price prediction for Amazon? Read until the end of the post as I reveal my price target for Amazon and why I believe it can deliver insane returns!**\n\n**\\~Warning! Very Very Long Post\\~**\n\n\\[Disclosure: I made this DD 2 weeks ago &amp; I wasn't part of this Subreddit until the last few days\\]\n\n\\[Wanted to post this before the next Amazon earnings later tonight!\\]\n\nHello everyone and welcome to another stock price prediction! Today we are going to talk about Amazon and what\u2019s the upside for the company! So, let\u2019s go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental, technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years &amp; months.\n\nSo, let\u2019s start by talking a little about [Amazon](https://ibb.co/47vPnY2), yeah, I know it\u2019s one of the biggest companies in the world, but I believe Amazon is still undervalued &amp; underappreciated compared to some of the highflyers that have generate insane returns in the past months, though most of them are still far from profitability and don\u2019t have the growth across all the board like Amazon.\n\nMaybe the market doesn't put as much attention in the numbers as I do but I would rather invest in a business which I consider to be healthy and growing rather than a what if stock like many of the recent inflated IPOs. Amazon is a trillion-dollar company growing at a double-digit pace as many companies that are a fraction of their size would kill for this numbers, but this hasn\u2019t helped Amazon since September.\n\nOn a global scale e-commerce is expected to increase from 16% to 22% of retail sales by 2023. With the U.S. expected to increase its retail e-commerce sales from $374 billion to $476 billion by 2024.This is another thing that supports the growth that e-commerce has in front of it, both as total and as a % of the total retail sales. With the latest [report](https://ibb.co/jRMvB7x) showing a 24% increase in holiday e-commerce transactions and a 19% increase for the 2020 fiscal year.\n\nE-commerce is showing signs that it will continue to gain share of the total market as a recent report projects that digital sales during the Black Friday-to-Cyber Monday period will grow by about 35% YOY, reaching [penetration](https://ibb.co/3StWbwz) of around 32% and growing by more 10B, as this continues to eat up market share from more traditional B&amp;M retailers.\n\nI think one of the biggest problems the company has, it\u2019s the actual share price of the company, not the value. We have seen that a stock split can and will attract more buyers and the share price would probably see an accelerated rate of growth, just look at what happened with Tesla and Apple [recently](https://ibb.co/GFqGsjV). By splitting the stock just like [Apple](https://ibb.co/d766wL5) has done a number of times, this allows more individual investors to invest in the company, as they will be attracted by the cheaper share price. [Amazon](https://ibb.co/XStd5Jf) hasn\u2019t done a share split since the dot com era, and it might be time for the company to take advantage of this hot bull market to actually go ahead with something like at least a 5-10:1 split.\n\nSo, let\u2019s go a little through the latest quarter [results](https://ibb.co/Y8JHWdc) and [guidance](https://ibb.co/mCT3T43). The company increased the operating cash flow by more than 55% to over $55B for the latest twelve months, with free cash flow also increasing by $6B, while they managed to avoid significant [dilution](https://ibb.co/6bYCLhx) of the company, with only 7M additional shares being outstanding.\n\nThe net sales also increased 37% in the last quarter to just over $96B, an increase of more than $26B over 2019, which is an insane 36% increase y/y yet again.\n\nThis year Amazon has also pushed their [Prime Day](https://ibb.co/1RPqhMv) ahead of schedule, which resulted in the two biggest days ever for third-party small &amp; medium sellers, which saw an increase in sales of over 60% over 2019, even bigger than Amazon own retail business.\n\nAmazon continues to expand into multiple revenue streams, with the first Amazon [Fresh](https://ibb.co/9ZBqwKM) grocery store opened in California, which is offering both in-store and online products.\n\nWe also saw Amazon\u2019s more profitable revenue streams meaning the services revenues increasing, with Amazon Studios continuing to produce original movies and TV-series while also expanding their offering to live sport games.\n\nThe company is also seeking to expand into the red-hot Video Gaming market, as they launched a new service Prime Gaming, available for free for Prime Members and also announced Luna which will be a cloud gaming service that will allow customers to play high-quality games on previously owned devices, thus not requiring bigger investments for many customers. They also continued to improve their [devices](https://ibb.co/VVkyDXX) like the Echo, Alexa, Ring and FireTV line of products, which feature more &amp; more AI Improvements.\n\nAmazon has also announced an expansion into the pharmacy business which put a lot of pressure on traditional pharmacy companies like CVS &amp; Walgreens, while also announcing a new Halo service, aimed at helping customers improve their lifestyle.\n\nI like companies that make me a lot of money, but I also like that they are [involved](https://ibb.co/r7C6NXs) in projects aimed at helping poorer communities around the world, with their latest Project Kuiper, being a low-earth orbit satellite constellation that is aiming to provide reliable &amp; cheap internet access around the world.\n\nAnd last but not least, let\u2019s not forget about the biggest income provider as margin goes, the Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://ibb.co/MkHgG7d)). Amazon continued to see significant customer demand for this product with multiple big companies like Global Payments &amp; Moderna using their services. Alongside these 2 companies we also saw AWS providing even more data services for the [NFL](https://ibb.co/zbYySCp) and many more other companies. AWS has been a terrific revenue stream for Amazon, with [AWS](https://ibb.co/87614m9) having 1/3 of the market share for cloud infrastructure in the first half of 2020, as the compound annual growth of AWS has been 40% in the recent years, just below the other profitable [services](https://ibb.co/0Byn2R7) they offer on subscriptions services, advertising &amp; payments, with the only revenue stream seeing a negative growth being the physical stores.\n\nOverall, the company has seen a 28% compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/mCwDCTb) in revenues since 2016 and an even bigger 68% [growth](https://ibb.co/jk57Qq9) in earnings/share, which is incredible to say the least.\n\nSo, before even starting, you should now that I am bull on Amazon but I am willing to hear other opinions so don\u2019t be afraid to leave a comment down below!\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nFirstly, let\u2019s start with the Guidance that Amazon gave us for the 4th quarter, as they are expecting net sales between $112B and $121B implying a growth of between 28-38% over 2019. They also provided guidance for the operating income but this is heavily impacted by the problems we had in 2020 and that still continue to be around.\n\nThe company also is aiming to [optimize](https://ibb.co/0ZTfncc) the free cash flow which was up 26% y/y for Q3, as they are trying to dilute the shares as little as possible. The total net [SALES](https://ibb.co/7jsRCN5) for the last twelve months is nearing $348B which even adjusted for forex is still up 31%. Amazon has only 12% of their revenues coming the AWS right now, but this is by far the most profitable revenue for the company, as the increases in AWS sales have led to an over 90% [increase](https://ibb.co/ts6VKrb) in operating income from the previous year.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the last quarter\u2019s results. We saw a big [INCREASE](https://ibb.co/qrpk3wR) in all 3 big revenue streams for Amazon, with the first 9 months of 2020 brining over $160B in sales in North America, $67B from International sales and almost $33B from AWS. For my [projections](https://ibb.co/4FCPJ8N) I actually just added another quarter like this one to the end results, which actually is a conservative estimate of $96B compared to the guidance of $112B, and the growth rate that Amazon\u2019s net sales has seen in the past year, with North America Sales rising by 37%, International by 31% and AWS by 30%.\n\nFor the cost of sales, I did pretty much the same, and with cost [margin](https://ibb.co/wcP1Wrj) standing at 75% of net sales for the last quarters I think this is pretty safe to say it will remain mostly the same if not even improve due to bigger revenues from the AWS. I also estimated the full yearly costs by adding another identical quarter, just like for the revenues, so that things stay even.\n\nFor the other operating expenses, I also took this from their financials as I expect both [SG&amp;A](https://ibb.co/QN7YWxQ) and [R&amp;D](https://ibb.co/DwmXmsK) expenses to start to normalize a little after the huge spending to ramp up capacity this year due to the increase in demand, while I also did the same thing for the [Capex](https://ibb.co/f0dSK7B) spending of Amazon, as they have invested massively in the last 12 months to ramp up things.\n\nMeanwhile for the interest [income](https://ibb.co/rdc1HRZ) and expenses I also just averaged things out for the full year while maintaining the other sources of income, but these have such a small impact that they don\u2019t even matter.\n\nAmazon has had a pretty wild effective [TAX RATE](https://ibb.co/N3vtKJn) in the past decade, but I decided to see what the avg was for the last 4years, and that was 16%, but for safety and due to the change in administration in the US I decided to bump this up a little to 18%.\n\nAnd one last number that is important is [THE](https://ibb.co/SnQGLXT) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which has seen a 36% increase y/y for since 2016.\n\nI like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings. So, let\u2019s take a look at what Amazon earnings/share will be by 2025.\n\nI implied for the 3 main streams of [revenues](https://ibb.co/KVnYyqC) which are North American Sales, International Sales and AWS sales a rate of growth similar to the one we had this year but with gradual declines each subsequent year. I also used pretty much the same average [cost of sales](https://ibb.co/3sv40Sf) which includes the actual cost of sales and the fulfillment costs. This has stood at about 75% of the net revenues for the past years and might actually improve, but I do want to stay on the safe side. So, by 2025 the gross [REVENUES](https://ibb.co/xSdQX9P) should reach around $244B, assuming margins stay pretty much in line, though it\u2019s likely they will improve margins, with International sales becoming a little more profitable and AWS brining more &amp; more money.\n\nWe also have to estimated what the Capex &amp; Operating [expenses](https://ibb.co/HHM0PfS) would be by 2025. I think Amazon should see somewhat of a slowdown of Capex, R&amp;D &amp; SG&amp;A spending, as they have seen a huge boost in the past year, and I think it should normalize, so I will imply an 8% annual growth for these, which is still very high.\n\n[Next](https://ibb.co/F75r4jN), we look at the interest income, expense and other losses or incomes for the company. This numbers are small compared to the vast cash flows of the company that they can even be ignored, but let\u2019s assume they see a 10% decrease both in income and expenses related to interest while also not suffering losses but having a smaller other income by 10%/year. This would results in an almost $114B income pre-tax for 2025.\n\nAs I showed you earlier, the effective tax rate for Amazon has been around 16% in the past 4 years, despite the nominal US tax rate. For safety reasons I will use an 18% tax rate, though this should stay closers to 16% on the back of the International taxes. So, with an 18% tax rate, the [FINAL](https://ibb.co/d7ZCstY) income for the company after everything has been taken into consideration should be $93.25B.\n\nFor the outstanding [shares](https://ibb.co/x33HyxP), I will be conservative and imply a .5% increase in outstanding shares, as the company has been very careful in avoiding the dilution of the stock. So, with that increase by 2025, we should have around 531M shares.\n\nSo, [BASED](https://ibb.co/282sK42) on Price to Future Earnings/share we can see Amazon is currently trading at almost 18 times 2025 earnings/share, which compared to the 90 multiple it\u2019s trading right now would be insanely low. I can see Amazon continuing to trade at very high P/E for the foreseeable future. So, with a 25 PE price the company should trade at 4400$, while with a 50 PE ratio, the stock should be close to 9000$/share, which is insane when you think about that number, but maybe Bezos will listen and split the shares finally.\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/2d2KPV4) are my actual price targets\u2026 I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Amazon trade at is $4828 which would imply a return of over 54%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Amazon will trade at 6145$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 96.5% return on the [current price](https://ibb.co/FwrMhnY). My most bullish case though is $7900, which would imply a return of 152%, with that number being mind-blowing given the current valuation of the company\u2026 but I guess we do have to start getting used with such high numbers\u2026 I guess decades ago when we saw the first millionaire or billionaire, people would have also thought that it was crazy\u2026 but crazy is for the limited minds only I believe.\n\nSo yeah guys, here is my [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/XF5h87q) price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 40 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 40-50.\n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_rAl569qptpB1n1k6hpLLdOroX045_JDHrXLj81-u0/edit) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for Amazon by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nKeep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Amazon has in the past. The company has increased in [value](https://ibb.co/QpDg4mp) by more 450% in just the past 5 years and is over 160.000% up since it started [trading](https://ibb.co/KyDzqWq). So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against one of the biggest and fastest growing companies in the world?\n\nThe company also has pristine [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/Bgxf91m), with more than $112B in current assets vs only $102B in current liabilities, with over $282B in total assets. So, the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts. We can see that the analysts expect a similar [EPS](https://ibb.co/R48nrDF) by 2025, of around $166 compared to $171/shares that my Growth Valuations are projecting. So, it seems that this could be a very reasonable upside for the company.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Amazon?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/kHwWq4x), so starting with the high the stock made before the September sell-off. The stock has been trading in this wedge formation for the last couple of months with increasingly higher lows. The stock isn\u2019t overbought and hasn\u2019t been since it saw an RSI of 73 when it reached the all-time highs. I think with this wedge formation building up, with increasing higher lows and with the pattern of trading likely being an Elliot Theory 5 [WAVE](https://ibb.co/MBqPyc2) formation, I think it\u2019s very likely we see a breakout in the near future, maybe just before earnings, and I expect this breakout to mimic the last run the stock had of about 23% up. So, with that 23% increase mirrored that would result the stock should peak around $[3900](https://ibb.co/VBpRv6j), which I expect to see by the end of the year.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 47 [analysts](https://ibb.co/YT0BPTP) on wall street are saying. They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of $3800 and a high price target of $4600 which is insane for a return in the next 12 months, as 46 of the 47 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Amazon. So yet again, the $3900 isn\u2019t that out of possibilities even as Wall Street\u2019s analysts expect\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own Amazon stock and I believe it still has tremendous room to grow, so I would start building a position as I expect the company to resume its uptrend sooner rather than later and the next catalyst may be just a couple of weeks away with the last quarter [earnings](https://ibb.co/nLhCJpk) expected to be announced early in February.\n\nAnd I shouldn\u2019t forget to mention that I believe Amazon is one of the most stable stocks out with very good [leadership](https://ibb.co/7KS3yS6), and with large institutional [holders](https://ibb.co/8Dj1W3C) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Morgan Stanley owning huge amounts of the company.\n\nSo, [THIS](https://ibb.co/2d2KPV4) are my projections and my expectations for the company, and if you do want to check out the spreadsheets you can find the link [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_rAl569qptpB1n1k6hpLLdOroX045_JDHrXLj81-u0/)\n\nThank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!
