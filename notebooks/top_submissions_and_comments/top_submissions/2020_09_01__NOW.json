        "selftext": "*edit: thanks for the awards. I'd be a dick to take credit. Go check out the one-man-band who actually wrote it---I've been reading for a couple months, good stuff*   [*https://bestinterest.blog/explain-the-big-short/*](https://bestinterest.blog/explain-the-big-short/)\n\n(Best Interest) This post will **explain the Big Short and the 2008 subprime mortgage collapse in simple terms.**\n\nThis post is a little longer than usual\u2013maybe give yourself 20 minutes to sift through it. But I promise you\u2019ll leave feeling like you can tranche (that\u2019s a verb, right?!) the whole financial system!\n\n**Key Players**\n\nFirst, I want to introduce the players in the financial crisis, as they might not make sense at first blush. One of the worst parts about the financial industry is how they use deliberately obtuse language to explain relatively simple ideas. Their financial acronyms are hard to keep track of. In order to explain the Big Short, these players\u2013and their roles\u2013are key.\n\n**Individuals**, a.k.a. regular people who take out mortgages to buy houses; for example, you and me!\n\n**Mortgage lenders**, like a local bank or a mortgage lending specialty shop, who give out mortgages to individuals. Either way, they\u2019re probably local people that the individual home-buyer would meet in person.\n\n**Big** **banks**, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who buy lots of mortgages from lenders. After this transaction, the homeowner would owe money to the big bank instead of the lender.\n\n**Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)**\u2014deep breath!\u2014who take mortgages from big banks and bundle them all together into a bond (see below). And just like before, this step means that the home-buyer now owes money to the CDO. Why is this done?! I\u2019ll explain, I promise.\n\n**Ratings agencies**, whose job is to determine the risk of a CDO\u2014is it filled with safe mortgages, or risky mortgages?\n\n**Investors**, who buy part of a CDO and get repaid as the individual homeowners start paying back their mortgage.\n\nFeel lost already? I\u2019m going to be a good jungle guide and get you through this. Stick with me.\n\n**Quick definition: Bonds**\n\nA **bond** can be thought of as a loan. When you buy a bond, you are *loaning* your money. The issuer of the bond is *borrowing* your money. In exchange for borrowing your money, the issuer promises to pay you back, plus interest, in a certain amount of time. Sometimes, the borrower cannot pay the investor back, and the bond *defaults,* or fails. Defaults are not good for the investor.\n\nThe CDO\u2014which is a bond\u2014could hold thousands of mortgages in it. It\u2019s a mortgage-backed bond, and therefore a type of mortgage-backed security. If you bought 1% of a CDO, you were *loaning* money equivalent to 1% of all the mortgage principal, with the hope of collecting 1% of the principal *plus interest* as the mortgages got repaid.\n\nThere\u2019s one more key player, but I\u2019ll wait to introduce it. First\u2026\n\n**The Whys**, Explained\n\n**Why does an individual take out a mortgage?** Because they want a home. Can you blame them?! A healthy housing market involves people buying and selling houses.\n\n**How about the lender; why do they lend?** It *used* to be so they would slowly make interest money as the mortgage got repaid. But nowadays, the lender takes a fee (from the homeowner) for creating (or *originating*) the mortgage, and then immediately sells to mortgage to\u2026\n\n**A big bank. Why do they buy mortgages from lenders?** Starting in the 1970s, Wall St. started buying up groups of loans, tying them all together into one bond\u2014the CDO\u2014and selling slices of that collection to investors. When people buy and sell those slices, the big banks get a cut of the action\u2014a commission.\n\n**Why would an investor want a slice of a mortgage CDO?** Because, like any other investment, the big banks promised that the investor would make their money back *plus interest* once the homeowners began repaying their mortgages.\n\nYou can almost trace the flow of money and risk from player to player.\n\nAt the end of the day, the investor needs to get repaid, and that money comes from homeowners.\n\n**CDOs are empty buckets**\n\nHomeowners and mortgage lenders are easy to understand. But a big question mark swirls around Wall Street\u2019s CDOs.\n\nI like to think of the CDO as a football field full of empty buckets\u2014one bucket per mortgage. As an investor, you don\u2019t purchase one single bucket, or one mortgage. Instead, you purchase a thin horizontal slice across all the buckets\u2014say, a half-inch slice right around the 1-gallon mark.\n\nAs the mortgages are repaid, it starts raining. The repayments\u2014or rain\u2014from **Mortgage A** doesn\u2019t go solely into **Bucket A**, but rather is distributed across all the buckets, and all the buckets slowly get re-filled.\n\nAs long as your horizontal slice of the bucket is eventually surpassed, you get your money back plus interest. You don\u2019t need *every* mortgage to be repaid. You just need *enough* mortgages to get to your slice.\n\nIt makes sense, then, that the tippy top of the bucket\u2014which gets filled up last\u2014is the highest risk. If too many of the mortgages in the CDO fail and aren\u2019t repaid, then the tippy top of the bucket will never get filled up, and those investors won\u2019t get their money back.\n\nThese horizontal slices are called ***tranches***, which might sound familiar if you\u2019ve read the book or watched the movie.\n\nSo far, there\u2019s nothing too wrong about this practice. It\u2019s simply moving the risk from the mortgage lender to other investors. Sure, the middle-men (banks, lenders, CDOs) are all taking a cut out of all the buy and sell transactions. But that\u2019s no different than buying lettuce at grocery store prices vs. buying straight from the farmer. Middle-men take a cut. It happens.\n\nBut now, our final player enters the stage\u2026\n\n**Credit Default Swaps: The Lynchpin of the Big Short**\n\nScrew you, Wall Street nomenclature! A **credit default swap** sounds complicated, but it\u2019s just **insurance**. Very simple, but they have a key role to explain the Big Short.\n\nInvestors thought, \u201cWell, since I\u2019m buying this **risky** tranche of a CDO, I might want to hedge my bets a bit and buy **insurance** in case it fails.\u201d That\u2019s what a credit default swap did. It\u2019s insurance against something failing. But, there is a **vital** difference between a credit default swap and normal insurance.\n\nI can\u2019t buy an insurance policy on *your* house, on *your* car, or on *your* life. Only *you* can buy those policies. But, I could buy insurance on a CDO mortgage bond, *even if I didn\u2019t own that bond!*\n\nNot only that, but I could buy **billions** of dollars of insurance on a CDO that only contained **millions** of dollars of mortgages.\n\nIt\u2019s like taking out a $1 million auto policy on a Honda Civic. No insurance company would allow you to do this, but it was happening all over Wall Street before 2008. This scenario essentially *is* \u201cthe big short\u201d (see below)\u2014making huge insurance bets that CDOs will fail\u2014and many of the big banks were on the wrong side of this bet!\n\nCredit default swaps involved the largest amounts of money in the subprime mortgage crisis. This is where the big Wall Street bets were taking place.\n\nQuick definition: Short\n\nA short is a bet that something will fail, get worse, or go down. When most people invest, they buy **long** (\u201cI want this stock price to go up!\u201d). A **short** is the opposite of that.\n\nCertain individuals\u2014like main characters Steve Eisman (aka Mark Baum in the movie, played by Steve Carrell) and Michael Burry (played by Christian Bale) in the 2015 Oscar-nominated film **The Big Short**\u2014realized that tons of mortgages were being made to people who would never be able to pay them back.\n\nIf enough mortgages failed, then tranches of CDOs start to fail\u2014no mortgage repayment means no rain, and no rain means the buckets stay empty. If CDOs fail, then the credit default swap insurance gets paid out. So what to do? ***Buy credit default swaps!*** That\u2019s the quick and dirty way to explain the Big Short.\n\n**Why buy Dog Shit?**\n\nWait a second. Why did people originally invest in these CDO bonds if they were full of \u201cdog shit mortgages\u201d (direct quote from the book) in the first place? Since **The Big Short** protagonists knew what was happening, shouldn\u2019t the investors also have realized that the buckets would never get refilled?\n\nFor one, the *prospectus*\u2014a fancy word for \u201cowner\u2019s manual\u201d\u2014of a CDO was very difficult to parse through. It was hard to understand exactly which mortgages were in the CDO. *This is a skeevy big bank/CDO practice*. And even if you knew which mortgages were in a CDO, it was nearly impossible to realize that many of those mortgages were made *fraudulently*.\n\n**The mortgage lenders were knowingly creating bad mortgages**\\*.\\* They were giving loans to people with no hopes of repaying them. Why? Because the lenders knew they could immediately sell that mortgage\u2014that *risk*\u2014to a big bank, which would then *securitize* the mortgage into a CDO, and then sell that CDO to investors. Any risk that the lender took by creating a bad mortgage was quickly transferred to the investor.\n\nSo\u2026because you can\u2019t decipher the prospectus to tell which mortgages are in a CDO, it was easier to rely on the CDO\u2019s **rating** than to evaluate each of the underlying mortgages. It\u2019s the same reason why you don\u2019t have to understand how engines work when you buy a car; you just look at Car &amp; Driver or Consumer Reports for their opinions, their ratings.\n\n**The Ratings Agencies**\n\nInvestors often relied on ratings to determine which bonds to buy. The two most well-known ratings agencies from 2008 were Moody\u2019s and Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s (heard of the **S&amp;P** 500?). The ratings agency\u2019s job was to look at a CDO that a big bank created, understand the underlying assets (in this case, the mortgages), and give the CDO a rating to determine how safe it was. A good rating is \u201cAAA\u201d\u2014so nice, it got \u2018A\u2019 thrice.\n\nSo, were the ratings agencies doing their jobs? **No!** There are a few explanations for this:\n\n1. Even they\u2014the experts in charge of grading the bonds\u2014didn\u2019t understand what was going on inside a CDO. The owner\u2019s manual descriptions (prospectuses) were too complicated. In fact, ratings agencies often *relied on big banks to teach seminars* about how to rate CDOs, which is like a teacher learning how to grade tests from Timmy, who still pees his pants. *Timmy just wants an A*.\n2. Ratings agencies are profit-driven companies. When they give a rating, they charge a fee. But if the agency hands out too many bad grades, then their customers\u2014the big banks\u2014will take their requests elsewhere in hopes of higher grades. The ratings agencies weren\u2019t *objective*, but instead were biased by their need for profits.\n3. Remember those fraudulent mortgages that the lenders were making? Unless you did some boots-on-the-ground research, it was tough to uncover this fact. It\u2019s hard to blame the ratings agencies for not catching this.\n\n**Who\u2019s to blame?**\n\nEveryone? Let\u2019s play devil\u2019s advocate\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Individuals**: some people      point the finger at homeowners, saying, \u201cYou should know better than to      buy a $1 million house on a teacher\u2019s salary.\u201d I find this hard to      swallow. These people, surrounded by the American home-ownership dream,      were sold the idea that they would be fine. The mortgage lender had no      incentive to sell a *good* mortgage, they only had an      incentive to sell *a* mortgage. So, it\u2019s hard for me to put      too much blame on the homeowners.\n* **Mortgage      lenders**: *someone* knew.      I\u2019m not saying that all the mortgage lenders were fully aware of the      implications of their actions, but some people knew that fraudulent loans      were being made, and chose to ignore that fact. For example, check      out [whistleblower Eileen Foster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileen_Foster).\n* **Big      banks**:      Yes sir! There\u2019s certainly blame here. Rather than get into all of the      various money-grubbing, I want to call out one specific anecdote. Back in      2010, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein testified in front of Congress.      Here it is:\n\nTo explain further, there are two things going on here.\n\nFirst, Goldman Sachs bankers were selling CDOs to investors. They wanted to make a commission on the sale.\n\nAt the same time, other bankers **ALSO AT GOLDMAN SACHS** were buying credit default swaps, a.k.a. betting *against* the same CDOs that the first Goldman Sachs bankers were selling.\n\nThis is like selling someone a racehorse with cancer, and then immediately going to the track to bet against that horse. Blankfein\u2019s defense in this video is, \u201cBut the horse seller and the bettor weren\u2019t the same people!\u201d And the Congressmen responds, \u201cBut they worked for the same stable, and collected the same paychecks!\u201d\n\nSo do the big banks deserve blame? You tell me.\n\n**Inspecting Goldman Sachs**\n\nOne reason Goldman Sachs survived 2008 is that they began buying credit default swaps (insurance) *just* in time before the housing market crashed. They were still on the bad side of some bets, but mostly on the good side. They were net profitable.\n\nUnfortunately for them, the banks that owed Goldman money were going bankrupt from their *own* debt, and then Goldman never would have been able to collect on their insurance. Goldman would\u2019ve had to payout on their \u201cbad\u201d bets, while not collecting on their \u201cgood\u201d bets. In their own words, they were [\u201ctoast.\u201d](https://bettermarkets.com/newsroom/email-shows-goldman-admitted-it-was-toast)\n\nThis is significant. Even banks in \u201cgood\u201d positions would\u2019ve gone bankrupt, because the people who owed the most money weren\u2019t able to repay all their debts. Imagine a chain; Bank A owes money to Bank B, and B owes money to Bank C. If Bank A fails, then B can\u2019t collect their debt, and B can\u2019t pay C. Bank C made \u201cgood\u201d bets, but aren\u2019t able to collect on them, and then they go out of business.\n\nThese failures would\u2019ve rippled throughout the world. This explains why the US government felt it necessary to bail-out the banks. That federal money allowed banks in \u201cgood\u201d positions to collect their profits and \u201cstop the ripple\u201d from tearing apart the world economy. While CDOs and credit default swap explain the Big Short starting, this ripple of failure is the mechanism that affected the entire world.\n\nBetting more than you have\n\nBut if someone made a bad bet\u2014sold bad insurance\u2014why didn\u2019t they have money to cover that bet? It all depends on [risk](https://bestinterest.blog/2019/10/18/risk-posture/). If you sell a $100 million insurance policy, and you think there\u2019s a 1% chance of paying out that policy, what\u2019s your exposure? It\u2019s the potential loss multiplied by the probability = 1% times $100 million, or $1 million.\n\nThese banks sold billions of dollars of insurance under the assumption that there was a  5%, or 3%, or 1% chance of the housing market failing. So they had 20x, or 30x, or 100x **less** money on hand then they needed to cover these bets.\n\nTurns out, there was a 100% chance that the market would fail\u2026**oops!**\n\nBlame, expounded\n\n**Ratings agencies**\u2014they should be unbiased. But they sold themselves off for profit. They invited the wolves\u2014big banks\u2014into their homes to teach them how to grade CDOs. Maybe they should read a blog to explain the Big Short to them. Of course they deserve blame. Here\u2019s another anecdote of terrible judgment from the ratings agencies:\n\nThink back to my analogy of the buckets and the rain. Sometimes, a ratings agency would look at a CDO and say, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to fill up these buckets all the way. Those final tranches\u2014the ones that won\u2019t get filled\u2014they\u2019re **really** risky. So we\u2019re going to give them a bad grade.\u201d  There were \u201cDog Shit\u201d tranches, and Dog Shit gets a bad grade.\n\nBut then the CDO managers would go back to their offices and cut off the top of the buckets. And they\u2019d do this for all their CDOs\u2014cutting off all the bucket-top rings from all the different CDO buckets. And then they\u2019d super-glue the bucket-top rings together to create a field full of Frankenstein buckets, officially called a **CDO squared**. Because the Frankenstein buckets were originally part of other CDOs, the Frankenstein buckets could only start filling up once the original buckets (which now had the tops cut off) were filled. In other words, the CDO managers decided to concentrate all their Dog Shit in one place, and super glue it together.\n\nA reasonable person would look at the Frankenstein Dog Shit field of buckets and say, \u201cThat\u2019s turrible, Kenny.\u201d\n\n**BUT THE RATINGS AGENCIES GAVE CDO-SQUAREDs HIGH GRADES!!!** Oh I\u2019m sorry, *was I yelling?!*\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s *diversified*,\u201d they would claim, as if Poodle shit mixed with Labrador shit is better than pure Poodle shit.\n\nAgain, you tell me. Do the ratings agencies deserve blame?!\n\nDoes the government deserve blame?\n\nYes and no.\n\nFor example, part of the **Housing and Community Development Act of 1992** mandated that the government mortgage finance firms (Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) purchase a certain number of sub-prime mortgages.\n\nOn its surface, this seems like a good thing: it\u2019s giving money to potential home-buyers who wouldn\u2019t otherwise qualify for a mortgage. It\u2019s providing the American Dream.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve already covered today, it does nobody any good to provide a bad mortgage to someone who can\u2019t repay it. That\u2019s what caused this whole calamity. Freddie and Fannie and HUD were pumping money into the machine, helping to enable it. Good intentions, but they weren\u2019t paying attention to the unintended outcomes.\n\nAnd what about the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC), the watchdogs of Wall Street. Do they have a role to explain the Big Short? Shouldn\u2019t they have been aware of the Big Banks, the CDOs, the ratings agencies?\n\nYes, they deserve blame too. They\u2019re supposed to do things like ensure that Big Banks have enough money on hand to cover their risky bets. This is called proper \u201crisk management,\u201d and it was *severely* lacking. The SEC also had the power to dig into the CDOs and ferret out the fraudulent mortgages that were creating them. Why didn\u2019t they do that?\n\nPerhaps the issue is that the SEC was/is simply too close to Wall Street, similar to the ratings agencies getting advice from the big banks. Watchdogs shouldn\u2019t get treats from those they\u2019re watching. Or maybe it\u2019s that the CDOs and credit default swaps were too hard for the SEC to understand.\n\nEither way, the SEC doesn\u2019t have a good excuse. If you\u2019re in bed with the people you\u2019re regulating, then you\u2019re doing a bad job. If you\u2019re rubber stamping things you don\u2019t understand, then you\u2019re doing a bad job.\n\n**Explain the Big Short**, shortly\n\nYou\u2019re about 2500 words into my \u201cshort summary.\u201d But the important things to remember:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Financial      acronyms suck.\n* Money      flowed from the investors down to the mortgage lenders, and the risk      flowed from the mortgage lenders up to the investors. In between, the big      banks and CDOs acted as middle men and intermediaries.\n* When      someone feels like their actions have no risk, or no consequences, they\u2019ll      behave poorly (big banks, mortgage lenders)When someone is given what seems like an amazing deal, they\u2019ll take it      (individual home owners).\n* CDOs      are like empty buckets. Mortgage payments are like rain, filling the      buckets. Investors buy tranches, or slices, across all the buckets. If      mortgages fail, then the buckets might not fill up, and the investors      won\u2019t get their money back.\n* CDOs      are intentionally complex. So complex, that not even the people grading      them understood what was going on (ratings agencies).\n* Buying      insurance on something your do not own is a behavior with potential for      abuse (big banks)\n* Buying      insurance on something for more than it\u2019s worth is a behavior with      potential for abuse (big banks). This is where most of the money in the      financial crisis switched hands.\n\nAnd with that, I\u2019d like to announce the opening of the Best Interest CDO. Rather than invest in mortgages, I\u2019ll be investing in race horses. Don\u2019t ask my why, but the current top stallion is named \u2018Dog Shit.\u2019 He\u2019ll take Wall Street by storm.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind my cussing but you do like this content, consider [**subscribing to the email list**](https://bestinterest.blog/subscribe/) to get these articles (and nothing more) sent to your inbox every week.\n\nI hope this post helped if you were looking for someone to explain the Big Short.

Tomorrow, the stock is no longer on limit down rule, meaning free fall down a hill, off a cliff, into the mariana trench.\n\nThis is for the special retards of WSB out there, exit your calls and sell your shares of this company, it's fucked. This stock is rolling down to delisted like it's shitty fake truck and you are dumb and in denial if you don't realise that.\n\nLet's look at the evidence.\n\nToday Hindenburg released a reply to NKLA rebuttal: [https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola-response/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola-response/) Please, just read this before you even reply. Anyone with any critical thinking skills can clearly see that this scam got caught with it's pants down at a child daycare.

GM is robbing this company of it's EV subsidy (First 200k cars sold), GM gets 11% of NKLA, GM gets 700 million from NKLA (lol how the fuck is NKLA gonna pay GM 700million) with no drawbacks. The only thing NKLA contributes to GM here is their brand name (marketting), that's literally it. If either the SEC or DoJ finds anything that they can use to bury NKLA, which they definitely will, GM is going to pull out of the deal. Remember, they have until 30th Dec to pull out, and I bet the board are talking about it and weighing up their options. If any of the other collaborations pull out, that would be a catalyst for others. This argument that GM is defending NKLA makes no sense. If they didn't defend NKLA, GM stock would collapse and CEO fired. GM has no downsides to defending NKLA at all, and gains so much from this deal.\n\nNow, lets value this stock. It's worth $13billion which is almost 1/3 GM. So what are we getting for 13 billion?\n\nA factory? No, it's dirt field that hasn't even gotten permits for construction.\n\nExclusive tech?

        "selftext": "(Bloomberg) -- Nikola Corp. has left a trail of inconsistent statements and contradictory announcements that are now coming under scrutiny from short-sellers eager to poke holes in the electric-vehicle company\u2019s success story.\n\nHindenburg Research, which holds a short position in Nikola stock and stands to gain if the shares fall, released a report Thursday detailing what it called \u201cdozens of lies\u201d about the company\u2019s capabilities, partnerships or products. The firm used internal emails, analyzed photos and even cited an investigator dispatched to rural Utah to test how far a car would roll down a hill. Nikola said Hindenburg\u2019s report was full of falsehoods but hasn\u2019t offered anything specific to rebut the allegations.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a hedge fund or a private eye to determine that Nikola, which struck a partnership this week with General Motors Co., has a pattern of discrepancies. A look at some of its announcements and filings, along with statements and tweets by Chairman Trevor Milton and other executives over the past few years, yields other examples that weren\u2019t part of Hindenburg\u2019s report. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit confusing trying to follow Trevor on his various social media outlets about the timing and cadence of communication of the different variables that you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Jeff Osborne, a Cowen &amp; Co. analyst, told executives on an Aug. 4 conference call.\n\nNikola\u2019s shares have tumbled 24% since the Hindenburg report, which, among other sources, cited a Bloomberg story from June about the company exaggerating the capabilities of a truck.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to doing our best to keep the investing public and all of our stakeholders informed and up to date at all times,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mark Russell said Friday in an emailed response to questions from Bloomberg about the following items.\n\nUnder Construction\n\nAt a press event on July 22, ahead of the groundbreaking of Nikola\u2019s Coolidge, Arizona, factory, Head of Global Manufacturing Mark Duchesne fielded a question on when construction would get underway. \u201cThat one is an easy answer,\u201d he said. \u201cStart of construction is tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe timeline was repeated by Milton the following day in a tweet. But \u201cconstruction\u201d turns out to be a broad term.\n\nTo facilitate the groundbreaking ceremony, the city of Coolidge issued Nikola a temporary use permit on July 13. The document, obtained by Bloomberg, allowed the company to do some limited ground clearing and preparation for holding the event, along with listing a plan for coronavirus safeguards. It didn\u2019t allow further construction to start beyond that. The company also obtained a Pinal County dust permit around the same time, a legal requirement in Arizona.\n\nOn Aug. 7, the company received its at-risk grading and drainage permit, City Manager Rick Miller said by phone. The permit allows Nikola to clear dirt and do drainage work on the site, but as yet the company doesn\u2019t have the permits required for foundation work, plumbing, electrical or vertical construction, Miller said. The permits are available through public-records requests.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nikola said in a tweet that Coolidge\u2019s city council had approved the company\u2019s \u201cfactory masterplan\u201d and that \u201cconstruction can now go forward.\u201d This is only partly true, Miller said. It was the planning and zoning commission that approved a \u201cmajor site plan.\u201d The approval will allow Nikola and its architects and engineers to apply for the next batch of permits.\n\nIn a statement, Nikola said that by \u201cconstruction\u201d it meant everything from groundbreaking to seeking permits. Now that its building plan is approved, \u201cthe various permits will be obtained in cadence with the steps of the construction. We remain on schedule for Phase 1,\u201d the company said in an email.\n\n\u201dThe factory will be up in 12 months,\u201d Milton said in a live broadcast on Instagram on Friday night. \u201cThe permit was just issued by the city. We are all good to go.\u201d\n\nPuzzling Partnership\n\nNikola has a stated ambition of manufacturing hydrogen-powered fuel cell semi trucks by 2023. Since 2017, it has had an agreement for German auto parts supplier Robert Bosch Gmbh to \u201cdevelop, build, test and support\u201d various components for Nikola\u2019s prototypes including a fuel-cell system, battery packs, steering pumps and motors, according to a regulatory filing in March.\n\nThe details of which partner is contributing what to the project has shifted over time, and the future of the deal has gotten hazier.\n\nNikola agreed to pay Bosch around $40 million for the development, according to the filing. In a presentation to investors in April, Nikola described the agreement with Bosch as a \u201cco-development\u201d and strategic supply chain partnership and said the company would jointly own any intellectual property developed with Bosch.\n\nHowever, Nikola executives have regularly stated that Nikola designed, developed and will provide much of the technology for its vehicles -- not Bosch. On Friday, Chief Financial Officer Kim Brady said that Nikola will provide only 15% of the parts in battery electric pickups due to be built in Ulm, Germany, while partner Iveco provides the rest. However, he added that Nikola\u2019s input represents 90% of the truck\u2019s value.\n\n\u201cWe are responsible for Nikola Tre -- the batteries, e-axle, e-motors, inverters, BMS system, infotainment system,\u201d Brady said. \u201cAll the key electric propulsion systems come from Nikola.\u201d\n\nAs recently as Aug. 25, Bosch has said that it\u2019s \u201cworking with the company to make the fuel-cell drive for trucks suitable for mass production.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Nikola announced that GM -- not Bosch -- will mass-supply a fuel cell system for Nikola\u2019s Class 7 and 8 semi trucks, as well as the battery packs for its debut electric pickup, the Badger. On Friday, Nikola clarified that Bosch will supply semi truck fuel cells in Europe, while GM will have exclusivity everywhere else.\n\n\u201cBosch is an investor, board member and supplier to Nikola. They help us in many facets of our business as our partner,\u201d Nikola said.\n\nMilton bristled at a claim by a Twitter user that Nikola was jilting Bosch in favor of GM.\n\n\u201cBosch as a company with a dedicated hydrogen strategy welcomes the decision of GM to enter this market as an important player,\u201d Bosch spokesman Tim Wieland said in an email. \u201cBeyond that, Nikola and Bosch have been working together for several years, not only on the fuel cell power train but also on other innovations like the steering system and the Mirror Cam System for the first prototypes of the Nikola trucks. The two companies will continue to cooperate in the future, also on fuel cells.\u201d\n\nGame Changer\n\nNikola\u2019s narrative about its battery strategy has also shifted over time.\n\nIn November 2019, Nikola issued a press release claiming to have \u201cgame-changing\u201d battery cell technology that it would unveil at an event in 2020. Nikola also said it had entered into a letter of intent to acquire a \u201cworld-class battery engineering team\u201d to help bring the new battery to pre-production.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about doubling the range of BEVs and hydrogen-electric vehicles around the world,\u201d Milton said in the statement.\n\nIn July, Milton tweeted that Nikola would \u201cmake the entire pack like the top guys do\u201d for its upcoming pickup truck, called the Badger. He said that all internal components, such as batteries, inverters, software and controls, are Nikola\u2019s own intellectual property. \u201cWe own it all in house,\u201d he said.\n\nMilton clarified in a tweet on Thursday that Nikola\u2019s change of direction -- to use GM\u2019s Ultium battery technology for the Badger -- was a result of cost analysis and cost savings.\n\nBeer Trucks\n\nBack in March, Nikola said in a presentation to investors that it has a \u201csigned binding agreement\u201d to provide Anheuser-Busch with as many as 800 hydrogen fuel cell electric semi trucks. What the presentation didn\u2019t say was that Anheuser-Busch committed to buy fewer trucks than that, and doesn\u2019t have to buy any at all.\n\nThe deal was first announced in May 2018 and stated the trucks were originally expected to be integrated into Anheuser-Busch\u2019s dedicated fleet by the end of 2020, according to a press release.\n\nThat timeline isn\u2019t going to be met. During the Aug. 4 earnings call, Russell, the CEO, updated investors on the deal, saying, \u201cWe do believe that we\u2019ll be able to give them test prototypes before the end of 2021; serial production or mass production of the fuel cell truck will not begin until 2023.\u201d\n\nThat does corroborate with the timeline for production set out in a July filing -- and to be fair, lots of people\u2019s plans have changed this year. But in the same filing, Nikola revealed that Anheuser-Busch retains the right to cancel the truck order, though there\u2019s no indication that will happen. The contract also has lease terms and rental rates that may be hard for Nikola to meet, according to the filing, \u201cdepending on our ability to develop our trucks and hydrogen network according to current design parameters and cost estimates.\u201d\n\nThe agreement between the two companies states that Anheuser-Busch gets priority of delivery for as much as 20% of Nikola\u2019s initial \u201cproduction line of Class 8 vehicles.\u201d To get production going by 2023, Nikola must work to have dedicated equipment in Anheuser Busch\u2019s breweries and distribution centers by the end of 2021, according to the deal terms. Anheuser-Busch only agreed to use at least 600 trucks -- the 800 figure, according to the document, is an estimate of what the brewer will need.\n\n\u201cThey have been, and continue to be, a great long-term partner in our shared vision of a zero-emission future (a Nikola Two prototype hauled our first load over public roads for them in St. Louis not too long ago),\u201d Russell said in the statement Friday, referring to Anheuser-Busch. \u201cOur original agreement with them has been modified over time. The current agreement terms are as we set forth in our earnings call.\u201d\n\nAnheuser-Busch didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The partnership with Nikola will help the brewer transition its entire long-haul fleet to zero-emission vehicles, Anheuser-Busch said last November.\n\nPrototype Production\n\nOn July 13, Milton said European partner Iveco was already producing vehicle prototypes.\n\n\u201cWe have a truck coming in to production right now with 720KwH, the largest battery we know of anywhere in the world coming in to production,\u201d Milton said on the TC\u2019s Charcast Podcast. \u201cWe have five of them coming off the assembly line right now in Ulm, Germany.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 4, during the company\u2019s debut earnings call, Russell echoed the sentiment, saying that the first five prototypes were \u201ccoming off the end of the facility at this point.\u201d\n\nThose statements were a mischaracterization of Nikola and Iveco\u2019s progress in Ulm, according to two people familiar with the matter. The assembly line is still under construction and not yet operational or building prototypes, the people said. There are prototypes being built by hand in a workshop, one of the people said.\n\n\u201cAs stated previously, the first five production prototypes of the Nikola Tre are being completed, by an assembly team at the Ulm facility. Also as stated previously, the Nikola/IVECO JV mass production line facility in Ulm is still under construction, and is on track for the start of regular serial production in 2021,\u201d Russell said Friday. \u201cWe anticipate that a number of current IVECO personnel will join the Nikola/IVECO JV production team in Ulm.\u201d\n\nNikola\u2019s Guidance\n\nHere\u2019s when Nikola has said it will hit its big milestones, based on filings, statements and interviews: [ ]\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/nikola-s-history-of-discrepancies-has-been-hiding-in-plain-sight-1.1492855",

        "selftext": "Snowflake (SNOW) will go public today. The data warehousing company will be the biggest IPO of the year and it has gotten a lot of attention lately. Salesforce and even Berkshire Hathaway will both be buying 3.1 million stocks, good for $500,000,000 in total. They got to buy them for $80 per share.\n\nThis week, the company's underwriters have upped the price range from $75-$85 to $100-$110, which is an increase of 31% due to greater demand. They then decided that this was still not good enough so the stock will go public at $120 per share.\n\nCan this be justified? Maybe. Their revenue increased with 130% in the first half of the year yoy. They're on track to bring in $500 mln in revenue this year. We all know that investors get really excited by cloud companies and pay a hefty premium for them, because they keep generating revenue during lockdowns and high growth rates are expected to continue over the coming years.\n\nNow, here's the quote we've all been waiting for:\n\n\"For the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments.\"\n\nThe irony is that Buffet himself is involved in this highly priced IPO. Yes, we all know that the company will probably do great over the next few years. The data warehousing industry will have a size of around $35 bln in 2025. That's just a little bigger than the current market cap of Snowflake($33.3 bln). Last February, they were only valued at $12.7 bln, and with a P/S ratio of 50, the stock is more expensive than Zoom. What you really should be asking yourself is: how much of their expected growth is already priced in? Are you willing to pay 50% more than that institutional parties had to?\n\nI'm not saying whether to buy in or not, I just wanted to give this piece of advice by the Oracle to you.

        "selftext": " \n\nNikola ([NKLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKLA?p=NKLA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)\ud83d\udcf7) and GM ([GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM)\ud83d\udcf7) are teaming up to take on Tesla\u2019s cybertruck.\n\nThe electric truck startup announced Tuesday it has selected GM to be its manufacturing parter for its electric pickup truck dubbed the Badger. The Badger will use GM\u2019s widely acclaimed Ultium battery technology. Additionally, Nikola will hand over $2 billion in stock to GM \u2014 giving the automaker an 11% stake in the company.\n\n\u201cNikola is one of the most innovative companies in the world. General Motors is one of the top engineering and manufacturing companies in the world. You couldn\u2019t dream of a better partnership than this,\u201d said Nikola founder and executive chairman Trevor Milton in a statement. \u201cBy joining together, we get access to their validated parts for all of our programs, General Motors\u2019 Ultium battery technology and a multi-billion dollar fuel cell program ready for production. Nikola immediately gets decades of supplier and manufacturing knowledge, validated and tested production-ready EV propulsion, world-class engineering and investor confidence. Most importantly, General Motors has a vested interest to see Nikola succeed. We made three promises to our stakeholders and have now fulfilled two out of three promises ahead of schedule. What an exciting announcement.\u201d \n\nAdded GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra, \u201cThis strategic partnership with Nikola, an industry leading disrupter, continues the broader deployment of General Motors\u2019 all-new Ultium battery and Hydrotec fuel cell systems. \u201cWe are growing our presence in multiple high-volume EV segments while building scale to lower battery and fuel cell costs and increase profitability. In addition, applying General Motors\u2019 electrified technology solutions to the heavy-duty class of commercial vehicles is another important step in fulfilling our vision of a zero-emissions future.\u201d\n\nThus far, the Badger has been a mere rendering that has lit-up social media feeds.\n\nThe company did begin taking pre-orders for the electric super pickup truck in late June. On paper, the truck stands to be a beast. It\u2019s expected to have 906 horsepower and have a 600-mile range using both battery and hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola has said pricing will start at $60,000 for the electric vehicle version and $90,000 for the one that also includes the hydrogen cell.\n\nThe Badger is expected to be unveiled in early December. Production has been set for 2022.",

So being a 22 year old, impulsive, and irresponsible I bought 100 shares for something like 305 with trading fee. I checked it for a few weeks regularly, nothing happens and I essentially forgot about it. I was discouraged that it didn\u2019t explode to the moon right away and I didn\u2019t do anything.

        "selftext": "You know all that nonsense from the Fed about average inflation and how they'll plan to let the economy run soooo hot that they break through the 2% target they never, ever achieved?\n\nWell guess what, there's no fucking way that happens, and the dollar index pump we're seeing right now reflects that. I think a lot of people here think that if the Fed prints money, more money = inflation. But actually that only happens when the average person has more money and increases their spending. But what's happened is that 100% of the money they print gets tied up in the banking system and never spent. This is the same reason there hasn't been significantly inflation in a decade: income inequality. And covid has only made that worse, which is why what we're up against is actually deflation.\n\nAnd why is deflation so shitty? Lower prices are awesome, right? Well, the reason inflation is so great for the US equities market is because (1) equities are inflation neutral and (2) companies are in shitloads of debt. Deflation makes the enormous debt bubble impossible to pay off. (In reality the relationship between the dollar and stocks is pretty complex, which is why you retards are only getting the ELI5.)\n\nIn short, the Fed's move is the same as saying \"we will no longer tax income over $5T.\" It sounds nice, but it doesn't fucking apply. The dollar tanking is a mirage and the bounce back will be swift and merciless. \n\nSPY 325p 11/20",

        "selftext": "\\&gt;Listen up retards, I want you to start making legitimate low risk guaranteed returns. This strategy if done correctly is actually the most profitable theta strategy, and the only one that can generate more then 70% if your investment consistently every month.    \n\n\\&gt;Quick Steps on how to do it and the TLDR is at the end, although i recommend reading through my explanation    \n\n\\&gt;Ok if you\u2019re still reading we\u2019ll need to establish a few things. A covered call is when you own 100 shares of a stock, and you sell a call against your position.     \n\n\\&gt;So basically if I own 100 shares of spy right now, I can sell a call at 335 giving the right to the buyer of the call to buy my 100 shares at 335 each, in exchange they will give me a premium to have that right, and hence I make money. This strategy works when you\u2019re expecting the stock to be bearish or flat. However, if the call exercises when it is ITM, you will be forced to sell 100 shares of spy at 335 no matter what the price is.    \n\n\\&gt;Now a poor man's covered call uses the same strategy, however using a different collateral. You see, when you buy a call, you are buying the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying at an agreed upon price. Therefore lets take this example, I buy a 335 call on spy, if I exercise it, I can buy a 100 shares of spy for 335 each. Now this right gives us incredible leverage, because we are able to do this, at the same time we can sell another call, such a 335 call. Now if the 335 call we sold is ITM and we are forced to exercise, then we exercise the call we bought, buy 100 shares for 335, and sell it to the other guy for 335, then we\u2019re released from all of its obligation. This also applies to call you sell that are at a higher strike price then the one you\u2019re holding, see if you\u2019re forced to exercise, you\u2019ll make the difference in intrinsic value back as profit. Such as selling a call at the 336 strike price, if you\u2019re forced to exercise then you\u2019ll actually make a 100$.     \n\n\\&gt;Ok you\u2019re with me so far? We have one more strategy to talk about, the diagonal spread. The diagonal spread is a strategy where you buy a long dated call say four months out, and sell another call at a higher strike price and shorter strike price. That way you make money from the premium of the short strike call, while simultaneously making money on the long dated call we bought.     \n\n\\&gt;So this strategy employs these two strategies together on SPY. So let's get started to how you would set this up. First of all, you\u2019ll go to SPY, and look at the current price. Currently Spy closed at 333.91, so we will use this value for our calculations. Now the usual way to find the best long dated option to buy, is to find one that is very close to being OTM or even a dollar or two ITM. The best date is 4 months plus, because you'll have around two months of negligible theta.      \n\n\\&gt;An important point here, the further out the better as the less theta, the more money this will generate long term. In addition, the more ITM the call is the better because it gives you more leeway, I\u2019ll explain how to use this to your advantage later.    \n\n\\&gt;So in our case, the best call to buy, is the 333c Jan 15 2021 for 1943$. Now you buy this, and you\u2019re a proud owner of this call, now it\u2019s time to start selling a call against it. The closest next expiry date is sep 14. Now the 336c call is looking pretty spicey with it\u2019s 123$ premium, so we sell it.    \n\n\\&gt;Now a very simple plug in of the call you sold into a \\[profit calculator\\]([https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)) we see that for this call to remain over the 123$ worth spy will have to open at 337.50 or higher which is more then 4$ increase, which isn\u2019t always likely. Now let\u2019s go over the few scenarios that might occur:    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\* spy opens below 337.50, in which case the call will lose its value. As long as spy doesn\u2019t close above 336, then you get to keep the premium, and if spy hovers around the current price and up to 334, the call becomes worth less then 20$, which means you can buy it back and get to keep the 100$ + difference    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*Spy moons 9 points to 342 in one day. To close the call it would cost you 553$ as it would be worth 675. However, keep in mind that our long dated call is now worth 2397. Therefore, if we closed both options we will be at a total loss of 50$. This happens due to gamma of the short call being higher, due to it's shorter expiry date. If you had cash, you can buy back that call you sold, and lose 553 cash on hand, and be 50$ negative on your entire portfolio. Then you can turn around and sell more calls    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*Spy has a retarded correction, or even god forbid a crash. In which case your long dated call will rapidly lose value and if spy loses more then 15% of its value, such as below 280$ then you lose 85% of the value of the spread. On the other a correction of 10%, would make the spread lose 65% of its value    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;It\u2019s very important to remember, the type of equity that spy represents, which is the entire US market. For context, in the last 5 years, spy has only had 7 instances of a correction over 10% which can result in a heavy loss with this strategy. Now let\u2019s look at the possible actions to take in every scenario.    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*If the call has lost more then 80% of its value, or really any amount where your profits are over 120, them buy it back and close it.    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*If the call becomes ITM and you\u2019re forced to close it, then look at your options(no pun intended)    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;&gt;\\*If you have enough cash to close it, and you don\u2019t have any possible use for that available cash within the next two weeks then close it.     \n\n\\&gt;&gt;&gt;\\*If you don\u2019t have enough money to close the call or you\u2019re not willing to lose that available cash, then simply close both options with either a profit or a loss depending on how had spy mooned that day.        \n\n\\&gt;Now after you\u2019ve done this once, let\u2019s say you were successful and the call you sold was worth less and you made premium back. Now you have more cash on hand, and you\u2019ve made money. Keep in mind, this also means more leeway, in case the next trade you might have to close the short call at a loss, either available cash loss, or net loss.     \n\n\\&gt;Doing the math on possible profits. In a single month, you are able to sell 12 spy calls. If a spy remains flat, or has a slow upwards trend, and says on average you sell your calls at a profit of 100$, then you can make 1200$ from the spy, on a 2000$ investment. Every month, until expiry on the long call. If spy rises, then your initial call would also increase in value, resulting in extra profits when you eventually close it.     \n\n\\&gt;\\_\\_NOW COMPARE THIS TO THE WHEEL STRATEGY\\_\\_ you would need a minimum of 33,000$ in order to buy a 100 shares of spy. Now first of all, the upfront collateral is ridiculous, and not many can afford it. If you\u2019re asking yourself, well why can\u2019t I use a cheaper stock, remember that only a spy has 12 contracts per month, every other etf and stock only has 4 per month. Furthermore, due to the sheer volume of spy, it's more reliable in terms of premiums.    \n\n\\&gt;Here\u2019s the best part too, spy increasing in value won\u2019t benefit you with the wheel strategy, as you\u2019re forced to sell your shares at the strike price of the short call. On the other hand, let\u2019s compare the potential losses with this strategy, If spy were to lose 10% of value down to 300, then you\u2019ll lose 3000$ vs only 1600$ with our long call. In addition, if spy keeps losing value you\u2019ll keep losing money, while your gains are capped with the long call.     \n\n\\&gt;Thereby the obvious advantages of this strategy:    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*We profit from spy\u2019s increase of value and its flatness        \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*Our maximum losses are capped, and the more successful calls we sell the less our risk becomes.        \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*Our total needed collateral is a fraction of spy, at usually around 6%. Keep in mind that the same call, 333c at an expiration of sep 17 2021, a leap year call, is only 3000$, which is still only 9% of the value we\u2019d usually need.     \n\n\\&gt;And the best part, is how scalable this is, at an average of 100$ per contract sold profits, we can make back out entire about a month and a half, and we can buy another long contract. This way, spending 4000$, for an average return of 200$ per contract. This is ofcourse not counting our long dated calls increasing value with spy.     \n\n\\&gt;This is to make your mouth water at the possible tendies. A 10,000$ investment, which is 5 contracts, can generate 6000$ per month on average, or even higher depending on market conditions. Keep in mind, the same amount of money, the 33,000 needed to use the wheel strategy, can generate 20,000 a month, vs the regular 1200 it can generate.    \n\n\\&gt;Keep in mind, this only works if spy is in an flat and positive trend. To put things into perspective, it takes 1.5 months to generate enough money to buy a second contract.  Now that you\u2019d be making double the money, that means you\u2019ll need half the time, to get the second contract, and because we\u2019re buying the contract at a higher strike price for the same price of around 2000, we keep covering higher and higher values of spy. So the second contract takes 1.5 months, the second would take three weeks, the third would take a week and half, the fourth would take 2 option dates, and them you\u2019ll be making enough money to buy another call, every weekly option.    \n\n\\&gt;I\u2019ll make a part 2 about how to take this strategy further if you are successful to layer calls upon calls, virtually building a tranche that becomes very profitable.     \n\n\\&gt;So I hope you employ this strategy to start making real money, and generating actual returns that are consistent, while still basking in the glory of theta gang, without needing the ridiculous amount of collateral\n\n\\&gt;TLDR : For the absolute retards who don't want to read but instead want to know positions: you\u2019ll need around 2000 - 2500 $ to employ this strategy correctly        \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*Buy long dated spy call, 4+ months out such as 335c Spy Jan 15 2021     \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*Then sell calls on weekly spy, 3-5$ OTM     \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*If the call you sold becomes ITM, buy it back with the cash on hand, if you can't, close both positions, and re-enter your long position at a higher strike price\n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*If not, buy the call back on the expiration day when it's lost 80% + of its value    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*Rinse and repeat    \n\n\\&gt;&gt;\\*You\u2019ll only be able to sell calls in this scenario, of 335c or higher, therefore if a spy's value drops where the 335c becomes worthless to sell, in this case if its value is less than a 100. Then exit your long dated call, and buy another one at spy\u2019s current level",

        "selftext": " We might be in a bubble. We\u2019re not at the later stages yet, but we\u2019re getting there. Here\u2019s a quick refresh on the 5 stages of a bubble and where I think we are in the stages.\n\n**1. Displacement**\n\n**A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a new paradigm, such as an innovative new technology or interest rates that are historically low. A classic example of displacement is the decline in the federal funds rate from 6.5% in July 2000, to 1.2% in June 2003. Over this three-year period, the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell by 2.5 percentage points to a historic low of 5.23%, sowing the seeds for the subsequent housing bubble.**\n\nIn our case the displacement is the Coronavirus pandemic. It has completely shifted how we think about--and value--technology stocks. Everyone is talking about the \u201cpost COVID world\u201d and how that has upended tech companies.\n\n**2. Boom**\n\n**Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain momentum as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.**\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen record numbers of retail investors joining the ranks. Everyone is stuck at home with nothing else to do and a bit of extra money from the stimulus, so they are deciding to learn how to ~~gamble~~ invest.\n\n**3. Euphoria**\n\n**During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and metrics are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the \"greater fool\" theory\u2014the idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more\u2014plays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.\ufeff Similarly, at the height of the internet bubble in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the Nasdaq was higher than the GDP of most nations.**\n\nIMO, we\u2019re in the early to mid stages of euphoria. Asset prices aren\u2019t skyrocketing, but they\u2019re increasing rapidly. It\u2019s not insane yet, but we\u2019re getting there. \n\n**4. Profit-Taking**\n\n**In this phase, the smart money\u2014heeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point\u2014starts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist John Maynard Keynes put it, \"the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\" In August 2007, for example, French bank BNP Paribas halted withdrawals from three investment funds with substantial exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages because it could not value their holdings.**\n\n\ufeff **While this development initially rattled financial markets, it was brushed aside over the next couple months, as global equity markets reached new highs. In retrospect, Paribas had the right idea, and this relatively minor event was indeed a warning sign of the turbulent times to come.**\n\nThis could be us if we\u2019re smart about it. Now, obviously we can\u2019t time the market perfectly. But we can play the odds and start hedging our bets when we get to a point where it seems likely that we\u2019re in a bubble. In the meantime we can still ride it out for a bit more gains. \n\n**5. Panic**\n\n**It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with margin calls and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&amp;P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance.  In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.**\n\nDon\u2019t let this be you, but if it is, just sit tight and buy once prices drop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Finally**, a good warning sign that the market is entering bubble territory is the widespread use of the following expressions by supposed experts:\n\n* \u201cOur only problems are the problems of success\u201d\n* \u201cPrices have adjusted to a new paradigm in which higher valuations will be the norm\u201d\n* \u201cGlobalization/communications technology/freer trade/wealthy investors from some part of the world you\u2019ve never heard of justify these higher prices\u201d\n* And, of course, \u201cthis time, it\u2019s different\u201d.\n\nIt won\u2019t be.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* Watch out for these warning signs\n* When we start seeing mass hysteria and even more inflated prices, start hedging your bets with shorts or put options\n\nLet me know your thoughts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*much of the information about the stages of bubbles was taken  from an Investopedia article.

        "selftext": "[https://on.ft.com/3gUWUIZ](https://on.ft.com/3gUWUIZ)  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank is the \u201cNasdaq whale\u201d that has bought billions of dollars\u2019 worth of US equity derivatives in a move that stoked the fevered rally in big tech stocks before a sharp pullback on Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Japanese conglomerate has been snapping up options in tech stocks during the past month in huge amounts, contributing to the largest trading volumes in contracts linked to individual companies in at least 10 years, these people said. One banker described it as a \u201cdangerous\u201d bet.\n\nThe aggressive move into the options market marks a new chapter for the investment powerhouse, which in recent years has made huge bets on privately held technology start-ups through its $100bn Vision Fund. After the coronavirus market tumult hit those bets hard, the company established an asset management unit for public investments using capital contributed by its founder Masayoshi Son.\n\nNow it has also made a splash in trading derivatives linked to some of those new investments, which has shocked market veterans. \u201cThese are some of the biggest trades I\u2019ve seen in 20 years of doing this,\u201d said one derivatives-focused US hedge fund manager. \u201cThe flow is huge.\u201d\n\nThe surge in purchases of call options \u2014 derivatives that give the user the right to buy a stock at a pre-agreed price \u2014 has been the talk of Wall Street in recent weeks, as the sheer size of the trades appears to have exacerbated a \u201cmelt-up\u201d in many big technology stocks over the summer. Shares in Tesla soared 26 per cent in under a week to September 1, while Amazon and Google parent Alphabet gained about 9 per cent.\n\nOne person familiar with SoftBank\u2019s trades said it was \u201cgobbling up\u201d options on a scale that was even making some people within the organisation nervous. \u201cPeople are caught with their pants down, massively short. This can continue. The whale is still hungry.\u201d\n\nThe options boom means that the US stock market remains vulnerable to further bursts of volatility, according to Charlie McElligott, a strategist at Nomura. \u201cThe street is still very much in a dangerous space, and that flow is still out there,\u201d he said in a note on Friday, adding that this leaves the market open to swings higher or lower.\n\nThe overall nominal value of calls traded on individual US stocks has averaged $335bn a day over the past two weeks, according to Goldman Sachs. That is more than triple the rolling average in 2017 to 2019. The retail trading boom has played a big part of the frenzy, but investors say the size of many recent option purchases are far too big to be retail-driven.",

        "selftext": "**I. INTRODUCTION**\n\n* When I look at the sentiment surrounding GameStop, it doesn\u2019t take very long to see [comments]( https://i.imgur.com/lndA70O.png) [like](https://i.imgur.com/Ec4z1fx.png) [these](https://i.imgur.com/6WoeXUS.png), yet here we [are](https://i.imgur.com/NpANVzR.png). What\u2019s going on? Are people that stupid? Just jumping on the new console cycle? Idiots not pulling their gains and going to zero? When even r/wsb thinks the stock is a dud, it must be right? Nearly 120% short interest, yet the stock is up nearly 40% this week. \n* Its no secret GameStop has been hurting. The secular shift to digital has been pressuring them for some time with their highest margin category - used video software \u2013 under significant distress. Each year their gross margins contract with net income in the red these past few quarters. Everybody has written them off as the easiest short in the world, however I'm going to try to explain whats going on and tell you that buying GameStop may not be as bad as you think.\n\n**II. CONSOLES**\n\n* Just to start things off, you have to remember we\u2019re in the beginnings of the new console cycle. But what does that even mean? Well the advent of new consoles means new trade-ins, new product, new customers, and a fresh spike in GameStop\u2019s popularity. Sales have stagnated the years prior, and they are all but certain to go up and remain elevated for the next 1-2 years. Note that against all counts, the company was actually profitable during the 2019 holiday season, with new consoles you can bet that they will annihilate all expectations and proceed into 4-8 more positive quarters off the cyclic shift. This is pretty unanimous, and everyone accepts that they will start reporting positive going forward. In fact, new console cycles are where GME has historically [spiked](https://i.imgur.com/LOehh3E.png).\n\n**III. POST CONSOLE CYCLE**\n\n* At this point, the focus turns to what happens once the hype dies down. Digital will continue to erode upon physical, but the key factor here is that physical is not actually dying off. [Its not](https://i.imgur.com/kmVPF39.png) [going to](https://i.imgur.com/rfRRGC9.png) zero. **The biggest reason physical is sequentially a lower percentage of the market is because the total market size is increasing.** Digital is shooting off while physical is largely stagnant. Note that physical games admittedly have their strengths. Not only are they structurally cheaper because you can resell them, they also have clear definitions of ownership and the collectability factor where you *need* to have a physical copy you can hold. In fact, [two thirds](https://www.limelight.com/resources/white-paper/state-of-online-gaming-2019/) of console video game players prefer physical vs digital.\n* While physical is here to stay, albeit at a weaker level, that isn\u2019t enough to turn the tides for GameStop. You see, GameStop knows digital is the trend and here to stay, they are not fighting it, **they are moving along the secular shift**. GameStop sells [digital games](https://i.imgur.com/RZJGjFE.png). GameStop is set to release a mobile app combining Game Informer and a online storefront by [month end](https://i.imgur.com/rdXejYc.png). They are doubling down on their online store with +500% ecommerce growth in [Q1]( http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-first-quarter-results) and +800% growth in [Q2](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-second-quarter-results-and-strong-progress). Expanding into numerous other [categories](https://i.imgur.com/QSkZEAw.png). Nearly 70% of their online orders were fulfilled on the same [day](https://i.imgur.com/NK8lkqD.png) leveraging their wide network of stores, of which they are pruning the excess. Also, Game prices are set to [increase $10](https://technosports.co.in/2020/09/19/sony-confirms-that-ps5-games-will-cost-up-to-69-99/). \n* GameStop\u2019s Loyalty Program accounts for over 55M [users](http://news.gamestop.com/fact-sheet-0). They intend on leveraging this network though a [company branded credit card](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-now-taking-pre-orders-sony-playstationr5-and-sony) with spending rewards to grab market share and retain customers. Furthermore, a digital revenue sharing model continues to [grow](https://i.imgur.com/V94FWJC.png) as publishers understand the value of GameStop as a customer acquisition service and that keeping the company afloat is better for sales and the general video game industry. (*[See the fall of Toys R us and its impact on Mattel/Hasbro](https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-toy-category-still-hasnt-recovered-from-the-death-of-toys-r-us/571701/); turns out the manufacturers really needed ToysRUs*)\n\n**VI. BALANCE SHEET**\n\n* But wait, their financials must be shit right? They have to be losing money. How much longer can they last? \n* Well it turns out their books are rock solid. They offered their creditors a new set of terms to push back debt for 2 years, 50% of them [took it](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-expiration-and-final-results-exchange-offer). They have eliminated all excess goodwill impairments. They are in a [$300M net cash position](https://i.imgur.com/HhfHaIT.png) with significantly reduced inventory (which explains the sharp reduction in Q1/2 sales) and massively cut SG&amp;A by 28% in preparation for the console cycle. [FCF KING](https://i.imgur.com/LYyrrUm.png)\n* Many believe the days of their strong margins are long gone, but in fact its only beginning. You have to remember, digital is only outpacing NEW physical games. [Retro games](https://thenextweb.com/gaming/2019/02/01/retro-consoles-video-game-sales-nostalgia/) are a [huge untapped market](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/01/talking_point_how_much_is_your_video_game_collection_really_worth_to_you) where GameStop can replicate their past success, and it is a category digital can never penetrate. [Jesus wtf.](https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nes/little-samson) GameStop is looking into [these already](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/retro-gaming/pre-owned)\n\n**V. MAJOR BACKING**\n\n* In fact, their ecommerce prospects are so promising, Ryan Cohen bought a [10% stake](https://investorplace.com/2020/08/gamestop-news-sends-gme-stock-soaring/). This guy took on Amazon and [won](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/#7cdf60865579). [Jefferies](https://i.imgur.com/Duyxu1i.png) and [Talsey](https://i.imgur.com/K169L1N.png), wall street firms, came out with strong buy ratings citing company prospects. [Michael Burry](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/michael-burry-top-portfolio-holdings-massive-bet-alphabet-google-scion-2020-8-1029517864#) still holds a 5% stake. This guy took on Wall Street and won. [Half their creditors](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-expiration-and-final-results-exchange-offer) ($200M worth) believe in GameStop\u2019s prospects. Why would they defer their debt unless they believed the company will be in a paying position by 2023?\n\n**VI. THE SHORTS**\n\n* But here is the real kicker. GameStop\u2019s short float. 120% has never been seen before. The short theory was that GameStop would not make it to the new console cycle and the shorters would collect their tendies. But GameStop made it. Current short fees are like 60% and from some figures we can draw on, we estimate that around 70% of the shorts got in [under $7](https://i.imgur.com/wRaMbLx.png), GameStop is currently nearing $10. **70% of the shorts are underwater.** Even if you don\u2019t believe that any of their initiatives will work you have to admit that the company will be able to continue operating for another two years off the new console hype alone. When the stock hits roughly $15, we can expect to see several margin calls trigger a fucking massive short squeeze. For reference, [Blue Apron](https://i.imgur.com/6EqU417.png), [Volkswagen](https://i.imgur.com/S3DHn3j.gif).\n\n**VII. CONCLUSION**\n\n* Just the fact GME got to the new console cycle must be making the shorts cry. Add on that they\u2019ve been making serious progress towards online and mobile presence, aligning themselves with industry trends, operating in a growing market, potential monopoly in the untapped retro market, solid financials, beginning their new upward cyclic cycle; you have the makings of a powerful ecommerce storefront just leaning into their growth period. Even post console hype, they should be able to leverage their branded credit card to retain a huge number of customers and bite off huge market share off other retailers. Lastly, remember that despite the trend towards digital, its in the gaming industry's best interest to keep GameStop going strong. The likelihood of additional revenue sharing agreements are fairly high.\n* For comparison GameStop has a P/S ratio 0.11. Chewy has a P/S ratio of 3.6. If GME begins to grow their revenue from this point its valuation will begin to normalize. Even a P/S of 0.2 would mean a stock price of ~$16, 0.4 would mean $32. The company is going to ride the console hype and likely trigger more than a few margin calls along the way. Everything management has been doing is to ride the new cycle into a fluid ecommerce business model, and everything I'm seeing suggests its going to work. \n\n[Tl;dr](https://i.redd.it/bxn2mf4bzoj41.jpg)\n\n10c 9/25 to play XBOX prerelease\n\n10c 10/2 to play Mobile App/Stimulus \n\n10c 11/20 to play Console Release Date\n\n10c 4/16 to play Holiday Earnings/short squeeze\n\n***most text references are from GameStop's Q2 transcript which you can find [here.](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/09/10/gamestop-gme-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)",

        "selftext": "Back in March, long before a short seller would raise questions about electric-truck company Nikola Corp. and hasten its founder\u2019s exit, early investors in the company were expressing concerns of their own.Those investors, led by mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments, were worried that Trevor Milton, for all his brash visionary talk and Twitter braggadocio, lacked the ability that Elon Musk possesses to deliver these sorts of newfangled products to market. They lobbied successfully to remove him as CEO before the company\u2019s June IPO and for Milton\u2019s father to leave the board, according to people familiar with the matter. When the deal was done, Milton only held the title of chairman, the post he resigned this month.\n\nThe back-room negotiations show that Milton\u2019s past was a concern to investors months before General Motors Co. executives placed a bet on the company in a US$2 billion deal carved out after the IPO. They liked Milton\u2019s vision and his ability to raise cash and felt the venture was safeguarded from his shortcomings in operations by his push upstairs, say people familiar with the matter. Nonetheless, the events that have unfolded since the short-seller report, with Nikola\u2019s stock plunging amid a steady stream of negative headlines, have exposed just how high the risks still were.\n\nNow, it\u2019s up to former GM Vice Chairman Steve Girsky, whose blank-check company VectoIQ took Nikola public via reverse merger in June, and Nikola CEO Mark Russell to stabilize the business and regain investor confidence. The plan with GM was to use Nikola\u2019s hot stock and Milton\u2019s ability to raise money to build a hydrogen-fueled trucking business with GM\u2019s technology.\n\n\u201cThere is obviously someone on the diligence side who isn\u2019t going to get a nice bonus this year,\u201d said Reilly Brennan, founder of the venture capital fund Trucks Inc. \u201cThe best possible thing if you\u2019re a shareholder is that Milton is no longer running the company and you have Girsky as chairman and GM providing technology.\u201d\n\nThe GM deal was originally scheduled to close Sept. 30, and the automaker has said it plans to carry through, but that timing may slip, say people familiar with the matter. BP Plc is still engaged with Nikola in talks to partner on a network of hydrogen fueling stations for fuel-cell trucks the company hopes to sell, but also is slowing the pace for a deal, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. BP and GM declined to comment.\n\nMilton\u2019s tale reads like a Greek tragedy. The report by short seller Hindenburg Research accused Milton of overhyping Nikola\u2019s technology and has prompted investigations by the Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A cousin has accused him of a decades-ago sexual assault, which he denies. The company\u2019s value peaked at US$30 billion and is now worth about US$7 billion.\n\nGirsky and GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra have both said publicly that they did plenty of due diligence. People familiar with the matter say that GM found out when scouting the deal that it had better batteries and fuel-cell technology but joined forces because Nikola had a working semi truck and access to capital markets. In addition, GM will get paid to build Nikola\u2019s Badger pickup on existing assembly lines. Milton was so excited to get the Badger pickup program moving that he signed a deal that heavily favored GM, one of the people said.\n\nNikola\u2019s stock and GM\u2019s US$2 billion stake are worth less than half what they were on Sept. 8, when the deal was announced. Milton\u2019s own stake is worth US$1.7 billion, down from almost US$5 billion at one point.\n\nMilton said in a June interview with Bloomberg News that he grew up in modest surroundings in Layton, Utah. His family moved to Las Vegas when he was very young and he lost his mother to cancer shortly after moving back to Utah in the sixth grade. He wrote on Twitter he didn\u2019t finish high school, earning an equivalency certification instead, and later dropped out of college. His Twitter account has since been deleted.\n\nHe grew up in a tight-knit Mormon family, according to Aubrey Smith, his first cousin. She went on social media recently and accused him of sexually assaulting her in 1999 when she was 15 and he was 17.\n\nIn a public account on Facebook and Twitter, and repeated in a phone interview, Smith said that Milton came onto her at the funeral of their grandfather. He took her shirt off without permission, Smith wrote, and then he touched her inappropriately before someone knocked at the door and she ran out.\n\nMilton denied the allegations through a spokesman.\n\nSmith said Milton raised money from family members to get his start. He founded and ran several businesses, including a home-security company that Milton claims he sold for US$1.5 million. Next, in 2009, he founded an e-commerce platform called Upillar.com, which Milton claims \u201cpioneered the shopping cart online.\u201d\n\nThen he got into clean propulsion but ended up embroiled in litigation with dHybrid Inc., which he founded in 2009. The company retrofitted diesel vehicles with natural-gas-burning turbines, claiming the dual system had greater efficiency.\n\nBut a deal with Swift Transportation Co. in 2010 ended in court when Swift alleged dHybrid defaulted on a US$322,000 loan and that it retrofitted only half of the agreed vehicles. The case was dismissed in 2015.\n\nMilton later tried to sell dHybrid to a company called sPower in May 2012 but that, too, got mired in lawsuits after sPower backed out and accused Milton of exaggerating its technological capabilities.\n\nAmid the litigation, Milton started another company with a very similar name, dHybrid Systems, selling it in 2014 to Worthington Industries.\n\nDuring an interview with Bloomberg in June, Milton said that dHybrid Inc. was a success but conceded that, \u201cwe ended up closing that one down because of some litigation.\u201d\n\nHis next startup was Nikola, founding it in 2014 in Salt Lake City before moving to Phoenix. Emulating Musk, he took the name from the electricity pioneer Nikola Tesla, and the company was soon billed as the Tesla of Trucks. His plan was seen as potentially disrupting the entire transportation industry by making trucks that ran on batteries or hydrogen-fuel cells. He also planned to build a network of hydrogen filling stations.\n\nFriends and Family\n\nMilton had friends and family members working for Nikola despite resumes that didn\u2019t match the job. His brother, Travis Milton, is director of hydrogen and infrastructure. His LinkedIn profile shows that most of his experience was being \u201cself-employed\u201d in Maui. The short seller, Hindenburg Research, said that Travis Milton poured concrete as a contractor. Milton\u2019s father Bill was originally on the board but stepped down when VectoIQ took the company public.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock prospectus said that Nikola had awarded more than 3 million stock options \u201cto recognize the superior performance and contribution of specific employees.\u201d The list included Travis Milton and an uncle, Lance Milton, the document said, acknowledging that they are relatives.\n\nAs Milton went public with Nikola\u2019s technology, questions soon arose involving his claims about the company\u2019s fuel-cell system. He bragged in an investor video in 2019 that the company had created \u201cwhat other manufacturers said was impossible to design.\u201d But while Nikola holds patents in fuel-cell and battery technology, most of its planned hardware was coming from German supplier Robert Bosch Gmbh.\n\nNikola Demonstrations\n\nIt became clear that Milton had gotten ahead of himself. A 2016 demonstration showed a truck that didn\u2019t have a working hydrogen-fuel-cell system and was missing key parts, people familiar with the matter said in June. Milton said at the time that the parts were removed as a safety precaution.\n\nIn July of this year, he recorded a video of the semi truck in which he ran alongside the vehicle as it coasted at low speeds in a parking lot. Aping Musk\u2019s combative social-media persona, Milton took a shot at his detractors saying, \u201cthese damned trolls, I wonder if they are going to apologize to everyone for the lies they spread the tens of thousands of comments about how fake we are.\u201d\n\nGirsky said in the webcast \u201cAutoline This Week,\u201d in which Bloomberg participated, that he has been in Nikola\u2019s fuel-cell trucks and that they work.\n\nStill, when the GM deal was done, GM will be supplying all of the technology for every global market except Europe. Nikola\u2019s pickup truck, called Badger, will use GM\u2019s Ultium battery, and the semis will run on a fuel cell developed by GM and Honda Motor Co.\n\nSince Milton\u2019s departure, Nikola has billed itself more as an integrator of other technologies into its Badger pickup and semi trucks.\n\nFor GM\u2019s part, the automaker is protected from any financial downside. GM got 11 per cent of the stock for no cash investment and gets paid for its technology. If Nikola fails, GM won\u2019t lose a dime.\n\nMilton has remained silent and is out of the company. He unknowingly presaged his own downfall in the June interview with Bloomberg: \u201cPart of becoming a better person in life is losing everything you have got and having nothing left.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/nikola-founder-milton-s-fall-reveals-what-his-backers-feared-1.1500376",

        "selftext": "# Introduction\n\nThis will be long, but it will also be concise, and is filled with information. Do yourself a favor and read it thoroughly. Don't complain that I got something wrong if you only skimmed the post.\n\nI've been studying options for years, and have read great books such as OAASI cover to cover. In other words, I know some shit. My goal here is to impart a simple strategy that can significantly outperform a \"buy and hold\" strategy on any major index, both so you can make tendies SAFELY, but also to rub it in the faces of those no-nothing /r/investing types who shun options.\n\nOne final note before we begin. I realize you can potentially increase returns on this strategy by utilizing margin to sell naked options and such... but I don't want to advocate a strategy that could blow up retards accounts. What I will advocate here is a 100% cash strategy and has no risk of a margin call.\n\n**This strategy is necessarily no riskier than buying and holding an index fund.**\n\nIf you insist on using margin to increase your returns, I would suggest simply using margin to own double the amount of assigned and held stock, in order to sell double the number of covered calls. This is a relatively safe way to increase returns.\n\n# The Wheel: An IMPROVED \"Buy and Hold\" Strategy\n\nForget credit spreads, diagonal spreads, iron condors, and all that often complicated jazz. The absolute best and simplest theta gang strategy, in my humble opinion, is The Wheel. But I'm going to argue for a very specific version of The Wheel here, and that makes all the difference.\n\nWhile spreads can be effective, we want to maximize returns by collecting FULL PREMIUM for options, and not hedging like a pussy.\n\n**When you think about The Wheel, I want you to picture an IMPROVED \"buy and hold\" strategy.**\n\nThe tried and true advice of most financial advisors out there is to drop cash in something like an index fund and forget about it. While this is good and all, we can clearly do better, by utilizing options. What we are attempting here is to mimic a \"buy and hold\" strategy, while consistently augmenting returns by collecting option premium on top.\n\nThe Wheel is a simple concept. You sell cash-secured puts and collect premium. If you ever get assigned, you hold and sell covered calls on the assigned stock. If your stock ever gets called away, you go back to selling puts. Rinse and repeat, ad infinitum.\n\nThe question of which options to sell and why gets complicated, and I will go into details below, but for simplicity I am advocating simply sticking to 30-45 DTE \\~0.30 delta options on major ETFs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vntvxqycv5p51.png?width=1286&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0b92bc6d4ecc345f07f4bf09ca2fd4f3f954f85\n\n# The Basic Concept\n\nYou want to get PAID to buy stock at a CHEAP price. You can do that by selling OTM cash-secured puts. And you want to get PAID to sell stock at a HIGH price. You can do that by selling OTM covered calls. When you understand this basic concept, you understand 90% of this strategy.\n\nThis will outperform \"buy and hold\" for two reasons: 1) It collects option premium on top of stock appreciation, 2) It reduces the cost basis for potential stock purchases. These factors also ensure reduced volatility compared with \"buy and hold,\" as both premium and reduced entry points offer downside protection from falling assets. This is inherently a long-term strategy; if you are unwilling to hold an ETF long-term through a drop or even a recession, don't waste your time... you WILL lose money.\n\nWhen I've looked for counter-arguments to The Wheel strategy, the common argument I hear is \"it works until it doesn't.\" In other words, these people argue that if you run The Wheel on a stock that drops hard and doesn't recover, you will lose money.\n\n**This argument completely falls apart if you run The Wheel on INDEX ETFs.**\n\nSPY and other major indices have recovered from every crash they have ever experienced. Individual stocks like Enron have not. If we want to mimic a conservative \"buy and hold\" strategy WITH diversification, we will only play major ETFs. This eliminates the major argument against The Wheel entirely, since it achieves instant diversification and will mimic the broader market. If you think the US economy will crash and never recover, you should be buying guns and ammo and not options.\n\nThe only REAL argument against The Wheel is that you could potentially lose out on stock appreciation during heavy bull runs. While this is true, we will show below that this argument doesn't hold much weight.\n\n# Calculating Returns\n\nIt is relatively simple to calculate potential returns for this strategy, so I will do that now using option prices on SPY as of 9/24/2020. Keep in mind IV is currently high, and so these returns will be inflated relative to a calmer market. Also keep in mind that annualizing returns based on one-month results can get wonky. *This is just an example to get a picture of how things work.*\n\nThere are two phases to this strategy: Selling CSP's and selling CC's. We will calculate each separately, using 30 DTE options and ignoring compounding for simplicity.\n\n**CSP Return (Conservative 0.30 delta):**\n\n\\[(CSP premium \\* 100 shares) / collateral\\] \\* 12 months = Return\n\n\\[($5.30 \\* 100) / $31,000\\] \\* 12 = **20.5% return**\n\n**CSP Return (Aggressive ATM/0.50 delta):**\n\n\\[(9.00 \\* 100) / $32,000\\] \\* 12 = **33.7% return**\n\n**CC Return (Conservative 0.30 delta):**\n\nS&amp;P500 return + \\[(CC premium \\* 100 shares) / collateral\\] \\* 12 months = Return\n\nS&amp;P500 return + \\[($4.12 \\* 100) / $32,500\\] \\* 12 = **S&amp;P return + 15.5%**\n\nNow there are a few caveats for the above calculations. The first is that if the S&amp;P500 rallies well past our CC strike price, we will lose out on those potential gains. This means the CC-side return for the S&amp;P is capped, which can be calculated as follows:\n\n**Maximum CC Return:**\n\n\\[(Strike price - stock price) \\* 100 shares + (CC premium \\* 100 shares)\\] / collateral = Return (one month)\n\n\\[($334 - $325) \\* 100 + ($4.12 \\* 100)\\] / $32,500 = **4.0% (48% annualized)**\n\nBy reversing this we can calculate how much SPY would have to rise to outperform us.\n\n$325 \\* 1.04 = $338\n\nIn other words, if SPY rises more than $13 in one month it will outperform us, but only for THAT MONTH. Obviously the S&amp;P doesn't achieve 48% returns annually and so bull months will be offset by flat and bear months. We will outperform the S&amp;P in both those categories as shown above, which will more than make up the difference in lost potential gains.\n\nOne final note: These calculations assume that all options are held until expiration. In practice, returns can be increased by closing winning positions early. If you achieve 70% gain in 10 days, it makes little sense to wait another 20 days to collect the remaining 30% premium. Simply close and roll as necessary.\n\n# A Guide for Smaller Accounts + Proof of Concept\n\nTo run the strategy I am advocating on SPY, you would need a minimum account size of \\~$35,000. I know a lot of you don't have that much money, so I've done a little experiment for smaller accounts.\n\nI set aside a fund to run The Wheel on smaller ETFs, such as XLE, XLF, and GDX. To run the wheel on these individually you would need an account size no bigger than \\~$4000. Even smaller ETFs such as SILJ could be run for as little as $1500, though they are more risky and less liquid. To prove the concept for smaller accounts, I set aside $10,000 and ran smaller ETFs such as these for 4 months.\n\n**After 4 months, I achieved a 41% annualized return. This outperformed the SPY ETF during the same period by around 5%, despite the fact the ETFs utilized underperformed relative to SPY. This, in my view, provides some proof of concept.**\n\nObviously this return would have dropped significantly during this recent market drop, which is why I stopped running the strategy on the 18th, to avoid losing my own money just for proof of concept. The best strategy will always be adaptive to market conditions, but if you want a one-size-fits-all approach, The Wheel is probably the best you can get.\n\nIn one instance I used margin to purchase an additional 100 shares of SILJ to sell a second CC for \"free\" (minus margin costs), just to offer an example of how margin can be safely used to increase returns. I also sold ATM options on SILJ shares because I wanted to dump it quickly before the crash, and to collect higher premiums. Got very lucky and sold right before the drop on Monday. This is an example of how to adapt the strategy based on your market predictions.\n\nHere is a complete breakdown of my trades during this 4 month period. **Notice that I usually closed positions early in order to increase my $/day return.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v80b50jfv5p51.png?width=1433&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=469d57e6bcce2c51641a211801d5997f05675e4b\n\n# A Note on Past Wheel Guides\n\nA prominent past guide on running The Wheel argued that you should always avoid assignment. However, they never made a compelling case for WHY you should avoid assignment. There is an argument to be made for such a position, which I will provide soon. However, there are also a number of arguments to be made in favor of accepting or even seeking assignment. They run as follows:\n\n1) Time Premium is maximized when the strike price is ATM. If we are selling time premium (Theta), selling ATM will tend to maximize premium returns long-term.\n\n[Apparently this picture didn't exist on the internet until now...](https://preview.redd.it/16ijbdsgv5p51.jpg?width=4608&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb7fda8a060de84719695afc98c09f8bb7f644f9)\n\n2) If we are bullish on an Index long-term, we shouldn't have any problem accepting stock ownership. In fact, it will likely increase our returns due to stock appreciation on top of option premium.\n\n3) Stock can be more easily owned on margin than options. Holding double the stock on margin and selling twice as many covered-calls will outperform selling cash-secured puts long-term.\n\nThese past guides also focused on running The Wheel on individual stocks. I have so far not yet seen a guide advocating The Wheel purely on Index ETFs to mimic and outperform a \"buy and hold\" diversified strategy. **This is perhaps the most important takeaway from this guide.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Maximizing Returns: ATM vs. OTM?**\n\nThis strategy is simple enough... Where it gets complicated is in the details. And the most difficult question of all is whether to sell ATM, or OTM, and if so how deep?\n\nLet's start with the absolute ideal scenarios...\n\n**In a bull market: You want to sell ATM puts and OTM calls.**\n\n**In a bear market: You want to sell OTM puts and ATM calls.**\n\n**In a completely flat market: You want to sell ATM puts and ATM calls.**\n\nThe reasoning is simple. If the market is rising, you want to maximize premium on your puts by selling ATM. You also want OTM calls so you don't lose out on gains in stock appreciation when the price rises. The ideal depth for OTM calls would be just above the total underlying appreciation (which obviously is difficult to predict in advance).\n\nBy the same token, if the market is falling, you want to sell OTM puts for downside protection against assignment, and you want to sell ATM calls to maximize premium.\n\nIn a flat market you simply want to maximize premium and have no need for upside or downside protection, and so ATM will perform best.\n\nIf you are brilliant and prescient like me, you can navigate these complicated waters and adapt to the market accordingly. If you are a retard, on the other hand, you can't easily predict where the market is headed...\n\nIn that case, my advice is the following:\n\nALWAYS SELL OTM ON BOTH ENDS. This will give you downside protection from drops, and also give you upside protection from rallies. The consequence of this is your premium returns will be reduced relative to someone who strategically sells ATM options, but that is an acceptable loss for a safer and more conservative strategy if you don't know wtf you are doing. **You will still outperform \"buy and hold\" using this strategy, while also achieving reduced volatility.**\n\nAiming for selling .30 delta, or 70% Prob ITM options, seems conservative enough for me. You can adjust accordingly based on your personal risk tolerance. If you want a more conservative strategy, aim further OTM. If you want more aggressive strategy, aim closer ATM. Keep in mind you MUST be willing to hold stock long-term through a drop to make this strategy viable! If you aren't willing to actually \"buy and hold\" while selling covered calls, look to gamble elsewhere.\n\n# Other Details\n\nThe reasoning for selling 30-45 DTE options, which is advocated by TastyTrade among others, is because theta decay for ATM options accelerates around this range. However, this is only true for ATM options, and OTM options theta decay can actually decelerate closer to expiration. It is likely better to go for longer dated OTM options for this reason, though it won't make a huge difference imo. I would suggest keeping things simple and maintaining a habit around this range.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s3hl0wekv5p51.png?width=586&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68e42cee750063a6932f96c151a8fb779f292467\n\nSome people attempt to run The Wheel by selling short-term weeklies/FDs. These individuals are not really selling theta so much as they are attempting to scalp gamma. While this can work, it is not really the consistent, safe, long-term strategy we are looking for here. It also suffers from the reduced theta decay for OTM options which I stated above. If you want to gamble, you might as well be BUYING the FD's, not SELLING them!\n\nI would usually close my options at 50%+ return and roll forward/up when necessary. This will tend to yield greater $/day returns if the underlying is moving in your direction. For example: If you make 80% return in 10 days, it makes little sense to hold another 20+ days for another 20% premium gain. Simply close the position and collect the secured premium to release collateral for another sell. If the underlying is moving against your direction, you generally want to hold until expiration and collect 100% of the premium, even if that means assignment. **Closing a sold option for a loss will DESTROY the returns of The Wheel! Do not do this!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This is probably already too long, so I will stop here. I apologize if I've made any mistakes while writing this. Feel free to ask any questions and I will do my best to answer them!**",

        "selftext": "Apparently, after CNBC's LeBeau commented \"Don't be surprised if $GM takes a greater than 11% stake\", NKLA has jumped 10% easy.\n\nUmmmm, for those buyers on this headline, do you still remember what the deal was?\n\nHere is the link to the SEC 8-K report [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-102820/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-102820/), which should give you the most information on the deal.\n\nTo sum it up, NKLA was going to give, **GIVE, NOT SELL,** 2 billion USD worth of stocks to GM, **for 0 cent in return**. In addition, **GM will also** **be paid** to supply batteries,manufacture NKLA's trucks. **And GM will also receive Nikola's emission credits**. \n\nThis is a shit deal for Nikola. So why would NKLA have agreed to this? Because N**KLA has no capability to build a truck by itself**. It only knows how to integrate. In order to build the Nikola Badger, it has to partner up with GM. **NKLA simply CANNOT do this job by itself.**\n\nNow, frauds claims have plagued NKLA's stocks for weeks. If you are Mary Barra, do you have to walk away from the deal? Hmmm. Why would you? **Why would you walk away from 2 billion dollars for free PLUS a battery customer**? You have nothing to lose here, except for some reputation, since Barra said \"appropriate due-dillgence\" was done. But hey, what due-dilligence needs to be done? **NO DUE-DILLIGENCE needs to be done.** **If you have nothing to lose in a deal, and you can walk away freely, why would you need to do any due-dilligence?**\n\nNow, since the deal has not been closed, and NKLA's share has plummetted more than 50%. If you are Mary Barra, who wants to continue to pursue this \"no-lose\" deal anyway, WOULD YOU STILL ACCEPT THE OLD TERMS? Hey, Nikola, you agreed to give me 2 billion worth (or 11%) of stake when the company was worth 20B, now your company is worth 7B, **OF COURSE I WANT MORE THAN 11% OF YOUR DAMN STAKES NOW right**? Original 2 billion worth of stocks will now be 27% of the company.\n\nAnd now, CNBC's LeBeau speaks, \"GM may take more than 11% stake on NKLA\". Hey bro, **I need you to tell me this shit information**? Yeah, NKLA is 10% up now. But wait a minute, **how can this shitty deal, which now benefits GM even more, benefit NKLA in anyway at all**? Nope, I dont't see it.\n\nMaybe the LeBeau guy is long NKLA stocks, now he plays with words to fool you retards. Headlines easily fool retards. Why spend ten minutes reading into the story and doing the thinking, while you can simply make your investment decision after spending 10 seconds reading a headline? (I mean, just look at SNOW's rise 2 days ago)\n\nIn the end, I simply can't emphasize enough, **this deal is sweet for GM and horrible for NKL**A. But NKLA has to take it because it is desperate. It's simply unable to build trucks by itself. \n\n**Risk disclaimer: I am not telling you NKLA share will go down**. Although I am short NKLA, the greater fool theory tell us, as long as there are more people misunderstanding the headline, the stock may go up. **Invest with caution.**",

I am in for 20 Nov 90C. Now let's look at Bid/ask spreads, volume, and the greeks below.\n\n\nI will only look at option chains expiring after November due to all the announcements in October. \n\n**6 Nov** is not worth it for reasons below.\n   - the average bid/ask spread is 40 cents for OTM/ITM calls. Personally I usually buy close ITM calls for the delta/theta movement as it is safer. \n   -Theta for closer OTM calls are already at .11\n   -Delta is hovering at about .5 which is okay, but preferably since its a month away, we would want it a little more. No doubt it will move up as AMD increases. But so will Theta for an option expiring a week after the announcements.\n\n\n**20 Nov**\n    -My position of choice due to much smaller bid/ask because I'm not a fan of losing money to MM's. \n    - Theta of .6/.7 right now which buys us more time. \n    -Since I plan on selling the options during early November, I still have adequate time to not get wrecked by theta and let delta move in my favor. \n\n\n**15 Jan 21**\n\n    - Another recommendation of mine.

Do you believe in TSLA as the \"company of the future\" that has a valuation potential that can't be captured (ie. ARKK's perspective, and hence their $7000 pre-split price target potential).\n\nAdded fun: AMD, BA, MSFT, AAPL are all hammered right now. Again, these are all stocks that I've seen people have incredible FOMO about missing the August run up. If you genuinely believe these stocks have a future, and are thinking long term (ie. over 1 year holdings), these price points are good entries for a DCA strategy. Basically, all these stocks gave up ALL their August gains, which means if you missed the boat at the end of July, nows the time to get back in because the train came back to the station.\n\nIf you believe the valuations of these stocks are still too high, then feel free to disregard this entire post.",

        "selftext": "Our devine overlords in Germany decided that you can't deduct your losses against your gains anymore. Or well only up to 10k within a year. Yes you read that right. You can lose money and still owe taxes. I expect some DP loss porn in 2022. You made 800k from your 10k through stupid trades and lost it all within the same year? You're in for a rude awakening after 2020 in Germany.\n\nThis retarded law means that your taxes trading derivatives can easily be multiple times higher than: your gains, your portfolio, your net worth. All possible with the buying power of a typical 4 digit account. Guaranteed financial disaster with the following single trade:\n\nBuy 100 AMZN 3010c AUG21, sell 100 AMZN  3000c AUG21 in one transaction. In other words, its an ITM bear call spread. Margin required to open this: probably below 10k. You tax bill if AMZN will trade below 3000 in August 2021: 1.8 million. \\~70.9k gain per lot on one side and a loss of \\~70k on the other derivative. Under  normal circumstances this means a gain of max 1k per contract and it depends on how much premium you got initially. Not with this new clever tax law, because you also \"gained\" money here!\n\nIts even more absurd if AMZN trades at like 8000 in August. Now  normally, you would have lost all the money on your bear call spread,  but now you also get to pay taxes on a gain of 5000\\*100\\*100 = 50 million,  too. Genius.\n\nIf you're an active trader, you can easily do worse than in this example. It's basically outlawing derivatives, \"because they are bad, mkay\". Because its going to be an absolute mine field after 2020 if you are German.\n\nGerman article (you can use Chrome to automatically translate this): [https://www.fundresearch.de/steuern/warum-die-neue-derivate-steuer-ab-januar-fatale-folgen-hat.php](https://www.fundresearch.de/steuern/warum-die-neue-derivate-steuer-ab-januar-fatale-folgen-hat.php)",

        "selftext": "Shortsellers are going after our favorite stocks to profit therefore we should despise them right? But are they all really bad? \n\nDon\u2019t just read articles and blog posts that confirm your view about a company. ***Right  now a lot of $TSLA &amp; $NKLA shareholders are mad about shortsellers  going after their stock but in fact you should embrace it.***\n\nShortsellers do research that you could ***never do on your own***.  In fact I would love it if someone would give me a 50 page report on  everything thats wrong with any of my holdings. I know whats right about  all the companies I own. What I want to know are the flaws, the  accounting issues ( if there are any ) etc.\n\nWith Luckin Coffee Muddy Waters Research bought thousands of cups of  coffee from different branches and kept an eye on the customers. Thats  invaluable research and in the end they were right that the numbers  don\u2019t match up. \n\nThey probably saved a lot of Luckin Coffee Shareholders from bigger  losses ( those who read the report). And of course short sellers should  get compensated for this work. There have to be incentives to do this  kind of work. Else nobody would do it. Don\u2019t count on auditors which are  incentivized to look the other way and keep a paying client.When you\u2019re  an analyst you can just say you think revenue will go up but you don\u2019t  need to back it up. \n\nThats it. But when you accuse someone of fraud then you better have a  lot of evidence to support this view. Short sellers face potential  losses &amp; lawsuit. If they are wrong they lose a lot. Thats why they  work hard and only release reports when they have enough to back up  their claim. Also what do Companies like Nikola have to worry about ? If  everything is fine then the Hindenburg report will turn out false and  they continue to enjoy a rising share price. **But what if the report is right?**\n\nIf you are a Nikola shareholder then you should pay attention to it.  Read it and work this into your thesis for owning the stock. Is it worth  the risk? Maybe limit your exposure.But don\u2019t ridicule the people that  release those reports. There is a lot of hard work &amp; money behind  it.\n\n***Short sellers don\u2019t do this for the fun of it.***  And if they are right they should be compensated for their work. I  would actually say that many short sellers work much harder on research  than a long analyst. After all they have to be right to make money.

        "selftext": " \n\n[SoftBank Group Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/9984:JP) shares tumbled in Tokyo trading after reports that the Japanese conglomerate made substantial bets on equity derivatives amid the surge in technology stocks.\n\nSoftBank shares dropped as much as 5.4%, the most on an intraday basis since April. The stock had gained 33% this year before Monday.\n\nThe Financial Times, Wall Street Journal and [Zero Hedge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QG8ZJIMB2SJO) reported that SoftBank was making massive bets on technology stocks using equity derivatives. The FT labeled SoftBank the \u201cNasdaq whale\u201d that \u201cstoked the fevered rally in big tech stocks,\u201d though it didn\u2019t include details of any trading. The FT later reported that SoftBank is sitting on trading gains of about $4 billion after founder Masayoshi Son\u2019s bets on equity derivatives, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\n The Japanese conglomerate [said in August](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-11/softbank-returns-to-profit-after-record-losses-on-startup-bets) that it was starting a new unit to trade public securities, pushing beyond its traditional base in telecommunications and private startup investments. Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-11/softbank-is-said-to-target-over-10-billion-in-public-investing) in August that SoftBank was targeting investments of more than $10 billion, perhaps tens of billions, and would use financing structures that would allow the company to avoid showing up in public disclosures of shareholding. \n\n \n\nThe Japanese company\u2019s derivatives strategy has been built over the past few months, the FT cited the people as saying, adding that SoftBank has spent about $4 billion on options premiums focused on tech stocks over that time. SoftBank now has large but unrealized profits, and the trades have been deeply controversial even within SoftBank, the newspaper reported.\n\nSoftBank declined to comment.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that SoftBank spent about $4 billion buying call options on stocks, while also selling call options at higher prices.\n\n \n\nThe idea that options buyers [could drive extreme rallies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-04/option-traders-flex-market-muscles-with-focus-on-very-few-stocks) in technology stocks -- and push benchmark indexes to record highs -- would have drawn skepticism in the past. But as call volumes have exploded in stocks such as Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc., analysts are beginning to embrace the theory. They point out that traders could have outsize influence by concentrating their bets on a narrow set of high-profile names while other trading activity is reduced.\n\n\u201cIn a world where volumes are distorted by the frantic trading of algos, any real order flows may have surprisingly large impact on prices,\u201d Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, wrote in a note Tuesday. \u201cBy trading options, they leverage their position.\u201d\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-06/softbank-s-4-billion-trading-gains-on-u-s-stock-option-bet-ft](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-06/softbank-s-4-billion-trading-gains-on-u-s-stock-option-bet-ft)",

        "selftext": " \n\nHello all,\n\nBefore the DD starts please take a look at my credentials, you will find nothing...\n\nNow, to preface \u2013 this play has a huge catalyst by end of this week or but is also viable for the long haul. I bet it\u2019s going to be cumming like my wife's boyfriend by Sept 22.\n\nThere are 2 companies in play here: TSLA and TSLA\u2019s soon to be meth dealer: LAC.\n\nWanna make up for those TSLA calls you got crushed on earlier this month?\n\n**WTF is LAC?**\n\nIf you\u2019re not dumb, you\u2019ll already know that LAC is a lithium miner, and IMO the one in the best position for success in the near future.\n\n1. LAC has two mines in the exploration phase, one in Argentina (49% owned, 51% owned by Chinese Li miner Ganfang - this is important for later) and one in Nevada (100% owned)\n2. LAC mines brine Li Carbonate (Li C) which should outperform the other major Li miners as they are mining Li Hydroxide (Li H) out of hard rock. The major hard rock suppliers are shutting down mines and have faced regulatory hurdles, setting up undersupply in 2-5 years in the Li market that Li C brine miners can take advantage of as demand creeps up mirroring EV demand.  \n\n   1. Li H has a marginal cost of production around $6500/t, with Li hovering around $7000/t it is no longer profitable to extract from hard rock.\n   2. Li C mined out of LAC\u2019s Argentine costs $3,576/t and in Nevada, $2,570/t.\n3. It is possible to convert Li C to Li H (which is preferred for long range batteries) at a cost ranging between $500/t - $2500/t depending on the composition of the brine.\n4. In LAC Bureau of Land Management Application in Nevada the firm lists an in-house Li C to Li H processing facility (huge competitive advantage)... it also lists a BATTERY FACTORY (&lt;- This is where stuff starts to get interesting).\n\n**LAC and TSLA: A Match Made in Heaven**\n\n1. Li is an important component in the battery supply chain, if TSLA cannot source Li it cannot build cars. Last year TSLA used approx. 23000 tonnes of Li, costing TSLA approx 300mil.\n2. The current agreement TSLA has for a Li supplier expires 21 Sept. 2020 - this agreement is with Ganfang (told you this was important).\n3. TSLA is holding a \u201cBattery Day\u201d event on 22 Sept. 2020.\n4. TSLA recently acquired Maxwell, a Li-ion battery tech company, confirming Elon\u2019s need for Li.\n5. TSLA is looking for US suppliers of Li. One of the few acquisition attempts TSLA has made was to acquire a domestic Li producer Simbol Materials (acquisition failed).\n6. The Pentagon has expressed that rare earth mining is vital to national security and should be domestically sourced as much as possible (Li being specifically named as important to national security). China controls the Li market right now, even the spot contract is priced in Yuan. This also makes the regulatory approvals for LAC easier as this is obviously a priority for this administration.\n7. LAC\u2019s Nevada mine (which will have a battery processing facility) is only around 3 hours away from the Gigafactory and holds the largest Li reserves in the US (no other mine in Nevada is even able to meet TSLA\u2019s Li needs, where LAC can produce 3x over a 40 year mine life (expected production date in early 2023)).\n8. The CTO of LAC, Rene LeBlanc, formerly worked at TSLA as a \u201cStaff Process Development Engineer\u201d where his responsibilities included:  \n\n   1. Supporting internal and external teams to identify, track and resolve technical, commercial, and organizational needs\n   2. Engage with upstream suppliers to stabilize or improve performance\n   3. Analyze market supply and demand to look for opportunities and new promising entrants\n9. The CEO of LAC has said that he cannot comment on talks with TSLA, while swallowing a smile, and saying \u201cTesla knows we are here\u201d.\n10. TSLA has been raising money (at market stock offer), perhaps to prep for some acquisitions...?\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\u2026 Put the dots together - LAC is a perfect vertical integration opportunity for TSLA in the short term and is overall is very well positioned to take advantage of increased Li demand for EVs in the mid-long term. Further, LAC is trading at around only 4.7x book value and 13 P/E\u2026 find that in another EV play.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nTSLA is likely to buy / take a stake in the mine / enter a partnership with LAC as their domestic supplier for Li, to be announced Sept 22.\n\n**Sources**\n\n[https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/article/22026386/chinese-lithium-giant-agrees-to-threeyear-pact-to-supply-tesla?fbclid=IwAR1zNDES1tR0aIUo\\_lEIVEtbATVvUnBL9jWoGa9nXfRm7BMV6WM1cui1rOQ#:\\~:text=Tesla%20will%20designate%20its%20battery,by%20three%20years%2C%20Ganfeng%20said](https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/article/22026386/chinese-lithium-giant-agrees-to-threeyear-pact-to-supply-tesla?fbclid=IwAR0klaeuk3_nDBcPMZJuk25JFgRXRleKqZokJ9GQg1aNoAxjOCaIldOw-SU#:~:text=Tesla%20will%20designate%20its%20battery,by%20three%20years%2C%20Ganfeng%20said)\n\n[https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/)\n\n[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/video/lithium-americas-ceo-we-ll-make-money-despite-price-slump\\~1897852?fbclid=IwAR1VXCNVrRN4Dz2bqZc1ncVnCxUVQjkpjZUqMSD7ZHADsykyXGFIbCVkaFM](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/video/lithium-americas-ceo-we-ll-make-money-despite-price-slump~1897852?fbclid=IwAR1VXCNVrRN4Dz2bqZc1ncVnCxUVQjkpjZUqMSD7ZHADsykyXGFIbCVkaFM)\n\n[https://electrek.co/2016/06/09/tesla-buy-simbol-lithium-startup-325-million/?fbclid=IwAR1BtqoeoBEdyFpiY2zb3k1bSPAXXcVUL4DE8LK4vNxZWbYnmpN6IH-c6-A](https://electrek.co/2016/06/09/tesla-buy-simbol-lithium-startup-325-million/?fbclid=IwAR1BtqoeoBEdyFpiY2zb3k1bSPAXXcVUL4DE8LK4vNxZWbYnmpN6IH-c6-A)\n\n**Positions**\n\nJacked up to the tits in $13 strike Oct 16 calls",

The purpose of the post was to gather information and speculation about a potential **EXPLOSIVE DREAM SHAKER** options play.\n\nFirst I would like to address the naysayers and conspiracies that have arised in the wake of a ***frustrating*** quad witching/bloody/currency fluctuating trading day.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9p1tut46xdo51.jpg?width=622&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eda1b638655ec8708ed985290831aec3d3d9933\n\n\u201c**Multiple People**\u201d\n\nFor full transparency, the DD post was written by me, however three of my trading friends kept sending me links and DD that they were finding. So while there is some truth to your statement, it is nowhere near as sinister as imagined.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nfcxu287xdo51.jpg?width=618&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5550e115d1eeeac654ee683624668d5b50dc2b22\n\n**\u201cThe Awards\u201d**\n\nI have no idea why people dump money on awards. Personally I think it is gay and I would rather put that money in a VALE yolo. When the post initially went live, all was well and it was on it\u2019s way to being #1. People were praising me as \u201cDD god\u201d and the comments piling in. About 6 hours after the post went live, it started to get \u201clost\u201d behind other satire posts and low quality content. I was confused as to why because the post seemed like it was getting a lot of traction and appreciation. (97% upvote ratio) My theory is that somehow it was being pushed down. I have no evidence for this claim but this could explain the crazy award to like ratio.\u00a0\n\n**\u201cBoofin on Vyvanse\u201d**\n\nCan confirm this is accurate. The smoke on the west coast makes going outside very uncomfortable (coming from someone who doesn\u2019t like huddling indoors) I decided to start writing the DD at 1am. Wrote an outline. Woke up for the market open, spent 16 hours writing it and not trading. Read over it and then decided to post the next day.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tz63hl9xdo51.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d17e9915eab55b60127d708bcd0f9e465d37dab9\n\nu/nanaboostme\n\nu/nanaboostme has been my biggest follower since I posted the $VALE DD. He/She believes that I am the \u201celaborate RKT post\u201d.\u00a0\n\n* At the time of RKT chatter, I was working overtime and had no time to play options. I never even saw the RKT post.\n* Never once have I traded RKT or even had it on my watchlist\n* u/nanaboostme has no evidence to support his claim. Unless we are doing guilty until proven innocent in WSB, I do not think I need to say more.\n\n**\"Outsider\"**\n\n[Video of me doing a flip in the rain](https://imgur.com/4jTsmXi)\n\n**\u201cUnprofitable Theta Gang Ploy\u201d**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fj5a22ucxdo51.jpg?width=620&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b4a64e75506b6c4e5e8f37b149385f5d9ee83b8\n\nSince the inception of the VALE DD post, the day of, ***NO*** new contracts in the 9/25 chain have been opened. O/I stayed at 2863 and volume was some outrageous 30,000-40,000. Selling theta on those would have granted you a whopping 0.0083% return before option fees. My portfolio also shows I have no short calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwl2legexdo51.jpg?width=1664&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=674ddc115083a35d2bc5db837aeb1a6f3d5cd0f0\n\n**PRPL Vibes**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg84n8iixdo51.jpg?width=1082&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ea009c681e20cf9dbfd7341e73b15b51c43d95a\n\nI am aware that there are legitimate pump and dump schemes that pass through r/wallstreetbets quarterly. I usually do not buy into DD posts. It's not my style. It can work very well though as seen with VALE on 9/17/2020. In fact I was the one who called Tanker gangs bluff, they had run too hard into ER and it was so predictable The post has since been deleted but I commented my take on it and got downvoted to earth's core.\n\n**\u201cWhen they send pumpers, they\u2019re not sending their best, folks\u201d**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9oera5sjxdo51.jpg?width=1081&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1d209998b992d67a0cd095007e340fff2e4872c\n\nu/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY warns \u201cbe careful who you take \u201cadvice\u201d from\u201d. My post is educational and entertaining. No where in the post did I rush readers to BUY IN QUICK or to ACT FAST. I even had a disclaimer at the bottom:\n\n\u201c disclaimer: none of this is financial advice, this is for educational and entertainment purposes only. nothing in this post should be construed as financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any sort of security or investment.\u201d\n\n**Why did** u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY **post this?**\n\nThe night of 9/17/20, I wanted to create humor around the culture of $VALE GANG, so I made a video post titled \u201c[$VALE GANG TRAILER](https://www.reddit.com/user/ExtraEgg/comments/ivcga3/vale_gang_trailer/)\u201d. This was shadowbanned from the subreddit and was only viewable if you had a direct link. :/\n\nI end up deleting the post and telling my friend to post it. Everyone is loving it, tons of feedback, medals, upvotes. WSB comradery was at an all time high.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5u9apc8nxdo51.jpg?width=918&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40da4139771c904b5742bda9b9a526a7333505f4\n\nThen suddenly we notice the post is not available on the Top, Hot, sort by new. Nowhere to be found. A couple minutes later it was outright deleted. I message a couple mods, no response. My friend who posted $VALE GANG TRAILER got *banned* from r/wallstreetbets.\n\n**Quote a fallen soldier**\n\n\"On the pinned \u201cadvice\u201d post, Mods heavily implied with only omission of name that Vale was a pump and dump and attacked my credibility and motives, when pressed in the comments they backtracked. Saying that my post was well made and they had no issues with it, however this is not true. I was shadow banned for my post and refused explanation from mods at all.\"[From this youtube video](https://youtu.be/VOhModuPCno)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0gy05m6qxdo51.jpg?width=821&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9de21b20ff00b3c39abd81956a9d7cd37760ee2b\n\nThen u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY posts his pinned post about being wary with \u201cadvice\u201d. I get to respond once in the comments. A couple minutes later u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY responds and *locks* the post. This was the start of the chaos.\n\nAlso, the VALE DD post was buried as well, bad algo? Or jealous mods? Only assuming because the conversation was cut short.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Video not on hot](https://imgur.com/n2EEzib)(videos were being (fucky) [Video not on day top](https://imgur.com/zv5CKpF) \n\n**\u201cHe\u2019s a Fraud!\u201d**\n\nAfter u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY\u2019s post went live, I was bombarded with naysayers and angry individuals. No, I am *not* selling you those dirt cheap contracts. No, I am not working for Goldman Sachs. No, I am not using WSB to bring volume into an options chain. One of my main reasons for entry in $VALE was the unusual activity coming from whales.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dbru0bttxdo51.jpg?width=1036&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc3da2d913c8ed5fe6e9c8a1eb9087087c8c9609\n\nThe 1/15/21 chain was especially flooded with whale volume. I will explain the updated whale activity down below in the DD. I am still holding my positions and do not need WSB to pump my contracts. I\u2019m relying on a price action movement to bring intrinsic value into my contract. I\u2019M NOT FUCKING SELLING!\n\n[**Shifting burden of persuasion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_burden_of_persuasion)\n\nWhen I am accused of shilling/pumping/being an outsider/pumping/baiting/selling contracts to buyers, the need for evidence or fact is absent. There is no evidence that indicates I was intentionally posting the DD with sinister motives. However, now that I am on my heels with no factual claims being made, I have to rewrite the constitution to prove my innocence. If a Mod wants to remove/shadowban, ideally they must have some evidence in order to do so. Otherwise their range of power is larger than acceptable. They could ban or *not ban* anything without justification or evidence. If abused this is a very dangerous system of management. The Mods shift the burden of persuasion on the author who is banned from the subreddit and has no platform to preach. Technically what I am doing is against WSB rules. Posting on an alt account if your main is banned. I had to deliver though, too many eager eyes waiting for this follow up. To conclude, WSB ban policy needs to be reworked.\n\n**If my credibility is restored, continue to read the updated DD**\n\n**What was missed in first post**\n\nA theory was floating around that the $5 billion in debt that [VALE paid off](https://www.reuters.com/article/vale-brazil-debt/brazils-miner-vale-to-pay-creditors-and-reset-revolving-credit-lines-filing-idUKL1N2GB0SA), was funded by Tesla. The debt was disbursed in March 2020, during the covid crash. $2 billion was due by June 2022 and $3 billion was due December 2024. Tesla raised $5 billion capital through shares. Tesla said they intend to use the cash to \u201cstrengthen its balance sheet and for general corporate purposes\u201d. That is a pretty broad statement. An analyst from Roth Capital partners said \u201cThey will need cash for all the facilities they are building, and **new growth initiatives**,\u201d([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/tesla-stock/tesla-launches-5-billion-capital-raise-tapping-in-on-share-surge-idUSKBN25S4W2))\n\nThe connection people were making, is that Tesla raised capital to give Vale. Both articles wet public within 24 hours of each other.\n\n\u201c**VALE DRILLING :(\u201d**\u00a0\n\nYes but no. After a shoot up in the morning, VALE fell for a couple of reasons\n\n* Entire Market was bloody\n* Quad witching madness\n* Exchange rate fluctuations\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xb0perowxdo51.jpg?width=368&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00ecbba08c28d7205431ceeb9818929d7fd635c2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flfiv9gxxdo51.jpg?width=692&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0544f56dfcb616ec78000761467f01be4bb766ca\n\nClose price on the brazilian exchange was 61.66/5.3876 =$11.44\u00a0\n\nThis is why after hours, VALE was hanging around 11.44 but now the dip is being bought so it is back up to $11.59. **What to take away:** Vales down movement today was closer to -0.69%. The rest was currency fluctuation. A little unfortunate but that\u2019s what we get for playing a brazilian rock farm.**What were the whales doing?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syidbj4zxdo51.png?width=1812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dc4710c842fecef2e411c94adc45cc716225bcb\n\nToday from market open until 9:55, ALL the FlowAlgo was bullish\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe whales were also buying into the 10/16 call contracts HARD. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. While the Najarian brothers live by following the Smart Money, it seems like it could be a lure.\u00a0\n\nWhales probably know we love VALE and they saw the 10/16 chain was empty, so they got in and are going to price fix it now, like how you would price fix the market in FIFA Ultimate Team.\u00a0\n\n10/16 also does not cover any earnings or special dates, just random.\u00a0\n\nToday was another high volume day for shares and options.\u00a0\n\nVolume: 46,142,890\n\nOptions volume\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yrgkxkc1ydo51.jpg?width=829&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24178d0e093b3238131d6efb2f93796ca9eca61e\n\nWhile the general sentiment among the options chain is bullish, there was an increase in p/c ratio for O/I\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oeqg7c34ydo51.jpg?width=204&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=007805ab2c362fb12a8f8435c755a5b141921c26\n\nWhat this means is that the majority of trading was bullish today. Roughly 1 put was traded for every 11 calls. However, the open interest is now showing Roughly 1.17 puts exist for every 1 call. Whether these are \u201csell to open\u201d puts is another question. The general sentiment in the options chain is still bullish. P/C ratio can be very misleading, going into ERIC Q2, the P/C was 11. That means there were 11 puts for every 1 call. ERIC beat earnings and then gapped up.\u00a0\n\nMy reaction to today\u2019s movement was the following. A perfect day to scare retail traders away,\u00a0\n\nFriday nerves holding into the weekend combined with a currency fluctuation. Buy low, sell high.\u00a0\n\nI bought more positions today.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What\u2019s keeping me bullish?**\n\nEverything from my initial DD post and some new information is keeping me bullish. VALE is not a meme stock. They are pretty well established and very large, just underlooked by retail. Whales continuing to pile in is keeping me bullish, along with the sneaky upgrades from Thursday and [Friday](https://zolmax.com/investing/vale-nysevale-upgraded-by-zacks-investment-research-to-strong-buy/4807283.html).\n\nGIGA metals is extremely bearish right now, CEO and Execs sold shares at the top and they have been getting beat down for three straight days.\n\n**Najarian** is very outspoken about his VALE position on CNBC. 2 days in a row he mentioned it. He is both long stock and long calls.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VALE EV PRESENTATION 2018**\n\nA lot of good information on demand for nickel was in [Vale\u2019s presentation](http://www.vale.com/EN/investors/information-market/presentations-webcast/PresentationsWebcastsDocs/BofA%20-%20May%202018%20-%20Bob%20Morris%20vFinal_i.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hkp7yuv6ydo51.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4306c23d6f37d697c8af77145f0ce1827711ddb\n\nThe Nickel demand in 2018 was benchmarked at 38 in comparison to a 260/590 (conservative/upside) by 2025 and 890/1700 by 2030.\n\nNickel demand for batteries wass 3% of the market in 2017. It is projected to be 37% of the market in 2030.\u00a0\n\nVale gives a disclaimer that the variance of range is 50% to the upside and 50% to the conservative side.\u00a0\n\nThis growth alone is reason to long VALE.\n\n**WSB comments**\n\nBecause I am banned, I cannot see the comments anymore. However, their were some interesting comments in the original VALE DD post. Those that I recall are\n\n* Friend works at VALE, can\u2019t say anything but I am holding a lot of calls\n* Apparently, there was a meeting in toronto between VALE and Tesla\n* Someone said that he orders 70k every month (or year I forgot) from VALE and they are a good company\u00a0\n\nInterpret how you will, comments could be fake.\n\n**Ex Dividend date**\n\nMany expressed concern that the ex dividend date would be devastating for the 9/25 calls. This is true, but at the same time if the big news comes out on batteryday/ex date. The price action could plow through ex date. This is also why I have longer expiration calls.\n\nIn Tesla\u2019s Q2 earnings call, they mentioned the word \u201cnickel\u201d that alone was enough to get the mining stocks to move up.\n\n**If nothing happens**\n\nIf there is no mention of VALE or nickel on battery day, the stock will be hard to dump because VALE has 5 billion outstanding shares. Compared to LAC, who rallied 10% on Friday, the have 90 million outstanding shares.\n\n**THE TWEETS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/un5h51t8ydo51.jpg?width=364&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a1cf38a9dbc056e7d4863b48affe5b0ce27fa03\n\n\u201cSpeedrunning Factorio in real life \u2026\u201d\n\nFactorio\u2019s game description\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zw68pm5aydo51.jpg?width=544&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62feefd344e670b72d0009e926e425774eb609cf\n\n**I rest my case**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nVALE has potential for explosive movement on 9/22. If nothing happens on 9/22 there is still reason to long the stock and load up on longer expiration calls/leaps and continue to roll.\n\n**Positions**\n\nVALE shares, 9/25 $13.00c, 1/15/21 $12.00c, 3/19/21 $12.00c, 10/2 $11.50c\n\ndisclaimer: none of this is financial advice, this is for educational and entertainment purposes only. nothing in this post should be construed as financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any sort of security or investment.",

        "selftext": "I don\u2019t really know how to start this or structure it so if this comes out as a jumbled mess I\u2019m sorry. \n\nI started trading back around late may/ early June of this year. I\u2019m 19 and I wanted a way to make a little bit of passive income. I threw $100 into Webull and started trading. Over the next month I would lose over $700. I kept throwing more and more money in my account after every loss. I know now that 20% on one trade is really good, but when 20% is only $40 or so, I don\u2019t see it as big money. I\u2019d make a couple trades that hit that sweet 100%+ mark and got addicted to chasing that high again, which always resulted in me diamond hands-ing into a substantial loss. Come mid July I decided to open a Robin Hood account.\n\nMy Robinhood play through started out incredibly well actually. Options went up a lot quicker than just regular trading (especially when ford drops the Bronco). After my first three days I\u2019d already tripled my initial $50 deposit. But once again my greed came back to haunt me. Instead of being happy with a 200% week I decided to keep trading FD\u2019s late into the week, which is when I \u201clearned\u201d about theta and IV. This process continued for another month: make it big early in the week, get greedy and blow my account back down. I got back into my old habit of funding whenever I got \u201ctoo low\u201d but the big kicker came when my RH account became restricted. Not being able to sell same day fucked me over, but I kept trading on RH until I decided to go back to Webull (not before losing another couple hundred dollars). (I\u2019d also like to note that I was now trading options on Webull)\n\nLast Monday I sat with about $150 in my account. I told myself that I was done being greedy and I was going to start settling for 20% profit. By Friday I was left $47. Monday I bought a $535 Tesla call for $36, anticipating a run up for battery day next week. I could\u2019ve sold my call for $350+ on Tuesday, but I went full retard and told myself that it was gonna run all week and I\u2019d get a $2,000 payout. Today my account has $2.98. \n\nI honestly feel like I\u2019m a moron, I have no idea why I just can\u2019t sell when I\u2019m up.  If I would\u2019ve just taken my profit every time I honestly think I\u2019d have at least 5k in my account, I don\u2019t make terrible trades I just hold for too long. I\u2019ve lost track of how much money I\u2019ve lost but I know it\u2019s in the $1,000-1,400 range. Which doesn\u2019t sound like a lot compared to most of the loss porn on here, but that\u2019s a lot for a college kid who is only working once every 2 weeks since school has started back up. \n\nI cried twice out of frustration this morning, which wasn\u2019t all because of stonks, but 50% of it was because it\u2019s just been accumulating in my head all summer.\n\nIf you read this whole thing, thank you. I just really needed to get all of this off my chest, I figured I\u2019d come here since there\u2019s a lot of people who can relate to my situation. \n\nSince I\u2019m barely working I can\u2019t really afford to fund an account any longer and I don\u2019t really know what to do. I guess I\u2019ll just be out of the game for awhile. If anyone has any advice please shove it down my throat (no homo), if you don\u2019t have any advice and just wanna call me a retard after reading this feel free to that as well.\n\nOnce again apologies if this is a mess, I kinda just poured out what\u2019s been going through my mind all week.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone.  I'm a mechanical engineering student with a hobby interest in finance.  I've spent the last few days figuring out if Nikola's leasing model is actually possible.  There's some really wacky stuff going on in Nikola's presentations and financial projections, and I wanted to share my findings.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is an absolute wall of words, and I wouldn't be offended if you didn't want to read it all.  In the first half, I try to tease out the cost per mile of an actual Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) given the specification Nikola lists.   Next there is a portion where I look at the discrepancies between their Financial Projections and their Lease breakdown.   Then a quick little peanut gallery where I look at their unrealistic assumptions and the hypocrisy of their comparisons.  Finally, a more serious portion where I discuss the design, efficiency, and utility implications of Nikola's chosen power output and battery capacity.  Hope you guys enjoy!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's get started:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hydrogen costs:**\n\nAccording to the DoE, it currently costs $5.10/kg to produce, compress, and dispense hydrogen.  Nikola claims they can do this for $2.47/kg.  I highly doubt their estimate, and will elaborate on that later.  Hydrogen has a specific energy 33.3 kWh/kg.  A Fuel cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) has an average thermal efficiency of 55%.  A diesel semi tractor, which easily compares to Nikola\u2019s offerings, consumes about 1.25 kWh of work per km (or 2.125 per mile) of useful work loaded.  \n\nThis implies the Nikola truck will use 3.86 kWh of hydrogen per mile, at a cost of $0.59 per mile, or $.29 using their estimates.  The DoE estimate could be pretty rosy as well, Hindenburg cited a practical price of $16 per kg for hydrogen in their report.  Nikola\u2019s estimate in the leasing breakdown is 7.5 miles per kg of hydrogen @ $2.47 per kg.  That works out to $.33/mile.  Our estimates are pretty close, excluding hydrogen costs.  It looks like, in a surprising twist, they actually overestimated the energy consumption of a tractor.  Or maybe not.  We\u2019ll get to that  \n\nICCT Tractor-Trailer Fuel Consumption:  https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EU\\_HDV\\_Testing\\_BriefingPaper\\_20180515a.pdf\n\nWhy do I doubt their hydrogen cost estimates?  $2.5 per kg implies $.075 per kWh of hydrogen produced  The average price for Industrial electricity in Arizona, the state they are headquartered in, was $.068/kWh, some of the cheapest in the US.  Of course, there isn\u2019t a 1:1 conversion of electricity to hydrogen: an electrolyzer uses about 50 kWh per kg of hydrogen ( specific energy of 33.3kWh/kg), making the electricity expense alone in excess of $.10 per kWh of hydrogen.  Electricity must also be used to compress the hydrogen.  This would take another \\~4 kWh, though we\u2019re already over budget.  God forbid they use California electricity at an average cost of $.15 per kWh.  The electricity expense for the Electrolyzers alone exceeds their estimates, much less depreciation expense, cost of capital, maintenance expense, salary expense, etc.  Clearly a bogus number.  \n\nI suppose they can use renewable excess during off-hours for cheap, but the rapidly decreasing costs of energy storage will likely level out those low prices rather quickly.  This also only works in Arizona and a select few other states; California not included.  There is the issue of a startup paying to build huge electrolyzers that might have a utilization factor of \\~30%, and additional high pressure storage will be needed.  The abhorrent upfront capex needed to try and drive down operating costs is not viable for them.      \n\nEIA electricity prices nationwide:  [https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm\\_table\\_grapher.php?t=epmt\\_5\\_3](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_3)\n\nNREL H2 cost analysis from 2011.  This is just about the most recent research I can find.  The abject lack of new material tells me it\u2019s not exactly a hoppin\u2019 field:  [https://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/production-cost-analysis.html#fn3](https://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/production-cost-analysis.html#fn3)\n\n**Fuel Cell costs:**\n\nPart of the reason there are currently so few FCVs on the road today is the limited service life of a fuel cell.  Fuel cells are precision manufactured components that degrade quickly when jostled &amp; vibrated too violently.  This is not good when combined with the rock-hard suspensions of semi tractors.     \n\nThe DoE targets a useful life of 150,000 miles for a fuel cell.  Currently, there is no information confirming this target has been met.  A Toyota Murai comes with a 100,000 mile warranty on its FC.  For the sake of argument, I will assume Nikola FCs can meet this target.  The DoE targets a cost of $40/kW for fuel cell production in 2020, provided mass hits 500,000.  This hasn\u2019t happened yet, but I will again assume this to give Nikola the best chance.  As an aside:  Nikola\u2019s decision to use exclusively GM FC technology in their Badger pickup indicates to me they have nothing \u201cup their sleeve\u201d to make the technology more viable, despite my optimistic assumptions.\n\nI\u2019ll assume the Nikola Two\u2019s Fuel cell is 500 kW, less than the 750 kW claimed output.  I think it  likely their horsepower claim will be a peak power figure only achievable when the motors draw on the battery &amp; FC.  I cannot confirm this, because Nikola does not list the output of their motors and FC separately (along with myriad other questionable, or lack of, claims).  I think this is reasonable, considering FC thermal efficiency is maximized between 20% and 30% load, and a semi will average \\~90 kW of useful work required on the highway, translating to \\~170 kW of FC usage.  This is near the peak efficiency band of a PEMFC.  This assumption also allows steady-state operation at 66% of the \u201crated\u201d output.  This implies an upfront cost of $20,000.  A targeted useful life of 150,000 miles implies a depreciation expense of $.13 per mile.  \n\nNREL Stack Durability and Performance vs load chart:  [https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/73011.pdf](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/73011.pdf)\n\n**Battery costs:**\n\nUsing BNEF 2023 battery cost estimates of $100/kWh, that equates to $25,000 of battery expense.  Assuming a useful life of .25M miles, more than any existing warranty currently covers, that results in a depreciation expense of $.125 per mile.  \n\n**Chassis and the rest:**  \n\nLastly, I extrapolated an FCEV COGS of $175,000 per truck from their Financial projections, minus the $45,000 of equipment already listed, and a 15% scrap value I pulled out of my ass to try and help nikola here, leaves $104,000 depreciated over 700k miles, or a $.15 depreciation expense per mile.\n\n**Maintenance costs:**\n\nNikola assumed a $.061/mile maintenance cost.  Any engineer should be able to see such a claim and immediately question it.  Tires alone should account for $.03 per mile.  That leaves\u2026. $.031 for brakes, air lines, HVAC, wiring, electrical equipment, motors, inverters, those battery and FC expenses I already calculated, sensors, etc.  They make no additional provisions for the battery/FC in their leasing breakdown.  Pure, unadulterated bullshit.   The ICCT puts BEV per mile maintenance at \\~$.19/mile.  How they squeezed 70% of those costs out, as an unproven startup, by going for a more complex FC-BEV hybrid is beyond me.  \n\nCost of trucking:  [https://www.thetruckersreport.com/infographics/cost-of-trucking/](https://www.thetruckersreport.com/infographics/cost-of-trucking/)\n\nNikola Leasing cost breakdown, p19:  [https://d32st474bx6q5f.cloudfront.net/nikolamotor/uploads/investor/presentation/presentation\\_file/5/NikolaInvestorRoadShowPresentation042720.pdf](https://d32st474bx6q5f.cloudfront.net/nikolamotor/uploads/investor/presentation/presentation_file/5/NikolaInvestorRoadShowPresentation042720.pdf)\n\n**Leasing Conclusions:** \n\nAdding their laughably low per mile maintenance expense of .061 + .15 + .125 + .13 +.59  gives us an aggregate $1.06 per mile expense for Nikola.  Using their fuel expense estimate of $.29, this equates to $.76; still more than their projected gross expenses.  The first estimate is 50% over they need for their claimed 30% gross margin at $.95 per mile.  Note:  I used a projected battery expense, projected FC service life target, and projected FC production expense.  None of these have been met.  I used the average resitive forces acting on a US tractor-trailer, which appear to be lower than the number Nikola uses.  I did not include warranty expenses in my estimate.  Additionally, these are EXPENSES, and includes 0 profit for the suppliers of these parts.  The GM-Nikola deal clearly shows there will be little vertical integration in their production, and such allowances would have to be made. \n\nA more reasonable estimate, including a still optimistic 3% interest expense for truck capex, a .4% annual warranty expense (corresponding to their presented 3% estimated reserve).  That reserve, btw, is very optimistic:  Tesla used a higher reserve on the S for years, while building a simpler product with a warranty length/distance a literal order of magnitude lower than the Nikola truck.  A \\*STILL\\* low maintenance expense of $.12, and a 10% margin for battery &amp; FC production, we end up with an **$.92** per mile expense, or more than Nikola can afford, even when using their untenable $2.5 per kg hydrogen estimate.  This is before G&amp;A expenses.  Their leasing business model is not possible.  \n\n**Lease Projections v. Income Projections:  Internal Chaos or Outright Fraud?**\n\nIt\u2019s possible some of the folks at Nikola have already found those problems out, though.  Nikola says they have plans to Lease their trucks.  They\u2019ve had presentation slides including the idea, and their truck descriptions on their website include a leasing plan.  In their most recent presentation at the DB Global Auto Industry Conference in June, however, the Leasing cost breakdown slide was conspicuously missing.  Their Financial projections slide showed 2,000 FCEV trucks being produced in 2023, and 470 million in revenue from FCEV sales.  This represents $235,000 per truck, and their FCEV revenue scales exactly linearly into their 2024 projected sales; no room for residual from the 2023 trucks.  **They\u2019re projecting to sell them!**  Revenue from maintenance and Hydrogen sales are also listed separately.  Their Financial projections clearly show the upfront sale of trucks with additional Hydrogen fueling and maintenance revenue, and the leasing model slide has disappeared.  It\u2019s easy to see why.  Their projected combined expenses and capex exceeds $7.5 billion through 2024, significantly more than their current $1 Billion in assets and a couple of lease payments would allow for.  This would take some intense share dilution (not something I think Trevor would be on board with) or extremely expensive leverage.  \n\nIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to get cheap loans secured against their proprietary trucks, requiring their proprietary stations, to run only their customers\u2019 preset routes.  A bank wouldn\u2019t want that kind of collateral.  The leasing idea is a real mess.\n\nNikla DB presentation, projections are 2nd to last page:  [https://d32st474bx6q5f.cloudfront.net/nikolamotor/uploads/investor/presentation/presentation\\_file/7/Nikola\\_and\\_VectoIQ\\_Conference\\_Presentation\\_DB\\_Global\\_Auto\\_Conference\\_\\_6.10.2020\\_.pdf](https://d32st474bx6q5f.cloudfront.net/nikolamotor/uploads/investor/presentation/presentation_file/7/Nikola_and_VectoIQ_Conference_Presentation_DB_Global_Auto_Conference__6.10.2020_.pdf)\n\nOne can claim that the lease model is still in the description of the trucks, but so are battery and fuel cell specifications for the Nikola one.  The Nikola one was, ostensibly, never actually powered by hydrogen, and development has since been abandoned.  It looks like their leasing Idea may have been abandoned as well.         \n\nI\u2019ll also point out that an expected 2024 FCEV maintenance revenue of 56 million on 7000 trucks sold, assuming an average of 50,000 miles per truck sold in 2024 (the average mileage if the trucks are sold at a constant rate through the FY) and 100,000 per truck in 2023, equates to 12.4 cents per mile, more than double the $.061 projected maintenance costs in the april lease presentation.  Either they plan on making a killing from maintenance, or there was some aggressive re-shuffling of numbers when maintenance went from an expense to revenue stream, or vice versa.\n\nThe same analysis of hydrogen expenses puts their per kg revenue at $4.08.  Still low, but a hefty sum above their $2.47 cost average on the leasing slide.  \n\nIf we use their projected FCEV maintenance revenue of $.124, $4.08 per kg H2 revenue, and $235,000 truck price depreciated over 7 years w/no interest expense, **the cost of ownership, according to their income projections, is $1 per mile** for a 100,000 mile year.  **More than they say a diesel will cost**.  OOPS!\n\nThat\u2019s most of what I wanted to talk about.  It\u2019s pretty clear that Nikola cannot possibly make a profit with their lease model, and Nikola\u2019s finance department has indirectly acknowledged this.  Hydrogen tech is still many, many years away.  Nikola\u2019s move fast and break things approach (though I\u2019m not convinced we\u2019ve seen much moving outside of gravity assists) will end up a \u201cmove fast and bankrupt things\u201d strategy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI now want to take a few moments to look at some of the sillier things I found in my research:  \n\nIn a laughably exuberant turn of events, Nikola projects 25% gross margins during their first year of production.  That\u2019s downright cute!  They plan on, ostensibly, slapping GM FCs &amp; batteries on IVECO platforms, and beating the margins of all publicly traded auto companies sans Ferrari within a few months of production start.  It's that easy.  Get your shit together, Ford! \n\nOn Nikola\u2019s website under their trucks, they have a comparison of FCs, BEVs, and Diesel where they seem to forget their trucks have hundreds of kWhs of battery storage onboard.  They claim \u201cHydrogen acts as a buffer and grid balance,\u201d while \u201cbatteries are a drain on the grid.\u201d  You heard it hear first, folks, batteries can\u2019t be used as a grid buffer, only a grid drain.  They also claim H2 is the \u201cmost abundant element on the planet,\u201d while \u201cBatteries \\[are\\] made of non-renewable resources; dangerous/costly to mine.\u201d  Makes me wonder why they chose to put so many on their trucks.  Also hilariously hypocritical, considering Platinum -required for PEMFCs- is one of the rarest metals on earth.\n\n**Design considerations and odd choices:**  \n\nI want to take a moment to talk about chassis design and the implications of Nikola\u2019s set power parameters.  And I want to start with a quote from Elon Musk during the Tesla Semi reveal:  \n\n\u201cWe designed the Tesla truck like a bullet,\u201d Musk said. \u201cA normal diesel truck is designed like a barn wall.\u201d The Tesla Semi is more aerodynamic than a $2 million Bugatti Chiron sports car, he said. \n\nA bold claim, but I believe this to be correct.  Cheesy, but correct.  Why?  Cooling requirements.  The more cooling air you need, the less favorable aerodynamics you\u2019ll have.  In the simple representation of an engine, there is a fuel input, a work output, and a heat output.  A gas engine  -especially one not designed with fuel efficiency in mind like the Chiron\u2019s- will likely only output \\~20-25% of its fuel input as a work output.  The Chiron makes 1,500 hp, and needs to reject 4,500-6,000 hp of heat at full throttle.  The goal of a Chiron isn\u2019t to slip through the air, au contraire.  It\u2019s designed suck in as much air as possible for cooling and brute it\u2019s way to 270 mph through raw horsepower.  Most modern sedans have more favorable aerodynamics than a Bugatti.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, about 90% of the inputs from an EV charger make it to the wheels -- a major factor that makes EVs so efficient.  This means Elon can put, for example, 1000 hp of motors in his truck and only worry about rejecting 100 hp of heat at full load, an easy task.  That\u2019s less cooling than a Prius needs, and the truck can be designed with virtually zero air input constraints.  He can swing his \u201c3x the acceleration\u201d dick around, and the only tradeoff is beefier driveline bits for the extra torque and bigger motors. \n\nC\\_D lists on wikipedia:  Note almost every production car below Cd=.24 is either a small displacement diesel or electric.  No supercars in sight.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile\\_drag\\_coefficient \n\nThe Chiron\u2019s standard Cd is .38.  A 1995 ford windstar minivan has a standard Cd of .35.  Not exactly a prestigious club, haha:  \n\nhttps://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/car-technology/a32329/these-rare-development-photos-tell-the-full-bugatti-chiron-story/\n\nHydrogen is a different story.  The thermal efficiency of a FCEV -above 50% load- will dip down into the 40-50% range.  The average efficiency of a diesel truck is \\~45%, and it will dip to \\~35% at max rpm, full load.  \u2018Ever seen the video where Trevor says the production trucks won\u2019t need as much cooling as their current prototypes?  He\u2019s lying through his teeth.  A 1000 hp FC would need more than 1000 hp of cooling; as much if not more than a 500hp diesel.  500 hp diesels are already built like a brick with a front aftercooler &amp; radiator the size of a football field.  Trevor\u2019s dick swinging has major consequences.  More cooling means more drag, more weight in heat sinks/radiators, and more power draw to move coolant.  These all create positive feedback loops, e.g. more air requirements mean less favorable aerodynamics &amp; more drag, which means more power draw at speed, which means more cooling, which means more air requirements...  It\u2019s not all fun and games like the pure BEV Tesla is making.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaimler\u2019s recently announced H2 semi offering only has 300 kW, and they can recycle their waste heat to warm up incoming liquid hydrogen, Nikola uses compressed hydrogen and won\u2019t have the same luxury.  Running so much horsepower is a real head scratcher; one would think their head of R&amp;D\u2019s only experience was pouring concrete or something.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note US tractor-trailers are hard capped at 80,000 lbs.  This means that every pound of tractor weight is a pound taken from potential cargo.  Y\u2019know\u2026 the part that actually makes money.  One has to wonder why Nikola is keeping \\~5000 lbs of batteries on the tractor; their website showed they aren\u2019t fans of the stuff.  It\u2019s enough to run a loaded tractor two full hours on battery alone, more than a regenerative braking system would require or power peaking during a hill climb.  It\u2019s dumb; 100 kWh would be more than enough when an on-demand primemover like a hydrogen cell is also onboard.  It\u2019s an expensive and opulent display to the vexation of customers, who would, in all likelihood, much prefer an extra 2 tons of cargo capacity.                      \n\nFeatures like 1000 hp and 250 kWh of battery appeal more to retail investors than trucking companies.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nActual conclusion time:  I think that I pretty conclusively showed that: \n\n1. Nikola\u2019s hydrogen cost projections are bogus.  There isn\u2019t even enough money there to pay for the electrolysis and compression, much less maintenance, depreciation, or labor.\n2. Nikola\u2019s leasing costs undercutting diesel is bogus.  One can disprove that with their own financial projections, much less the real costs of FCs and H2 electrolysis.  \n3. Nikola\u2019s plan to lease the trucks is totally divorced from reality, according to their own financial projections.  \n4. Nikola\u2019s projected per mile operating &amp; maintenance expenses are beyond indefensible.\n5. A myriad of odd, marketing focused design choices limit the trucks on-road efficiency and utility to potential customers. \n\nIf you made it this far, congrats!",

        "selftext": "Not sure when all the casual people will catch on, but Intel's big announcement(which was a shitty window dressed marketing power point presentation) came off as insecure, petty, and scared.  They mentioned AMDs name like 37 times, used the words \"our competitors\" 17 times, and called AMD \"imitators\"\n\nThey claimed to be above benchmarks because \"benchmarks dont show real world application\" and then proceeded to use a bunch of their own benchmarks in a real shady way...a bunch of misleading versions of their own benchmarks vs a rivals laptop they gimped up.\n\nFirst, they kept claiming the AMD they used was their \"top\" one, when there are 4 skus AMD makes better and they used a lower watt version. They cut the ram down by 20% on the AMD they tested just because too.\n\nIntel put this disclaimer on their site\n \n\" Software and workloads used in performance tests may have been optimized for performance only on Intel\u00ae microprocessors.\"\n\nYeah dude, and my PS4 runs a lot faster than Xbox One  I poured beer on, placed a bunch of magnets on, and then hit with a hammer a bunch of times. 3x faster, 2.77 more efficiency, 300% better vs the xbox I measured all the features as a vague 1.0.\n\n\nNVIDIA when they did their announcement never mentioned their rivals once. The benchmarks they showed were comparing their other products to the new one.\n\n Intel is scared. AMD, ARM, NVIDIA, AWS, are coming for big chunks of markets Intel gets its $$$$ from and their idea is to do the equivalent of \"alternate facts\" while coming off like someone obsessed with their ex.\n\nNow no one can predict the exact time all  the common people will see through Intel's bullshit, so I cant give you an exact date for you to do an FD on. Im very bullish and long on AMD.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are a couple things Intel's new thing(they cant even get their name right because all their shit is like the IG48800UX+ or the IS4800UGX or some alien shit) does well...you just have to go out of your way to find those things because Intel is too busy trash talking AMD and running their own sketchy benchmarks (while saying benchmarks are unrealistic in the same breath) instead of promoting these things as much as they should. Maybe also give your stuff names your own people can remember instead of naming it like two Star Wars droids combined into one?

        "selftext": "Attention to all. For those of you who are trying to process what is happening right now let me break it down for you. \n\nTesla= What Netflix did to Blockbuster. And blockbuster is currently ever vehicle manufacture on the planet right now. You just don\u2019t see it yet. \n\nThe other day I posted a thoughtful question regarding the long term consequences in the event that Elon created a new ground breaking battery and what that effect that would have on big oil/other vehicle manufactures. The responses varied. \n\nSome of you are mad about this solely because you lost money on the stock in the short term. You failed to account for the fact that Tesla is already worth 40% of the entire vehicle market which means the market has already priced this day in. The good news is it's only going to get better from here. \n\nAny company that did not already make the necessary pivot to the EV world is completely fucked. Any of them that did make the pivot will now have to forget everything known about battery tech and start from scratch. This 25k vehicle with the advanced battery and imporved recharge time, extended range, and the fact that it's all made in house and from an abundant resource is going to change the game forever. Also, very few people go from electric back to gas driven so that means every person they grab is a permanent EV driver. \n\n***This is going to decimate the vehicle market.*** and by cornering the market this will make Tesla reign supreme and lord over all. Every vehicle manufacture CEO right now is already planning their ten year exit from the space and the oil industry is about to take a Rochambeau like kick in the nuts. \n\nTesla owns the patent tech on the new batteries so in the event another manufacture tries to compete they will have to license this battery tech from Tesla = money for Tesla. \n\nEvery time Tesla drops its price by 5k it doubles the available matket. They will soon produce a vehicle for 25K which will open the market up to 4x as many people as compared to today = money for Tesla. \n\nTesla will push other auto makers out of business by manufacturing a cheaper vehicle. This will consolidate market share = Big money for Tesla. \n\nEssentially this is the best news you will ever hear as an investor. It's the best 10 year play you could ever make.\n\nSo hold your position, stop crying and look at the big picture so you can be fucking rich! \n\nFor those of you still confused think about the history of the flat screen TV. The first one was damn expensive which only allowed for a select few to purchase it. Those select few that purchased it brought in money which allowed for further R&amp;D and price reduction which opened up an even bigger class of people to afford it. That process occurred over and over and now everybody has a flat screen TV in their house. Tesla just changed the vehicle market forever.",

        "selftext": "Softbank put huge amounts of money on tech calls to drive up the price. I decided to find out how much this would effect the stock. There's currently about 50 billion dollars in calls on Tesla and 5 billion on puts. A call ATM has about .5 delta which means the market makers are force to delta hedge about 50 shares. The total delta hedge on Tesla should be about 77 billion which is about 20% of the market cap of 389 billion. Now 20% is significant, however Tesla has already fallen by 20% this week. \n\nTheres also a possibility that HFT is chasing the momentum and affecting the price. \" It is estimated that 50 percent of stock trading volume in the U.S. is currently being driven by computer-backed high frequency trading. Also known as algo or algortihmic trading. \"\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/glossary/h/high-frequency-trading](https://www.nasdaq.com/glossary/h/high-frequency-trading)\n\nEveryone knows the tech price are high. Elon sent prices into overdrive with the split. Then he announced a 5 billion dollar public offering to pay off there debt (worried about future cash issues?), which the shares will likely be priced below market value due to the volatility sending prices even lower. Elons brother sells right after the split knowing it would be ATH.\n\nMy thought process? Negative news will cause people to close there call options. TSLA won't be added to S&amp;P. People are already anticipating high volatility during election, so large institutions will hedge with puts, causing more delta hedging of the stock downward. Market makers already have low gamma exposure, which means rather than focus on reducing volatility for long term profits, they will have to sell when others sell and buy when others buy causing increased volatility which leads to lower prices. Also the dark pool index is low meaning its becoming illiquid and a crash could cause large corporations to have to sell on the actual stock market causing huge price movements. The public offering on TSLA will likely cause the stock to creep lower as well. \n\nSo a possible timeline: \n\nTuesday: TSLA drops 2-5% due to the S&amp;P news, as well as the insider trading news. Rest of the market is \"okay\" due to nothing unusual over the weekend.\n\nWednesday: Big money may pull out a bit due to the massive layoffs from airlines recently, and the knowledge of unemployment numbers on Thursday showing we are not recovering. another 3% drop in the market, 8% drop for Tesla. \n\nThursday: Bloody\n\n[https://www.squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix](https://www.squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix)",

I barely got out with anything and I think I'm done for awhile. I've noticed that over the past year, I'm obsessed with checking my Robinhood account. Every day even when I was just in stocks I was constantly thinking about it. Up until today it was a 'healthy' obsession because I was able to keep out of the red.\n\nI posted here earlier today showing my losses. (Thanks for the pity award) I'm now down 76% after trying to 'get rich quick'. I was initially up 27% before close on 8/31. Then Elon and pals decided to unload some gains and destroyed me in the process. \n\nDon't get me wrong I wasn't playing with rent money or anything but I've been telling myself I was going to use the money I lost, for a house. Now this is not an option. Time to cut back spending, maybe sell some stuff and work like hell at my day job. \n\nThis whole situation sucks but it may be necessary for me to realize I shouldn't be constantly gambling, even if I'm up at the time. I think I'm gonna use this time to focus on my health and work out alittle. \n\nHopefully this gives everybody something to laugh at and you can all give your opinion on how dumb I am. Maybe it will help some of you on the fence to take you profits and move on. If nothing else I hope you at least think about if the constant stress and worry of checking calls and stocks is worth it. \n\nI think I'll go sit outside for awhile, watch the sunset.",

        "selftext": "From my time in here I know that being wrong is one of the things that we do best, so I finally found out how to make money off of it. I first dipped my toes into options trading a few years ago. I had previously been swing trading stocks so I had a couple years of experience before that, but the leverage and potential returns that options provided really piqued my interest. After it was all said and done, I lost almost $20,000 buying options. After realizing that someone was getting all of this money I was losing, I learned about option selling and haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nI recently posted my YTD performance [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/i0mkv3/10k_to_100k_in_5_months_23k_in_deposits_and_67k/), and received a lot of questions about how I did it. My strategy changed over time, but I first started with credit spreads, which may be applicable to more people since it\u2019s a strategy that works with smaller accounts too. I got a lot of questions about how I played credit spreads and it\u2019s tough to completely explain what I do through a comment here and a comment there so I created this guide explaining my exact approach to trading credit spreads. Here you go:\n\nThis is a wall of text, so if you're a more visual learner, here's a link to videos explaining all four parts:\n\n[Part One](https://youtu.be/J12HR1Ax2k0)\n\n[Part Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1mlknat5qA)\n\n[Part Three](https://youtu.be/Uu7_8856nZw)\n\n[Part Four](https://youtu.be/2p5nlczCcFo)\n\n#Part One: The Basics\n\nSo what is a spread? A high level conceptual explanation is that you\u2019re essentially betting on a stock to finish above or below a certain price upon expiration. One of the advantages here is that you can set this number out of the money, so if a stock is trading at $100, you can bet that it\u2019ll remain below $110 by a certain date. This is a bearish position, so if you\u2019re correct and it goes up, you\u2019ll make max profit. The catch though is that even if you\u2019re wrong, you basically have a 10% downward cushion before you start to lose any money. So the easiest way to describe it is a strategy that lets you make money if you\u2019re right, but also make money if you\u2019re slightly off.\n\nHow does it work? So in the above example, if we were bullish on a stock we would open what\u2019s called a put credit spread. We could set it up where we sell a 110c for a credit of $1.50, and buy a 115c for a debit of $0.50. This means that in this transaction we receive $1.50, and pay $0.50 for a net credit of $1. That credit is your max profit on the play. If you\u2019re familiar with options you\u2019ll know that if the stock finishes at or below $110 upon expiration, both of these calls will be worthless. That\u2019s great news for us because the long leg we bought (115c) for 0.50 will be a loss, but we\u2019ll get to keep the full $1.50 from the short leg (110c) that we sold, resulting in us realizing our max gain on the trade of $1.\n\nWhy not just sell the 110c and collect the full $1.50? While it cuts into our profits, the reason we buy the 115c in this example for $0.50 isn\u2019t to cut into our profits when we\u2019re correct, but rather protect us when we\u2019re wrong. If the stock in the example stays below $110, we\u2019re good to go and we\u2019ll hit max profit. But what if it goes to $120, $150, or something crazy happens and it hits $200. If the stock hits $150 upon expiration, that 110c that we sold for $1.50 will be worth $40, meaning that we\u2019ll incur a $3,875 loss in pursuit of a $150 gain. We\u2019ve seen crazy run ups from the likes of TSLA and ZM lately, and people who sold what we call \u201cnaked options\u201d got absolutely killed. With our spread, yes our 110c will be worth $40 meaning we\u2019re down $4,000 on that position, but the 115c we bought behind it will be worth $35 meaning we\u2019re up $3,500 there for a net loss of $500. Additionally, we get to keep that $1.00 credit we received up front no matter what, so our loss with this spread is actually $500-$100=$400 as opposed to the $3,875 loss that we would\u2019ve seen had we sold the 110c by itself. THAT is the value in selling a spread as opposed to a naked option.\n\nWhy are you multiplying everything by 100? Each options contract is worth 100 shares, so a contract that is trading for $1.50 actually costs $150 to purchase.\n\nAnother high level point I like to make is that there are really 5 different things that can happen when you make a play. Let\u2019s say you think a stock will go up. It can (1) go up a ton and you\u2019d be correct, (2) go up a little and you\u2019d be correct, (3) trade flat and you\u2019d be incorrect, (4), go down a little and you\u2019d be incorrect, or (5) go down a lot and you\u2019d be incorrect. With a bullish spread, you\u2019d hit max profit on 4/5 , or 80% of the possible outcomes, whereas if you bought stock or purchased an option you\u2019d only be profitable on (1) or (2). Obviously the actual outcomes are a little more complex, but for a base-level understanding of the advantages a spread provides, I think this is a good way to look at it.\n\nSo that\u2019s the value of a spread. A lot of traders are introduced to option selling and are scared of the prospect of incurring a huge loss like we mentioned above, but using credit spreads is a great way of receiving the benefits that selling has to offer while limiting a lot of the risks. So let\u2019s move onto actually opening a spread.\n\n#Part Two: Making the Trade\n\nSo for actually opening a spread up, we have a four-step approach we take: Pick a Stock Pick a Direction Pick a Strike Price Execute the Trade\n\n**1: Picking a Stock:**\n\nOne of the most important things I tell people is to trade what you know. I have a watchlist of 25-30 stocks that I watch and get familiar with during the day. That way if I recognize a good opportunity, I\u2019ll have a decent base of knowledge to rely on to make what I feel is a smart play. It\u2019s super easy to get caught up in the \u201cstock of the week\u201d and try to jump in on a play because a ticker is in the news. If you\u2019re not familiar with a stock, don\u2019t trade it.\n\nFor this example (the one used in the video), Wayfair was trading in a 195-210 range for a little bit and then had a big day where it broke up out of that range and up towards $220. This was an unusual move that I noticed since it was on my watchlist, so I decided to make a play.\n\nSTOCK: WAYFAIR\n\n**2: Picking a direction:**\n\nSo if we look at Wayfair\u2019s YTD chart, it has exploded this year. A clear upward trend, but a recent trend that I noticed from following the stock was that every time it broke out like this, there would be a little bit of a pullback afterwards. Additionally, I felt the stock was overvalued on a fundamental basis (had a negative book value at the time of the trade) so I wanted to play this stock back down. This is probably the quickest and easiest step of the four, since you\u2019ll likely already have an opinion on most of the stocks that you follow.\n\nDIRECTION: DOWN\n\n**3:Picking a Strike Price:**\n\nSo we know that we\u2019re going to be playing Wayfair back down, but now the question is what spread are we going to set up to do that. In this example Wayfair was trading at $218.42 at the time that we decided to make this trade. In the video we illustrate a trading channel that Wayfair was at the top of. It was also approaching the ATH of $221.54. A lot of the time that will act as resistance for a stock, meaning it\u2019ll bounce down off of it. So in order to give ourselves a bit of a cushion we decided to set our short leg at 222.50, meaning that we\u2019re playing the stock to stay below $222.50 by the end of that week.\n\nSo with this play it means in plain English that if we\u2019re correct and the stock goes down, we hit max profit. But if we\u2019re wrong and it goes up, we still have a $4.08 cushion before we\u2019re not hitting max profit anymore. So we could be a little wrong, have the stock go up a few dollars, and still walk away with max profit.\n\nSTRIKE PRICE OF SHORT LEG: $222.50\n\n**4: Executing the Trade:**\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to tell you that when I started trading spreads I didn\u2019t realize you could open both legs of the spread at was. I was stupid. I would like to think I\u2019m at least a little bit smarter now. If you look at the options screen for most brokers, you\u2019ll just see single legs. Switching over to \u201cvertical\u201d allows you to set up the entire spread in one trade. If you use something like RH, there\u2019s a feature that allows you to select multiple options, so you\u2019ll select the one you wish to sell (short leg) and the one you wish to buy (long leg).\n\nIn this example we selected the 222.5/225c spread, meaning that we sold the short leg of 222.5 and the long leg of 227.5. The net credit was 1.45, which is our max gain on the trade. A wider spread gives a larger credit but also increases max loss. This is a $5 wide spread but we could have made it a tighter spread with a $2.5 width. Typically the best risk to reward ratio is on the tightest spreads, but a slightly wider spread will raise your breakeven price and studies have shown that it actually results in better expected value long term.\n\nCircling back to the credit we received of $1.45, this means that our max profit was $145 and our max loss was $355 for each spread that we sold. We know that because our broker tells us that, but a quick way to calculate it is the width of the spread minus the credit. A $1.45 credit on $5 wide spread means a $5-$1.45=$3.55 max loss.\n\nWhen I evaluate trades like this I look for a max profit to max loss ratio of 1:2 to 1:4. Based on different scanners I\u2019ve seen, the best expected values tend to fall on spreads within that risk/reward ratio. The ratio on this trade is 1:2.44.\n\nSo we put our order in for a credit of $1.45, it filled, and now we get to sit back and watch. Sometimes your order won\u2019t fill right away. In fact, most of the time it won\u2019t fill right away. It\u2019s important to be patient with your fill price and not chase it downwards. We want the highest credit possible. So if the credit on these spreads dropped to 1.30 when I was trying to place an order, it usually isn\u2019t a great idea to drop my order price down to 1.30 just to get a fill. The only time I would recommend that is if you\u2019re trying to open a spread right before the market closes. Otherwise, hang tight. Patience pays.\n\n#Part 3: Managing the Trade\n\nSo now that we\u2019ve made the trade, it\u2019s time to manage it. In my opinion one of the best parts about trading spreads is that they don\u2019t require active management. You get to sit back and watch the price. Once the trade has been opened, which is also quick, it takes very little effort.\n\nSo with the Wayfair example we used, our analysis turned out perfectly, as Wayfair touched the ATH and dipped back down to end the week safely at $214. We hit max profit on that trade, but what if the trade goes against us? That\u2019s what we\u2019ll take a look at in this section.\n\nOne thing we didn\u2019t address in part two is when to open the trade. We like opening spreads on Mondays and Tuesdays, and monitoring them during the week. This is the part of my strategy that is a little bit controversial, as there is a (legitimate) school of thought that selling spreads about 45 DTE is better value. I like that idea and if you would rather do that then absolutely go for it. It\u2019s important to trade what you\u2019re comfortable with. All of the lessons in here still apply to that strategy. With that said though, I stick with the weekly strategy of opening them at the beginning of the week and look to close them throughout the week.\n\nThe way I see it, your % of max profit should be the metric you\u2019re looking at when deciding what to do with a spread. Divided up equally, that means if you progressed through the week to max profit in a linear fashion, you would be at 20% of max profit on Monday, 40% on Tuesday, and so forth. A good rule of thumb I use is that if you\u2019re ever on the fence about whether or not to close something out, do so if your return exceeds the linear return for that day of the week. The market can move quickly and I\u2019ve had several times where I have regretted not closing a spread out. It\u2019s important to take profit.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019ll add to this is that this weekly strategy gets a little risky on Thursday afternoon headed into Friday. If your spread is remotely close to being in the money on Thursday afternoon, close it out. Now that I type that out I realize that may all sound a little convoluted, but it\u2019s better visualized in the video I\u2019ve linked for this section.\n\nNow let's get into what happens if a trade really starts to move against you. With the strategy we use there are really two options: (1) Close the trade for a loss and move on, or (2) Roll the strikes higher.\n\nThe first option is pretty self explanatory, but a quick note I want to add here is that you can have a stock move way against you but still be able to close the trade for less than max loss. The example I use in my video is I played FB earnings, thought it would go down, but it shot way above my spread and well into max loss territory. We opened a 245/247.5c spread for a credit of $0.54. FB was reporting earnings on a Thursday night and we sold this spread that expired the following day, so there wasn\u2019t a ton of time to manage it. Long story short, FB killed earnings and shot up to $256 that morning. Really not a prayer that it would come back down to the spread I opened by the end of the day. But despite the fact that this trade went way against us and we had almost no time to manage it since it was a Friday play, we were still able to close out for a debit of $1.90. Yes that\u2019s a loss of $1.36 per spread, but we SAVED an additional $0.60 cent loss by avoiding a max loss debit of $2.50. That\u2019s another benefit of spreads.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about option two. This is the best option to use if you\u2019re confident that you\u2019re correct about the ultimate price action on a stock, but you need a little extra wiggle room on the trade. For this example we\u2019ll look at a TSLA call spread that I opened. TSLA was trading at $1542 after an incredible run, so I figured I would play it below 1600 with a 1600/1610c spread that offered a credit of $2.52. As is the theme with this section, TSLA exploded the following morning (Tuesday) and went all the way up to $1794 at one point. My spread was literally almost $200 out of the money. One of the biggest possible moves against myself that I had ever seen. Despite this crazy move, it was only Tuesday and we were able to close the first spread for a debit of only $5.25 (as opposed to a $10 max debit). We opened 6 of these off the bat so this was a loss of $1638. From there we \u201crolled\u201d our strikes higher, opening 10 1750/1760c spreads for a credit of $3.45. So the closing and subsequent opening of a spread like we did here is what we are referring to when we say we \u201crolled the strikes higher\u201d.\n\nBy the end of the week TSLA had finally crashed a bit and it finished at $1506. This meant the second of spreads we opened were easily max profit. And while we lost $1,638 on the first set of spreads we opened here, we profited $3,450 on the second set of spreads so we were able to still finish the week with a $1,812 profit on TSLA. The funny thing with this one is that the original spread would have hit max profit since it dropped all the way back down to 1500, but we would have had the same result had TSLA finished anywhere below 1750.\n\nRolling the strikes higher gave me extra breathing room and turned a potential disaster into a profitable trade. One thing I\u2019ll add though is that with this method you do run the risk of increasing your potential max loss. Because of that, I\u2019ll only roll my strikes higher ONCE. Anything past that is chasing a losing trade. If I roll my strikes higher and it\u2019s still going against me, I\u2019m at the point where I need to accept the fact that I don\u2019t fundamentally understand a stock as well as I thought I did and move on. There is always another trade out there.\n\nThe final point I\u2019ll add to this is ALWAYS CLOSE OUT YOUR SPREADS. The only time I\u2019ll let a spread expire worthless is if my spread is OTM by a crazy amount and it would quite literally take a historic after-hours move on Friday to take me back ITM. Other than that, close your spreads out. Even if it\u2019s just for a $0.05 debit. It may seem annoying but I\u2019ll tell you why in the following section.\n\n#Part 4: Additional Risks and Considerations\n\nI will start this section by saying I\u2019ve never been impacted by any of the following risks, but it\u2019s important to be aware of 100% of the possible outcomes of your trade before you enter it. They\u2019re infrequent but this really wouldn\u2019t be a comprehensive guide if I omitted them. They are as follows: (1) Early Assignment, (2) Dividend Risk, (3) Pin Risk.\n\n**1: Early Assignment:**\n\nThe best way to start this section is by talking about why your max loss is actually your max loss. We know it\u2019s quickly calculated as the width of your spread minus the credit, but why is that?\n\nLet\u2019s use a 110/115c spread as an example. We\u2019ll say we received a credit of $1. We know that if the stock finishes anywhere below 110 then both legs are worthless and we\u2019ll hold onto that $1 credit. But what happens if we\u2019re in a max loss position. Let\u2019s say the stock finishes at $120.\n\nIn this situation the short leg (110c) we sold would be worth $10 (120-110), meaning that we would owe $1,000 on that position. The long leg we bought would be worth $5 (120-115), meaning we are holding a position worth $500. The net effect is a $500 loss, but remember that\u2019s netted against the $100 credit you received, so it\u2019s a max loss of $400. That math checks out as the width of the spread is $5, the credit is $1, so the max loss is 5-1=$4*100=$400.\n\nSo that\u2019s how it works upon expiration. But lets say this position moved against you, you still have a few days until expiration, but the stock is at $120. Since there are a few days left, you probably could close the contract for a debit of $3.50 rather than the max loss debit of $5. However, since your short leg is ITM the person you sold the option to may choose to exercise their option. As a result, that would require you to take on a short position of $110*100=$11,000 per contract sold. You may not be able to afford to cover that, or your broker may not let you hold that position. So what happens is your long leg gets exercised as well resulting in you taking a max loss early. So while on paper you received a credit of $1 that could have been closed for a debit of $3.50 and your loss was only $2.50, early assignment results in you prematurely taking a max loss.\n\nWhen does this happen? It typically doesn\u2019t, since it requires the buyer sacrificing the remaining extrinsic value on the option, but it\u2019s more likely with certain stocks. There are three different classifications of a stock that relate to it\u2019s borrowing ability: Easy to Borrow (ETB), Hard to Borrow (HTB), and Not Available to Borrow (NTB). The harder a stock is to borrow, the more likely it is that a call is exercised early because it gives the buyer a way to acquire a stock which may not be available to them through their broker. So if you\u2019re selling call spreads that are close to being ITM, make sure to check out the borrowing status of the stock.\n\n**2: Dividend Risk:**\n\nThis risk relates to the first one discussed, as it\u2019s just another way you risk early assignment. If a company is announcing a dividend, there will be something known as an \u201cex-div\u201d date, which means that all shareholders as of that date are entitled to receive the divident, which will be distributed usually at a later date. Because of this, call buyers may exercise an out of the money call option in an effort to acquire those shares.\n\nRemembering that exercising an option means that you sacrifice all remaining extrinsic value, another reason a buyer may exercise a call option before an ex-dividend date is that the value of the dividend announced is greater than the extrinsic value remaining in the option. Say a 100c is trading at $2 and the underlying (stock) is currently at 101. The extrinsic value is the value of the option in excess of what it would be worth upon expiration. So the extrinsic value in this situation is $1, since the 100c trading for $2 is just $1 in excess of the current strike price. If the company in question here announced a $2 dividend, an option buyer would likely exercise their call option because the $2 dividend is greater than the $1 of extrinsic value.\n\n**3: Pin Risk:**\n\nWe know that if your spread finishes out of the money it\u2019s a max gain and if both legs of your spread finish in the money it\u2019s a max loss. But what happens when the price of a stock finishes between the two legs of your spread? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nSo using a 100/110c spread as an example, let\u2019s say that the stock finishes at 105. Your long leg, which is there to protect you, is worthless so you wouldn\u2019t exercise it. However the short leg at 100 that you sold will be exercised by the buyer since it\u2019s ITM. As a result, you\u2019re now short 100 shares at a price of 100 and you\u2019ll be holding that position over the weekend. This can go both ways from here, but since we\u2019re focused on risk let\u2019s say that this stock you\u2019re now short shoots up over the weekend and some sort of news/event brings it up to $120.\n\nWith this short position of 100 shares at $100 you\u2019re borrowing $10,000 worth of stock. Now that the stock is worth $120 this position is now worth $12,000. Over the weekend you\u2019ve sustained a $2,000 loss. If we received a credit of $3 when we opened this spread, we may have thought that our max loss was 10-3=$7*100=$700. Since we failed to close the spread out, this position has now resulted in a $2,000 loss net of the $300 credit that you received when you opened the position. So on a trade where you thought you could lose at most $700, you\u2019re now down almost $2k.\n\nI can\u2019t repeat it enough, but THIS IS WHY WE CLOSE OUT SPREADS BEFORE EXPIRATION. That is the single most important takeaway I can give you here. Spreads are great since they\u2019re defined risk and defined gain. When you\u2019re buying options you have a defined loss but a potentially infinite gain. This can make it really easy to get greedy and I\u2019ve seen countless traders lose big profits because they keep holding out for more. When you have a defined gain and defined loss it makes it easier to make smart decisions, take profits, and continuously build on those profits over time.\n\nThat was an enormous wall of text but I hope it helps explain, from a base level, what spreads are and how they work. Switching from buying options to selling options has dramatically changed my performance in the market so I hope sharing this can do the same for someone else. If you have any questions let me know and I\u2019d be happy to answer them.",

        "selftext": "Needham:\n\n\"Yesterday, at AMZN's devices and services event, AMZN announced Luna+, a $6/month (intro price) cloud gaming subscription competitor to Google's Stadia ($10/month), Microsoft xCloud($15/month), and EA's Origin Access ($15/month). **Although AMZN's content is inferior to competitors today, we expect its Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) to be below competitors, thanks to its Twitch and AWS integrations.**\"\n\n\"We believe additional value from Luna+ comes from: a) building brand trust with the next generation (16-26 year olds); b) upside from sub revs, which are valued at 9x Rev vs AMZN's avg of 4x; and, c) a new rev stream using AWS &amp; Twitch that raises AMZN\u2019s barriers to entry.\"\n\n\"**We calculate that AMZN's media revenue streams are worth nearly $600B, or about 40% of AMZN's total EV, suggesting these businesses are the most undervalued piece of AMZN.**\"\n\n\"Advertising's Hidden Value. The \"hidden\" value of AMZN's advertising's expected 50% y/y growth in FY21E is important because many public companies with comparable ad rev growth rates trade above 7x and up to 22x revs. We use an average of 14.5x EV/Rev.\"\n\n\"Subscription Revs Hidden Value. Similarly, subscription revenue streams typically trade at much higher EV/Rev multiples than AMZN's core business, so anything that adds revenue in subscription silos grows AMZN's value faster, we believe. Consumer-facing subscription revenue is generally predictable, sticky, has upside optionality to add more rev/month over time, and has high switching costs and barriers to entry. As a consequence, many subscription business models trade at 7x-12x EV/Rev, well above AMZN's avg.\"\n\n\"Luna. By implication, successful growth of subscriber revenue streams suggests faster upside valuation revisions for AMZN. A gating factor to this potential upside value driver is introducing new subscription services, like Luna.\"\n\n\"Twitch and AWS Integrations Lower AMZN's Risks. AMZN's economic risks of Luna failing is lower than its competitors because it already owns the cloud servers required through AWS, and it also owns the dominant video game viewing platform in Twitch, which it is integrating into Luna. Both AWS and Twitch should lower Luna's CAC. Therefore, even if Luna fails, it should cost far less than other companies that don't already own cloud servers and a huge number of video gamers already spending hours per day on a sister-platform.\"",

        "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI am a data scientist who has been working on applying machine learning and data analysis to build trading tools. I have been thinking of open sourcing some tools and I am really excited to introduce the first tool called **Surpriver**. \n\n# Introduction\n\n**Surpriver** is a python based tool which tries to use volume and price changes to look for anomalous and unusual patterns using machine learning and anomaly detection algorithms - more specifically, it uses something called an Isolation Forest for anomaly detection. Surpriver gives you the flexibility in analyzing different granularities of data e.g 1 minute bars, 30 minutes bars, 60 minutes and some more.\n\n&gt;**Although the tool works on all kinds of stocks, it works more effectively on penny stocks as there are more fluctuations in penny stocks and their patterns.**\n\nHere is the **basic flow** of the tool. It goes over 5000 stocks and extracts their price and volume data from **yahoo finance**. It then calculates a few technical indicators like Ease of Movement and converts everything into a single vector representation which we call features. These features are then passed to an anomaly detection engine which find unusual patterns by comparing a stock's features with every other stock and ranks the stocks based on anomaly score. The stocks with the highest anomaly scores are expected to move up or down more than the ones with lower anomaly scores. **In a nutshell, the tool looks at 5000 stocks and tries to automatically infer some unusual patterns which** ***can*** **lead to some big moves.**\n\nYou might tell me that there are some existing scanners for this but every single of them are based on manually curated rules e.g if volume is greater than 5 times the average volume of last 5 days, alert the stock. However, such scanners can often fail when market conditions change. **Surpriver is a totally automated scanner that does not need such rules. Also, in order to find anomalies, since it looks at the global view of market movement, it is more robust.**\n\n# Results\n\nLet us look at a scatter plot of results from last 2 days of this week. The stocks were analyzed on Wednesday and the plot below shows their absolute percentage change in price in the next two days.\n\n**Scatter Plot:** \n\n[Correlation plot showing that when anomaly score is high \\(negative values\\), the future change for the stock is also higher](https://preview.redd.it/leddxl0sqlk51.png?width=1009&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f10a7b77438db954af0527933904264d0eab965b)\n\nAs you can see in the image above, the anomalous stocks (score &lt; 0)  usually have a higher absolute change in the future on average. That  proves that the predictions are actually for those stocks that moved  more than average in the next few hours/days. One question arises here,  what if the tool is just picking the highest volatility stocks because  those would yield high future absolute change. In order to prove that  it's not the case, here is the more detailed description of stats.\n\n    --&gt; Future Performance \n    Correlation between future absolute change vs anomalous score (lower is better, range = (-1, 1)): **-0.23** \n    Total absolute change in future for Anomalous Stocks: **89.660** \n    Total absolute change in future for Normal Stocks: **43.000** \n    Average future volatility of Anomalous Stocks: **0.332** \n    Average future volatility of Normal Stocks: **0.585** \n    Historical volatility for Anomalous Stocks: **2.528** \n    Historical volatility for Normal Stocks: **2.076**\n\nYou can see that historical volatility for normal vs anomalous stocks is  not that different. However, the difference in total absolute future  change is double for anomalous stocks as compared to normal stocks.\n\n# Results\n\nI ran this tool on 60 minute bars with a history of 14 bars only. Here are the results for this week. These results were generated on 28th August, you can see how they did in the last few days.\n\nResults (August 28): [https://pastebin.com/L5T2BYUx](https://pastebin.com/L5T2BYUx) \n\nSince a lot of folks don't know how to use python, I will be updating the results on the GitHub repository on weekly basis. There are no strings attached.\n\n# Backtesting - How would have it worked in the past?\n\nI am pretty sure everyone is going to want to backtest it on historical data. For that purpose, there is a separate section in the GitHub repo that talks about running the tool on historical data and see how it would have done in the future. Please go to the repo to look at those steps. I have also provided some backtested results from the last two days of this week.\n\n# Limitations\n\nThe tool only finds stocks that have some unusual behavior in their price and volume action combined. It doesn't predict which direction the stock is going to move. That might be a feature that I'll implement in the future but for right now, you'll need to look at the charts and do your DD to figure that out.\n\n# GitHub Repository\n\nLink: [https://github.com/tradytics/surpriver](https://github.com/tradytics/surpriver)\n\nMore information on how the tool works is given in the GitHub repository. Please ask if you have any questions.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nWould love to get everyone's thoughts. Since this is open source, please feel free to make changes and push them. If you have a feature request, just create an issue in the GitHub repo and I will work on it. Also, I am taking requests for more tools that folks here would want. Please comment if there is anything specific that you would like.\n\nHappy to talk more about how everything works in detail.\n\n# Is this promotional? No, this is 100% free and open source.\n\nSo we have a few competitors who downvote every single thing we post and report almost all of our posts. This had led to a lot of my posts getting removed. Therefore, for this post, I have specifically gone ahead and asked the mods if this is allowed to post here. \n\n&gt;***This is not a promotional post or tool*****. The tool resides on github and is literally 100% free.** \n\nPS: If you want more open sourced tools, just comment with your idea of a tool. I will try to work on it and open source it for everyone.",

        "selftext": "I will start off my discsussion using a couple of examples where investors/analysts missed the big picture and the company/stock has proven that they're much more than that.\n\n**Microsoft**\n\n\nIn July 2013, Microsoft stock had the biggest drop of the century after reporting their earnings. The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. \n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/\n\n**Apple**\n\nBack in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple\u2019s stock shouldn\u2019t obsess with near-term iPhone sales. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,\u201d he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html\n\nLook at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.\n\n\n**Intel**\n\nI'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader\u2019s methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely on solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't. Also, the fact that TSMC will be on 5 nm by the time Intel fixes the 10 nm/7 nm node problems. Those are problems I'm well aware of and they have been beaten to death already. There is nothing I can add to that. I will talk about that later on but in the end as not the focal points. What I'd like to talk about and focus on is the data-centric transformation and its MobilEye division.\n\n\n**Data Centric Transformation**\n\nIntel in 2019 pivoted from being a PC centric business to a data centric business. The TAM of this is 250 billion dollars. Revenue in this business group has grown from 42% of revenue in 2015 to 51% of revenue over the TTM. While many business transitions result in periods of low performance, as firms switch focus from declining to new businesses, Intel has managed to grow its revenue by 12% compounded annually over the past four years as it better positions itself for future growth.\n\nhttps://channelbuzz.ca/2019/04/intel-emphasizes-data-centric-transformation-of-company-at-new-xeon-launch-30025/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\n**Self driving business**\n\nIntel purchased MobilEye in 2015. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel . Mobileye has a plan to dominate self-driving. Self driving taxis and cars are a big growth business. MobilEye is in a great position to capitalize on this business. Mobileye says it shipped 17.4 million systems last year. Today, over 40 million cars have Mobileye technology installed, and its products have been selected for implementation in serial production of 313 car models from our 27 OEM partners by 2017 (compared to 36 car models across seven OEMs in 2010). Some of the partners include Volkswagen, BMW, Nissan, Ford. It also has partnered with NIO, a Chinese EV company which people have dubbed the Chinese Tesla.\n\nThe firm\u2019s acquisition of Mobileye strategically positions it to build out its driverless technology business as well. In just three years, Mobileye has experienced rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $210 million in 2017 to $879 million in 2019. Its share of automobile semiconductor sales increased from just 0.5% to 1.9% over the same time. If Mobileye continues taking market share in this fast-growing segment, Mobileye\u2019s could provide a meaningful contribution to Intel\u2019s operations, as it made up just over 1% of revenue in 2019. ResearchAndMarkets.com expects the autonomous/driverless market to grow 18% compounded annually from 2020 to 2025. Intel is positioned to grow with this new market.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/ford-expands-partnership-with-mobileye-intels-autonomous-driving-business/\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18039216/volkswagen-intel-mobileye-self-driving-ride-hailing-israel-2019\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/mobileye-testing-autonomous-cars-germany-104521486.html\n\n\n**PC Business**\n\nThis is the side of Intel most people immediately associate Intel with. Intel\u2019s PC-centric business is not something to write-off. There is still a piece of the PC-centric market where Intel has an opportunity to grow: graphics processing units (GPU). Allied Market Research, expects the GPU market to grow from $19.8 billion in 2019 to nearly $201 billion in 2027 or by 34% compounded annually. For example, Intel is aggressively entering the discreet GPU business, which is about 80% of the current GPU market. The iGPU processors codenamed Tiger Lake just released September 2nd. Intel poached AMD's GPU guy Raja Koduri and nVidia's Tom Peterson. Intel hired engineers and marketing experts from Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA, the market leader in the space, to assemble a team to develop and rollout the firm\u2019s Intel Xe GPU.\n\nIntel is also releasing entry level processors. The entry-level processors will be targeted at budget-tier laptops and fanless mini desktops when they launch in early 2021. \n\nhttps://www.nextplatform.com/2020/09/02/intel-puts-its-xe-gpu-stakes-in-the-ground/\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-jasper-lake-10nm-tremont-atom-cpus-leak-pentium-celeron-skus-2021/\n\n\n**7 nm/10 nm process**\n\nSince I have your attention until here - I'd like to say one final thing about this debacle. Lot of people assume that Intel's problems with this are due to complacency. Its not. Its due to Intel attempting to achieve and do something others have been unable to do, which is the exact opposite of complacency. Intel tried to use GAAFET for 7 nm when TSMC and Samsung warned Intel not to.  Intel was warned by TSMC and Samsung that the GAA-FET technique is too challenging to implement at this point in time, but Intel\u2019s pride and persistence led it to stubbornly try and tackle the GAA-FET problem, until it finally conceded this July.\n\nI agree Intel fucked up here but the point I'm trying to make is that this was not due to complacency as widely believed. Intel has a lot of management problems, hostile work environment etc but complacency is not one of them.  Intel never got complacent about its objectives, but it may have gotten complacent about its approaches, methods, and processes.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/i8qrx4/intel_exemployee_reveals_insider_details_on/\nhttps://www.dvhardware.net/article73530.html\n\n\n**Tl/DR; Post Summary / Post Script** : \n\nI'm perfecty aware that AMD and nVidia are eating Intel's lunch and have better more powerful CPUs/GPUs. However, Intel is much more than that and its other divisions are what will drive future growth. Analysts and investors are missing this big picture.",

        "selftext": "Six trading days after the S&amp;P hit its all time high, bulls and bears can both agree that there is much more uncertainty about what will happen next. While we all know the NASDAQ is in a bubble, no one can say for sure if it has popped or if this dip will be dwarfed by the face ripping rally that could show itself as September continues on.\n\nAs a confused bull right now I wanted to take a look at some tech stocks and offer a word of caution to those echoing \"BTFD.\" Buying dips is obviously a good strategy but doing so recklessly could leave you missing out on a good amount of profit. Don't try to be a hero calling bottom when a clear bottom has not shown itself.\n\nTaking a look at AMZN, MSFT, &amp; GOOGL charts should help paint this picture better.\n\n[AMZN Daily Candle Chart](https://preview.redd.it/a4cg6rl2zsm51.png?width=1543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1efead5e7afd376ec9bd6856857cdd0a0891f80)\n\n[MSFT Daily Candle Chart](https://preview.redd.it/zutwr967zsm51.png?width=1543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30030941855be77df09ca3d001ca8fbd452522ce)\n\n[GOOGL Daily Candle Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ggbp5b29zsm51.png?width=1543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9177952a6ebf33ac4c4885dd213664b2c5cd15c)\n\nAll three of these tech giants have broken the trend line, retested it on the Wednesday/Thursday bounce, and gone back down. Closing the week at new lows for MSFT and AMZN. AMZN even sporting a bearish divergence with RSI over 70 since the July high.\n\nWith 10 week and 40 week moving averages as far apart as they are, major price corrections could take place and it would be nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nWe all just like to make money. But I know many will be mad even looking at charts pointing towards further downside corrections for their beloved tech giants. I don't want them to but its what i think will happen.\n\nFeel free to discuss future market possibilities, rip me apart for making lines on a chart, or comment a nice \"fuck you gay bear\".\n\nIf the market turned around early next week and SPY never looked back at 330 I would turn bullish very easily. But until then, I will be short.\n\nPositions:  SPY 9/18 330p, TSLA 9/18 340p, AMD 9/18 72p",

        "selftext": "I briefly talked yesterday about Tesla's market cap and how it was absurdly priced and honestly felt like gambling to me. However, APPL is somewhat overlooked as well and I wanted to hear your guys' thoughts on it!\n\nApple's Market Cap as of right now is 2.3 Trillion ([Source](https://ycharts.com/companies/AAPL/market_cap)). On August 20, it was 2 Trillion. It has added 300 billion in about 10 days - without having added any products what soever (primarily due to the stock split). \n\nIn April of this year, it was 1.1 Trillion or so. It has since doubled since that time, so much so that it is the size of the GDP of France ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/685925/gdp-of-european-countries/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/685925/gdp-of-european-countries/))\n\nNow, I am all for Apple devices and services. They make some of the best products ever. They have crazy high margins and once a consumer buys an Apple device, he has to buy other ones due to the seamless integration it provides (biggest selling point). It is now getting in more markets such as India with its' new iPhone SE 2, but I am somewhat skeptical on its' valuation. \n\nI feel like people are buying AAPL due to its security - it has always gone up, so it will always go up - and therefore, it's safe to park their money there. Some are even likening it to Treasury Bonds - that it's better to put your money in AAPL stock because it's *safe.*",

        "selftext": "TLDR: I believe precious metals and industrial materials will have a beter return on investment than the broad equities market and will be the main drivers of the next bull market.\n\nAs you all may or may not have noticed, the stock market and especially the tech giants have been on an incredible run as of late. Even though many people expect a general market downturn in the near future, myself included, it cannot be denied that these companies have presented an incredible return on invested capital in the past few months. These shares have not been the only ones on a tear in the last few months however, with precious metal miners going up in multiples since the lows seen in march. Because of the way monetery policy is implemented at the moment, with an agressive targeting of inflation by the FED and the printing of trillions of dollars, I have shifted my attention to what I think will be the next great bull market.\n\n\nAfter the decade long bull market we have seen, what do I think will be the next bull market after all this is set and done? Commodities, specifically precious metals followed by industrial materials. We all know that when a currency is being devalued by printing trillions of it, investors tend to take their money and put it into 'safer' investments. These investments have historically been gold and silver, who last experienced great bull markets in the 1980's and after the 2000 dot-com bubble. Now it looks like everything is in place for another massive bull run, where investors will move a part of their portfolio into these assets both as a safety net and an chance to take part in the precious metals bull market. I am a firm believer that we will see higher gold and silver prices the more the dollar (and other currencies around the world) lose value. How high? Nobody knows, but predictions of $5,000 gold and $100 silver have not been uncommon. How do you invest? You can invest into an ETF, buy physical gold and silver or you can invest in the miners who pull it out of the ground. There are a lot of options out there, with miners offering the best leverage for a precious metal bull market. Personally I intend to own Pan American Silver, SSR mining and B2Gold.\n\n\nBut am I only going to invest in precious metals? Absolutely not, because while I feel like this bull market is inevitable, I also believe that after the coming economic slowdown that will paint the next two to three years, countries are going to try their hardest to improve their own economies again. This has historically been done with heavy investments in things like infrastructure of all kinds. Regular industrial materials like copper, oil, platinum, uranium and steel have not been the best investments over the past few years, but a industrial material bull market will change all that. With an economic rebuild comes the need for these materials and because the respective prices for these materials have been relatively low over the past few years, I expect a major turnaround to incentivize the new production the world is going to need to properly get back on its feet. Prices of things like oil, copper and especially uranium will shoot up and the companies that produce these materials will go right up there with it. I am especially bullish on uranium, of which I wrote about many times. I believe uranium offers that best risk/reward investment in the current market and will reward patient and strong handed investors who can handle it's volatility on the way up.\n\n\nTo truely see how undervalued commodities are compared to regular equities in the S&amp;P 500, I would recommend looking at the chart mentioned here:\u00a0https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commodities-watch-2020-170025867.html\n\nWhen something is so underinvested in and has all the catalysts in place to rally upwards, a subsequent bull market will be all the more violent on the upside. According to Rick Rule, one of the best commodity investors of the past few decades and CEO of Sprott Global, this will be the investment of choice for him and all his clients and after looking at the numbers, I can't say anything except I fully agree with him. This investment idea is gaining traction and while it is good to always be diversified, it would almost be foolish not to allocate at least a part of your portfolio into commodities. It is what I will be doing and I expect it to outperform the broad equities market in the coming decade.\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nMake sure to always do your own research when deciding what is right for you. Everybody has different goals and different portfolio's, I am just here to present a different investment oppertunity that I don't see extensively discussed on this sub. Best of luck out there and have a good day.",

Still though, fuck you in advance.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------  \nLet's get the party started: \n\n  \nRemember this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7bihk24y1q51.jpg?width=569&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64cbe74c338ce1fbbc226ba436704186fd378473\n\n  \nYeah, usage of this is downward trending - evident in Altria's [$8.6 billion writedown](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312520133822?cik=764180) on its investment in Juul over 2019. Ongoing studies of the health impacts of vapor-type tobacco products continue to point towards health deterioration &amp; the legal pressures are mounting. Altria (Juul's parent co) is currently handling [621 legal cases](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/76418020000074?cik=764180) against them for JUST Juul as of 7/2020.  \n\n\nWill all of these e-vapor kids eventually switch to traditional tobacco products? Who knows - the CDC estimates around \\~21% - \\~28% of vape users eventually try a cigarette or cigar; but what really drew people into vapes?  \n\n\n***In my view - it was the ease, the ability to take a quick puff in indoor settings, &amp; the quick disappearance of evidence. All of that plus a slight head high &amp; cool smoke looking shit.***   \n\n\nIf anyone has ever been to Asia &amp; some parts of Europe - you will have noticed this:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zscjcwt4y1q51.jpg?width=481&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71e336c6528a3f24d6dac2ffefccffbc07874c41\n\n  \nIt is ubiquitous - shit is everywhere here. If you're into vaping, or anything of that nature, this is the best alternative the market has to offer. Even serves as an alternative for regular cigarette users (more later).   \n\n\nPeople in the U.S. might not know of iQOS now - but Phillip Morris International (NYSE: PM) just got [FDA approval for marketing iQOS as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\")](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200707005847/en/FDA-Authorizes-Marketing-of-IQOS-as-a-Modified-Risk-Tobacco-Product#:~:text=On%20April%2030%2C%202019%2C%20the,the%20protection%20of%20public%20health) a few months ago, in July 2020. You will for sure start to see these pop up in convenience stores &amp; be on commercials going forward. \n\n  \nThis FDA designation is something Juul would have KILLED for, &amp; probably thought an investment in them by Altria would provide them with the lobbying resources to get them this designation or something similar. But they are failing in this regard, badly. \n\n  \niQOS is the **ONLY** **e-nicotine product to be granted marketing orders through the FDA's MRTP process** &amp; the FDA even goes onto say that *\"..switching completely from conventional cigarettes to the iQOS system reduces your body's exposure to harmful chemicals\"*. So we have a market of people who want to quit cigarettes plus in my view, fallout users of e-vape products. \n\n  \nNow we have a scenario where the U.S. has just opened its regulatory regime to be an open door for PM to market this shit. All of the work Juul did to introduce young adults &amp; kids to tobacco products is now a ripe market for PM to sell iQOS products to &amp; it provides the same experience / benefits as traditional e-vaping products. In that - it is *easy to use, you can use it indoors as the smell dissipates fairly quickly, you get your nicotine hit, it emits cool smoke - &amp; get this - in Asia there are even flavored products that you know PM is going to sneak into the U.S.* If you don't believe me, go ask your wife's boyfriend to buy you one &amp; try it out. \n\n  \nA bit more about PM before we dive into some numbers. These guys trace their lineage back to 1847, so they've been in business around 173 years. Fucking the boomer's boomer company here. These boomer companies have high dividends, &amp; subpar growth. Really, they grow just enough to beat inflation &amp; pay out their dividend (Currently yielding \\~6%/year). On top of this, prior to iQOS, their business is/was antiquated as fuck - cigarette usage is declining &amp; excluding iQOS from 2007 - 2016 their revenues grew at a pathetic 1.4% CAGR. Which brings me to this idea - if a Company like this can turn into a quasi-revenue or even full on growth story, what are the potential upsides?  \n\n  \nLet's look at some results for iQOS:\n\n* [From 2019 to 2018 - Heated Tobacco shipments grew +44%](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/141332920000007?cik=1413329) vs. Traditional Cigg volumes being down -4.5% \n\n[As of most recent quarter, PM has acquired \\~1MM iQOS users per quarter for an overall user base of 15.4MM. This user acquisition has grown by +43&amp;#37; since 2018 when they were growing iQOS users by \\~0.7mm a quarter \\[1\\]](https://preview.redd.it/83z2robey1q51.jpg?width=592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e00ba718a00ae7f4d193e3538c2af3746a87daab)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Current conversion rate of 72&amp;#37; vs. 67&amp;#37; 2-years ago \\[1\\]](https://preview.redd.it/lmihqnvfy1q51.jpg?width=476&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f16f93deebec91f038cbd236c2afc5332c332206)\n\n* PM defines 'fully converted' as one that uses iQOS products for 95% of daily tobacco consumption over trailing 7 days\n* As a reference point - e-vape conversion rate is in the mid-teens \\[1\\]\n* Wall Street expects this conversion rate to rise &amp; level off at 76% \\[1\\]\n* Of the total user base of 15.4MM @ 72% conversion rate = 11.1MM active users\n* More room to go - as of 12/31/19 total vape users globally is \\~40MM \\[1\\]\n\n\\-------\n\nSo all of this we reach the following conclusions: the market opportunity is huge, it's been relatively under-penetrated, &amp; PM's iQOS has a leading edge. What about TAM? Currently, PM makes about \\~$450 on average in net revenues per user. Assuming they capture the size of just the e-vaping market of \\~40mm users, this is an &gt;$18Bn opportunity. The fact that we're even talking about TAMs &amp; shit about a 173 year old Company, is in my view, insane. This stock will have boomer buyers &amp; Robinhood autists when this thing really gets moving. \n\nLook at the Google search trends stateside over the last couple years on \"iQOS\":\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fj437gxjy1q51.jpg?width=286&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c166e22b890dbb369a92827d0f627c3729366da\n\nAnd Google search trends for \"Buy iQOS\":\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hm6wroiky1q51.jpg?width=280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=877d7eea33f212a5b99a2195989440677c9a4512\n\nEvidence that PM's marketing machine is getting work since the FDA's MRTP approval. \n\n\\-------\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nSo at yesterday's close of $76.31/Share, these guys are trading at \\~10.1x EV/Forward EBITDA. This is *below* their historical 1-year average of trading at \\~11x and very below their 3-year historical average trading level of \\~12x. \n\nVersus their Tobacco peers, \\~10x represents an \\~8% premium, but on average they traded at an 8% premium over 1-year periods to their Tobacco peer group. This premium in my view, is not a 'growth' premium - this is premium is primarily related to PM's array of leading Tobacco brands like Marlboro/Parliament vs. their competition. \n\nI know P/E multiples are worth jack shit - but it's a quick and dirty way to find relative market positioning, so let's do that. Their current stock price implies \\~13x on fwd. P/E. This is a **\\~30% discount** to the broader market - meaning: on P/E valuations, the overall market has left these guys behind in the recent run-up, even with the iQOS embedded growth story in the stock. What's this tell me? Their growth story hasn't been realized by the market.. yet. \n\nHow about historically? Historically, they've traded at a \\~9% discount to the broader market on a fwd. P/E basis, so even if PM were to align with their P/E's historical relationship with the wider market, there is still double digit upside here (30% discount up to 9% discount).\n\nOne more final kicker. Less than 5% of PM's revenues come from the U.S. - what's been happening recently? The dollar is weakening, GLD is becoming more &amp; more of a crowded trade. Their growth in iQOS, regardless of whether it comes from consumer usage in the U.S. or not, will be amplified by this dynamic. With their dividend yield - this will eventually cross the 'smart' money's eyes as a weakening dollar play. They make money in China, Europe, Japan, to name a few. \n\n\\--------\n\n**Quick Management Overview:**\n\nTheir CEO is this 62 year old Greek guy by the name of Andre Calantzopoulos &amp; got into the position of CEO in 2013. What interested me most about him was his background - Electrical Engineer with professional work experience in Robotics. This plus PM's shift to iQOS/tech-driven tobacco just makes sense under this guy &amp; makes me excited that PM's Board of Directors went with a visionary to be at the helm of a Company that screams old school. \n\nHis comp plan, in addition to rest of the C-suite is based roughly [45% on Growth initiatives (Market Share, Net Revenues, Customer/Employee Satisfaction) &amp; the remaining 55% on Profit initiatives](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312520085906?cik=1413329). While on the surface, this may not seem to be the best comp structure to motivate a CEO to pursue extraordinary growth initiatives, the Profit part of his comp plan is built on $ values generated, &amp; not % margin growth. This is a 173 year old company with a supply chain that's hammered out probably most of its flaws, so margins as they are (\\~40%+ Operating Income Margins historically) should be the ceiling. So how to grow this? Top line. Revenues. \n\n\\-------------\n\n**POSITIONS: &gt;$80Cs &amp; up to $105+**\n\n**TL;DR - NYSE: PM. GET IN ON THE NEXT JUUL**\n\n*Warning: There is very low OI &amp; Volume on this name, Bid/Asks will be wide, but IV is stupid low, so if you can get in, it's an exclusive club.* \n\n\\[1\\] Wall Street Research\n\nRest of my footnotes have now been embedded in links for easier verification.",

So on, so on. \n\nBut, given that investor sentiment has driven oil supermajors to multi-year lows, is there a case to be made for snapping up shares?\n\nP/E and Price/Book ratios are in the single digits. Dividend yields range from 5% to 10%. FCF is monstrous as usual. Oil demand is ramping back up to pre-COVID levels. Oil demand will exist among  businesses (industrials, miners, etc) and developing economies for years to come. European supermajors BP and Shell have already begun incorporating renewable energy into their business models. And honestly what\u2019s to stop any of these supermajors from just acquiring the next generation of energy companies? It\u2019s not like they\u2019re married to oil.

        "selftext": " **Here's why I think RKT (Rocket Mortgage) is going to become dominant in the mortgage industry, as well as potential risks and responses to those risks.**\u00a0\\*\\*Please note: This is nearly all qualitative fundamentals. I don't spend much time on quantitative fundamentals for reasons I'd be happy to explain some other time. And it's sure as hell not technical analysis because....cmon. Also, I am focusing mainly on their Rocket Mortgage arm in this thesis. They have a few other branches (which will be important down the road), but right now mortgages are the main money maker/area to focus on.\n\n**Strengths of their company**\n\n1. Their incredible focus on UX and UI, and a great all around customer experience. There app has 4.9 stars on the appstore, which says 1, it's a good app, but 2, people usually use the app as a medium to rate the service they get from the company, so in essence, rocket mortgage has 4.9 star rating on their mortgage service.\u00a0They listen to customers and integrate their feedback.\n2. Their focus on tech/data. Rocket mortgage is the only player in this space that is focusing relentlessly on a digital first experience.\u00a0\n3. The company is growing, which will only increase their economies of scale and allow them to get better rates as they grow.\n4. The amount of data/data points they have on their customers is incredible. They are an order of magnitude ahead of competitors when it comes to data and analytics on their customers. They are essentially the Google of mortgages where data is concerned.\u00a0\n5. They have a refinancing retention rate of 75%, compared to the industry average of 22%. Refinancing is a large chunk of their revenue and is a very important part of any mortgage companies business.\n6. Their potential for scalability is massive. In the past 10 years, we've seen a huge boom in software stocks. The reason is that software is infinitably scalable. It costs nothing (or extremely close to nothing) to add another user for a piece of software. This means the margins on the product can be incredibly high. This is similar to how Rocket Mortgage is operating. Since much of their mortgage process is automated and online, it is much cheaper for them to add new customers than their competitors.\u00a0\n7. People are treating them like a traditional mortgage company, when I think they are a fintech company. This may be the biggest area where I am wrong, but I don't think so. All the analyses I've seen on Seeking Alpha, etc, talk about them as a mortgage company. One bear case mentioned that their forward P/E is around 16, vs 8 or 9 for Citi or Wells Fargo, and they suggested that this was way too high (in case you're wondering their bear case was $20). However, I am thinking of them as a disruptive fintech (although certainly not as new as something like Square). If you look at it this way, and compare their forward P/E to Squares of 152, it looks like an incredible bargain. Now, I don't think their P/E should actually be anywhere near Squares, and they aren't a huge growth company like Square, but I think they are a lot more of a growth company than other people are realizing.\u00a0\n\n**Positive shifts in the industry:**\n\n1. I believe we're going to see what happened to banking in the past 5 years happen to mortgages in the next 5-10. (Everything is moving online, digital banking, fintech disruption, traditional banks losing to more innovative players, etc.)\n2. Haven't really seen much fintech disruption in the mortgage space yet, this means Rocket Mortgage can have the first mover advantage.\u00a0\n3. Difference between other fintechs and the mortgage industry is that in this industry there are much higher startup costs, and you really have to have a lot of experience to do well. Rocket mortgage has Plenty of experience, (started in 1985, so 35 years) but they still are the first to market with a digital only platform.\u00a0  \n\n   1. Other mortgage companies can imitate the online experience, but they're not going to be winners.\u00a0\n   2. Think of your traditional banking app vs. new fintechs like Square or Cashapp. (Personally on the \"traditional\" side, I use U.S. Bank for banking and Charles Schwab for investing. Both of their apps/digital experiences are OK, but nowhere as good as other fintech apps I use like  Cashapp or Wealthfront.)\n4. Everything is moving towards digital. The boomers are dying, or at the very least, not buying very many more homes. The majority of new mortgages are going to be coming from Millennials, and soon enough, Gen Z. (There is the possibility that these generations buy less homes, as we have already seen. This is discussed in the Risks section). Millennials and Gen Z already do everything else on their phone and most of them will likely be interested in getting a mortgage on their phone/computer too.\u00a0\n\n**Risks/reasons it could go wrong:**\n\n1. They are too dependent on the mortgage industry/housing market as a whole, as well as macro trends like interest rates. This is the biggest reason I'm not more bullish. The housing market is incredibly complex and hard to understand, much less predict. There is plenty of uncertainty right now surrounding COVID, government stimulus, and unemployment. The best response here is that over the long run the housing market is usually a good bet, as everyone knows they're not making more land and people usually still want to own a home, but there certainly is a fair deal of risk in this too.\n2. This ties in to 1. above, but Millenials and Gen Z may not be as interested in buying homes as previous generations. I've seen stats saying 70% of Millenials still want to own homes, but it's hard to tell. My response here is that even if demand for houses falls a lot, I think Rocket Mortgage will still have a dominant enough competitive advantage that they will come out on top and the stock price will increase. For example, even if M and GZ demand for houses falls 20% compared to previous generations (which would be massive), my wager is that the majority of M and GZ who do get mortgages would go with Rocket, and their dominance will only increase in coming years as more things go digital.\u00a0  \n\n   1. This also ties in to the above and point 1, but as ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood says, \"Innovations thrives in a crisis\".\n3. They get disrupted by a smaller fintech. I do think that we will see more fintech players in the mortgage space in the coming 5-7 years. However, as previously stated, I think the mortgage market is inherently harder to enter than something like peer to peer payments or online banking. Plus, they ARE ALREADY the disruptor in this space.\n4. Price is overvalued because it's so new. This is another factor I'm somewhat worried about. I do very little quantitative analysis to determine fair market price. I usually just look at market history (not technical analysis because that's bullshit, but just general market price history). However, with so little data it is hard to tell what's a good price. That being said, when looking at All Time Highs and All Time Lows, it is more on the low side (currently at $23ish vs ATH of $35.)\u00a0\n\n**Question Check:** (I have a system of generic questions to evaluate each stock I invest in against. These are based almost completely off the work and process of both Stanley Druckenmiller and Warren Buffet).\n\n1. Is the world changing in a way that is advantageous to them?\n   1. Yes, everything, especially finance, is going digital. Mortgages haven't really caught up, but I think they will.\n2. Does it have an asymmetrical risk/reward ratio?\n   1. Maybe not as much as I would like (although companies like that are nearly impossible to find these days), but still yes. Upside could be huge if they become the dominant market player and realize 2-3 years of near monopoly position before incumbents catch up. Downside is likely only limited to US housing market downturn, which could be bad, but still recoverable.\u00a0\n3. Do you like the company and believe in the product?\n   1. I like the company. I haven't used their product yet (too young for a house), but every single person I've seen on reddit who has used them liked them. And they have tons of great reviews in the appstore (for the process, not just the app)\n4. Could you hold this stock forever?\n   1. Maybe not forever, but at least 20-40 years.\u00a0\n5. Is it a company that is currently doing well that could do even better?\n   1. Yes, they have been doing well for the past many years, but have really taken off with the introduction of rocket mortgage and I think will continue to do even better due to that.\u00a0\n6. Do you like and trust the management?\n   1. This is one area I'm weak in. The only management I know of is the founder, but I like his drive a lot. In case you don't know, he founded the shoe resale startup StockX too.\n7. Could this blow up and ruin me?/What are the odds it falls by a ton? (\"Don't lose money\"-Warren Buffet)\n   1. Unlikely to completely blow up unless there is some huge unforeseen occurrence that no one predicted.\n8. Would you buy the stock if it was 50% higher?\n   1. Honestly, yes. 50% higher right now would mean 34.5, which is just about all time highs. I think we have a lot farther to go in the future.\u00a0\n\nI'd love to hear any feedback, especially risks/weaknesses I missed. Let's discuss.\n\n**TLDR:** Rocket Mortgage is set to grow an insane amount over the next 5-7 years. Buy now.\u00a0\n\np.s. Sorry for the clickbait title.

        "selftext": "Back in July, Barron\u2019s ran a story profiling the rise of Nvidia (NVDA) as the company moved past Intel (INTC) in market cap to become the most valuable US semiconductor company. The  article cited Nvidia\u2019s favorable exposure to data center, gaming, and  AI as major reasons why the company overtook top spot from Intel. Only  two months later, Nvidia is now worth $107bn more than Intel. In other  words, Nvidia is worth more than an AMD more than its Santa Clara rival.  Around the same time, AMD (AMD)  also began to see significant out-performance relative to Intel shares.  With continued momentum in the PC market on the back of its Ryzen  processors and increased success in data center with the EPYC product  line, AMD has risen 57% since the start of July. Over that period, Intel  declined 15%. \n\nIn contrast to Nvidia and AMD, Intel is disproportionately associated with  the PC. Yet even within the PC market, analyst commentary has been  overwhelmingly positive on AMD whereas doubts have surfaced over Intel\u2019s  ability to innovate and remain competitive. In the span of a week at  the end of July, Intel announced a major delay with its 7nm chips and  AMD beat Q2 earnings, raised guidance, and hit its highest PC market  share since 2013. However, the focus on Intel as a struggling PC player  has wrongly overlooked several important developments that set the company up for a near-term rebound in PC and [long-term revenue opportunities in the same higher growth end markets that have fueled premium valuations for both Nvidia and AMD](https://blackjacketco.com/f/new-brand-new-intel-growth-ahead-for-tiger-lake-edge-and-av).\u00a0\n\n1. Release of Tiger Lake processor, expanded efforts in graphics via  Xe architecture, and development of discrete GPUs for data center and  desktop\n2. Continued momentum in company shift to data-centric business first and PC business second\n3. Expanded Total Addressable Market (TAM) associated with edge computing and edge-enabled technologies\n4. Competitive positioning in autonomous vehicle technology\n\nIntel is currently priced for stagnant to declining revenues, further market share erosion, and lower  relative probability of success compared to Nvidia and AMD. Given recent  product releases and refreshes, as well as a strong strategic vision to  increase share in these higher growth end markets, Intel revenue is  more likely to accelerate and lead to significant multiple expansion in  the coming years.\u00a0\n\n* Assigning Intel CY23 PT of $125 per share\n* FY23 revenue projected at $100bn\n* FY23 net income projected at $34bn delivering 7.55 in EPS\n* Applying 16.55x P/E and 4.55 P/S\u00a0\n\nFor an in-depth and comprehensive breakdown on Intel's competitive positioning, see below:\n\n**Tiger Lake and Renewed PC Innovation**\u00a0\n\nYesterday  Intel finally revealed the highly anticipated Tiger Lake 11th  generation processors for ultra-thin high-performance laptops. Industry  reporting in previous months had speculated that the new system-on-chip  (SoC \u2013 incorporates different components like graphics and AI into one  integrated unit) would offer CPU performance advances and improvements  in graphics and AI. Intel even leaked some specs on Monday that seemed  to confirm some of the performance metrics. Although independent  industry studies are required to run Tiger Lake through its full paces,  the event demonstrated that not only can Intel still innovate, it is  more than premature to start counting the company out on PCs.\u00a0\n\nTiger  Lake clocks up to 20% higher frequencies compared to the 10th  generation Ice Lake family and can reach a single core turbo of 4.8 GHz.  During the presentation, Intel noted that the integrated Iris Xe  graphics perform better than 90% of PCs sold last year, on-board AI is  up to 5x more effective, and WiFi connectivity is up to 3x faster. In a  like-for-like comparison to AMD, Tiger Lake enabled 4x faster photo  upscaling, 2x faster video processing and exporting via Adobe Pro, and  20% faster performance in both Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. For  gaming, Intel conducted side-by-side tests using Gears Tactics. Laptops  running AMD 4800U with integrated graphics and a Nvidia MX350 discrete  graphics card (with Intel 10th Gen i7) performed worse than Tiger Lake.  Intel\u2019s test showed that Tiger Lake handled the game at up to 66% higher  frames per second versus the AMD and Nvidia-powered laptops.\u00a0\n\nBarring significant discrepancies found during independent reviews, Intel just  delivered performance on 10nm that is equivalent to what is possible on  7nm. With the simultaneous launch of the Evo brand to encompass the new  11th generation-powered ultra-thin high-performance laptop range, Intel  can begin building customer brand recognition and altering perceptions  that Intel has lost competitive footing in the PC market. With 50 PC  designs set to ship with Tiger Lake as soon as this fall, and at least  150 designs anticipated from partner OEMs, Intel may see a very  near-term recovery in its PC market share even despite the 7nm delay.\u00a0 \n\n**Transition to Data-Centric Business and Future at the Edge**\n\nMore  important to Intel\u2019s future is the multi-year shift towards  higher-growth end markets associated with cloud, edge, and data. Rather  than PCs, Intel sees its primary business as the Data-Centric reporting  segment that now comprises 52% of revenues. That figure is likely to  expand in coming quarters following 34% YoY growth in the most recent  earnings report. In FY19 Q2, the Data-Centric segment only accounted for  46% of revenues.\u00a0\n\nThat  Data-Centric segment includes: The Data Center Group (36.3% of total  Intel revenues); Non-Volatile Memory Storage Group (8.5%);  Internet-of-Things Group (3.4%); Programmable Solutions Group (2.6%);  and Mobileye (0.7%). The two largest contributors to the segment are  performing extremely well. The Data Center Group grew 43% YoY and saw  operating income climb 72%. The second largest business in the segment,  Non-Volatile Memory Storage, grew 76% YoY for record revenue on the back  of NAND demand growth and higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs).\u00a0\n\nBy  2024, Intel expects its TAM to reach $300bn. But $230bn of this is  attributed to the Data-Centric TAM. And Intel\u2019s own calculations may be  slightly conservative. In the company\u2019s analysis of its various end  markets, Intel only mentioned the edge compute market in general terms.  Yet that market alone is projected to surpass $100bn by 2030. As much as  public cloud adoption drove demand for server-related products over the  past five years, the edge could end up being a far more important  trend. That is because, in addition to further server demand, the edge  will enable billions of IoT devices to finally become widespread after  years of hype. With TAM growth associated with edge server CPU, GPU, and  storage, plus IoT and edge AI solutions, Intel can achieve growth into  the 2030s so long as the company can execute on its strategic vision. \u00a0\n\n*Edge Server*\u00a0\n\nAn S&amp;P Global study  in spring 2020 estimated that Intel has 90-95% share of the data center  CPU market despite recent share gains by AMD. While edge server  architectures and processes differ versus hyperscale cloud servers, this  figure is testament to the strength of Intel\u2019s relationships with the  leading cloud providers that are also among the early movers in the edge  computing space \u2013 namely Amazon with its Lambda@Edge platform,  Microsoft with Azure Functions, and Google with Google Cloud Functions. \u00a0\n\nFor  smaller edge providers especially, like Fastly, Akamai, or Cloudflare,  there will be particular emphasis on price-per-performance for server  components. Until recently, that dynamic favored AMD whose EPYC Rome  7742 processor rivals Intel\u2019s Xeon Platinum 8280 on performance yet  undercuts it on price by about 60%. The cost efficiency of EPYC led to  some important edge server design wins for AMD, including Cloudflare\u2019s  new GenX server that excluded Intel parts for the first time.\u00a0\n\nThe  latest Xeon processors had been on the market for a couple years,  though, and Intel refreshed the product line earlier this year in an  attempt to greatly reduce cost while maintaining performance. In its 24  February press release, Intel directly addressed the need to become more  competitive with AMD on price-per-performance noting that the Xeon  refresh: \u201c\u2026\\[reinforces\\] Intel\u2019s data center leadership by providing  greater performance and performance-per-dollar choices for\u2026customers  across cloud, network and edge.\u201d While Intel compromised on  compatibility with certain server designs, the result is 1.42x better  price-per-core-performance and a cost of $141 per-core for the Gold  6258R. The price tag puts Xeon in a much stronger position relative to  EPYC Rome 7742 which goes for $108 per-core.\u00a0\n\nDespite  early advantages in cost-per-performance for AMD, Intel still managed  to double its edge deployments year-over-year according to Forbes. And  its impressive partner list includes Lenovo, Red Hat, Advantech,  Caswell, Inventec, Lanner, Nexcom, World Wide Technology, Ericsson, ZTE,  Verizon, Vodafone, Nokia, and China Telecom, among others. With drastic  improvements in price-per-performance, Intel could very well see  additional customer wins in upcoming quarters.\u00a0\n\nBeyond  CPU, edge applications will see an increase in demand for integrated  and hybrid GPUs. Between advancements in Intel Xe graphics and its  development of discrete graphics cards, the company will become better  positioned to take advantage of the more than 33% CAGR projected for  GPUs from 2020 to 2027 \u2013 taking the market from just under $20bn in 2019  to over $200bn according to Deloitte.  Even if Nvidia and AMD maintain large leads over Intel in GPU market  share for edge servers, even a marginal portion of the market could be  meaningful to the Data Center Group which measured around $7bn in Q2.\u00a0\n\nIn  addition, edge servers present an unprecedented opportunity for NAND  solutions as well \u2013 specifically flash storage that utilizes the NVMe  (Non-Volatile Memory Express) protocol. Edge servers have strong need  for high-performance startup operations and extremely reliable storage.  That is because rapid startup times are critical for edge providers to  quickly launch computing instances and deliver the lowest possible  latency for their customers. Improvements in NVMe NAND greatly shrink  the physical storage footprint, reduce power and cooling costs, all the  while improving the overall speed, flexibility, and failure rates. And  Intel Optane and 3D NAND SSDs are exceptionally reliable for storage and  offer performance improvements over legacy storage solutions.\u00a0\n\n*IoT and AI*\n\nMuch  like edge servers, edge deployed IoT devices will similarly boost  demand for Intel processors. For workload intensive industrial IoT,  Intel has its Core processor. And the Intel Atom processor is  purpose-built for lower-power or embedded applications. Because IoT  devices will collect and process vast amounts of data, these  applications will also require significant amounts of flash memory \u2013  specifically NAND. On-device NAND SSD can increase data transfer speeds  while also integrating module-level security features, remote  management, and more flexible power configurations. Collectively,  improvements in NAND will lower total cost of ownership for these  machines. \u00a0\n\nThe edge will lead  to rapid growth for edge AI chipsets that enable IoT devices to deploy  machine learning at the edge without having to send data via internet  back to a centralized data center. Deloitte notes that around 300  million edge AI chips were sold in 2017, but this year could see more  than 750 million units hit the market. With compounded annual growth in  edge AI chipsets anticipated to outpace the broader semiconductor  industry by a considerable amount, ABI research predicts that these edge chips will surpass the market for cloud AI chips by 2025 \u2013 marking a massive shift.\u00a0\n\n**Mobileye and Autonomous Driving Technology**\u00a0\n\nIt  is interesting the extent to which mainstream conversations in media  and financial commentary largely exclude Intel\u2019s Mobileye and instead  focus on Tesla as the technology leader in autonomous vehicles and  Nvidia as the chipmaker best positioned to disrupt. Although Telsa  claims to offer autonomous modes for its vehicles, based on the 5-level  autonomous capability hierarchy \u2013 the industry standard established by  the Society of Automotive Engineers \u2013 the most advanced cars currently  on the market only operate at level 2+. Level 2+ falls between levels 2  (partial automation) and 3 (conditional automation). The hardware to  support full level 5 autonomy does exist in 2020, and the software  necessary to manage these systems is not too far behind. However, it  will likely take 5-7 years before manufacturing volumes reach levels to  drive down hardware prices, the necessary regulatory frameworks come  into place, and fully autonomous vehicles gain broad consumer  acceptance. \u00a0\n\nIn the  intermediary period, the progression towards level 5 autonomy will  continue to be gradual and incremental. Higher degrees of autonomy will  be achieved by increasingly sophisticated advanced driver assistance  systems (ADAS) that prove out the viability of these technologies and  underpin the manufacturing, regulatory, and consumer environment that  will facilitate the future arrival of self-driving cars. Beyond this, in  many cases the same technology at the center of levels 4 and 5 builds  on the existing foundations of ADAS capabilities. And the dominant  player in the ADAS market is not Tesla, Waymo, or Nvidia. It is  Mobileye.\u00a0\n\nMobileye\u2019s market  share has consistently stayed above 70% for years, even as competition  from other players has ramped up \u2013 Nvidia in particular. The Mobileye  solution is noteworthy, pairing its SoC \u2013 the EyeQ family \u2013 to support a  range of ADAS capabilities using only a single camera sensor. This  differs from the LiDAR and radar-based systems favored by Waymo, Uber,  GM-owned Cruise, and Nvidia. Tesla \u2013 who previously used Mobileye  technology until the two parted ways in 2016 \u2013 also leverages a  camera-based system. However, Tesla deploys ultrasonic sensors and  radars in combination with billions of miles of driver data.\u00a0\n\nMobileye\u2019s  commanding market share in ADAS means that its technology is used by  more than 300 models from 25 global automakers, resulting in 60 million  vehicles on the road worldwide. In contrast, Tesla currently has fewer  than 1 million vehicles on the road equipped with variants of its  autopilot technology. And Mobileye is already working with 4 major OEMs  to soon provide level 3 autonomous solutions. As part of its  arrangements with OEMs, Mobileye receives access to sensor data from  customer vehicles. At present, Mobileye is collecting 3.7 million miles  per day and growing as another 2 million vehicles from these OEMs are  set to join the data-sharing program over the next two years.\u00a0\n\nWhat  this translates to is a massive partner network with the world\u2019s  leading auto OEMs who will all have a vested interest in competing with  Tesla both in autonomous but also electric vehicles. This also means  that Mobileye has a significant advantage over Nvidia in getting its  ADAS and future autonomous solutions on vehicles. As Mobileye further  prioritizes its fully autonomous solutions, its leading competitive  positioning in ADAS, as well its strong relationships with OEMs, gives  the company a strategic advantage over its competitors as higher levels  of autonomous technologies go to market. This is evidenced by Mobileye\u2019s  strategic partnership with Tesla EV rival NIO to offer level 4 consumer  vehicles by 2022.\u00a0\n\nEven though  Mobileye made its name based on its single camera platform, the company  is separately developing what is called a full autonomous stack,  incorporating the necessary LiDAR, radar, non-camera sensors, GPS,  modems, and other hardware components that will run on its 5thgeneration  EyeQ processor. In the meantime, Mobileye recently demoed a  self-driving vehicle that navigated the congested streets of Jerusalem  using only 12 cameras and no LiDAR, radar, or non-camera sensors.\u00a0\n\nOn  the back of the hyperbolic move in Tesla shares YTD, numerous articles  have lauded the company\u2019s so-called multi-year advantages over rivals in  the space. Notably, in July Elon Musk stated that Tesla is \u201cvery close\u201d  to level 5 autonomy with no updates needed to hardware as the company\u2019s  Tesla Computer processor currently supports full autonomy. Mobileye\u2019s  EyeQ 5 also supports level 5 autonomy, however. And although the Tesla  Computer exceeds EyeQ 5 on tera operations per second (TOPS), EyeQ 5  offers footprint and power consumption advantages. Moreover, unlike most  other players in autonomous systems, Mobileye has opted for an open  architecture that enables OEMs to program their own software on top of  Mobileye hardware.\u00a0\n\nTesla has a  lead in data collected per mile at over 3 billion miles, but Mobileye is  catching up and its data repositories also exceed the billion-mile mark  on an annual run rate basis. To deepen the data sets available to  Mobileye, Intel also bought Israeli mobility-as-a-service company Moovit  for $900mn this year. Like Tesla, Mobileye is set to offer its  technology in the important robotaxi market that many in the industry  view as the precursor to consumer-adopted fully autonomous vehicles down  the line. Mobileye is launching pilot robotaxi fleets in Tel Aviv,  Paris, and Daegu City in 2022.\u00a0\n\nMobileye  still accounts for less than 1% of total Intel revenues despite  doubling sales since being acquired by Intel. Given the strength of  Mobileye\u2019s position in the ADAS market that is expected to grow to more  than $80bn by 2030, as well as the prospects in robotaxis and level 4/5  autonomous systems, Mobileye has strong potential to develop into a  major growth engine for Intel over the next 4-5 years.\u00a0\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIntel  shares are roughly flat since early 2018 despite revenues up almost 20%  from FY19 Q2 to FY20 Q2. The relative out-performance in Nvidia and AMD  shares over that time has furthered perceptions that Intel could fall  behind as the former two companies achieve sustained revenue growth tied  to more attractive end markets like data center, gaming, AI, and  autonomous vehicles.\u00a0\n\nHowever,  recent struggles with certain products and lost PC market share to AMD  have distracted investors from Intel\u2019s ongoing transition to a more data-centric business. With a $230bn TAM projected by 2024 for this  operating segment alone, Intel has multiple opportunities to likewise  drive revenue growth over the long-term.\u00a0\n\nGiven  the company\u2019s recent advancements with its 11th generation Tiger Lake SoC, continued progress in improving price-per-performance for edge  server components, and the vastly underrated leadership of Mobileye in  the ADAS and autonomous vehicle markets, Intel offers an extremely  compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to these  technology trends at a more reasonable valuation.\u00a0\n\n*You can find me on Twitter* [@BlackjacketCo](https://twitter.com/BlackjacketCo) *where I write about emerging technologies, industry news, and long-term market trends.

By definition, it tends to be bigger companies which are on the stock market. So inevitably the stock market can\u2019t capture the thousands of small businesses that are failing. Yet, even here, disaggregation of the S&amp;P tells us a lot. Again, there is a wide and sharp dispersion right now, with average returns for large firms a lot higher than smaller firms. This wasn\u2019t the case in February. More than half the companies in the index have less than $25 billion in market capitalization, and the average year-to-date return for all these companies (equally-weighted) is negative.  \n\n&gt;Once returns are broken down by sales growth, we see dramatic differences based on sales growth and decline. Returns are in fact highest for companies with the strongest year-over-year sales growth. Among those with sales growth greater than 20% are familiar companies like Amazon and Netflix, but also much smaller companies like Nvidia and Paypal. In other words, tech stock returns are being driven by tech sales.\n\n&gt;This does not mean that stocks, especially the ones that have really run up in price, are avoiding overvaluation. However, that is a different question. If there are overvalued stocks, it is likely caused by companies that have seen the biggest sales growth leading to overoptimistic expectations of future sales growth. Overconfidence reflects the economy and beliefs about the economy, while none of us know the future. But this is a generic point, not an argument for setting aside consideration of the stock market. Stocks with the highest valuation, as measured by forward price to earnings ratio, have in fact gained the most year-to-date.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR SPY P $300 10/16     \n\nToday's Fed announcement will be the first sell the news event on JPow because there's nothing he or the Fed can do to spur inflation. Most wealth is now tied up in assets for the top 10% and is sloshing around to different classes without increasing money velocity. There's only so many Gucci bags these people can buy and banks aren't doing shit with Fed liquidity, because they don't want to lend money to an economy of people without jobs and a $1200 Robinhood account. \n       \nNew mortgage lending has gotten tight as fuck and remains out of reach for most people despite low rates. Top 10% will likely continue to move wealth into prime residential property to keep valuations high and extract rent from the rest of the population.       \n\nSPY will pump in the next two hours leading up to the announcement and then tank right after, as hedge funds and other big fuckers use this liquidity to get out. Every Joe Bob and Harry expects rampant inflation in the coming years but most people are fucking idiots, and smart money knows deflation is actually the problem due to the reasons listed above. Smart money just isn't ready to talk about it on CNBC yet.      \n\nKeep an eye on the DXY leading up to the U.S. election. Historically it pumps, and has an inverse correlation to asset prices. After Trump wins the markers might go nuts for a couple months to mirror expectations of a repeat move from the 2016 election, then expect a slow slide into oblivion over the coming years as deflation settles in and the DXY heads to ATH valuations. Good luck to all NKLA call holders.",

        "selftext": "[This Twitter post](https://twitter.com/girldadninja/status/1305111815509086208?s=19)\nshows screen of instagram conversation with Trevor Milton and he says:\n\n\"We will have the documents out next week to debunk all the lies. I can't promise what the stock will do but it will show the report was full of lies.\"\n\nI've red it and to be honest it doesn't sound comforting at all - nothing has changed on his side, still says the report is a lie but nothing more of substance, before he said that lawyers forbid him and they take it through legal way so he shut up on social media finally but as we can see here he still responds to pm's. They can't contain him or he just doesn't know what he is doing? Or the \"lawyer thing\" was just a bluff?\nSecond of all - if the report was full of lies and their documents will prove it, shouldn't he be calm about stocks price? I mean - if you are clean there is nothing to worry about, people who left will come back with more loyalty and belief in your vision.\nTo be honest all they would need to do is show proof of technology able to create hydrogen fuel for less than 81% of current price and I'd gladly jump on this boat even if its sinking right now.\nI was waiting this weekend for some NKLA response to convince me to buy the dip but it looks like the dip is not finished.",

        "selftext": "Alright my favorite group of aspies let's talk real estate and why you should give a shit.  For reference I'm going on 7 years as a full time agent (also down 7k on options cause im a paper handed bitch).  This is not financial advice and I don't currently have any holdings to shill you (cash gang).\n\nReal estate correlates so strongly with rates it might as well just be tied to it.  There's a feeding frenzy in residential right now because of low rates and zero inventory.  Also, in residential real estate you can get so much leverage that it makes your margin accounts look like a flaccid dick on Friday night.  We talking 96.5 % Loan to Value.\n\nAside from low interest rates and general covid fear. There's pretty low inventory across the board cause Donny isn't allowing foreclosures through the end of the year at least on the Fed backed paper.  This means banks can't take grandmas home and sell it until the end of March give or take.\n\nOn the other hand Commercial lease contracts are usually years long and are still on-going and most corporate businesses have probably been paying their landlord.  There will be a swath of small businesses going BK and exiting smaller leases.  This is a given.\n\nLow inventory high prices.  Thank you college.\n\nWhat happens when the moratorium on foreclosures +90 days passes.  Banks going to take back grandma's home and sell it at the market.  Increasing inventory.  With low interest rates this is fine.  There's fairly good buying power in middle class America to keep residential more stable (relatively).  More importantly you buy residential real estate based on your personal income.\n\nWhat happens when commercial leases start expiring and corporate America doesn't care if you watch porn and move pixels around at home as long you do whatever you do well enough to not make your boss look bad.  They don't renew their lease, take substantially smaller space, or take space at a reduced rate.  Increasing inventory of leases.  Lower rents and top line goes down for commercial landlords.  Now the critical difference here is that the great majority of commercial assets rely upon cash flow to determine value of the asset and qualify for the loan. So commercial asset prices start to come down to meet the new and reducing demand for commercial space.  This now means a ton of more recent acquisitions in commercial are underwater and paying fairly high interest rates 4% - 6% with LTVS closer 65% and often much shorter term notes.  So the owners have to decide quickly whether to pay a higher rate with less income or bail on the asset and take the equity they have left.  Tough choice since its not a 30 year amortized fixed at 3.2%.\n\nOn the high end I bet commercial real estate takes a cut as high as 35% within 36 months.\n\nI'd personally consider buying REITs after there is further downward correction on real estate.\n\ntldr: commercial reits are going to have a bad time\n\nConsidering rolling savings into PSTH.U and just forgetting about it.  All feedback welcome and will reply as I am able.",
