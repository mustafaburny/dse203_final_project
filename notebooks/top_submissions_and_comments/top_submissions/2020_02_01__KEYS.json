        "selftext": "The Decentralised Finance space is developing and offers some interesting financial instruments. One that particularly caught my attention is Dai Savings Rate (DSR). Dai is a decentralized stablecoin (i.e. 1DAI = $1) built on Ethereum platform (MakerDAO project) with over 100M market cap.\n\nOne feature of DAI is the possibility to generate variable yearly interest with no exposure to any (volatile) crypto asset. Current rate at 7.50 APR  makes it a very lucrative investment. Rate can change, but it's not necessary to lock funds for prolonged time - if it gets too low one can simply exchange dai back to fiat currency to invest elsewhere. Many exchanges provide liquid DAI/USD pairs.\n\nWhile holding DAI doesn't expose investors to the volatility of \"normal\" crypto assets, there are other risks to keep in mind:\n\n* Wallet Management: utilising DSR requires careful management of keys and performing transactions. While it's only a couple of transactions, losing a private key or sending funds to a wrong address can lead to loss of all assets. One should start with smaller amounts first to get comfortable with the system.\n* Smart Contract Risk: the system is decentralised, and a bug in the contract can lead to fund loss. However, the MakerDAO smart contracts were audited multiple times and already hold significant amount of funds for prolonged time, making this risk much lower. \n* There might be a bug in Ethereum itself - very unlikely at this point. If desired, it can be hedged with buying Put options on ETH.\n\nsource and more info: [https://ethereumprice.org/guides/article/dai-savings-rate-explained/](https://ethereumprice.org/guides/article/dai-savings-rate-explained/), [https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/f4xijg/should\\_i\\_put\\_100000\\_dai\\_into\\_dai\\_savings\\_rate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/f4xijg/should_i_put_100000_dai_into_dai_savings_rate/)",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Coronavirus fears spoiled a solid earnings season and will further dominate markets ahead\u2019  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-fears-ruin-solid-earnings-season-and-cloud-growth-picture.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The coronavirus outbreak ruined for investors what was a solid earnings reporting season and is casting a pall on forecasts for this quarter and the rest of this year. And now with most of the earnings season in the books, look for the latest coronavirus headlines to fill the vacuum and weigh on stocks the rest of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Fourth-quarter profit growth for S&amp;P 500 companies came in at 3.1%, and if the energy sector is excluded, the growth rate was 6.0%, according to Refinitiv. Just about four weeks ago, analysts expected a slight decline.\n*****\n&gt; However, the deluge of solid corporate results was largely overlooked by investors who are focusing on the spillover impact from the coronavirus on U.S. corporations. Stocks post losses this week as a jump in confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths deepened concerns about slowing global economic growth. Major U.S. companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble have sounded alarms on the disease, warning of a dent in profits down the road.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe virus is totally underrated,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said on Friday.\u201cWhat I think is a little too premature is they all presume that it is going to be solved within a foreseeable time frame. At what point do we say that many, many companies are going to be hurt by the virus [and] we\u2019re paying too much for stocks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018More cautious than usual\u2019\n&gt; Wall Street analysts have been quick to slash their earnings expectations for the next quarter in light of the fast-spreading virus. Expectations for earnings growth in the first quarter have been cut in half to just 3.2% from more than 6% at the start of 2020, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Companies themselves are also lowering guidance for earnings growth in the near future. There have been more U.S. companies issuing below-consensus guidance for the next quarter than those with upbeat forecasts, marking the weakest ratio in a February since 2014, according to Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile guidance is typically weak in the first quarter as corporates set a low bar, it has been more cautious than usual this earnings season, likely due to the coronavirus,\u201d Subramanian said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have cited coronavirus during their earnings call this season, according to FactSet. These companies\u2019 average revenue exposure to China is 7.2%, compared to 4.8% exposure for the average S&amp;P 500 company.\n*****\n&gt; As of Friday, China\u2019s National Health Commission reported more than 75,000 confirmed cases and over 2,000 deaths on the mainland. South Korea has also reported more than 200 cases. Meanwhile, World health officials said the outbreak in Iran is \u201cvery worrisome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season,\u201d John Lynch, LPL Financial\u2019s chief investment strategist, said in a note. \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ePo2a9q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ClwuPuJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/jpEvLyH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/flHhHRv.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HyjYjBt.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/XCThMbQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TN0RBSk.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ixAr7Su.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ncauH0T.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/x4XfkyA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yeknvyf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hOU10RV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Earnings Season Observations\n\n&gt; The recent news that technology giant Apple would miss its fourth quarter 2020 revenue targets has understandably increased investor anxiety surrounding the potential economic impact of the coronavirus (now called COVID-19). Lost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season.\n\n&gt; \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cDespite slowing global economic growth, weakness in capital investment and manufacturing, a strong US dollar, and a huge drop in energy sector profits, S&amp;P 500 companies are impressively grinding out 1-2 percentage points of overall earnings growth.\u201d The fourth quarter earnings growth may cement the third quarter of 2019 as the trough, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some highlights of this earnings season:\n\n&gt; * **Solid revenue upside**. A solid 65% of S&amp;P 500 Index companies have beaten revenue estimates, the highest level since second quarter 2018 and well above the long-term average at 57%. S&amp;P 500 companies have produced a larger-than-normal nearly one percentage point positive revenue surprise and are tracking to a 3.5% top-line increase.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/revenue-tracking-nicely-ahead-of-expectations-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Respectable earnings upside despite headwinds**. The earnings beat rate at 71% is slightly above the 10-year average (70%). S&amp;P 500 earnings growth has surprised by a solid 4.4% so far despite economic, currency, and commodity headwinds.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Consider the energy drag**. Though 1-2% overall earnings growth isn\u2019t much, the gain is approximately 4%, excluding the energy sector.\n&gt; * ** Sector standout**. One of the most China-exposed sectors produced one of the biggest upside earnings surprises: Technology. Technology sector earnings growth is tracking to a 5% year-over-year increase, about 9 percentage points above prior estimates.\n&gt; * **Reassuring outlooks**. Estimates for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share in 2020 have only fallen by about 0.9% since December 31, 2019. Though these numbers may come down a bit more in the coming days and the China situation remains fluid, this modest reduction reflects U.S. companies\u2019 resilience overall amid significant supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n# Election Year March: Performance Haunted By Steep 1980 Declines\n\n&gt; Boisterous March markets tend to drive prices up early in the month and batter stocks at month end. Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to \u201cbeware the Ides of March\u201d but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. In March 2001, DJIA plunged 1469 points (-11.8%) from March 9 to the 22.\n\n&gt; Normally a decent performing market month, March is somewhat above average in election years with advances 64.7% of the time with a 1.0% average DJIA gain since 1952. S&amp;P 500 has also advanced 64.7% of the time since 1952, but gains have been slightly better at 1.2%, on average. NASDAQ has not fared well in March in election years since 1972. Due to a 17.1% loss in 1980, March is NASDAQ\u2019s second worst month of the election year. Similarly, March 1980\u2019s steep losses adversely affect Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indices.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9950c2a54b4059c3ffe0481a83cf281a/573a7bf3eae7af17-3d/s400x600/7703526bf6d4a2214d4e4b75883edec7f23d56af.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Performance Throughout The Presidencies\n\n&gt; As markets were closed to observe Presidents Day yesterday and the 2020 Presidential election continues to ramp up, we thought it would be a good time to check up on stock performance during different administrations. In the table below, we show the performance of the Dow during the administrations of every US president since 1900 in addition to the annualized return. In the time since President Trump was sworn into office, the Dow has risen 46.9%. On an annualized basis, the 13.3% return places the current administration in 3rd place for the strongest performance. Only the Clinton administration in the 1990s and Coolidge administration in the 1920s have observed stronger annualized gains. The one caveat of course is that President Trump's term (or terms) has yet to end. Comparing Democratic and Republican administrations since 1900, Democratic presidencies have tended to average stronger returns than their Republican peers, so the stock market's returns under President Trump have deviated somewhat from the norm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-Presidents1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it is impossible to say what a candidate's election will mean for the market, at the moment betting markets favor the incumbent to win the presidency while Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg go back and forth in taking the number 2 spot, hovering around 15%-16%. Come Super Tuesday (March 3rd) when we could finally see more clarity on the Democratic side, the back and forth between Bloomberg and Sanders might become more one-sided.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-EBO.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yet Another Corona Friday\n\n&gt; The major indices decided it was five o'clock somewhere right off the bat today as they experience yet another \"Corona Friday\". More concerns around the coronavirus have sent stocks lower with the S&amp;P 500 down around 1.1% as of this writing and the Nasdaq down nearly 2% today. Declines on a Friday have become par for the course in 2020. Fridays have been the weakest day of the week so far in 2020; the only one to average a decline. On average, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.52% on Fridays while the next worst day has been Monday which has averaged a gain of 0.19%. Fridays have also been the day that the S&amp;P 500 has closed higher the least. Only 28.6% of Fridays this year have seen the S&amp;P 500 finish in the green. That compares to a positive close more than three-quarters of the time on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. While it has averaged a gain of 0.24%, Tuesdays have also experienced a positive close less than half of the time.

All three indexes are well above their respective historical averages for this time of an election year. NASDAQ has in fact already exceeded its average full election year performance going back to 1972. Bullish sentiment and momentum appear to be firmly in place and historical election year patterns suggests strength could easily continue for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 into May. NASDAQ\u2019s surge higher could be vulnerable to a retreat sooner, in March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/baea2768b612eb15dbd047fbc0cff07b/5100d48ef25e7c53-d2/s500x750/10e181f3beef5c191c7ec0ad2bf7e50a0e449324.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Dow Without Boeing (BA)\n\n&gt; For more than a year now, Boeing (BA) has been plagued by the 737 MAX crisis which has weighed on shares of the plane manufacturer with it now currently down nearly 20% from when the initial groundings took place on March 10th of last year. Despite this, while underperforming the broader market due to the 737 issues, the stock is actually still up just over 5% since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; Even though BA has lagged, it is still the highest-priced of the 30 stocks in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average. Currently trading around $338.50, the only stocks in the index holding a candle to BA are Apple (AAPL) and UnitedHealth (UNH), which also trade north of $300 per share. That means these stocks have the highest weighting in the index and therefore have a much larger impact than other stocks on the Dow's performance.\n\n&gt; With BA's issues, a number of people have pondered the what-ifs for the Dow had the company not had the issues with the 737. Would we have already broken out the Dow 30K hats were it not for BA? In the chart below, we show the actual performance of the DJIA and have overlaid the performance of an 'alternate Dow' showing its performance if BA had not been in the index since the start of 2019. We used the start of 2019 instead of the actual date of the groundings as it is a little less arbitrary. By our calculations, while we would be a bit closer, even if BA wasn't in the index since the start of 2019, we wouldn't quite be at Dow 30K yet. As shown, our alternate Dow would be almost 1% or 266 points higher if Boeing was not included in the index since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; While BA has been a drag on the DJIA since last March, it also provided a big boost to the index in early 2018 before the 737 issues hit the stock. In fact, at the start of March 2017, BA was up over 36% YTD and the spread between the Dow's performance with and without BA was around 700 points in the other direction as it is now!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow-wo-BA-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Another example of this dynamic in which high priced stocks have a greater impact on the index was observed on Tuesday when Apple's (AAPL) stock fell after the company warned that Q1 revenues would be shy of prior guidance due to the coronavirus. The warnings sent shares down over 3% at its intraday lows, but the stock only finished down 1.83%. While there were equivalent or larger declines like Dow (DOW) or Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) in Tuesday's session, AAPL's declines by far weighed on the index more than any other stock.

And now with most of the earnings season in the books, look for the latest coronavirus headlines to fill the vacuum and weigh on stocks the rest of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Fourth-quarter profit growth for S&amp;P 500 companies came in at 3.1%, and if the energy sector is excluded, the growth rate was 6.0%, according to Refinitiv. Just about four weeks ago, analysts expected a slight decline.\n*****\n&gt; However, the deluge of solid corporate results was largely overlooked by investors who are focusing on the spillover impact from the coronavirus on U.S. corporations. Stocks post losses this week as a jump in confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths deepened concerns about slowing global economic growth. Major U.S. companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble have sounded alarms on the disease, warning of a dent in profits down the road.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe virus is totally underrated,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said on Friday.\u201cWhat I think is a little too premature is they all presume that it is going to be solved within a foreseeable time frame. At what point do we say that many, many companies are going to be hurt by the virus [and] we\u2019re paying too much for stocks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018More cautious than usual\u2019\n&gt; Wall Street analysts have been quick to slash their earnings expectations for the next quarter in light of the fast-spreading virus. Expectations for earnings growth in the first quarter have been cut in half to just 3.2% from more than 6% at the start of 2020, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Companies themselves are also lowering guidance for earnings growth in the near future. There have been more U.S. companies issuing below-consensus guidance for the next quarter than those with upbeat forecasts, marking the weakest ratio in a February since 2014, according to Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile guidance is typically weak in the first quarter as corporates set a low bar, it has been more cautious than usual this earnings season, likely due to the coronavirus,\u201d Subramanian said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have cited coronavirus during their earnings call this season, according to FactSet. These companies\u2019 average revenue exposure to China is 7.2%, compared to 4.8% exposure for the average S&amp;P 500 company.\n*****\n&gt; As of Friday, China\u2019s National Health Commission reported more than 75,000 confirmed cases and over 2,000 deaths on the mainland. South Korea has also reported more than 200 cases. Meanwhile, World health officials said the outbreak in Iran is \u201cvery worrisome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season,\u201d John Lynch, LPL Financial\u2019s chief investment strategist, said in a note. \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ePo2a9q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ClwuPuJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/jpEvLyH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/flHhHRv.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HyjYjBt.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/XCThMbQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TN0RBSk.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ixAr7Su.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ncauH0T.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/x4XfkyA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yeknvyf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hOU10RV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Earnings Season Observations\n\n&gt; The recent news that technology giant Apple would miss its fourth quarter 2020 revenue targets has understandably increased investor anxiety surrounding the potential economic impact of the coronavirus (now called COVID-19). Lost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season.\n\n&gt; \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cDespite slowing global economic growth, weakness in capital investment and manufacturing, a strong US dollar, and a huge drop in energy sector profits, S&amp;P 500 companies are impressively grinding out 1-2 percentage points of overall earnings growth.\u201d The fourth quarter earnings growth may cement the third quarter of 2019 as the trough, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some highlights of this earnings season:\n\n&gt; * **Solid revenue upside**. A solid 65% of S&amp;P 500 Index companies have beaten revenue estimates, the highest level since second quarter 2018 and well above the long-term average at 57%. S&amp;P 500 companies have produced a larger-than-normal nearly one percentage point positive revenue surprise and are tracking to a 3.5% top-line increase.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/revenue-tracking-nicely-ahead-of-expectations-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Respectable earnings upside despite headwinds**. The earnings beat rate at 71% is slightly above the 10-year average (70%). S&amp;P 500 earnings growth has surprised by a solid 4.4% so far despite economic, currency, and commodity headwinds.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Consider the energy drag**. Though 1-2% overall earnings growth isn\u2019t much, the gain is approximately 4%, excluding the energy sector.\n&gt; * **Sector standout**. One of the most China-exposed sectors produced one of the biggest upside earnings surprises: Technology. Technology sector earnings growth is tracking to a 5% year-over-year increase, about 9 percentage points above prior estimates.\n&gt; * **Reassuring outlooks**. Estimates for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share in 2020 have only fallen by about 0.9% since December 31, 2019. Though these numbers may come down a bit more in the coming days and the China situation remains fluid, this modest reduction reflects U.S. companies\u2019 resilience overall amid significant supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n# Election Year March: Performance Haunted By Steep 1980 Declines\n\n&gt; Boisterous March markets tend to drive prices up early in the month and batter stocks at month end. Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to \u201cbeware the Ides of March\u201d but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. In March 2001, DJIA plunged 1469 points (-11.8%) from March 9 to the 22.\n\n&gt; Normally a decent performing market month, March is somewhat above average in election years with advances 64.7% of the time with a 1.0% average DJIA gain since 1952. S&amp;P 500 has also advanced 64.7% of the time since 1952, but gains have been slightly better at 1.2%, on average. NASDAQ has not fared well in March in election years since 1972. Due to a 17.1% loss in 1980, March is NASDAQ\u2019s second worst month of the election year. Similarly, March 1980\u2019s steep losses adversely affect Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indices.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9950c2a54b4059c3ffe0481a83cf281a/573a7bf3eae7af17-3d/s400x600/7703526bf6d4a2214d4e4b75883edec7f23d56af.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Performance Throughout The Presidencies\n\n&gt; As markets were closed to observe Presidents Day yesterday and the 2020 Presidential election continues to ramp up, we thought it would be a good time to check up on stock performance during different administrations. In the table below, we show the performance of the Dow during the administrations of every US president since 1900 in addition to the annualized return. In the time since President Trump was sworn into office, the Dow has risen 46.9%. On an annualized basis, the 13.3% return places the current administration in 3rd place for the strongest performance. Only the Clinton administration in the 1990s and Coolidge administration in the 1920s have observed stronger annualized gains. The one caveat of course is that President Trump's term (or terms) has yet to end. Comparing Democratic and Republican administrations since 1900, Democratic presidencies have tended to average stronger returns than their Republican peers, so the stock market's returns under President Trump have deviated somewhat from the norm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-Presidents1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it is impossible to say what a candidate's election will mean for the market, at the moment betting markets favor the incumbent to win the presidency while Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg go back and forth in taking the number 2 spot, hovering around 15%-16%. Come Super Tuesday (March 3rd) when we could finally see more clarity on the Democratic side, the back and forth between Bloomberg and Sanders might become more one-sided.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-EBO.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yet Another Corona Friday\n\n&gt; The major indices decided it was five o'clock somewhere right off the bat today as they experience yet another \"Corona Friday\". More concerns around the coronavirus have sent stocks lower with the S&amp;P 500 down around 1.1% as of this writing and the Nasdaq down nearly 2% today. Declines on a Friday have become par for the course in 2020. Fridays have been the weakest day of the week so far in 2020; the only one to average a decline. On average, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.52% on Fridays while the next worst day has been Monday which has averaged a gain of 0.19%. Fridays have also been the day that the S&amp;P 500 has closed higher the least. Only 28.6% of Fridays this year have seen the S&amp;P 500 finish in the green. That compares to a positive close more than three-quarters of the time on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. While it has averaged a gain of 0.24%, Tuesdays have also experienced a positive close less than half of the time.

All three indexes are well above their respective historical averages for this time of an election year. NASDAQ has in fact already exceeded its average full election year performance going back to 1972. Bullish sentiment and momentum appear to be firmly in place and historical election year patterns suggests strength could easily continue for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 into May. NASDAQ\u2019s surge higher could be vulnerable to a retreat sooner, in March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/baea2768b612eb15dbd047fbc0cff07b/5100d48ef25e7c53-d2/s500x750/10e181f3beef5c191c7ec0ad2bf7e50a0e449324.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Dow Without Boeing (BA)\n\n&gt; For more than a year now, Boeing (BA) has been plagued by the 737 MAX crisis which has weighed on shares of the plane manufacturer with it now currently down nearly 20% from when the initial groundings took place on March 10th of last year. Despite this, while underperforming the broader market due to the 737 issues, the stock is actually still up just over 5% since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; Even though BA has lagged, it is still the highest-priced of the 30 stocks in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average. Currently trading around $338.50, the only stocks in the index holding a candle to BA are Apple (AAPL) and UnitedHealth (UNH), which also trade north of $300 per share. That means these stocks have the highest weighting in the index and therefore have a much larger impact than other stocks on the Dow's performance.\n\n&gt; With BA's issues, a number of people have pondered the what-ifs for the Dow had the company not had the issues with the 737. Would we have already broken out the Dow 30K hats were it not for BA? In the chart below, we show the actual performance of the DJIA and have overlaid the performance of an 'alternate Dow' showing its performance if BA had not been in the index since the start of 2019. We used the start of 2019 instead of the actual date of the groundings as it is a little less arbitrary. By our calculations, while we would be a bit closer, even if BA wasn't in the index since the start of 2019, we wouldn't quite be at Dow 30K yet. As shown, our alternate Dow would be almost 1% or 266 points higher if Boeing was not included in the index since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; While BA has been a drag on the DJIA since last March, it also provided a big boost to the index in early 2018 before the 737 issues hit the stock. In fact, at the start of March 2017, BA was up over 36% YTD and the spread between the Dow's performance with and without BA was around 700 points in the other direction as it is now!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow-wo-BA-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Another example of this dynamic in which high priced stocks have a greater impact on the index was observed on Tuesday when Apple's (AAPL) stock fell after the company warned that Q1 revenues would be shy of prior guidance due to the coronavirus. The warnings sent shares down over 3% at its intraday lows, but the stock only finished down 1.83%. While there were equivalent or larger declines like Dow (DOW) or Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) in Tuesday's session, AAPL's declines by far weighed on the index more than any other stock. Of the Dow's 165.89 point decline, AAPL contributed 40.35 points. Fortunately, UNH helped to mitigate some of those losses as it had a positive impact on the index of +22.79 points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow2.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BYND**\n&gt; * **$SQ** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$SPCE** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$CRON** \n&gt; * **$CHK** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$TTD** \n&gt; * **$AMRN** \n&gt; * **$SHAK** \n&gt; * **$KOS** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$ILPT** \n&gt; * **$CLVS** \n&gt; * **$TNDM** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$CRI** \n&gt; * **$SPNS** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$CTB** \n&gt; * **$ETSY** \n&gt; * **$TREE** \n&gt; * **$KEYS** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$GWPH** \n&gt; * **$W** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$WEN** \n&gt; * **$CROX** \n&gt; * **$DIN** \n&gt; * **$DNR** \n&gt; * **$LL** \n&gt; * **$DORM** \n&gt; * **$GH** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$MGI** \n&gt; * **$AMT** \n&gt; * **$JCP** \n&gt; * **$CBRL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/qvtfNhx.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/kpCRctt.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3PTK97f.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eNbMCOD.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/qV7qy6J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eNgrHgV.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FopcLUz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2yyK6HI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dsgBu6B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9VYkHyk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/5mFOqR0.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rd8JhvX.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WrX9hNT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jsCwSCH.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/fzm6EPP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lKtvBHM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Beyond Meat, Inc. $117.45\n&gt; **Beyond Meat, Inc.

You don't do much active trading, or you use a separate brokerage for that e.g. Robinhood.\n\n**Vanguard**\n\n* Reasonable if dated UI.\n* Supports Fido U2F (Yubikey) 2FA on the website.\n* Supports Touch ID on the mobile app, even with U2F enabled.\n* Really nice visualization of overall return.\n* Free trades on mutual funds, can invest 100% without worrying about divisibility by share price.\n* Couldn't automatically invest direct deposit into mutual funds, had to set up a separate automatic investment, which broke when there was slight variation in payday for weekends and holidays, so ended up always putting in my biweekly buy orders manually.\n* Mobile app wants a password even after Touch ID to make trades or really get anywhere past the home screen.\n\n**Fidelity**\n\n* Reasonable, more sophisticated but also dated UI.\n* Supports Symantec VIP (TOTP like Google Authenticator or Authy) on web and mobile.\n* Unified view with employer 401k.\n* Free trades on more things, but only ETFs not Vanguard funds. Leaves a couple hundred dollars of uninvested cash sometimes.\n* Can't automatically invest into an ETF at all. Theoretically supports automatic investment into mutual funds but the trades have steep fees.\n* Poor visibility into total return over time, data is there but you have to build the visualization yourself.\n* Mobile app supports Touch ID but also wants a VIP code every session. My phone is already the second factor! Don't make me switch apps.\n\n**Chase You Invest**\n\n* Unified view with checking and credit card.\n* Can use the balance to qualify for premium Chase service tiers (Sapphire, Private Client, etc).\n* Chase app supports touch ID and only asks for more authentication when reasonable (new outgoing transfer account, etc).\n* No 2FA available other than SMS.\n* Godawful UX, designed by a committee of children, can barely figure out how to do the most basic things.\n\n**Robinhood**\n\n* Beautiful design. Thoughtful, joyful UX. \n* Supports TOTP for initial login and Touch ID for ongoing sessions, like a sane tech company.\n* Feels like a toy / meme and not the right place for six-figure life savings unless you're planning to YOLO it all on options trades. This company literally announced a checking account and retracted it that afternoon when it learned that banking is a regulated industry.\n\n**Betterment / Wealthfront**\n\n* Haven't tried, but 25bps seems like a lot to pay for a less annoying UI.\n\nWhat are your experiences with other brokerages? Have you found the holy grail?",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game!

In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=291cHBjPndw))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=291cHBjPndw))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;
