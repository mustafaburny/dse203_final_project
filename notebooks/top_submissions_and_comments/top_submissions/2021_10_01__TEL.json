Though smaller, Rigetti said the development marked a recent design breakthrough that put his company on a path to much more rapid advances in the coming years.\n\n\u201cWe have found a better way to scale,\u201d Rigetti said in an interview with the Financial Times. The latest prediction is based on a modular design that involves linking a number of smaller quantum chips into a single processor, simplifying the job of getting a large number of qubits to work together.\n\nThe company claimed the design gave it an edge over rivals, putting it on a path to build a 1,000 qubit system in 2024 and one based on 4,000 qubits in 2026. Its founder also predicted that it would be able to build a machine ten years from now with more computing power than all of today\u2019s cloud computing systems combined.\n\nHowever, company executives said the decision to go public now reflected a belief that early, more rudimentary versions of the technology would yield commercial benefits much sooner. \u201cWe believe we can get to customer value in a couple of years,\u201d said Taryn Naidu, chief operating officer.\n\nRigetti said it planned to go public early next year through a merger with Supernova Partners, a spac, or acquisition vehicle, co-chaired by hedge fund investor Alexander Klabin and Spencer Rascoff, a former chief executive of real estate site Zillow.\n\nThe funding includes a $100m equity investment from investment groups that include T Rowe Price, Bessemer Venture Partners and Franklin Templeton. Other investors include In-Q-Tel, the CIA\u2019s venture capital arm, and Palantir, the data analytics company that has done extensive work for the national security establishment.\n\nWhile Wall Street\u2019s spac boom has opened a route for quantum computing companies to go public, stock market investors have yet to show real appetite for the technology. Shares in IonQ, a rival start-up, closed on Tuesday at $7.73, well below their $10 notional value at the time of the company\u2019s listing last week.",

        "selftext": "While the swamp-dwellers in Washington D.C. bicker about the fate of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, another legislative development in the US Congress may be a game-changer for potheads, cannabis investors, and cannabidonal enthusiasts alike.  Last Thursday, a House of Representatives Committee on Thursday approved a bill to federally legalize marijuana.  For those (like myself) who have been in on cannabis equities in recent years, this is the moment we have all been waiting for.  Access to the massive American consumer and financial markets will revolutionize the CBD sector like none other.  Given these promising legislative whispers coming from Congress, I wanted to focus-in on two CBD stocks I think are worth keeping a close eye on: Innocan (INNO.CN) and Ayurcann (AYUR.CN).\n\nBefore getting into a little compare-contrast,  let's first  talk about the global  cannabis market as a whole. The market, as we all know, is vast, but a segment of it is gaining traction in terms of pharma research and commercialization. The Cannabidiol (CBD) market, (basically the oil extracted from the plant) was valued at $2.8 B in 2020, and estimates are that by 2025 it will more than double itself, with growth forecast at over 20% per annum (https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cannabidiol-cbd-market).  In other words, major growth potential for the CBD market over the next few years, with or without federal legalization.\n\n\u201cSo after this long prelude, are you going to tell me about relevant companies?!\u201d Of course. \n\n**Innocan Pharma** **(CSE: INNO) (FSE: IP4) (OTCQB: INNPF)**\n\nInnocan Pharama is an Israeli listed on the CSE and produces both therapeutic and cosmetic products from CBD.  To this end, the company was founded by an accomplished team of scientists and is currently working with Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University on R&amp;D for CBD-loaded liposome (LPT) and exosome (CLX) delivery platforms, respectively. \n\nINNO\u2019s market cap and enterprise value are pegged around 265M CAD, and are projected to keep growing as the company\u2019s research and commercialization progress. In terms of its price action, Innocan gets a gold star for most-bullish in recent months.  The ticker is up &gt;600% over the past 12 months, +255% YTD, and +150% o in the last 3 months. Also, the ten days average volume is at 188.04k after recent gains, with a stable RSI of 57. Considering the positive MACD trendline, well folks, I reckon we\u2019re observing a clear bullish trend. \n\nInnocan\u2019s product line can be divided into three main groups:  Exosome delivery platform, liposome delivery platform, and cosmetics/therapeutic topicals incorporating CBD. Because we don't have room to get into all of these innovations, let me tell you about the one I find the most promising - their CLX platform. They have filed a patent application for this CLX tech that uses exosomes to deliver cannabidiol into the bloodstream with an extended release (up to 50 days!) for a range of therapeutic purposes. This platform - CLX - has immense therapeutic potential for use in everything from elite sports medicine to promoting the recovery of damaged tissue.\n\nGiven its recent performance on the market, ongoing R&amp;D, robust commercialization, and the disruptive potential of its CLX research, Innocan is a winning CBD smallcap to screen for.\n\n**Ayurcann Holdings Corp.** (CSE: AYUR) (FSE: 3ZQ0)\n\nAyurcann is a Canadian company that primarily specializes in the extraction of high-grade CBD. Ayurcann focuses on extraction of CBD for use in a wide range of possible uses, from hemp to ethanol to medicine.  Essentially, Ayurcann\u2019s market niche is in innovation and development of extraction technology, and as a result, their corporate strategy is to produce quality CBD for other firms requiring it as an input for value-added products (like Innocan). For example, one of their recent deals was concluded with the National Cannabis Distribution that wholesales in Saskatchewan. The deal is for two vaping products and tinctures, and is plausibly one out of many more to come, indicating active and ongoing commercialization. \n\nAs Ayurcann is a young company, its market value cap stands at a middling 20M, but its latest fiscal results reported 5.58M revenue and an EBITDA of 1.36M. While their technology is entirely different, Ayurcann and Innocan recently signed a deal for AYUR to manufacture and distribute INNO\u2019s topical product line in Canada, making these two complimentary tickers.  In short, when one goes up, we can expect they both will.  Anyways, that\u2019s my two cents on Ayurcann, another solid play to consider for those CBD investors out there looking to make moves and position themselves strongly before Washington gets around to legalizing weed.  \\*\\*\\*DYOR, this is not financial advice, but rather a personal opinion\\*\\*\\*",

        "selftext": "Good afternoon ladies and gents, another day, another price-sensitive catalyst.  Was browsing the news this morning and caught a headline that Hub Security, an Israeli cyber company, announced that they are weighing a delisting from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to be followed by a potential NASDAQ listing down the road.  Beyond the fact that every tech company dreams about NASDAQ, I did some digging and think that this HUB co. may in fact be a real hidden gem for the tech-chasing crowd.  \n\nI'm sure you've all seen the recent slew of news about high-profile hacks, data leaks, and system compromises.  From the Solar Winds' hack of the entire US government to the Pandora Papers' embarrassing leaks for the global billionaires club, we are entering a brave new world where cyber security is becoming equally as valuable as physical security.  Combine this uptick in offensive cyber capabilities with the fact that we're on the cusp of the quantum computing age (which, if the R&amp;D comes through, will change everything).  In short, the current and projected market value for information/cyber security is clearly there and waiting for an innovator to capitalize on it.\n\nEnter HUB Security.  This company hails from Israel, that breeding ground for tech startups that ultimately migrate over the pond to American exchanges.  HUB is attempting to follow a similar course, and recently has been putting its money where its mouth is, with two big deals in 2021.  Back in February they merged with ALD, another Israeli cyber company trading on TASE, in which HUB will become the controlling shareholder in the newly merged entity, with 51% of its shares and a majority holding on its board of directors.   Two weeks ago, they acquired ComSec Global in what represents a huge expansion of their future revenue stream and commercialization architecture.\n\nI won't get into their product details to much because its pretty technical, but basically HUB is combining hardware and software for a holistic approach to cyber security.  They refer to their market niche as \"confidential computing\", which uses things like advanced encryption tech and edge-computing security mechanisms for the most comprehensive such infosec solution on the market.\n\nHUB's price action looks great, and its +500% for the past year, though that makes sense given the magnitude of those two recent deals.  If they end up making the transfer over to NASDAQ, we can assume that their enterprise value with increase by 10-15X, as is typical when international startups delist and then relist on a huge American exchange.  For now these guys are still only traded on TASE, but I'll be watching developments very closely over coming months in anticipation of more big moves.  DYOR, this ain't financial advice, and happy Tuesday folks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jes0d7otz1t71.png?width=1220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcd1752ae0f7b3b26d10d84729fcdbe63296cb14",

        "selftext": " \n\nUpdate 10-18-21 10:46 EDT\n\nMedigus (MDGS) Trading Below Book Value, An Affiliate Just Made an Accretive Acquisition and the Company is Investing in a New Platform for NFT Digital Creations\n\n**Medigus Ltd. (NASDAQ: MDGS),** is a technologies company focused on innovative growth partnerships, in advanced medical solutions, digital commerce, and electric vehicle markets.\n\nCurrent price $1.479/share (as of 10:00 am EDT 10-17-21)\n\nAfter closing at $1.45/share in the past Friday session, MDGS shares opened at $1.44 and reached a high of $!.49 early today.\n\nWhen I look at the [company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=MDGS), I note that MDGS shares have crossed their 50 SMA of $1.48 today, and are close to crossing their 20 SMA of $1.51/share. This kind of movement can indicate a potential breakout.\n\nOur considerations on the value of MDGS:\n\nCurrent market cap of only $34.5M  \n**Shareholder\u2019s equity of $53.9M**  \nOwns investments in public companies with a $31.4M value  \nOnly 23M shares outstanding and in float  \nH1 2021 net profit $7.9M  \nNo long-term debt\n\nP/E \u2013 H1 net profit was $7.9M so full year 2021 net could conservatively be projected at $9.5M resulting in earnings of $.398/share. Using a p/e ratio of 10X we **could expect a share price of $3.98.**\n\nPrice to book - Many value investors consider a stock trading under 3.0X its book value to be a positive metric. In the case of MDGS, the book value is $2.17/share (as of 6-30-21) so using a conservative p/b value of 2.0X we **could expect a share price of $4.34/share.**\n\n**Recent developments**\n\nMDGS owns a 33.17% (38.01% on a fully diluted basis) stake in its affiliate, publicly traded Gix Internet (TASE: GIX) and Gix has [just completed the acquisition](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medigus-gix-completed-acquisition-leading-115700714.html) of 70% of Cortex Group, a global marketing technology solutions company. Through Q3 2021 Cortex has reported $26M in revenues and $2.7M in operating profit. Cortex\u2019s financial results will be consolidated with Gix\u2019s financial statements, as of the closing date and are expected to contribute significantly to Gix\u2019s consolidated results for 2021. This is a major accretive acquisition for GIX and may significantly increase the value of the MDGS investment.\n\nThe [recently announced investment](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medigus-enters-nft-space-first-103000278.html) of $400,000 in Safee for a 2.5% stake could be lucrative in the mid to long-term. Traditionally, digital asset management has required a special 'crypto wallet' application. To simplify the process and reach a wider audience, Safee has created a simple, engaging, and disruptive way to apply ownership to any personal digital media using NFT technology.\n\nThe NFT phenomenon involves ownership, monetization, and the proliferation of digital rights to everyone. Safee's NFT-based social network platform enables digital creators to take **any personal media item** (art, photos, videos, music) and turn it into an NFT. If you visit [Safee.io](https://safee.io/) you will be offered a chance to subscribe, join the Safee community, and be updated.\n\noriginal report below\n\nMedigus (MDGS) is Trading Below Book Value, Enters NFT Space and an Acquisition\n\nGood day everyone,\n\nThere are a lot of companies that pay lip service to \u201ccreating shareholder value,\u201d but every so often I come across one that backs that promise up with actions.\n\n**Medigus Ltd.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 3, 2021**\n\nThe market continued its march higher, with all three major indexes remarkably posting fresh intraday highs. The market gapped up in the last few hours of the session after the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monthly monetary policy decision, which came in exactly how market participants wanted. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out in a big way today, finally breaking the $234.5 resistance it was battling with all year. Overall a great day for the markets. \n\nAs was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. \n\nThe Fed said in a statement, \u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nThe best part, and what propelled markets higher the last hour of market, was that the Fed\u2019s decision did not come with an updated timeline regarding the interest rate.\n\nStill, the persistently hotter-than-expected inflationary pressures in the recovering economy have put the Fed in a difficult spot when it comes to waiting on rate hikes, many economists argued. These elevated levels of inflation might push the Fed to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed, some maintained. And in the Fed's latest policy statement Wednesday, the central bank slightly updated its remarks on inflation, saying that \"Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory.\" In September, the Fed had said inflation was \"elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors.\" \n\nIn a later press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said of current inflationary pressures, \u201cThe inflation that we\u2019re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It\u2019s due to bottlenecks and it\u2019s due to shortages and it\u2019s due to very strong demand meeting those. We don\u2019t see troubling increases in wages, and we don\u2019t expect those to emerge.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that there is further ground to cover in regards to maximum employment, one of the fundamental data points the Fed looks at when deciding policy. Powell said, \u201cIt is time to taper we think because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals measured for last December. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s time yet to raise interest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment both in terms of employment and terms of participation.\u201d\n\nOn a personal note, I want to say I commend the Fed for successfully avoiding another taper tantrum, like the one we saw in 2013 when the markets went into meltdown after the Fed announced they would begin to taper QE. In the end the fears were massively overblown. I saw a lot of fear mongering regarding tapering this time around glad that was avoided.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) stock was on the rise today again after Uber announced Tesla cars will be available to buy or lease as part of a green initiative for the ride-hailing company\n* Netflix (NFLX) announced that subscribers with Android phones or tablets can start playing mobile games on its app, an effort by the company to push into gaming. A Netflix subscription is required but there is no additional cost. \n* Elon Musk clarified via Twitter (TWTR) that there was no contract signed yet between Hertz and Tesla (TSLA) to buy the 100,000 EVs. A Hertz spokeswoman said deliveries of Tesla had already started. A link on Hertz\u2019s website gives users the option to rent a Tesla Model 3. However, Hertz declines to comment beyond its original statement saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss the details of our business relationships or discussions with any auto maker or partner\u201d.\n* With the recent surge in Tesla, Elon Musk became the first person to have a personal net worth surpassing $300 billion, absolutely insane. If he were a company, he\u2019d be a top 30 company in the US by market cap by himself.\n* Green Bay Quarterback Aaron Rodgers teamed up with Square (SQ) to give away $1 million in BT.... as part of a promotion and will begin receiving part of his massive $33.5 million salary in that currency. \n* Amazon (AMZN) seeks approval from the Federal Communications Commission to launch two Project Kuiper satellites in 2022.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 3, 2021**\n\nThe market continued its march higher, with all three major indexes remarkably posting fresh intraday highs. The market gapped up in the last few hours of the session after the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monthly monetary policy decision, which came in exactly how market participants wanted. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out in a big way today, finally breaking the $234.5 resistance it was battling with all year. Overall a great day for the markets. \n\nAs was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. \n\nThe Fed said in a statement, \u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nThe best part, and what propelled markets higher the last hour of market, was that the Fed\u2019s decision did not come with an updated timeline regarding the interest rate.\n\nStill, the persistently hotter-than-expected inflationary pressures in the recovering economy have put the Fed in a difficult spot when it comes to waiting on rate hikes, many economists argued. These elevated levels of inflation might push the Fed to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed, some maintained. And in the Fed's latest policy statement Wednesday, the central bank slightly updated its remarks on inflation, saying that \"Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory.\" In September, the Fed had said inflation was \"elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors.\" \n\nIn a later press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said of current inflationary pressures, \u201cThe inflation that we\u2019re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It\u2019s due to bottlenecks and it\u2019s due to shortages and it\u2019s due to very strong demand meeting those. We don\u2019t see troubling increases in wages, and we don\u2019t expect those to emerge.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that there is further ground to cover in regards to maximum employment, one of the fundamental data points the Fed looks at when deciding policy. Powell said, \u201cIt is time to taper we think because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals measured for last December. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s time yet to raise interest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment both in terms of employment and terms of participation.\u201d\n\nOn a personal note, I want to say I commend the Fed for successfully avoiding another taper tantrum, like the one we saw in 2013 when the markets went into meltdown after the Fed announced they would begin to taper QE. In the end the fears were massively overblown. I saw a lot of fear mongering regarding tapering this time around glad that was avoided.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) stock was on the rise today again after Uber announced Tesla cars will be available to buy or lease as part of a green initiative for the ride-hailing company\n* Netflix (NFLX) announced that subscribers with Android phones or tablets can start playing mobile games on its app, an effort by the company to push into gaming. A Netflix subscription is required but there is no additional cost. \n* Elon Musk clarified via Twitter (TWTR) that there was no contract signed yet between Hertz and Tesla (TSLA) to buy the 100,000 EVs. A Hertz spokeswoman said deliveries of Tesla had already started. A link on Hertz\u2019s website gives users the option to rent a Tesla Model 3. However, Hertz declines to comment beyond its original statement saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss the details of our business relationships or discussions with any auto maker or partner\u201d.\n* With the recent surge in Tesla, Elon Musk became the first person to have a personal net worth surpassing $300 billion, absolutely insane. If he were a company, he\u2019d be a top 30 company in the US by market cap by himself.\n* Green Bay Quarterback Aaron Rodgers teamed up with Square (SQ) to give away $1 million in BTC as part of a promotion and will begin receiving part of his massive $33.5 million salary in that currency. \n* Amazon (AMZN) seeks approval from the Federal Communications Commission to launch two Project Kuiper satellites in 2022. Similar to SpaceX, it intends to be a broad constellation of internet and broadband satellites.\n* EV startup Rivian which is backed by Amazon (AMZN) and Ford Motors (F) announced it was seeking a $53 billion valuation in its upcoming IPO\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Akamai Technology target raised by Morgan Stanley from $119 to $130.
