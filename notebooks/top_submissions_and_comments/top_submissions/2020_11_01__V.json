        "selftext": "Hey all, \n\nRead through the 10-K filings and figured I would highlight the risk catalysts and manufacturing agreements NIO is currently involved with to give you a better idea of their output forecast and so you can research yourself as to whether or not they can be sustainable: \n\n&gt; We have entered into an arrangement with Jianghuai Automobile Group Co., Ltd., or JAC, for manufacturing the ES8 for five years. In April 2019 and March 2020, we entered manufacturing cooperation agreements with JAC for the manufacture of the ES6 and the EC6, respectively.\n\n---\n\n&gt; The ES8 and ES6 are manufactured in partnership with JAC at its Hefei manufacturing plant. JAC is a major state-owned automobile manufacturer in China and it constructed such Hefei manufacturing plant for the production of the ES8 (with a modified production line for the ES6) and potentially other future vehicles with us.\n\n---\n\n&gt; **we pay JAC for each vehicle produced on a per-vehicle basis monthly for the first three years.**\n\n---\n\n&gt; In addition, for the first 36 months after the start of production, which commenced on April 10, 2018, to the extent the Hefei manufacturing plant incurs any operating losses, we have agreed to compensate JAC for such operating losses. Cooperation after the first 36 months will be subject to further negotiation between the parties.  As of December 31, 2019, we had paid JAC a total of $90,310,656.80, including $49,772,468.20 as compensation for losses incurred in 2018 and 2019 and $40,538,188.60 for manufacturing and processing fees.\n\n---\n\nRisk catalysts mentioned: \n\n&gt; Beginning July 1, 2018, the tariff on imported passenger vehicles (other than those originating in the United States of America) was reduced to 15%. As a result, our pricing advantage could be diminished.\n\n*(In English: The trade war between the US and China is killing any chances of NIO achieving market share in places outside of China.)*\n\n---\n\n&gt; Pursuant to the 2018 Negative List, the limits on foreign ownership of auto manufacturers were lifted in 2018 for NEVs and will be lifted by 2022 for ICE vehicles. As a result, foreign EV competitors could build wholly-owned facilities in China without the need for a domestic joint venture partner. For example, Tesla has started constructing a factory in Shanghai without a joint venture partner. These changes could increase our competition and reduce our pricing advantage.\n\n*(In English: China is incentivizing FDI (Foreign Domestic Investment), which is leading to competition from corps like Tesla who are much more established and have the funds to outpace NIO.)*\n\n---\n\n&gt; We believe that our sales performance of ES8 and ES6 in 2019 was negatively affected by the reduction in the subsidy standard. The current 2020 subsidy standard, effective from April 23, 2020, (i) reduces the base subsidy amount in general by 10% for each NEV, (ii) sets subsidies for 2 million vehicles as the upper limit of annual subsidy scale; and (iii) provides that national subsidy shall only apply to an NEV with the sale price under $44,826.60 or equipped with battery swapping module. Further, the 2021 and the 2022 subsidy standard are expected to be reduced by 20% and 30% respectively as compared to the standard of the immediate preceding year.\n\n*(In English: Less government incentive = lower operating margin = less revenue growth.)* \n\n---\n\n&gt; Our servicing will primarily be carried out through third parties certified by us. Although such servicing partners may have experience in servicing other vehicles, we and such partners have very limited experience in servicing our vehicles. Servicing electric vehicles is different from servicing ICE vehicles and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques\n\n*(In English: NIO cannot afford to achieve [vertical integration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalintegration.asp) yet and relies heavily on outsourcing to other, much smaller companies to get certain jobs done. Their supplier network is likely to be inefficient at times and falter under macroeconomic headwinds like government intervention (think trade war and tax credits) and covid-19 and this makes NIO's operations all the more compromised.)*\n\n---\n\nSome outside data to look at: \n\n[China Total Vehicle Sales: 1997 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/total-vehicle-sales)\n\n*Overall seems incredibly cyclical but in an upward trend over the next 5 years. Long term investors shouldn't worry about demand.* \n\n[China GDP Annual Growth Rate: 1989 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/gdp-growth-annual)\n\n*China believe it or not is still considered a developing country which is defined by its high GDP growth rate and low standard of living. It averages 6% a year but due to covid fell harshly. Right now it is sitting at 4% but is expected to return to 6% within the next two years.* \n\n[China Consumer Confidence Index: 1991 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/consumer-confidence)\n\n*Consumer confidence forecasts are predicted to rise as the world recovers from covid-19. This in turn can translate to increased spending and economic stimulation (aka more potential demand and orders for NIO vehicles.)*\n\n[China Car Production: 2005-2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/car-production)\n\n*China is set to return to the 25 Million vehicle production milestone it often flirted with over the past decade. Should it overcome the impact on manufacturing from covid and the trade war, it may very well achieve even higher historical output although that is a very optimistic outlook given the current geopolitical situation.*",

        "selftext": "**Biden wins the election, what does this mean for the economy and the stock market, what Buffen\u2019s Berkshire has done in the last quarter and more, let\u2019s talk about everything** \n\nHey everyone and welcome, I am going to react to the latest news from the election, the economy and in the stock market from last week and what to expect next\n\nSo late Saturday the victory of Biden was announced as networks finally started to predict that he won the election. I have no partisan view as i am not a resident or citizen of the US, but i believe that the results of this election (the Biden win and the Republicans keeping the Senate) is the best the stock market could have hoped for, as many experts were predicting a Blue Sweep. There still will be two important runoff elections in Georgia at the beggining of 2021, where the Democrats could still end up winning the Senate. Biden currently has a projected 290 electoras votes but i believe he will also keep the lead in Georgia and end up with 306 electoral votes, the same number as Trump had 4 years ago [VOTE MAP](https://ibb.co/LZ5dnzt) . Important leaders like the German Chancellor, Uk\u2019s prime minister, Canada\u2019s prime minister, France\u2019s president and many more welcomed and congratuled the win of Biden, which seems to be favored internationaly by the world leaders as they were tired of the whipsaw that came with Trump tweeting non-stop. So this probable grid-lock in Congress is loved by the stock market, as there are no iminent tax raises and a stimulus bill is far more likely if not by the end of the Trump mandate surely at the very start of Biden\u2019s.\n\nSo this scenario that is playing out seems to be the most profitable one for wall street as the average annual return since 1933 is about 14% with a Democractic President and a split Congress [Historical CHART](https://ibb.co/SJGP97P)\n\nYesterday Biden also announced how they will try to combat the illness with Better testing and tracing, a increase in PPE production, National guidance for schools, business and families, Investments of 25 bilion in vaccine development and distribution and mask mandates. While also trying to make the higher risk individuals more safe.\n\nP.S. Here\u2019s a funny meme that LeBron James posted with a throwback to his big block of an opponent. [MEME](https://ibb.co/2hmQk6R)\n\nSo all 3 big indices had the best week since early April with the Nasdaq composite being up just over 9% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/rpgWtJH), the SP500 was up 7,32% [S&amp;P CHART](https://ibb.co/Ss7FWVN) and the DOW gained almost 7%.[DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/j3bB0P8) The Nasdaq and Sp were flat for the day, pairing loses from the begining of the day while the down fell 0,23% mostly based on profit taking in my opinion.\n\nThere were more companies that were declining on Friday with over 60% of the companies in the red but with a disproportional number of almost 90% of new highs while the volume fell again way below average [MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/k0kY7Z1) . There weren\u2019t any significant leaders in the market on Friday but energy traield again being more than 2% down [SECTOR CHART](https://ibb.co/VDFksR8) while small caps under-performed the market especialy the value plays.  [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ndqFLC)\n\nThe fear in the market seems to have completly gone away as we have seen another 10% decline in the VIX indicator to drop below 25. [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/8MjSd1f)\n\nHere is a heat map of Friday, you can see this was quite a slow day, not to many green companies but not that big of a red day either. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/nsCvwVz)\n\nThe US economy added more than 638 thousand jobs [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hDrrTXs) more than 503 thousand that were expected [CHART](https://ibb.co/C6fD3Sh), while the unemployment rate fell to 6,9% way better than the 7,7% expected this is the sixt straight month of jobs recovery.[CHART](https://ibb.co/RBZzdVG) As they seem to be in a big V shape recovery, overall  [V- SHAPE](https://ibb.co/HN6n9dH)\n\nThe market should now turn they\u2019re attention to the samshing of the earnings season amid the election with 2 thirds of the SP500 beating the estimates both the top and bottom line, that is almost double the 38% historical average. \n\nBank of American release a chart for q3 earnings and as you can see earnings have increased 6,7% in the SP500 year over year and 21,5% quarter over quarter. [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/C6zfWZR)\n\nAnd as the fed announced that it will keep the benchmark rate between 0 and 0,25% [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/vjNy43D)this continues to stimulate the economy of the US, with the fed beeing probably more responsible for the recovery in the last months as stimulus has been staled in congress. Also they continue to have a target of a running inflation of 2% and will continue to buy assests worth around 120 billion dollars montly to pump money in the economy  [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/wBxn56S). If a stimulus bill will eventualy pass, households will probably continue to use the money the same way as last time with over 70% of the money being used for savings and debt payments. But thay may go down a little as people may tend to spend a little more on essentials and non essentials with a better outlook in the near future than last time. [HOUSEHOLD SPENDING](https://ibb.co/dbbKCj6)\n\nHere are some interesting economic events for next weeks as we continue to closely watch how to recovery is going. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/gMX5XH5)\n\nNvidia saw a pop in the stock finally as they announced that Fornite will join the GeForce gaming cliud, that could mean a return for the game in ios devices with GeForce currently available on Mac,Windows,Android and Chromebooks. The company has almost reteurn to it all time highs after this weeks strong gains. [NVIDIA CHART](https://ibb.co/1qxmphB)\n\nBuffets Berkshire announced on Saturday that they bought back around 9 billion of the company\u2019s stock,bringing the total to around 16 bilion for the year so far.[BUYBACK CHART](https://ibb.co/ysw5bkx) That was around 4 billion more than in the second quarter. the operating earnings also decrease a little since last quarter and are almost 3 billion or 32% less then last year. [BUYBACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/fSWCvdQ)The only segment that improved since last year was Railroad,utilities and enegery, while insurance was the biggest loser.\n\nThe company has almost the same amount of cash and short term investemtns like the previos quarter at around 146 billion dollars with 70% of the investments concentrated in 4 big companies (Apple , Bank of America, Coca-Cola and American Express) up from the 60% these company represented at the end of 2019. [INVESTMENTS](https://ibb.co/Dps2f95)\n\nThe buybacks of the company exced any full year amount in Berkhsire\u2019s history and far exeded the analysts expectation of around 3,2 billion in buybacks. As the strategy for Buffet and Charlie Munger is to buyback the company\u2019s stock as long as they believe it\u2019s undervalued and they will still have ample cash after the buybacks. AS the only other major investments made last quarter were about 6 billion invested in the five big Japenese trading houses and the data storage company Snowflake.\n\nI just saw some interesting news as NetFlix announced they will launch a offering named NetFlix Direct in France that will come with a linear feed of content from Netflix\u2019s library, so the company that is the biggest reasons for the decline of old TV programming made quite a twist as they seek to expand more and more.  [NETFLIX NEWS](https://ibb.co/gWzmKKs)\n\nHere is a list with some of the most important earnings next week, some companies that i like that are reporting are: McDonalds, Datadog, Tencent, Corsair, Purple, Lemonade and DraftKings.

        "selftext": "**Section** **I.  The Election**\n\na.  A Republican Senate:\n\nFirst and foremost, to explain why puts got melted this week, the republican senate was a key component of the bull-run we've seen over the past few days.  When you think of the 2020 US election from the perspective of the major equities in weighted indices (like the SPY), what they were most worried about going into the election was the end of an era of low taxes and deregulation.  Sure, a Biden/Trump win was what people were thinking about most, but in the case of a Biden win, the continuation of a republican senate is what is key in keeping company valuations steady for the next 2 years.  This will keep taxes low, deregulation extended, and new legislation slow to pass.\n\n[Betting Odds for Control of the Senate.  Republicans \\(Red\\) vs Democrats \\(Blue\\).](https://preview.redd.it/1kpa2m0znkx51.png?width=573&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce1d7774d22188467451350a9983150c43f801f8)\n\nShown above are the senate control betting odds as of last night.  They are sitting around 75-25 in favor of the republicans.  If this shifts in the favor of the democrats, we are very likely to see a negative reaction from the markets (though this is unlikely).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb.  The Implications of a Disputed Election:\n\nNow, on the uniqueness of 2020, this is going to be the first election in a long time where a ton of people on both sides are confident that they're winning.  Shown below are the presidential betting odds since right before the start of the election.  You can see that during the first night, Trump's odds nearly hit 80% as all of the initial votes being counted were from in-person voters. \n\n[Presidential Betting Odds Since Nov 2.  Biden \\(Blue\\) vs Trump \\(Red\\).](https://preview.redd.it/wvf1pf2knkx51.png?width=574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=335e7a06beb2e7efccc6636cb12a3d7661eaf9ed)\n\nThe sudden shift back to Biden (currently around 97% chance to win) from mail-in voters is what he has partly (but not exactly) been citing as evidence for voter fraud, and many of his followers are completely with him on the issue.  Invalidating the results of the election is his last stand, but the impact on equities markets is not going to end once the election is called.  The consequence of the apparent invalidity of the entire electoral process is that there will soon be mass confusion, protests, and other civil conflict and unrest around the country.  \n\nSomething that's worth noting is that **during the Bush v Gore election (2000) which was also contested, equities markets sold off 7-8%** within the weeks following the election.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc.  Stimulus:\n\nOne final point about the election worth noting is that it has distracted both legislators as well as the general public away from other issues.  One of those issues is the lack of a new stimulus bill from congress; **it is likely that we are going to have to last through the winter until February without a new stimulus bill being passed**.  Trump losing the election will only make him less likely to focus on the issue, as his focus will rather be on taking the best evidence for voter fraud he can find to the Supreme Court.  We may start seeing people defaulting on loans in the middle of the winter, and consequently, we may also start to see small businesses struggling to stay afloat (we will talk about this more when we look at economic data).  On top of this, the initial jobless claims are still sitting around 750,000 people each week (down 7000 from last week); these are people that rely on these stimulus checks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Section II.  Covid-19:  Winter is Coming, Is a Vaccine?**\n\na.  R0 and Cold, Dry Weather:\n\nSo we're headed into the winter months, and one of the other things the election has distracted us all from is the coronavirus.  Its fairly common knowledge that the cold, dry weather of the winter months is primarily responsible for facilitating flu seasons that are worse than they are during any other months of the year.  If you look into some of the early research done on the same topic for Covid, you find exactly what you would expect.  Pictured below are two visuals from a study done in late January in China that aimed to seek the effects of temperature and humidity on the coronavirus.\n\n[A City-Level Visualization of China's Average Temperature from Jan 19 - Feb 10](https://preview.redd.it/pmi8nzd7qkx51.png?width=749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=116cd149c7322aa0315961682259e7f9bc854e26)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A City-Level Visualization of China's Observed r0 Value of Covid-19 From Jan 19 - Feb 10](https://preview.redd.it/mz2nz9a2qkx51.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50583687dd093959ab1c1c388c7bc7a4a0dc4351)\n\nSource: [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2003/2003.05003.pdf](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2003/2003.05003.pdf)\n\nWhat we see is a fairly **strong correlation between a decrease in temperature and an increase in the observed r0 of the disease**.  Simply, the r0 is just a measure of the contagiousness of a disease.  What we can expect is that during these next few months, Covid is going to reach new highs of contagiousness in the United States.  As we will see below, the current case rates in the US do not seem to set us up for a calm winter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb.  The Data:\n\n[Daily Coronavirus Cases in the United States.  7-Day MA Overlaid in Blue.](https://preview.redd.it/az26jsexmkx51.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fce6317132ab8e3275a2550218f2d77d4a959d92)\n\nNow to look into the number of infections, during the first wave of cases in the US, we peaked at around 30,000 daily cases and started trending back down as we entered lockdowns and started social distancing.  **Yesterday, we hit 120,000 cases in a single day**, and this barely broke the news as everyone is still entirely focused on the election.  \n\nThese insanely high case numbers, coupled with the effect on r0 of the winter weather, and possibly coupled with massive gatherings that are soon to come from election protests paint a grim picture for the winter to come.  It's never been a better time to stay inside, but we aren't seeing that sentiment or concern  being expressed from the country as a whole.  It's going to get bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc.  The Euro Countries:\n\nAs a response to a similar issue, we have seen Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and some other countries instantiate lockdowns to combat their rapidly rising case numbers.  \n\nSource: [https://www.cntraveler.com/story/european-countries-enter-second-lockdowns-as-cases-spike](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/european-countries-enter-second-lockdowns-as-cases-spike)\n\nThis is something that Trump has repeatedly said he would not do, but that's not necessarily the case with Biden; he has simply said that he will follow the science.  Soon enough we are going to start seeing regulation on social gatherings tightening up again.  A solution to stopping the current wave of Covid is unavoidable at this point, once the election news slows down, this is what people are going to be focused on.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nd.  Waiting on a Vaccine:\n\nAt the moment, we have Remdesivir which is able to reduce the infection period of Covid by a few days, but we have yet to discover something that reduces the mortality rate.  Something import to note about the Covid vaccines under development, however, is that **the US government has opted to protect pharmaceutical companies from any lawsuits related to unintended symptoms/damages caused by a vaccine**.  The purpose of doing this is to enable pharmaceutical companies to create a vaccine at a significantly faster pace, but the downside is that people are going to be skeptical of taking it.  It's also very likely that once a vaccine is available, it will be primarily given to high-risk patients as it will be in such a short supply, and it will take months (or possibly even a year) until there is enough supply/distribution underway that it can be given to everyone in the country.\n\nThe takeaway here is that we don't have much to help us get through the winter.  The market's are not going to like another economic slowdown, even if it is significantly smaller than the one we saw back in March/April.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Section III.  The Invisible Economic Data**\n\na.  Banks, Loans, and What They're Telling Us:\n\nOnce again, due to all of the news and drama about the results of the election, something that is being overshadowed is economic data.\n\nTo take a look at some interesting trends, something that should catch your eye is that we are seeing a continuation of banks tightening their lending standards.  In a booming economy with the \"V-Shaped Recovery\" we are always hearing about, this is not something that we would see continuing to rise.  Especially during a time when people are talking about inflation fears, something to note is that banks tightening their lending standards is deflationary.  If people can't take out loans, and there is less money circulating around the economy, the dollar starts to increase in value.\n\n[Percentage of Banks Tightening Their Lending Standards \\(From the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey On Bank Lending Practices\\)](https://preview.redd.it/2uwn3takuox51.png?width=1150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c67d0594ce6f5c4996281475cf72cd0be53d0c09)\n\nShown above, we are seeing around **70% of banks tightening their lending standards to small firms**, and we have not seen this number start to turn around yet.  These levels are comparable to what they were at the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, and what is shows is that the banks, for whatever reason, are **really not comfortable lending money to people right now**.  It should also be noted that typically, when banks tighten their lending standards, long-term treasuries decrease in yield and increase in price.  This is consistent with the fact that banks purchased around $30b in mortgage backed securities this past week alone to make up for their decrease in outgoing loans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb.  Imports and Exports:\n\nTaking a look at US month-over-month imports and exports, what we would expect to see during a V-Shaped recovery are values falling rapidly during the initial shock, and then linearly approaching pre-Covid levels by the end of the recovery.  However, what we can see now is that after imports started to recover rapidly in July and August, **the demand has already started to taper off**.  Similarly, exports still have a long way to recover to reach pre-Covid levels, but we are even seeing export demand taper off.  This is likely due to our main export-countries also struggling to regain their pre-Covid levels of demand.\n\n[US MoM Imports \\(USD\\)](https://preview.redd.it/03sdum9c9px51.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a065043f449bb5da971e40940a48e8c2925ff1eb)\n\n[US MoM Exports \\(USD\\)](https://preview.redd.it/0tpsoudeapx51.png?width=659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e71fc897e2643b99090d295c7ac12f56350a4f3b)\n\nThe key takeaway here is that with rising Covid cases, a typical economic slowdown during winter months, decreasing import and export demand, and tighter lending standards, the economic data does not portray the country as being in a strong position right now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Section IV.  The Market and The VIX**\n\na.  Nasdaq, SPY, and DOW's Melt-Up:\n\nFinally, to take a look at where the markets are positioned, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied about 6% in the past 5 days, the DOW has rallied about 5.6%, and the Nasdaq has rallied about 7.9%.  This last trading day, we saw each index fail to break through it's current level, which is just about at market all-time-highs for each of them aside from the DOW (which has not yet fully recovered since March).  Today's volume was also significantly less than it was 2 days prior.\n\n[QQQ 3-Month With Volume](https://preview.redd.it/jget31s6epx51.png?width=814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01ccd4903bd0314f83818ed7b0a1488ae40540fc)\n\n[DIA \\(Dow Jones\\) 3-Month With Volume](https://preview.redd.it/hcdavds8epx51.png?width=812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=939b2795c4812448859c35b0b157b6aeb02a557d)\n\n[SPY 3-Month With Volume](https://preview.redd.it/2qyjkpwaepx51.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ac2b71a8c136e37ef5f97238331388465c3c1ce)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc.  The VIX:\n\nTaking a look at the VIX we are sitting at an all-time low since the start of Covid.  With so many people going long on vol and puts right before the election and then selling out of their positions once the next two years appeared to be stable due to the likelihood of a republican senate, the VIX has gotten absolutely crushed.  \n\n[VXX 6-Month With Volume](https://preview.redd.it/dcsglrtrepx51.png?width=810&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c00193cc466a62ac0b5ace19262dfb60c5144a71)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:**  Given the incoming political unrest of the country, the lack of stimulus for another several months, relatively persistent jobless claims, a likely increasing contagiousness of Covid coupled with possible social distancing regulations coming back into effect, ATH daily Covid case numbers (still rising), economic slowdown associated with winter months, 08-level tightening of banks' lending standards, tapering and slowing demand for imports and exports in the US, and the huge market rally and volatility crush we have just witnessed, the market seems to be gifting us a volatility trade.\n\nAs for the timing of it, once people look away from the election, once people start protesting the results, once people start focusing on Covid again, and once people take a closer look at the economic data, they will feel a lot less comfortable valuing markets at ATH levels.  These valuations will not last.\n\n**TL;DR of TL;DR:**  Volatility spike is likely.  A long-vol play seems appropriate, it's very cheap.\n\n**Positions:  34x (VXX 11/20 $24C)** \n\nLet me know if I missed anything or if you have any ideas of your own.  I may roll-back the options next week to the 27th to buy some more time.",

        "selftext": "My post [last Sunday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmbuff/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_this/) where I talk about my positions. [On Wednesday I did a follow up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jo3up7/4k_in_realized_gains_from_sunday_positions_next/) and discussed why I held some, closed others, and also why I opened up cash-secured-puts on QCOM right before earnings for a $450 pay-day.\n\nKeep in mind I only sell puts and buy shares. I made $4k on putting roughly $80k of collateral down for buying shares if I end up getting assigned. My true profit was about 5% last week with relatively low-risk positions where if they went against me I would bag-hold until profitable. When you are willing to bag-hold for months you literally cannot lose on any position (not financial advice). If you're ready to take your trading to the next level and do some technical ANAL(ysis) with me, then follow along. For those of you that hate money close this thread immediately.\n\nLastly, before I start. This is my game-plan for tomorrow's open. A lot depends on the price action in the morning. If market is down big or flat in the morning it will help me sell puts or buy shares, if we open hulk green then I just may need to wait. I haven't entered any of these positions yet. Normally I don't do this many positions, but it's earnings so its time to YOLO on some theta decay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore we start, when you look at my charts:\n\n**PINK = CHANNEL LINES** where the stock bounces between that range. When a stock exits a channel it either:\n\n1. Comes right back down into the channel or\n\n2. Begins to form a new channel.\n\nYou will never know which option happened until after-the-fact.\n\n**BLUE = SUPPORT OR RESISTANCE LINES**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll positions listed should be expected to expire this Friday the 13th of November. You can always go out further to collect more premium. It all depends on your strategy and what you are comfortable with.\n\n**DDOG - Earnings on Tuesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9quq9wx0i3y51.png?width=1964&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91186ec0288bd562ee7a4fc31f96f4de3591efc7\n\nDDOG provides cloud-based services. They shit the bed last earnings and the stock tanked 20% the next day. Am I worried about that happening again? Of course. Do I think it will? No. They are currently trading 10% higher than they were from market-close of their last earnings call. For any of you that have been following the stock, they landed a huge deal with Microsoft and we are about to find out just how much value that contract will bring. For that reason I think it will put a hard floor on where the stock might drop to.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$95p strike for $4.25 premium expiring this week will net you a return of about 4.5%. \n\nBreak-even only reached if stock drops to $90.75.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RKT - Earnings on Tuesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1r6vebe2i3y51.png?width=1968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a41d32126ce49e2e91ec8b05af193af5bfd916a\n\nRKT is somewhat of a recent IPO so the stock price is all over the place. What I do see on the chart is some strong support at the $18 and $20 level. The trend is currently down, but it looks like the stock might be reversing and breaking into a new channel through earnings this week. Good earnings will rocket this stock back to $25+, poor earnings we can re-test the $20 level. I like the upside on this one relative to what the downside might be. I'll be selling puts here.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$20p strike for $0.75 premium will have a return of 3.75%\n\nBreak-even is reached if the stock drops below $19.25\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RVLV - Earnings on Wednesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dx4hk495i3y51.png?width=1954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e262fb8fd220ac069fb0b822e6b2030c88392ec9\n\nRevolve crushed earnings on their last report and the stock went up 25%. You can see the stock has been trading in channel (pink lines) and is sitting comfortably somewhere near the high portion of the channel. Each time the stock price exited the channel to the upside it was rejected and pulled right back down. Generally it takes a break-through of the supply zones (resistance) or a big event to exit a channel and form a new trend. If we see some downside from earnings we might get a bounce off the $18 level. I'll be selling some puts there.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$18p for $0.85 premium will have return of $4.7%\n\nBreak-even reached if the stock drops below $17.15\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PTON - Earnings last week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tqfvpvl6i3y51.png?width=1956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f4a5802a15a0769523eee117083da0b6805d19f\n\nPeloton reported earnings last week. Management summarized to us that demand was still very high and they had trouble keeping up with it. Pretty fucking solid. This stock is literally a meme, but I do think it will be bought up on any dips. IV is also pretty high so I'll be selling weekly puts at the $115 or $120 level when I get a chance.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$120p at $2.25 premium for a return of 1.9%, break-even at $117.75\n\n$115p at $1.00 premium for a return of 0.85%, break-even at $114\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**V - Not earnings play**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppd3x268i3y51.png?width=1836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58093caef63d46861d8751d5ea4826d9c69135f0\n\nVisa is one of the more predictable stocks. The dip to $180 two weeks ago was an early Christmas gift. I didn't draw any channel zones with my magical crayons here because this thing just bounces back and forth between resistance and support zones. V is currently trading at the pinnacle of the resistance line. If it gets rejected expect another dip back to $195 or even $190. If it breaks through we might see a continuation in momentum all the way up to $215. Why? We might see some follow through on last week's move. All the other times it was rejected by $200 from July through August it was on small moves and lower volume.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nIV is low on Visa, personally I would just outright buy the shares here. You can sell the weekly $210 covered call for some extra pocket money. I doubt this will break-through by end of next week and if it does you've already won on your shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pro Tip:** Cash-secured-puts are a much \"safer\" way to make money. There is a misconception about selling higher volume of credit spreads instead of 1 or 2 cash-secured-puts because when you lose on a credit spread you are realizing and accepting the loss. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nListen here folks, we will NEVER accept defeat. We might lose the battle and get assigned some shares of these ultra high-quality stocks, but we will ALWAYS win the war and come out profitable. See how I am aiming here for 1-3% on each of these plays. We are winners baby so lets make that bread.",

        "selftext": " So Friday we saw the stock market down again as the dow fell almost 0,6% percent while the s&amp;p fell over 1% and the nasdaq was crushed being down almost 2and a half percent as This last week we saw the dow fell 6,5% the s&amp;p 5,6% and the nasdaq 5,5% as all 3 ended the month of october down more than 2,3%\n\nOne good thing for the US economy is that the retail stores sales has recovered and consumers are still spending excess cash especially with the holidays and black Friday up next. I believe that as much as Tuesday is important for the economy, the events that will come later in the week as the FED holds two important meatings and the latest jobs report comes in at the end of the week far outweight that\n\nAs you can see the New York Federal bank economic index is still rising, that sugests a V-Shaped recovery is continuing in the US. This index takes into consideration lots of important data from the economy.\n\nThe unemployment in the US has been decling but that rate has sharply slowed down in the last months as it\u2019s still more than double the 3,5% at the start of the year as the latest number from September was almost 8% rate of unemployment.\n\nAs you can see the most affected people are still the middle and low wage under 60k/year. As the high wage jobs unemployment rate is barely down 0,5% since January.\n\nSo the fear in the stock market saw a huge pop in the last week as the VIX (the volatility index) rose from 27,55 more than 10 points to close at over 38 this last week. This next week is probably the last with such high volatility as the upcoming big events will pass and more certainty will be in front of us . The volatility was so high as we retested the June highs and have seen a pullback 3 times after hiting those levels.\n\nDespite strong earnings last week from all big tech companies (Alphabet,Amazon,Apple, facebook and Microsoft) the companies stocks dropped amid the broader stock market sell-off with the exception of Google which posted terrific numbers to crush analysts expectation.\n\nApple is down almost 19% since the highs of September and has lost 450 billion dollars in market cap since then.\n\nThis dropped in the company has been caused by a broader stock market sell off as well as missed iphone revenues. I do believe that iphone revenues will see a huge spike in the next coming quarters as apple customers as myself will finally upgrade from older iphone to this next generation iphone which is the first to have 5G technology as well as other great improvements in capability as well as camera.\n\nA couple analysts have recently changed they\u2019re target to between 132-140 which is over 20$ from where it sit\u2019s today. That is quite good upside for the company.\n\nAs you can see they are barely down 2,7% year over year in product revenue despite not having the new iphone launch included in this financials, and overall the company still saw a 1% increase in revenue due to the huge spike in services revenue that I believe will continue especially with the Apple One bundle just being launched at the end of last week. The Total Gross margin also increase slightly but I expect this to be just a small drawback in the short-term.\n\nAlso I believe that Amazon was dragged down because of the next quarter predictions of huge costs while they only forecasted a operating income of 1 to 4 point 5 billion dollars which is below what was anticipated despite amazon web services continuing to be the largest player in cloud spending. With a 32% share of total market and a revenue of 11,6 billion dollars which Is up 29% year over year, while Azure from Microsoft comes in second and google cloud in third. There is still a lot of room to grow for all of this companies as there is still over 37% of the market provided by other companies. Also this is a great company to own for the long term as digitazation and online commerce will continue to grow, some are estimating that by 2030 amazon could have annual revenues of 1 trillion dollars $ while using conservative projections of compound annual growth for e-commerce of 10%, for the cloud services of 15% and for ad revenue of 20%, amazon could hit that mark by then. But I believe this is possible even faster than that.\n\nFacebook is the one company that I will have to analyze more in this group. They will be hit with privacy issues do to the regulatory risk and Apple\u2019s announced privacy changes. But I still do believe this to be a great company as they also own Instagram, and I really like how that part of the company is innovating and growing.\n\nWhile google seems to be back on track as the company was the laggard in the group. They have become less reliant on the search ad revenue as growth in Youtube ads and Google cloud will push the company to renewed growth in the future.\n\nAlibaba will see two big events this week as they will kick off the singles day event next week, extending the event with 3 more days rather than the usual 24-hour event, in which they will also double the products on offer. Also another big event will be the IPO of ant Group in which Alibaba will still have a big stake. I believe they are a great company the forward revenue growth estimates of 31% are higher than other tech companies like amazon, google and Microsoft while the P/E for the company is the most attractive of the group also.\n\nFord just announced that late next year they will introduce a lower priced competitor for Tesla AutoPilot and GM\u2019s super cruise, this is great news for the company as they seem to be improving the company continuasly.\n\nSome important earnings coming this week are :\n\nPaypal on Monday, which I believe is the greatest fin-tech company, on\n\nWednesday Qualcomm will announce that will be a great insight to see what Apple\u2019s iphone 12 is doing as Qualcomm is the biggest supplier for apple and on Thursday Alibaba (with ant group ipo) coming also on the same day this stock could see a surge in value.",

        "selftext": "So we have a [**free twitter bot**](https://twitter.com/TradyticsAIbot) that posts intraday alerts for options contracts. They've been quite successful, so I thought why not share them here too with more explanation and my own thoughts. There are no strings attached, it's a free bot that you can follow on twitter. We had some huge winners last week with [500% gains on $NFLX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdeKyIXUF4), [400% on $SPY](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-Ky2Hn-O9kyo-LYyf4-R6KOj-Aslkb), and plenty more. Twitter page has everything detailed.\n\n# $BABA\n\n**Alert:** Buy $310 Call with Expiration 2-3 Weeks Away\n\nBABA has a good price action right now with [support at around $300](https://www.tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=BABA). With all the volatility this week, it's better to go with contracts where you have a tight stop loss. If this breaks support, you'll know to exit immediately.\n\n# $AMZN\n\n[**Alert:**](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-lVtkD-wzJ59-Ig64T-O9Iiq-uS47P) Buy $3500 Call with Expiration 1 Week Away\n\nAMZN dipped hard as did plenty of other tech stocks. However, our bot gave tons of CALL alerts. When that happens, there's a reversal coming the next day. This alert did not work on Friday, but I am expecting this to pan out in the next 1-2 days.\n\n# $TWTR\n\n[**Alert:**](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-d03l5-HXntU-unLMV-M6GDV-kFnc7) Buy $55 Call with Expiration January 15, 2021\n\nAgain, this one is seems like a safe bet considering how much TWTR dipped on Friday. The fact that the price stopped right at the support gives me more confidence. ([https://i.imgur.com/yZgsc9i.png](https://i.imgur.com/yZgsc9i.png)). Also, market tends to fill gaps and there is a huge gap up which needs filling. Given that this alert is far off in the future, it seems like an excellent one. Will keep an eye on this one.\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\nThere were tons of tech CALL alerts on Friday which makes me think tech might go up for atleast a day tomorrow. If you see any bullish signs, you can also try the following contracts:\n\n**$NFLX:** Go one or two weeks ahead from the expiration date of this alert since this one has already expired: [https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-3GH9w-uOIyX-Jnx0P-xx6As-9t28w](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-3GH9w-uOIyX-Jnx0P-xx6As-9t28w)\n\n**$CCL, NCLH, RCL:** They usually move opposite to the market and went up quite a bit on Friday. Since PUTs are not that costly, go out 2-3 months and buy PUTs,\n\n# Risk Management\n\nIf you buy some of these contracts, **hedge them with an SQQQ or** [**VXX Call**](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-tpoCB-2BxBJ-P7hS0-PrJI9-vUMzG) just to stay safe. You'll find a few alerts on SQQQ Calls on the twitter bot. Stay safe everyone!\n\nLet me know your thoughts!",

        "selftext": "#**An Electric Market**\n\nThe auto manufacturers industry is currently the [third best performing industry](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&amp;v=140&amp;o=-perfytd) on the year-to-date time period. How did this historically struggling industry become a top performer during the COVID-19 Pandemic? The answer is seen in the massive gains electric vehicle stocks have seen. The best performers of the past year are NIO at 1911% gains, TSLA at 540% gains, WKHS at 492% gains, and GP at 377% gains.\n\nThe valuation of EV companies has been controversial, with many institutional investors believing EV valuations are unreasonable. Furthermore, the rise of SPACs has provided zero revenue companies easy access to investors, most notably Nikola Corporation. Many EV stocks have become popular with retail investors, with TSLA, GM, NIO, PLUG, NKLA, and WKHS ranking among the most popular tickers on Robinhood.\n\nThe table below consists of 22 popular EV stocks and relevant data.

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm a BAM shareholder with about 15% of my portfolio.\n\nGreat interview two days ago from one of the great asset managers of all time (IMO): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PXxqCc24q4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PXxqCc24q4)\n\nSince March I rotated into 80% tech stocks (QQQ, ARK, some individual picks). However, I still kept holding my BAM shares. Bruce Flatt is a legendary value investor.\n\nIn this interview he says a number of interesting things:\n\n\\- BAM has up to $80B in dry powder and will look for distressed opportunities over the next 18 months\n\n\\- He thinks retail is going through a consolidation, but that strong will get stronger. They want to own the best mall in any given city, and its likely that the bottom half of malls will be bulldozed.\n\n\\- Bullish on return to office (boomer comment from him IMO)\n\n\\- Very interesting: Thinks that real estate prices should be 1.5x - 2x now due to the low interest rate environment, and this is starting to happen for BAM. But he also thinks people aren't quite comfortable doing these transactions yet and things are trading at big discounts\n\nI really agree with him on the last comment. Bruce Flatt knows how to smell a good deal. Buying Real Estate may be the best value opportunity in the market today.\n\nI'm primarily (80%) invested in tech (QQQ/ARK/individual picks). But I have been building up some dry powder since August or so, since values got out of hand.\n\nAs a complete side note, I went to a \"top\" mall today to go to the Apple Store. The mall was absolutely packed.\n\nDoes anyone else agree? Are public REITs currently a deep value opportunity?",

        "selftext": "Hello value investing community,  \n\nI hope you had a great weekend!\n\nI think it is fair to say that Twitter is THE most powerful news, learning, and curation tool in the world. And as an investor, it is your responsibility to constantly look for opportunities, to be informed about current events, and to expand your mental models. Everybody wants to gain an edge in the markets and Twitter might be the tool that allows you to get access to information that you would otherwise not have considered in your investment process.\n\nBut who are the most important people for investors to follow on Twitter? I think that for Twitter to unfold its full potential, it\u2019s important to keep your Twitter feed clean and learn and so it is important that you only follow quality people.\n\nI have just released a video on this subject and mention four Twitter accounts that every value investor should follow. But obviously, this list is far from exhaustive and I wanted to ask you if you have any additional recommendations? Maybe you can share a brief summary of what this account is recognized for.  \n\nBest regards\n\nRene\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhw7Dn5aUWw&amp;feature=youtu.be",

It\u2019s a great concept and has delivered exceptional returns in the past \u2013 23% annually (1988-2005). Personally, I think it is a great screening tool to generate investment ideas! \n\nWell, I recently came across an interesting chart provided by the AAII that showed the performance of the magic formula ever since Greenblatt\u2019s book \u201cThe Little Book That beats The market\u201d was published. I was quite surprised by the recent performance of the Magic Formula strategy \u2013 a drop from 23% annually (1988-2005) to 6% (2005-2019) is quite significant!\n\n[https://www.aaii.com/stockideas/performance](https://www.aaii.com/stockideas/performance)?\n\nWhat do you think caused this drop?

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 9th, 2020.\n\n# **After sharp bounce, market may take a \u2018breather\u2019 on lingering election uncertainty, virus outbreak  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/after-sharp-bounce-market-may-take-a-breather-on-lingering-election-uncertainty-virus-outbreak.html)**\n*****\n&gt; After an initially exuberant election reaction, stocks may trade more cautiously in the week ahead, as investors watch election developments unfold and track the course of the coronavirus. \n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up more than 7.3% in the past week, at 3,509, and the Nasdaq rose 9%, the best weekly performance since April. Stocks slid Friday, but technology, communications services, health care and discretionary stocks had the biggest gains for the week, after it appeared Democrat Joe Biden could be the next president but with a split Congress.\n*****\n&gt; The election was still unresolved heading into the weekend, but even if Biden is declared winner, close votes and lawsuits are likely to result in recounts. The Senate appeared to be in Republican hands, but the margin of control is likely to be tight, and runoff elections are required for two Senate seats in Georgia in early January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the uncertainty is going to catch up the market on a short-term basis,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, BNY Mellon\u2019s Wealth Management chief investment officer. \u201cPerhaps next week could be a drifting lower kind of week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ahead of the election, the market had been betting on a \u201cblue wave,\u201d where Biden would take the White House and Democrats would get control of the Senate, giving them total control of Congress. But when it appeared the Senate would stay in Republican hands, stocks surged on the idea of gridlock, which would keep Biden from implementing tax increases and lots of new regulations.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, there has been a surge in daily new coronavirus cases to more than 122,000. Economists are concerned that the economic recovery could suffer as some states could restrict activities and consumers may pull back heading into the important holiday season.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed, in its post-meeting statement Thursday, repeated that the course of the virus could help determine the path of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports in the week ahead, including consumer price index inflation data Thursday and the producer price index Friday. More than a dozen Fed officials are on the speaking circuit, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who speaks Thursday on central banking at a European Central Bank forum.\n*****\n&gt; The earnings season is beginning to slow down, but there are still dozens of reports, including from McDonald\u2019s on Monday and Walt Disney, Applied Materials and Cisco on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is just setting up to be a breather. There\u2019s still a lot to figure out here,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cThe equity market\u2019s reaction has been I think understandable and probably better than many might have expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there may be uncertainty for awhile. \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking about is the Senate races. Part of the market reaction has been relying on this divided government.\u201d After the votes are all in or recounted, \u201ca sweep is unlikely but possible.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the longer this stays uncertain and messy, the more the post-election bounce comes into question,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Different than 2000\n&gt; It would not be unusual for the stock market to sell off before rallying into year end, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall does not expect the type of turbulence there was in 2000, when former Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush in a tight race that ultimately went to the Supreme Court.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn 2000, they were not expecting hanging chads. But they do expect a contested election this time. I think in many ways the market anticipated this,\u201d said Stovall.\n*****\n&gt; But the market, after its election week surge, could pull back. \u201cHistorically, the market goes down in the month of November, after a Democratic victory,\u201d said Stovall. Since World War II, Democrats won the White House nine times, and the market fell an average of 0.5% in November in those years, compared to the average gain for all Novembers of 1.4%, he said.\n*****\n&gt; After those Democratic victories, stocks then rose 1.9% in December on average, more than the normal 1.5% gain for all Decembers.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they currently do not expect the kind of lockdowns that states ordered when the pandemic started to spread in March. But there could still be some impact that could be negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said he sees some signs of optimism for the market. Strong data, like third quarter GDP, October\u2019s drop in unemployment to 6.9%, and the better-than-expected earnings are all positives for the market. Another is that investors are so skeptical.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat does still exist is a great deal of dry powder. There\u2019s $4.3 trillion in money markets alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you, being in touch with investors of all shapes and sizes this week, there\u2019s still a lot of skepticism. From a contrarian view, high cash and a lot of skepticism is a contrarian indicator.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WUlRQfd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FWN82Hs.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ZnTzBNz.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/g52vqsv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OiPuXi8.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lA86Kou.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xmtVSEB.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RRxlWej.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/W80POso.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eGUQXgr.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yoHWfIC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hQyweyw.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Presidential Election Anticipation Is Keeping Us Waiting\n\n&gt; While we all anxiously await the final count and outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election, here are some possible scenarios for 2021. Our analysis here is based on historical market performance during the most likely political alignments for next year. We ran these likely scenarios through the Almanac database software to create this graph.\n\n&gt; We are either going to have the fifth year of a two-term republican president or a first year of a new democratic presidency. It appears the democrats will hold the house and the republicans will hold the senate, but that is not a forgone conclusion either. So we also examined both presidential outcomes with a democratic, republican and split congress.\n\n&gt; Our study uses the S&amp;P 500 from 1949 to 2017. We start in 1949 because it is the first full 4-Year Presidential Stock Market Cycle since the end of WWII. The Twenty-Second Amendment that implemented presidential term limits for a max of two terms or eight years was ratified on February 27, 1951. Truman in 1949 was excluded as there was a no change of party in the White House. We gave Bush 41 the same treatment.\n\n&gt; Admittedly, there are limited data points; four each of fifth year republicans and first year democrats. Here\u2019s what we found. A change in party with a new, first year democratic president came with democratic control of Congress and significantly higher performance for the S&amp;P 500, averaging 10.6% with a median gain of 15.1% versus 7.0% for the average post-election year since 1949.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a89421df75f426e1b1ff90cb2c29cb90/b63e1cf962f89fdb-a3/s400x600/f9bde99a9e4ba83b0df266a8d3cc04cd732cc58f.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Fifth year republican presidents in 1957 (Eisenhower) and 1973 (Nixon) had to work with democratically controlled Congresses and the market suffered significant losses. The market did well in Reagan\u2019s fifth year with a split Congress \u2013 a testament to how \u201cThe Great Communicator\u201d was able to work across the aisle with then Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill. Even with republican control of Congress under Bush 43\u2019s fifth year, the market had a tough year with ongoing issues in Iraq, North Korea declaring it\u2019s a nuclear power and the most active and second costliest hurricane season on record.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Continues as COVID-19 Cases Rise\n\n&gt; The US labor market shrugged off election uncertainty and continued to add jobs in October. Despite the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 638,000 jobs, ahead of Bloomberg survey estimates calling for 580,000. The headline number was depressed by a 268,000 drop in government employment, including 147,000 temporary census workers. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9% despite a rise in the labor force participation rate, a reversal of the dynamic we saw in September when unemployment fell while the labor force participation also declined.\n\n&gt; However, a troubling trend remains beneath the surface. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the number of long-term unemployed\u2014those out of work for 27 weeks or longer\u2014continues to rise as a share of the total unemployed:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11.6.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhile the labor market has continued to show improvement, there are still many people out there who are having a hard time getting back to work,\u201d noted LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWith total jobs in the US around 10 million below pre-pandemic levels and rising COVID-19 cases, there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement despite the declining unemployment rate.\u201d\n\n&gt; COVID-19 cases in the United States have reached record highs with a weekly trend growth rate above 20%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. As the weather cools and more activity shifts indoors, additional restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could slow the fragile labor market recovery.\n\n&gt; In particular, much of the private sector gains in this month\u2019s jobs report were in the services sector, where previous jobs reports had shown strength in goods-oriented industries. Many countries in Europe have reinstated restrictions or even gone as far as implementing new lockdowns. While we don\u2019t expect lockdowns in the United States like we saw in March, restrictions on activity could limit future job gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Sentiment Survey Soars While Another Sinks\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we discussed how bullish sentiment in the AAII survey has been on the rise, but looking at another weekly sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence, the opposite is true. The percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell sharply this week, 7 percentage points, down to 53.6%. While a majority are still optimistic and that reading is in the middle of its range, that was the largest weekly decline since a 7.4 percentage point decline to 41.7% in the first week of March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, the percentage of newsletter writers that are \"looking for a correction\" rose sharply to 25.8% this week following last week's over 5% decline for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Correction.png))**\n\n&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey has a long history dating back to 1963, and in all weeks in that time, only 5% (174 weeks) have seen bullish sentiment fall 5 percentage points or more while the percentage of respondents looking for a correction has risen at least 5 percentage points in the same week. In the chart below, we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 following these past occurrences when there has not been another in the prior 3 months. The S&amp;P 500 has frequently been higher over the following weeks and months, but there is a slight underperformance relative to all periods since 1963 when the survey begins.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2 Post-Election Charts You Need to See\n\n&gt; The election is over, but the questions are mounting. We don\u2019t know who will be the next president as of Wednesday morning, but we do know that stocks tend to do well the final two months of an election year. \u201cOnce the uncertainty is over, stocks tend to rally in November and December, with November the best month of the year during an election year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOf course, 2020 isn\u2019t like any other year, and we still could be a ways away from who the winner will be.\u201d\n\n&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index tends to do very well the final two months of the year, especially during election years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The modern design of the S&amp;P 500 stock index was first launched in 1957. Performance back to 1928 incorporates the performance of predecessor index, the S&amp;P 90\n\n&gt; One of the big takeaways so far from Tuesday night is that the Senate likely will stay Republican, meaning we may have a divided Congress. The chances of higher taxes and more regulation likely took a hit under this scenario. This could be a nice tailwind for stocks, as the S&amp;P 500 historically has done quite well under a divided Congress, up more than 17% on average. Additionally, in years with a divided Congress, stocks have been higher the past 10 times, with 2020 potentially being the 11th in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-2-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; This election is far from over, so stay tuned to LPL Research as we continue to monitor things!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Emerging Markets Cheering a Potential Biden Win\n\n&gt; The US equity market has seen a massive rally in reaction to what is looking like a Biden victory over President Trump coupled with the Republican party maintianing its majority in the US Senate. None of these results are official at this point, so they are subject to change, but these are the most likely scenarios as of now. Outside of the US, emerging markets have also rallied. In just the last two days, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) has rallied 5% and broken above resistance to new 52-week highs. If for no other reason then Biden's campaign slogan isn't America First, the rationale behind the rally makes some sense.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-Now.png))**\n\n&gt; The reaction of EEM in the aftermath of this election is very much different from what happened in 2016. Heading into the 2016 election, EEM had been trending higher, but pulled back in the days leading up to the election and broke its uptrend that had been in place since earlier in the year. Again, Trump's America First approach was understandably viewed as a headwind to emerging market equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-labels.png))**\n\n&gt; While the initial reaction of EEM to Trump's election was negative, that weakness didn't last long. The chart below shows the performance of EEM in the two months before and one year after the 2016 election. The gray box represents the same period shown in the chart above. Within days after breaking its uptrend after the 2016 election, EEM bounced back, rallied to its 50-DMA, tested its November low, and then in the early days of 2017 it was off to the races as EEM. In fact, even accounting for the post-Election Day declines, one year after the 2016 election, EEM was up 25% which was actually more than the 21% return for the S&amp;P 500! The moral of the story here is that first reactions aren't always the right reactions, and as an investor it's not just imperative to know the environment you are operating in, but also when the tides are turning.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-2017.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Winners and Losers During Trump's Presidency\n\n&gt; With Election Day upon us, below we take a look at the biggest winners and losers across financial markets during the Trump Presidency from Election Day 2016 through today. First off, below is a chart of the market cap of the Russell 3,000 since Election Day 2000 which George W. Bush eventually won. The Russell 3,000 makes up more than 98% of the total US equity market cap, so it's a good gauge to use for measuring the overall change in market cap levels. The current market cap of the Russell 1000 is just north of $35 trillion, which is up $11.5 trillion since Election Day 2016. President Obama oversaw US market cap growth of $12.3 trillion over his two terms, while President Bush actually saw market cap decline by $4.1 trillion after his two terms.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/mktcap.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the total return of various asset classes since Election Day 2016 using key ETFs listed on US exchanges. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 70.6% since Trump was elected, while the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) more than doubled that at +144.3%. Of the broad index ETFs in the matrix, the Smallcap Value ETF (IJS) is up the least since Election Day 2016 at just +17.2%.\n\n&gt; Looking at US sector ETFs, the Energy sector (XLE) is a huge outlier with a decline of 48.3% since Trump was elected. Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are up the most with gains of 154% and 97%, respectively.\n\n&gt; Along with Energy stocks, the oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) ETFs have been more than cut in half since 11/8/16, while gold (GLD) is up 47% and silver is up 29.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/assetclass1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Not every country has seen stock market gains since Trump was elected. As shown below, Mexico (EWW) is down 28.5%, Brazil (EWZ) is down 19.4%, Spain (EWP) is down 6.8%, and the UK (EWU) is just slightly in the red.\n\n&gt; The US (SPY) is up more than any other country with a gain of 70.6%, while China (ASHR) is up the second most at +51%. Whatever happened with the trade war certainly didn't hurt the US and China versus the rest of the world on a relative basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/countryreturns1103.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/sectors1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Within the Russell 1,000 in its current form, there are nine stocks that are up 1,000% or more since Election Day 2016, with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at the top with a gain of 8,590%. Trade Desk (TTD) is up the second most at +2,448%, followed by Novocure (NVCR), SolarEdge Tech (SEDG), and Quidel (QDEL). Square (SQ) ranks sixth with a gain of 1,203%. Other notables on the list of big winners since Trump was elected include Etsy (ETSY), Teladoc (TDOC), Tesla (TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA), Atlassian (TEAM), Boston Beer (SAM), and Lululemon (LULU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-since-2016.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of market cap gains for individual stocks, the numbers below are quite eye-popping. Apple (AAPL) has gained the most in market cap since Trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! Amazingly, both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well. Prior to the last few years, no company was even close to having a $1 trillion market cap, but at this point, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT have gained that much in the last four years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/capuse.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 6th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ5sT7SXYTk))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.8.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/gziesWx.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Yme9cXS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a6Kp4iF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOR4bP6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TfDOPZJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OsrCLIc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N7Ibl9s.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/y4tBaZw.png))\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wVnvQZH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9PnmIUs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uoiA0Bw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

        "selftext": "**Biden wins the election, what does this mean for the economy and the stock market, what Buffen\u2019s Berkshire has done in the last quarter and more, let\u2019s talk about everything** \n\nHey everyone and welcome, I am going to react to the latest news from the election, the economy and in the stock market from last week and what to expect next\n\nSo late Saturday the victory of Biden was announced as networks finally started to predict that he won the election. I have no partisan view as i am not a resident or citizen of the US, but i believe that the results of this election (the Biden win and the Republicans keeping the Senate) is the best the stock market could have hoped for, as many experts were predicting a Blue Sweep. There still will be two important runoff elections in Georgia at the beggining of 2021, where the Democrats could still end up winning the Senate. Biden currently has a projected 290 electoras votes but i believe he will also keep the lead in Georgia and end up with 306 electoral votes, the same number as Trump had 4 years ago [VOTE MAP](https://ibb.co/LZ5dnzt) . Important leaders like the German Chancellor, Uk\u2019s prime minister, Canada\u2019s prime minister, France\u2019s president and many more welcomed and congratuled the win of Biden, which seems to be favored internationaly by the world leaders as they were tired of the whipsaw that came with Trump tweeting non-stop. So this probable grid-lock in Congress is loved by the stock market, as there are no iminent tax raises and a stimulus bill is far more likely if not by the end of the Trump mandate surely at the very start of Biden\u2019s.\n\nSo this scenario that is playing out seems to be the most profitable one for wall street as the average annual return since 1933 is about 14% with a Democractic President and a split Congress [Historical CHART](https://ibb.co/SJGP97P)\n\nYesterday Biden also announced how they will try to combat the illness with Better testing and tracing, a increase in PPE production, National guidance for schools, business and families, Investments of 25 bilion in vaccine development and distribution and mask mandates. While also trying to make the higher risk individuals more safe.\n\nP.S. Here\u2019s a funny meme that LeBron James posted with a throwback to his big block of an opponent. [MEME](https://ibb.co/2hmQk6R)\n\nSo all 3 big indices had the best week since early April with the Nasdaq composite being up just over 9% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/rpgWtJH), the SP500 was up 7,32% [S&amp;P CHART](https://ibb.co/Ss7FWVN) and the DOW gained almost 7%.[DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/j3bB0P8) The Nasdaq and Sp were flat for the day, pairing loses from the begining of the day while the down fell 0,23% mostly based on profit taking in my opinion.\n\nThere were more companies that were declining on Friday with over 60% of the companies in the red but with a disproportional number of almost 90% of new highs while the volume fell again way below average [MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/k0kY7Z1) . There weren\u2019t any significant leaders in the market on Friday but energy traield again being more than 2% down [SECTOR CHART](https://ibb.co/VDFksR8) while small caps under-performed the market especialy the value plays.  [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ndqFLC)\n\nThe fear in the market seems to have completly gone away as we have seen another 10% decline in the VIX indicator to drop below 25. [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/8MjSd1f)\n\nHere is a heat map of Friday, you can see this was quite a slow day, not to many green companies but not that big of a red day either. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/nsCvwVz)\n\nThe US economy added more than 638 thousand jobs [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hDrrTXs) more than 503 thousand that were expected [CHART](https://ibb.co/C6fD3Sh), while the unemployment rate fell to 6,9% way better than the 7,7% expected this is the sixt straight month of jobs recovery.[CHART](https://ibb.co/RBZzdVG) As they seem to be in a big V shape recovery, overall  [V- SHAPE](https://ibb.co/HN6n9dH)\n\nThe market should now turn they\u2019re attention to the samshing of the earnings season amid the election with 2 thirds of the SP500 beating the estimates both the top and bottom line, that is almost double the 38% historical average. \n\nBank of American release a chart for q3 earnings and as you can see earnings have increased 6,7% in the SP500 year over year and 21,5% quarter over quarter. [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/C6zfWZR)\n\nAnd as the fed announced that it will keep the benchmark rate between 0 and 0,25% [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/vjNy43D)this continues to stimulate the economy of the US, with the fed beeing probably more responsible for the recovery in the last months as stimulus has been staled in congress. Also they continue to have a target of a running inflation of 2% and will continue to buy assests worth around 120 billion dollars montly to pump money in the economy  [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/wBxn56S). If a stimulus bill will eventualy pass, households will probably continue to use the money the same way as last time with over 70% of the money being used for savings and debt payments. But thay may go down a little as people may tend to spend a little more on essentials and non essentials with a better outlook in the near future than last time. [HOUSEHOLD SPENDING](https://ibb.co/dbbKCj6)\n\nHere are some interesting economic events for next weeks as we continue to closely watch how to recovery is going. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/gMX5XH5)\n\nNvidia saw a pop in the stock finally as they announced that Fornite will join the GeForce gaming cliud, that could mean a return for the game in ios devices with GeForce currently available on Mac,Windows,Android and Chromebooks. The company has almost reteurn to it all time highs after this weeks strong gains. [NVIDIA CHART](https://ibb.co/1qxmphB)\n\nBuffets Berkshire announced on Saturday that they bought back around 9 billion of the company\u2019s stock,bringing the total to around 16 bilion for the year so far.[BUYBACK CHART](https://ibb.co/ysw5bkx) That was around 4 billion more than in the second quarter. the operating earnings also decrease a little since last quarter and are almost 3 billion or 32% less then last year. [BUYBACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/fSWCvdQ)The only segment that improved since last year was Railroad,utilities and enegery, while insurance was the biggest loser.\n\nThe company has almost the same amount of cash and short term investemtns like the previos quarter at around 146 billion dollars with 70% of the investments concentrated in 4 big companies (Apple , Bank of America, Coca-Cola and American Express) up from the 60% these company represented at the end of 2019. [INVESTMENTS](https://ibb.co/Dps2f95)\n\nThe buybacks of the company exced any full year amount in Berkhsire\u2019s history and far exeded the analysts expectation of around 3,2 billion in buybacks. As the strategy for Buffet and Charlie Munger is to buyback the company\u2019s stock as long as they believe it\u2019s undervalued and they will still have ample cash after the buybacks. AS the only other major investments made last quarter were about 6 billion invested in the five big Japenese trading houses and the data storage company Snowflake.\n\nI just saw some interesting news as NetFlix announced they will launch a offering named NetFlix Direct in France that will come with a linear feed of content from Netflix\u2019s library, so the company that is the biggest reasons for the decline of old TV programming made quite a twist as they seek to expand more and more.  [NETFLIX NEWS](https://ibb.co/gWzmKKs)\n\nHere is a list with some of the most important earnings next week, some companies that i like that are reporting are: McDonalds, Datadog, Tencent, Corsair, Purple, Lemonade and DraftKings.

        "selftext": "After World War II, a new international monetary system called Bretton Woods was created.\n\nBretton Woods established three main things:\n\n(1) the U.S. dollar was to be an international reserve currency, \n\n(2) the U.S. dollar would be backed by gold at a price of $35 per ounce, and \n\n(3) any country could exchange dollars for gold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCountries running trade surpluses with the US sought to exchange their dollars for gold, and this rapidly shrunk US gold reserves. \n\nThis then led to the so called Nixon shock - President Richard Nixon effectively ending the Bretton Woods system in 1971.\n\nThe world economy entered a new era: the US Dollar became the global reserve currency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe US made no effort to rein in deficit spending, in fact quite the opposite.\n\nTherefore, the US needed to continue to find ways to sell government debt (i.e. to find buyers of US Treasury Securities) *without* driving up interest rates.\n\nThat is, the US needed more buyers for its debt.\n\nBut by 1974, the enormous flood of dollars from the US into top-oil-exporter Saudi Arabia suggested a solution.\n\nThat year, Nixon sent new US Treasury secretary William Simon to Saudi Arabia with a mission...\n\nThe task: neutralize crude oil as an economic weapon against the US and find a way to persuade a relatively hostile kingdom to finance America's widening deficit with its newfound petrodollar wealth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe basic framework was simple: the US would buy oil from Saudi Arabia and provide the kingdom military aid and equipment.\n\nIn return, the Saudis would plow billions of their petrodollar revenue back into US Treasuries and therefore finance America's spending.\n\nA win-win: the Saudis would receive protection from geopolitical enemies, and the US would get a new place to unload large amounts of government debt.\n\nThis became known as \"petrodollar recycling\".\n\nBy *spending* on oil, the US was creating new demand for US debt and US dollars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoreover, since Saudi Arabia dominated the OPEC - the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries - this dollar deal was extended to OPEC overall, which meant that the dollar became the preferred currency for oil purchases worldwide.\n\nAnd so the petrodollar era began.\n\nThis petrodollar system has had *massive* implications for US foreign policy, which has essentially involved imposing 'freedom' on any major oil-exporting state that moves towards ending its reliance on dollars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2000, Saddam Hussein, then-president of Iraq, announced that Iraq was moving to sell its oil in Euros instead of dollars.\n\nFollowing a particular catalyst event in 2001, the US invaded Iraq, deposed Saddam Hussein, and converted Iraqi oil sales back to the US dollar.\n\nOf course, this exact pattern was repeated with Gaddafi when he attempted to create a unified African currency backed by Libyan gold reserves to sell African oil.\n\nShortly after his announcement, rebels armed by the US Government and allies overthrew the dictator and his regime.\n\nAfter his death, the idea that African oil would be sold on something other than the dollar quickly died out.\n\nOther regimes that have called for abandoning the petrodollar include Iran and Venezuela. \n\nThe US has called for regime change in both of these countries...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough they have tried to keep it under wraps, Saudi Arabia is believed to be one of America's largest foreign creditors.\n\nUndoubtedly, Saudi holdings of US debt and other assets are significant.\n\nAll else being equal, the US should be growing less dependent on foreign holders of debt, certainly in terms of Saudi and OPEC-held debt, since the global role of OPEC and the Saudis has been diminishing in terms of global market share.\n\nBut all else *isn't* equal, and the US has been piling on ever-larger amounts of debt in recent years. \n\nIn 2019, for example, the annual deficit topped *one trillion*. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis immense growth in debt obviously makes the US regime more sensitive to changes in demand for US debt, and ever more reliant on foreign demand for both US debt and US dollars. \n\nIn order to avoid a crisis, the US must ensure that interest rates remain low and that foreigners want to acquire both US dollars and US debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWere petrodollars and petrodollar recycling to disappear, it would have a twofold effect on US government finances: \n\nFirst of all, a sizable decline in petrodollar recycling would put significant *upward* pressure on interest rates. \n\nThe result would be a budget crisis for the US government, as it would have to devote ever-larger amounts of the federal budget to payments on the debt. \n\n(The other option would be to have the US central bank monetize the debt by purchasing ever-larger amounts of it to make up for a lack of foreign demand. But this would lead to growing price inflation.)\n\nFurthermore, if participants began to exit the petrodollar system (and, say, sell oil in euros instead) demand for dollars would drop, exacerbating any scenarios in which the central bank is monetizing the debt.\u00a0 \n\nThis would also generally contribute to greater price inflation, as fewer dollars will be sucked out of the US by foreign holders.\n\nThe result could be ongoing declines in government spending on services, and growing price inflation. \n\nThe US regime's ability to finance its debt would decline significantly, and the US would need to pull back on military commitments, pensions, and more. \n\nEither that, or keep spending at the same rate and face an inflationary spiral.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr...how about another option?\n\nAnyone fancy a Great Reset? \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjK0nRSUNgU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjK0nRSUNgU)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCREDIT: \n\nRyan McMaken\n\n[Huge Debt Got Us Hooked on Petrodollars \u2014 and on Saudi Arabia](https://mises.org/wire/huge-debt-got-us-hooked-petrodollars-%E2%80%94-and-saudi-arabia)",

Visa generated 52% of its volume in the September quarter from debit transactions, compared with 44% for Mastercard MA .\n\nIn normal recessionary times, debit stays strong for a while before a swing back into credit takes place after a few years, Ellis said, but the COVID-19 crisis adds a new dimension. In addition to the cyclical shift toward debit because of the pandemic, there\u2019s also been a step up in cash displacement, which is a secular trend that she expects to continue. Much of that movement from cash to cards seems to be happening through debit.\n\nEllis said that the debit trends are one reason she tilts toward Visa shares over Mastercard\u2019s these days, though she has buy ratings on both names. She\u2019s also upbeat about the company\u2019s Visa Direct platform, which allows for \u201cpush\u201d payments, a popular way for gig economy companies to pay drivers and delivery people. Mastercard has its own version of this, called Send, but Ellis said Visa is investing more in this area and may be benefitting from its larger scale.",

        "selftext": "I am a known massive proponent for the transaction fintechs, and have written a multitude of posts on them in the last 3 years. Apart from diligent financial analysis and modeling, the largest reason for these massive long positions is Sweden.\n\nSweden is a world leader of digital payments, spawning multiple large fintechs platforms, such as Swish (Sweden domestic only), Klarna (Global payments), and iZettle (PayPal acquisition). As one of the world leaders of fintech, I use what works in Sweden to project into the US.\n\nIn the latest Central Bank (Riksbanken) report, Swish (Swedish Venmo/Cashapp) has surpassed total cash usage. It's used eveywhere, by everyone. Combine this potential future with Cashapp and Venmo (both of which show profitable margins), the potential for Square &amp; PayPal is much larger than is currently priced in. These stocks may look very over valued as of now, if you draw a line between where their e wallets are now to where swish is in Sweden, they have very very far to go.\n\nSQ is especially hot as of this week after a smash earnings, but I have a massive conviction that this isn't the last smash quarter they will have. Over the next 5 years I am extremely confident they will both outperform the market in raw e-wallet growth. For the first time, cash will be monitized by private corporations. You don't want to miss it.\n\nI mostly made this post for people who doesn't know how far e wallets have come in frontiers. In 5 years, cash will be very very close to dead in sweden. In 20, it'll be gone. Someone will profit and perhaps become the visa / Mastercard of the new age. \n\nPs: \"hur durr bitcoin &amp; crypto will deseat fiat currencies\". PayPal and Square are the two largest corporations currently investing heavily into crypto. If the stable cryptocurrencies is part of our fintech future, no large company will profit as much as they. Get in.\n\nDisclosure: Gargantuan Square position and large PayPal.",

        "selftext": "\nIn my original cover piece of\u00a0Open Orphan\u00a0(ORPH) on the 30th October 2020 I indicated the company is not a one trick pony play on covid-19. The company has a portfolio of 8 viral challenge study models which are: 2 FLU, 2 RSV, 1 HRV, 1 Asthma, 1 cough and 1 COPD viral challenge models. East London Queen Mary Bio-Enterprise facility is now close to fully booked until the end of 2021. It is the world leader in testing antivirals and vaccines. What makes the company so attractive to the large pharmaceuticals and government agencies is the fact it has the world's largest database for infectious diceases. However, it must be said the Covid-19 part of the business, namely the world's first company to take part in human for the Covid-19 challenge vaccine trial appears to be an area the retail investors is chasing the money. But wait, there is more to Open Orphans as I will explain a little later in the follow-up.\n\n\nIt is worth noting\u00a0no more fundraisers' are expected, the last raise was for \u00a312m in May, of which it still had m of this last week, giving at total of \u00a321.5m plus \u00a310m received on Monday from the UK government, plus \u00a32.5m announced on the 5th November - assuming I have not misheard Cathal's strong Irish accent the company should have somewhere in the region of \u00a334m of cash.\n\n\nWith more \u00a3multi million contract wins anticipated it is likely Open Orphan will offer special dividends to shareholders. I don't believe there are any dilutive share options due in the future to the board. I think Cathal referred to these type of options being granted as theft. I'm not sure I agree with this unless the board are amply renumberated. Thus no liefestyle pay packets for the board, Cathal is on \u00a3140,000 and he is the highest paid member of a well run board.\n\n\nDue to the company's specialist facilities and database which has positioned the company ahead of any other company in the world, which meaning it has become the goto human vaccine challenge company, thus well positioned to become rapid cash-cow, with estimates of \u00a34m worth of contracts each month in Q3, with Q4 looking to accelerate the income stream's which could expand at warp speed if the company has as some of us suspect the unnamed US biotechnology company now partnered by their hVIVO arm are involved with Trumps Warp Speed Project.\n\n\nOperation Warp Speed was introduced in early April 2020, after a round-table meeting with Trump, Pence and industry executives at the White House on March 2. It will promote mass production of multiple vaccines based on preliminary evidence allowing for faster distribution if clinical trials confirm one of the vaccines is safe and effective. As part of the funding the US government has allocated $10 billion for Operation Warp Speed through the\u00a0Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, with $6.5 billion designated by Congress for countermeasure development through\u00a0BARDA, along with $3 billion for\u00a0NIH\u00a0research. For the moment we do not know if Open Orphan is part of this project - For now, Cathal Friel is keeping a tight lip. Imagine how exciting very exciting this project could be for us?\n\n\nProbable M&amp;A Activity (it is no secrete)\n\n\nI will focus on Imutex as this has the most potential in terms of value for shareholders, which I believe will be returned in the form of a dividend. Open Orphan has a 49% owned interest in Imutex - picked up for beans. Earlier this year its hVIVO unit reported successful phase IIb trial of a potential flu vaccine for its FLU-v. This has resulted in a\u00a0joint-venture peer-reviewed article written in a scientific journal. The data from FLU-v 004 challenge study underlined its ability to reduce mild-to-moderate symptoms of the illness. The publication of the results in the periodical ''npj Vaccines'' follows results from a separate field assessment of the drug, which revealed \u201ccellular and humoral immunogenicity\u201d from a single dose of adjuvanted FLU-v.\u00a0Meaning the vaccine immediately provoked an immune response.\n\n\nIf as expected Imutex meetings with FDA regulators in the USA ahead of further trials, this should pique interest from M&amp;A suitors.\n\n\nOpen Orphan chief executive Trevor Phillips: \u201cProgression to larger phase III studies with FLU-v can further describe the cellular immune response and evaluate how the vaccine interacts with influenza disease,\u201d Open Orphan chief executive Trevor Phillips.\n\n\nCEC Cathal Friel: \u201cThe need for better, more broadly protective vaccines against influenza is a high priority worldwide, and few new vaccines have demonstrated efficacy in humans as seen in the results of the challenge study for FLU-v 004. \u201cThis is the first universal influenza vaccine that has shown this protection from influenza and reduction of symptoms\u00a0in late-stage studies and together with the\u00a0highly statistical immune results reported in a peer review article means that the risk of failure in a phase III setting is greatly reduced compared with entering into phase III studies with no efficacy data.\u201d\n\n\nNo doubt revenues are anticipated to grow at pace in the coming months as bed capacity/occupancy increases, if not sooner...probably sooner because the CEO. Cathal Friel is a man on a mission to gets things done. I am sure we all expect news on this front from Holland and the USA soon. All of this I believe to be just c90 per cent of the business if I understand Cathal Friel.\n\n\nIt is fair to say Open Orphan has struck gold with its acquisition of hVIVO shortly followed by the acquisition of CHIMagent for a nominal fee. Leaving aside the relatively poor performance before Open Orphan opportunistic, or should I say insightful vision. Along with VENN, these little beauties have transformed the company in a matter of a few months, moreover, have not proved to be a cash drain on the company, but have fitted into a brilliant strategy almost seamlessly and the bonus, that they are already producing a lot of cash with much more to come. Which means Q4 group profitability I believe to be at a NET cash level.\n\nSmart Us of The World Largest Infection Dicease Database\n\nI am really excited for the monetisation of the world's largest infectious dicease database. The excitement is centered around utilising the data in everyday consumable wearables.\u00a0Previous management did not seem to understand the value they had until Cathal Friel arrived a shrewder Irishman, and these fellas are not known for missing much when it comes to turning muck into brass. I am not sure I can call infectious diceased much, unpleasant perhaps! No matter, they have considerable value as we are already witnessing, yet Cathal appears to have found another way to unlock more value in a way I find even more exciting. Let's face it, we will need to learn to live with Covid-19 for some time to come, and everyday affordable wearables could help the world live with infectious diceased that make us much more aware of them.\u00a0\n\n\nThe talk coming from Open Orphan (not just BB gossip), is Apple and Amazon, plus others, are seeking to use the database for wearable devices, smartwatches, health monitor devices, etc. These are often premium devices, especially if you are Apple or Samsung smartwatches brands. So, what is the market size for smart devices? As investors we shouldn't allow Apple's cash pile reported to be $1900bn to excite us too much - Apple didn't amass that cashpile by giving away money to smaller companies as a charitable donation, these companies a ruthless as I am sure their Chinese workforce would profess to their collective dismay. That said, if anyone thinks Cathal, et al at the company do not realise its worth and do not know how to pitch one corporate off against another are fools. Not many Open Orphan investors strike me as fools.\u00a0\n\n\nGlobal Smart Devices Market - Huge and Growing Fast\n\n\nThe global wearable medical device market size was valued at USD 13.0bn in 2019 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 27.9% over the forecast period. The growth of industries such as\u00a0home healthcare\u00a0and remote patient monitoring devices is anticipated to positively influence the demand for wearable devices. In addition, increasing consumer focus on fitness and efforts toward leading a healthy lifestyle are expected to positively fuel the product demand.\n\nMore from the report\u00a0here.\n\n\nThe Global Smart Healthcare Market size stood at US$ 141bn in 2019 and is expected to grow at 14.5% through 2030. Smart Healthcare is technology integrated diagnostic tool used for treating patients and improving the quality of life using e-health, m-health and ambient assisted living services. Rising government initiatives for the digitization of healthcare infrastructure are driving the growth of the smart healthcare market.\n\nMore from the report\u00a0here.\n\n\nThe number of connected wearable devices worldwide has more than doubled in the space of three years, increasing from 325m in 2016 to 722m in 2019. The number of devices is forecast to reach more than one billion by 2022.\n\n\nTwo important factors to the growth within the wearable devices market is primarily being powered by sales of smartwatches \u2013 shipments of smartwatches worldwide are forecast to surpass 100m in 2020. Apple, who unveiled their first smartwatch in 2015, currently dominate the smartwatch market and have held a share of around 45% since 2018. Another reason for the growth of the wearables market is the rise in popularity of hearable devices. Also referred to as earwear or ear-worn devices, this category is expected to soar over the next few years with shipments of devices forecast to increase by 45% to 105m units by 2023.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAny search you chose to do for smartwatches, or health monitoring devices will vary from the cheap and nasty, to the premium expensive kind. What is important as far as we are concerned, and Open Orphan of course, is the fact the company has a very lucrative database of infectious diceases. Some of the world's largest companies are seeking to supplant in their wearable smart devices. While these devices may have been around for a while, and in some cases become a short-term fad for the post-Christmas fitness bunny, I think, as do Apple and Amazon, probably others, a new more important market has just opened up, one that has the potential to save lives as well as monitor health and wellbeing on an all new level previously only health care professionals had access too.\u00a0\n\n\nAs I understand it. The idea is to license Open Orphan data to smart device manufacturer(s). These devices will have the ability to instantly warn the consumer they have contracted symptoms of an infectious dicease, which will have a variety of alert levels related to the disease offering specific advice, like self isolate, off you pop to hospital, etc. The \u00a3multi million question must be who with?\u00a0\n\n\nOne option is to a global leader as first mover advantage on an exclusivity period - naturally this option would yield significant margins to Open Orphan by virtue of the market it would grab ahead of any other adopter because this would of course add significant value in today's pandemic environments.\u00a0\n\n\nThen the second highest bidder? Or multiple companies and or government agencies. The moral standpoint I have is one of ethics and morality. (I make no apologies for my Master Mason and Christian beliefs) To my mind I think such ground-breaking technology should be made as widely available as possible because the alert system is lifesaving, track and traceability (IF AN OPTION) could become a problem if governments do not put financial safety nets in place for people contracting Covid -19 or ave some symptoms that require isolation, this being the only real negative I see for such devices as this would reduce its effectiveness.\u00a0\n\n\nThe other question is the pricing for such data access and alerts in real time - will this price the ordinary mid to low salary consumers be priced out of the market, thus reduce the effectiveness if it were not made available more widespread at affordable pricing levels? This must be a factor for opening up the world economy again...yes, it really has the potential to be this important.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat price could be put on this new ground-breaking market to Open Orphan? Surely global governments have more buying power than any global Apple, Amazon type business. Hell fire, do they deserve this opportunity!\n\nThank you for reading.

        "selftext": "#**Sector and Industry**\n\nThe communication services sector has seen annual [earnings growth of 19.63%]( https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=sector&amp;v=152&amp;o=-eps5years&amp;c=0,1,11) in the past five years. This makes the sector second only to the consumer cyclical sector in earnings growth. Notably, the consumer cyclical sector includes Yum Brands ([YUM](https://www.vhinny.com/display/YUM)), Amazon ([AMZN]( https://www.vhinny.com/display/AMZN)), and Acushnet ([GOLF](https://www.vhinny.com/display/GOLF)).\n\nThe telecommunication services industry is a subset of the broader communication services sector. Telecom companies provide communication solutions through phones, airwaves, cable infrastructure, satellites, and the Internet. The industry has seen stable earnings growth over the past five years. Telephone communication has been the largest historical source of revenue for telecom companies. However, technological advances have proven that future growth will be focused on Internet communication and mobile networks. \n\nTelecom services is [third in EPS growth](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&amp;sg=communicationservices&amp;v=152&amp;o=-eps5years&amp;c=0,1,11) for the last five years, of the communication services industries. Overall, telecom has seen steady earnings growth in recent years but still underperformed its sector.\n\nVerizon is the largest in the industry, with a market cap of $241B compared to AT&amp;T\u2019s $193B. The two companies make up approximately 30% of the industry\u2019s [$1,345B total market cap](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&amp;sg=communicationservices&amp;v=152&amp;o=-perf52w&amp;c=0,1,2).\n\n#**Descriptions**\n\nVerizon and AT&amp;T are both titans in mobile data plans, internet service, and entertainment. AT&amp;T has a larger exposure to entertainment through its [acquisition of Time Warner in 2018]( https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/att-vs-verizon-stock-which-is-a-better-investment). Time Warner was renamed to WarnerMedia and includes Warner Bros., Turner Broadcasting, HBO, CNN, DC Entertainment, Cinemax, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, TBS and TNT. AT&amp;T has famously struggled to retain customers of its DirecTV services and is currently [attempting to sell the division](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/att-loses-another-600000-tv-customers-as-it-seeks-buyer-for-directv/). \n\nVerizon has made the notable acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo\u2019s internet division in the past five years. These acquisitions ended in Verizon [writing off a $4.6 billion loss in 2018](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/verizon-takes-4-6-billion-hit-aol-yahoo-n946486) after failed attempts to integrate the two companies. In September, Verizon [acquired Tracfone\u2014a prepaid mobile phone provider](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/verizon-stock-buy-now/). Verizon has since moved away from entertainment and focused on preparing for the adoption of 5G technology. It is still unclear if Verizon will have a competitive edge over competitor T-Mobile in the 5G space.\n\n#**Valuations**\n\nTicker|Company|Mkt Cap|P/E|PEG|Div %|Payout Ratio\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:\nVZ|Verizon|$241B|13.24|3.82|4.29%|55.60%\nT|AT&amp;T|$194B|18.06|6.76|7.58%|103.70%\n\nVerizon and AT&amp;T both carry large debt loads; both are part of the top five most indebted companies. Verizon carries $139B in total debt with a current ratio of 1.10 ([read about current ratios here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp)). AT&amp;T\u2019s debt situation is much worse with $181B in total debt and a current ratio of 0.80. A current ratio of less than 1 indicates the Company has short-term debts greater than its total assets. \n\nAT&amp;T is considered a dividend aristocrat as the Company has increased its dividend payout for 36 consecutive years. AT&amp;T currently pays a dividend of 7.58%, with a [payout ratio of 103.70%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;t=T,VZ&amp;c=0,1,2,14,15). The Company\u2019s large debt and unsustainable payout ratio makes it fundamentally undesirable, although it is attempting to cut cash-burning operations such as DirecTV.\n\nVerizon is not yet a dividend aristocrat, with 16 consecutive years of increased dividend payouts. Verizon\u2019s 4.29% dividend yield at a [payout ratio of 55.60%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;t=T,VZ&amp;c=0,1,2,14,15) is much more sustainable than its competitor. The lower dividend payout ratio has allowed Verizon to invest into 5G technology and pay down debt, while still growing the dividend in a sustainable way.\n\nFundamentally, Verizon trades at both lower P/E and PEG ratios. AT&amp;T has seen annual EPS growth of  [8.90% the past five years, compared to Verizon\u2019s 14.00%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;t=T,VZ&amp;c=0,1,2,19). Estimated five-year growth for both companies is low, with [Verizon at 2.27% annual growth and AT&amp;T at -1.74%](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&amp;t=T,VZ&amp;c=0,1,2,20). This estimate will likely change as the impact of 5G on Verizon\u2019s revenues becomes clear and AT&amp;T continues [restructuring efforts](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/03/struggling-att-plans-tens-of-billions-in-cost-cuts-more-layoffs/).\n\n#**Conclusion**\n\nPositive catalysts for Verizon include the adoption of 5G and its low debt compared with AT&amp;T. Verizon recently spent [$1.9B in bidding on 5G mmWave spectrum](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-verizon-dish-became-top-spenders-crbs-spectrum-auction-2020-9), on top of other multi-billion 5G investments. [Open signal data]( https://www.opensignal.com/reports/2020/06/usa/mobile-network-experience-5g) from mid-2020 showed Verizon\u2019s average 5G speed beating AT&amp;T's by as much as eight times.\n\nAT&amp;T would benefit from selling their DirecTV division, which would allow focus on the recently launched HBO Max streaming service. However, even selling DirecTV may not be enough for AT&amp;T\u2019s success in the digital streaming space due to intense competition from Disney, Netflix, Apple, and Amazon. Right now, AT&amp;T is limited by their dividend payout ratio and debt.\n\nIn conclusion, Verizon has stronger fundamentals than AT&amp;T and has made key investments that should serve as positive catalysts in the future. AT&amp;T is weighed down by its dividend payment and debt making innovation difficult. Neither company offers a compelling case for growth investors and the telecom industry fits dividend investing ideals better. Those invested into either company can expect less volatility and consistent dividends but also lower gains than the total market.\n\n---\n\nFinancial data was sourced from [Vhinny](https://www.vhinny.com), [Finviz](https://finviz.com/), and [Yahoo Finance]( https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nI hold no position in VZ or T and do not plan to in the near future.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 9th, 2020.\n\n# **After sharp bounce, market may take a \u2018breather\u2019 on lingering election uncertainty, virus outbreak  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/after-sharp-bounce-market-may-take-a-breather-on-lingering-election-uncertainty-virus-outbreak.html)**\n*****\n&gt; After an initially exuberant election reaction, stocks may trade more cautiously in the week ahead, as investors watch election developments unfold and track the course of the coronavirus. \n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up more than 7.3% in the past week, at 3,509, and the Nasdaq rose 9%, the best weekly performance since April. Stocks slid Friday, but technology, communications services, health care and discretionary stocks had the biggest gains for the week, after it appeared Democrat Joe Biden could be the next president but with a split Congress.\n*****\n&gt; The election was still unresolved heading into the weekend, but even if Biden is declared winner, close votes and lawsuits are likely to result in recounts. The Senate appeared to be in Republican hands, but the margin of control is likely to be tight, and runoff elections are required for two Senate seats in Georgia in early January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the uncertainty is going to catch up the market on a short-term basis,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, BNY Mellon\u2019s Wealth Management chief investment officer. \u201cPerhaps next week could be a drifting lower kind of week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ahead of the election, the market had been betting on a \u201cblue wave,\u201d where Biden would take the White House and Democrats would get control of the Senate, giving them total control of Congress. But when it appeared the Senate would stay in Republican hands, stocks surged on the idea of gridlock, which would keep Biden from implementing tax increases and lots of new regulations.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, there has been a surge in daily new coronavirus cases to more than 122,000. Economists are concerned that the economic recovery could suffer as some states could restrict activities and consumers may pull back heading into the important holiday season.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed, in its post-meeting statement Thursday, repeated that the course of the virus could help determine the path of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports in the week ahead, including consumer price index inflation data Thursday and the producer price index Friday. More than a dozen Fed officials are on the speaking circuit, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who speaks Thursday on central banking at a European Central Bank forum.\n*****\n&gt; The earnings season is beginning to slow down, but there are still dozens of reports, including from McDonald\u2019s on Monday and Walt Disney, Applied Materials and Cisco on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is just setting up to be a breather. There\u2019s still a lot to figure out here,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cThe equity market\u2019s reaction has been I think understandable and probably better than many might have expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there may be uncertainty for awhile. \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking about is the Senate races. Part of the market reaction has been relying on this divided government.\u201d After the votes are all in or recounted, \u201ca sweep is unlikely but possible.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the longer this stays uncertain and messy, the more the post-election bounce comes into question,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Different than 2000\n&gt; It would not be unusual for the stock market to sell off before rallying into year end, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall does not expect the type of turbulence there was in 2000, when former Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush in a tight race that ultimately went to the Supreme Court.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn 2000, they were not expecting hanging chads. But they do expect a contested election this time. I think in many ways the market anticipated this,\u201d said Stovall.\n*****\n&gt; But the market, after its election week surge, could pull back. \u201cHistorically, the market goes down in the month of November, after a Democratic victory,\u201d said Stovall. Since World War II, Democrats won the White House nine times, and the market fell an average of 0.5% in November in those years, compared to the average gain for all Novembers of 1.4%, he said.\n*****\n&gt; After those Democratic victories, stocks then rose 1.9% in December on average, more than the normal 1.5% gain for all Decembers.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they currently do not expect the kind of lockdowns that states ordered when the pandemic started to spread in March. But there could still be some impact that could be negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said he sees some signs of optimism for the market. Strong data, like third quarter GDP, October\u2019s drop in unemployment to 6.9%, and the better-than-expected earnings are all positives for the market. Another is that investors are so skeptical.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat does still exist is a great deal of dry powder. There\u2019s $4.3 trillion in money markets alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you, being in touch with investors of all shapes and sizes this week, there\u2019s still a lot of skepticism. From a contrarian view, high cash and a lot of skepticism is a contrarian indicator.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WUlRQfd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FWN82Hs.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ZnTzBNz.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/g52vqsv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OiPuXi8.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lA86Kou.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xmtVSEB.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RRxlWej.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Piu5auo.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/W80POso.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eGUQXgr.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yoHWfIC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hQyweyw.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Presidential Election Anticipation Is Keeping Us Waiting\n\n&gt; While we all anxiously await the final count and outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election, here are some possible scenarios for 2021. Our analysis here is based on historical market performance during the most likely political alignments for next year. We ran these likely scenarios through the Almanac database software to create this graph.\n\n&gt; We are either going to have the fifth year of a two-term republican president or a first year of a new democratic presidency. It appears the democrats will hold the house and the republicans will hold the senate, but that is not a forgone conclusion either. So we also examined both presidential outcomes with a democratic, republican and split congress.\n\n&gt; Our study uses the S&amp;P 500 from 1949 to 2017. We start in 1949 because it is the first full 4-Year Presidential Stock Market Cycle since the end of WWII. The Twenty-Second Amendment that implemented presidential term limits for a max of two terms or eight years was ratified on February 27, 1951. Truman in 1949 was excluded as there was a no change of party in the White House. We gave Bush 41 the same treatment.\n\n&gt; Admittedly, there are limited data points; four each of fifth year republicans and first year democrats. Here\u2019s what we found. A change in party with a new, first year democratic president came with democratic control of Congress and significantly higher performance for the S&amp;P 500, averaging 10.6% with a median gain of 15.1% versus 7.0% for the average post-election year since 1949.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a89421df75f426e1b1ff90cb2c29cb90/b63e1cf962f89fdb-a3/s400x600/f9bde99a9e4ba83b0df266a8d3cc04cd732cc58f.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Fifth year republican presidents in 1957 (Eisenhower) and 1973 (Nixon) had to work with democratically controlled Congresses and the market suffered significant losses. The market did well in Reagan\u2019s fifth year with a split Congress \u2013 a testament to how \u201cThe Great Communicator\u201d was able to work across the aisle with then Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill. Even with republican control of Congress under Bush 43\u2019s fifth year, the market had a tough year with ongoing issues in Iraq, North Korea declaring it\u2019s a nuclear power and the most active and second costliest hurricane season on record.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Continues as COVID-19 Cases Rise\n\n&gt; The US labor market shrugged off election uncertainty and continued to add jobs in October. Despite the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 638,000 jobs, ahead of Bloomberg survey estimates calling for 580,000. The headline number was depressed by a 268,000 drop in government employment, including 147,000 temporary census workers. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9% despite a rise in the labor force participation rate, a reversal of the dynamic we saw in September when unemployment fell while the labor force participation also declined.\n\n&gt; However, a troubling trend remains beneath the surface. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the number of long-term unemployed\u2014those out of work for 27 weeks or longer\u2014continues to rise as a share of the total unemployed:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11.6.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhile the labor market has continued to show improvement, there are still many people out there who are having a hard time getting back to work,\u201d noted LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWith total jobs in the US around 10 million below pre-pandemic levels and rising COVID-19 cases, there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement despite the declining unemployment rate.\u201d\n\n&gt; COVID-19 cases in the United States have reached record highs with a weekly trend growth rate above 20%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. As the weather cools and more activity shifts indoors, additional restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could slow the fragile labor market recovery.\n\n&gt; In particular, much of the private sector gains in this month\u2019s jobs report were in the services sector, where previous jobs reports had shown strength in goods-oriented industries. Many countries in Europe have reinstated restrictions or even gone as far as implementing new lockdowns. While we don\u2019t expect lockdowns in the United States like we saw in March, restrictions on activity could limit future job gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Sentiment Survey Soars While Another Sinks\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we discussed how bullish sentiment in the AAII survey has been on the rise, but looking at another weekly sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence, the opposite is true. The percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell sharply this week, 7 percentage points, down to 53.6%. While a majority are still optimistic and that reading is in the middle of its range, that was the largest weekly decline since a 7.4 percentage point decline to 41.7% in the first week of March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, the percentage of newsletter writers that are \"looking for a correction\" rose sharply to 25.8% this week following last week's over 5% decline for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Correction.png))**\n\n&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey has a long history dating back to 1963, and in all weeks in that time, only 5% (174 weeks) have seen bullish sentiment fall 5 percentage points or more while the percentage of respondents looking for a correction has risen at least 5 percentage points in the same week. In the chart below, we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 following these past occurrences when there has not been another in the prior 3 months. The S&amp;P 500 has frequently been higher over the following weeks and months, but there is a slight underperformance relative to all periods since 1963 when the survey begins.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2 Post-Election Charts You Need to See\n\n&gt; The election is over, but the questions are mounting. We don\u2019t know who will be the next president as of Wednesday morning, but we do know that stocks tend to do well the final two months of an election year. \u201cOnce the uncertainty is over, stocks tend to rally in November and December, with November the best month of the year during an election year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOf course, 2020 isn\u2019t like any other year, and we still could be a ways away from who the winner will be.\u201d\n\n&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index tends to do very well the final two months of the year, especially during election years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The modern design of the S&amp;P 500 stock index was first launched in 1957. Performance back to 1928 incorporates the performance of predecessor index, the S&amp;P 90\n\n&gt; One of the big takeaways so far from Tuesday night is that the Senate likely will stay Republican, meaning we may have a divided Congress. The chances of higher taxes and more regulation likely took a hit under this scenario. This could be a nice tailwind for stocks, as the S&amp;P 500 historically has done quite well under a divided Congress, up more than 17% on average. Additionally, in years with a divided Congress, stocks have been higher the past 10 times, with 2020 potentially being the 11th in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-2-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; This election is far from over, so stay tuned to LPL Research as we continue to monitor things!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Emerging Markets Cheering a Potential Biden Win\n\n&gt; The US equity market has seen a massive rally in reaction to what is looking like a Biden victory over President Trump coupled with the Republican party maintianing its majority in the US Senate. None of these results are official at this point, so they are subject to change, but these are the most likely scenarios as of now. Outside of the US, emerging markets have also rallied. In just the last two days, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) has rallied 5% and broken above resistance to new 52-week highs. If for no other reason then Biden's campaign slogan isn't America First, the rationale behind the rally makes some sense.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-Now.png))**\n\n&gt; The reaction of EEM in the aftermath of this election is very much different from what happened in 2016. Heading into the 2016 election, EEM had been trending higher, but pulled back in the days leading up to the election and broke its uptrend that had been in place since earlier in the year. Again, Trump's America First approach was understandably viewed as a headwind to emerging market equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-labels.png))**\n\n&gt; While the initial reaction of EEM to Trump's election was negative, that weakness didn't last long. The chart below shows the performance of EEM in the two months before and one year after the 2016 election. The gray box represents the same period shown in the chart above. Within days after breaking its uptrend after the 2016 election, EEM bounced back, rallied to its 50-DMA, tested its November low, and then in the early days of 2017 it was off to the races as EEM. In fact, even accounting for the post-Election Day declines, one year after the 2016 election, EEM was up 25% which was actually more than the 21% return for the S&amp;P 500! The moral of the story here is that first reactions aren't always the right reactions, and as an investor it's not just imperative to know the environment you are operating in, but also when the tides are turning.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-2017.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Winners and Losers During Trump's Presidency\n\n&gt; With Election Day upon us, below we take a look at the biggest winners and losers across financial markets during the Trump Presidency from Election Day 2016 through today. First off, below is a chart of the market cap of the Russell 3,000 since Election Day 2000 which George W. Bush eventually won. The Russell 3,000 makes up more than 98% of the total US equity market cap, so it's a good gauge to use for measuring the overall change in market cap levels. The current market cap of the Russell 1000 is just north of $35 trillion, which is up $11.5 trillion since Election Day 2016. President Obama oversaw US market cap growth of $12.3 trillion over his two terms, while President Bush actually saw market cap decline by $4.1 trillion after his two terms.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/mktcap.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the total return of various asset classes since Election Day 2016 using key ETFs listed on US exchanges. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 70.6% since Trump was elected, while the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) more than doubled that at +144.3%. Of the broad index ETFs in the matrix, the Smallcap Value ETF (IJS) is up the least since Election Day 2016 at just +17.2%.\n\n&gt; Looking at US sector ETFs, the Energy sector (XLE) is a huge outlier with a decline of 48.3% since Trump was elected. Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are up the most with gains of 154% and 97%, respectively.\n\n&gt; Along with Energy stocks, the oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) ETFs have been more than cut in half since 11/8/16, while gold (GLD) is up 47% and silver is up 29.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/assetclass1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Not every country has seen stock market gains since Trump was elected. As shown below, Mexico (EWW) is down 28.5%, Brazil (EWZ) is down 19.4%, Spain (EWP) is down 6.8%, and the UK (EWU) is just slightly in the red.\n\n&gt; The US (SPY) is up more than any other country with a gain of 70.6%, while China (ASHR) is up the second most at +51%. Whatever happened with the trade war certainly didn't hurt the US and China versus the rest of the world on a relative basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/countryreturns1103.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/sectors1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Within the Russell 1,000 in its current form, there are nine stocks that are up 1,000% or more since Election Day 2016, with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at the top with a gain of 8,590%. Trade Desk (TTD) is up the second most at +2,448%, followed by Novocure (NVCR), SolarEdge Tech (SEDG), and Quidel (QDEL). Square (SQ) ranks sixth with a gain of 1,203%. Other notables on the list of big winners since Trump was elected include Etsy (ETSY), Teladoc (TDOC), Tesla (TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA), Atlassian (TEAM), Boston Beer (SAM), and Lululemon (LULU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-since-2016.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of market cap gains for individual stocks, the numbers below are quite eye-popping. Apple (AAPL) has gained the most in market cap since Trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! Amazingly, both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well. Prior to the last few years, no company was even close to having a $1 trillion market cap, but at this point, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT have gained that much in the last four years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/capuse.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 6th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ5sT7SXYTk))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.8.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PLUG** \n&gt; * **$WKHS** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$DKNG** \n&gt; * **$BYND** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$ACB** \n&gt; * **$RKT** \n&gt; * **$SPG** \n&gt; * **$JMIA** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$NKLA** \n&gt; * **$DDOG** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$DHI** \n&gt; * **$WIX** \n&gt; * **$CARS** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$DIS** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$GRWG** \n&gt; * **$NLS** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$DOYU** \n&gt; * **$RNG** \n&gt; * **$PRTS** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$LMND** \n&gt; * **$TGNA** \n&gt; * **$WVE** \n&gt; * **$EXPI** \n&gt; * **$PRTY** \n&gt; * **$ICPT** \n&gt; * **$HUYA** \n&gt; * **$GOGO** \n&gt; * **$NCLH** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$PEIX** \n&gt; * **$CYBR**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Piu5auo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MDVAWXO.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Yme9cXS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a6Kp4iF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOR4bP6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TfDOPZJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OsrCLIc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N7Ibl9s.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/y4tBaZw.png))\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wVnvQZH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9PnmIUs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uoiA0Bw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Plug Power, Inc. $18.86\n**Plug Power, Inc.

        "selftext": "Hello r/CanadianInvestor,\n\nI'm looking at 3 ETFs today: [XCV](https://www.blackrock.com/ca/individual/en/products/239498/ishares-canadian-value-index-etf), [XDV](https://www.blackrock.com/ca/individual/en/products/239496/ishares-canadian-select-dividend-index-etf), and [CDZ](https://www.blackrock.com/ca/individual/en/products/239834/ishares-sptsx-canadian-dividend-aristocrats-index-fund).\n\nThe [coof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0dE-zMrbCM&amp;ab_channel=Jules) has indirectly damaged dividends. Most of our longest-paying dividend stocks are financials and this sector has not recovered from March.\n\nAs someone who's just starting out but wants to transition into value stocks in the future, I looked at value and dividend ETFs. I realized that all 3 of the ETFs I found through Ishares had solid dividend yields which slightly surpassed what I was looking for, only to be brought down by their MERs.\n\nDiversification-wise, XCV is heavily overweight in financials, which makes sense since we've had low interest for a while. XDV is also heavily overweight in financials but also has a strong showing of utilities and telecommunication. CDZ is the most diversified, though its a shame they have a low amount of telecom stocks.\n\n~~When it comes to total returns, it would be expected for XCV to beat both XDV and CDZ over a long time period.~~ \n\nMy question is due to the unique situation our market is in: could value ETFs such as XCVbe a long-term replacement for dividend ETFs like XDV or CDZ, or should we wait another 5 years to see how value stocks change?",

        "selftext": "**Biden wins the election, what does this mean for the economy and the stock market, what Buffen\u2019s Berkshire has done in the last quarter and more, let\u2019s talk about everything** \n\nHey everyone and welcome, I am going to react to the latest news from the election, the economy and in the stock market from last week and what to expect next\n\nSo late Saturday the victory of Biden was announced as networks finally started to predict that he won the election. I have no partisan view as i am not a resident or citizen of the US, but i believe that the results of this election (the Biden win and the Republicans keeping the Senate) is the best the stock market could have hoped for, as many experts were predicting a Blue Sweep. There still will be two important runoff elections in Georgia at the beggining of 2021, where the Democrats could still end up winning the Senate. Biden currently has a projected 290 electoras votes but i believe he will also keep the lead in Georgia and end up with 306 electoral votes, the same number as Trump had 4 years ago [VOTE MAP](https://ibb.co/LZ5dnzt) . Important leaders like the German Chancellor, Uk\u2019s prime minister, Canada\u2019s prime minister, France\u2019s president and many more welcomed and congratuled the win of Biden, which seems to be favored internationaly by the world leaders as they were tired of the whipsaw that came with Trump tweeting non-stop. So this probable grid-lock in Congress is loved by the stock market, as there are no iminent tax raises and a stimulus bill is far more likely if not by the end of the Trump mandate surely at the very start of Biden\u2019s.\n\nSo this scenario that is playing out seems to be the most profitable one for wall street as the average annual return since 1933 is about 14% with a Democractic President and a split Congress [Historical CHART](https://ibb.co/SJGP97P)\n\nYesterday Biden also announced how they will try to combat the illness with Better testing and tracing, a increase in PPE production, National guidance for schools, business and families, Investments of 25 bilion in vaccine development and distribution and mask mandates. While also trying to make the higher risk individuals more safe.\n\nP.S. Here\u2019s a funny meme that LeBron James posted with a throwback to his big block of an opponent. [MEME](https://ibb.co/2hmQk6R)\n\nSo all 3 big indices had the best week since early April with the Nasdaq composite being up just over 9% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/rpgWtJH), the SP500 was up 7,32% [S&amp;P CHART](https://ibb.co/Ss7FWVN) and the DOW gained almost 7%.[DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/j3bB0P8) The Nasdaq and Sp were flat for the day, pairing loses from the begining of the day while the down fell 0,23% mostly based on profit taking in my opinion.\n\nThere were more companies that were declining on Friday with over 60% of the companies in the red but with a disproportional number of almost 90% of new highs while the volume fell again way below average [MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/k0kY7Z1) . There weren\u2019t any significant leaders in the market on Friday but energy traield again being more than 2% down [SECTOR CHART](https://ibb.co/VDFksR8) while small caps under-performed the market especialy the value plays.  [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ndqFLC)\n\nThe fear in the market seems to have completly gone away as we have seen another 10% decline in the VIX indicator to drop below 25. [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/8MjSd1f)\n\nHere is a heat map of Friday, you can see this was quite a slow day, not to many green companies but not that big of a red day either. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/nsCvwVz)\n\nThe US economy added more than 638 thousand jobs [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hDrrTXs) more than 503 thousand that were expected [CHART](https://ibb.co/C6fD3Sh), while the unemployment rate fell to 6,9% way better than the 7,7% expected this is the sixt straight month of jobs recovery.[CHART](https://ibb.co/RBZzdVG) As they seem to be in a big V shape recovery, overall  [V- SHAPE](https://ibb.co/HN6n9dH)\n\nThe market should now turn they\u2019re attention to the samshing of the earnings season amid the election with 2 thirds of the SP500 beating the estimates both the top and bottom line, that is almost double the 38% historical average. \n\nBank of American release a chart for q3 earnings and as you can see earnings have increased 6,7% in the SP500 year over year and 21,5% quarter over quarter. [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/C6zfWZR)\n\nAnd as the fed announced that it will keep the benchmark rate between 0 and 0,25% [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/vjNy43D)this continues to stimulate the economy of the US, with the fed beeing probably more responsible for the recovery in the last months as stimulus has been staled in congress. Also they continue to have a target of a running inflation of 2% and will continue to buy assests worth around 120 billion dollars montly to pump money in the economy  [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/wBxn56S). If a stimulus bill will eventualy pass, households will probably continue to use the money the same way as last time with over 70% of the money being used for savings and debt payments. But thay may go down a little as people may tend to spend a little more on essentials and non essentials with a better outlook in the near future than last time. [HOUSEHOLD SPENDING](https://ibb.co/dbbKCj6)\n\nHere are some interesting economic events for next weeks as we continue to closely watch how to recovery is going. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/gMX5XH5)\n\nNvidia saw a pop in the stock finally as they announced that Fornite will join the GeForce gaming cliud, that could mean a return for the game in ios devices with GeForce currently available on Mac,Windows,Android and Chromebooks. The company has almost reteurn to it all time highs after this weeks strong gains. [NVIDIA CHART](https://ibb.co/1qxmphB)\n\nBuffets Berkshire announced on Saturday that they bought back around 9 billion of the company\u2019s stock,bringing the total to around 16 bilion for the year so far.[BUYBACK CHART](https://ibb.co/ysw5bkx) That was around 4 billion more than in the second quarter. the operating earnings also decrease a little since last quarter and are almost 3 billion or 32% less then last year. [BUYBACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/fSWCvdQ)The only segment that improved since last year was Railroad,utilities and enegery, while insurance was the biggest loser.\n\nThe company has almost the same amount of cash and short term investemtns like the previos quarter at around 146 billion dollars with 70% of the investments concentrated in 4 big companies (Apple , Bank of America, Coca-Cola and American Express) up from the 60% these company represented at the end of 2019. [INVESTMENTS](https://ibb.co/Dps2f95)\n\nThe buybacks of the company exced any full year amount in Berkhsire\u2019s history and far exeded the analysts expectation of around 3,2 billion in buybacks. As the strategy for Buffet and Charlie Munger is to buyback the company\u2019s stock as long as they believe it\u2019s undervalued and they will still have ample cash after the buybacks. AS the only other major investments made last quarter were about 6 billion invested in the five big Japenese trading houses and the data storage company Snowflake.\n\nI just saw some interesting news as NetFlix announced they will launch a offering named NetFlix Direct in France that will come with a linear feed of content from Netflix\u2019s library, so the company that is the biggest reasons for the decline of old TV programming made quite a twist as they seek to expand more and more.  [NETFLIX NEWS](https://ibb.co/gWzmKKs)\n\nHere is a list with some of the most important earnings next week, some companies that i like that are reporting are: McDonalds, Datadog, Tencent, Corsair, Purple, Lemonade and DraftKings. [EARNINGS NEXT WEEKS](https://ibb.co/JFKh6kN)\n\nThank you everyone for reading!  Be sure to leave a comment down below!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",
