It's a rapidly growing product that I believe will protect interests as Latin America develops. I believe that their development of privacy-focused serverless computing and video streaming infrastructure was what was necessary for it to experience enormous growth in the next few years.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/) \n\n\\- **Corteva - AGRICULTURE BIOTECH**\n\nCorteva is a powerfully focused agritech investment. They have deep investments in corn, which is an enormous product that will always persist in Mexico and US agriculture.\n\n [https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening](https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening) \n\n\\- **Facebook - E-COMMERCE**\n\nI believe Facebook will play a really interesting role with Canada's Shopify in Latin America. WhatsApp is enormously popular in Mexico due to Facebook's networking investments, making it cheap to use. WhatsApp is better suited for Mexico's barter style economy, while Instagram seems to serve America's ad-centric transactions better. I believe we will be seeing Facebook develop deep business support with Shopify that is easy to use for billions of people across different economies.  Some of the technology is actually faschinating, as you can purchase products and test products using filters and 1-swipe purchases.\n\n [https://www.facebook.com/business/shops](https://www.facebook.com/business/shops) \n\n**- Kansas City Southern - US-MEXICAN RAIL**\n\nKansas City Southern is an extremely important trade vector between Mexico and the US. In particular, Texas and Monterrey. It's well diversified to deliver at a cost effective rate between changes in agriculture, energy, automotive, machining, food, and more.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf\\_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Adobe - GRAPHICS**\n\nI'm completely impressed by Adobe's growth and acquisitions across multiple sectors. I believe Adobe is a great longterm AR play as it maintains a close relationship with Apple, develops software for video games, movies, digital signatures, and e-commerce, architecture, design, and an endless array of other software solutions.\n\n [https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/](https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Paypal - FINANCIAL ACCESS**\n\nPaypal is interesting in regards to US-Mexico.Paypal has always demonstrated itself as a pioneer. It's very easy to send remittance money through Xoom. It's easy to send money to your friends via Venmo. Their credit system is awfully fair, which is helpful in a nation like Mexico that's critically underbanked. \n\nThey also had an excellent acquisition with Honey. I believe they'll be generating billions through their transactions on Amazon and other industries and will force fintech to rethink how far financial technology can go.\n\n [https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:\\~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Texas Instruments  - EMBEDDED SYSTEMS**\n\nI've selected for TI over AMD and Nvidia  since TI has a greater distribution. You'll find TI in automobiles, space rockets, airplanes, CNCs, school calculators, concrete producers, and so on.  Either way, AMD is listed below as a supplement to an already cloud-heavy setup.\n\n [https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx) \n\n\\- **Teradyne - SYSTEMS TESTING &amp; INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION**\n\nTeradyne is part of the COVID restructure. I believe networking hardware chips are only  going to be more needed as an economic driver. Teradyne has an excellent client base regarding that and also develops and impressive amount of industrial automation robots across warehouses, farms, and so on. The future is inevitably automation, and this is my participation in that.\n\n [https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/](https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/) \n\n\\- **Microsoft - SOFTWARE AUTOMATION**\n\nI'm really excited to see Microsoft's future in software automation and services. They have a really interesting position with regards to gaming, cloud computing, and wonderful acquisitions for Github &amp; NPM and an array of other tools that can perform intensive software automation.\n\n [https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/) \n\n\\- **Costco - QUALITY CONSUMER GOODS**\n\nCostco has an excellent selection process that can be replicated across multiple cultures. The business pays their customers well which in turn results in supreme customer service and care.\n\n [https://futurefuel.io/employee-benefits/costco-careers/](https://futurefuel.io/employee-benefits/costco-careers/) \n\n\\- **Berkshire.B - QUALITY BUSINESSES**\n\nBerkshire.B is selected for similar reasons to Costco. I'm excited for Abel's leadership in the 21st century and they're simply an elegant long term investment with respects to quality business selection.\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/the-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/the-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio) \n\n\\- **XLB Materials ETF - PROCESS ENGINEERING**\n\nXLB has an excellent selection of dominant businesses with respects to their industry like Sherwin-Williams, Linde PLC, and Ecolab.\n\n [https://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xlb/holdings](https://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xlb/holdings) \n\n\\- **Tesla - FUTURE MANUFACTURING**\n\nTesla is interesting as it develops robust applications and development of EV batteries, battery solutions, industrial automation and is helmed by a person who is able to mine engineering resources and relationships from SpaceX.\n\n [https://electrek.co/2020/06/17/tesla-new-deal-panasonic-battery-supply/](https://electrek.co/2020/06/17/tesla-new-deal-panasonic-battery-supply/) \n\n\\- **AMD - COMPUTING ACCESSIBILITY**\n\nI feel that the name of the game for AMD is the ability to reduce energy costs and low the cost of computing. They have been excelling at this for years now and I believe this patience will pay off enormously as AMD conquers the maintenance of data centers around the world.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-of-why-cloudflare-chose-amd-epyc-for-gen-x-servers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-of-why-cloudflare-chose-amd-epyc-for-gen-x-servers/)",

        "selftext": "This economic data looks grim, there is no way Tesla can be valued over Toyota, I think to myself. This is the right move. I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 7/15 TSLA 1250p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.\n\nI come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only features in the room are what I assume to be a Model X and a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, TSLA 2000. P/E exceeding infinity.\n\nI hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell and Elon Musk step in front of me. I try to speak up but Powell cuts me off. \"What am I-\"\n\n\"Why did you short Tesla Motors?\" he asks.\n\n\"Huh?\" I respond, confused.\n\n\"Why did you short Tesla Motors?\" he demands, louder this time.\n\n\"I, uh... the market cap is higher than Ford, Toyota and GM combined.. It's not sustainable! It's-\" WHAM! One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.\n\n\"It's priced in,\" he says coolly. \"So why did you short Tesla?\"\n\nDizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. TSLA has climbed to 3000. Impossible, I think to myself. \"Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 50 percent and they can't sell that many cars!\" I manage to answer. WHAM! Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Trillions in investment grade bonds from Tesla. Loans to Liberty University. Loans to Goldman Sachs\n\n\"Repeat after me: Tesla only go up,\" Powell and Musk demand in unison.\n\nI say nothing. On the terminal behind him, TSLA has climbed well over 5000. An involuntary guh escapes my mouth as it falls agape.\n\nPowell frowns and continues, \"I'll ask you one more time: why did you short Tesla Motors?\"\n\nI feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, \"Tesla market cap can't exceed all automotive industries in the world! GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-\" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.\n\n\"Tesla only go up,\" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows TSLA has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 10000 in the dust, making new all time highs.\n\nThe first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.\n\n\"Tesla only go up,\" I say.\n\nShamelessly stolen from SA's Doomsday Economics thread. I mean, I made this.",

        "selftext": "Hi Folks!\n\nLong post but bear with me. I had a Motif Investing account which I opened in 2016. For those who don't know, Motif used to offer theme based investing (for instance Cloud Computing was a theme). I had a 4-5 themes and each theme had a bunch of stocks each.\n\nFast forward to this year, Motif sent me an email that they were being sold to Folio Investing and that they have a monthly fee of 19.99 per month. I used to pay a small fee on Motif for free stock advisories in different themes and free rebalancing. They also had free individual stock trading which I used instead of Robinhood. However, I decided the 20 dollar monthly fee was too much for my \\~40k portfolio in Motif. So I called Vanguard and had them initiate a rollover. I have most of the rest of my portfolio with them and very happy so far. It went well except, Vanguard doesn't do fractional shares that Motif did. So eventually Motif had to liquidate all the fractional shares before rolling over the account complete. I didn't mind that either coz I have a good chunk of Tax loss Harvesting done in March this year when shit hit the fan. \n\nNow my question is, what do I do with the individual stocks in my Vanguard account? Here are the companies I own - \n\nABB, ABBV, ABT, ADM, AFL, ALB. ALL, AMCR, AMD, AME, AMOT, AMZN, AOS, ATVI, BABA, BEN, BILI, BRKS, CGNX, CMCSA, CVX, DEO, DIS, EA, EMR, EVRI, EXPD, FTI, GLUU, GPC, HEI, HLX, IGT, IRBT, IRM, ISRG, JNJ, LEG, LMNX, MDT, MG, MITK, MSFT, NFLX, NICE, NTES, NUE, NVDA, OMCL, ON, PBCT, PH, PPG, RXN, SCPL, SE, SGMS, SNE, SOHU, T, TER, TJX, TM, TRV, TTWO, TXT, UBER, UL, V, VNE, WB, WBA, XOM, ZNGA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother piece of information - I am sitting on a gain on the total but there are certainly losers in there. I know it is a lot of information to parse through. But is there any advice on how to consolidate this? My investing philosophy has evolved and I have most of my money in low cost index funds now and would prefer to do that for this piece of my portfolio as well. Thanks for reading!\n\nTLDR: How do I consolidate a bunch of individual stocks into index funds?",

        "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.
