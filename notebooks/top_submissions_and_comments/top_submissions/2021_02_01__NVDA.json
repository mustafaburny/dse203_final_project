        "selftext": "For background, I'm 20. The markets have been very exciting lately. Huge gains have been made....but also huge losses. I am in the latter group. I saved money for most of my life, and started investing during 2020 after the pandemic hit. I didn't want to trade, I wanted to just get long term investments and hold them. And that did work out pretty well. I was down red at certain points, but it was never SERIOUS drops, and I was confident that my picks were good in the long run. I wouldn't go into details about the weighting, but my portfolio essentially contained AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, SQ, NKE, ARKK, PLTR, NVDA, WMT, COST, DIS, JNJ, PG, V, and a couple other small picks that were my \"fun\" stocks - I actually had a few dozen APHA shares at $6. I had heavy tech weighting, but I was confident in the long term prospects. \n\nBy this year, just about everything was in the green, and collectively up around 15%. Then came BB. BB looked appealing so I sold most of my stocks that had been moving sideways for a while (AMZN, MSFT, NVDA) and put the money into BB when it was low teens. Within a couple days, it hit the 20s and I sold for thousands in profit. The fact that I made thousands of dollars by doing nothing was crazy to me. The rest of my portfolio was also up several thousand dollars (overall, my profit was around $7000 at this point - a combination of the realized gains from BB and the unrealized gains from everything else). \n\nThen came GME. Several months ago, I neglected GME because I did not think they were a good long term investment, and so I did not buy them when they were less than $20/share. So when I saw the stock jump to 40, and 60 in the span of hours, I thought that was crazy. So what did I do? Naturally, I got FOMO when the stock was almost $400 and bought into the hype because I actually believed in what people over at another subreddit were saying. Within a week, my portfolio dropped around 80% (roughly $20,000). I thought that would be the best learning experience for me, but I bought into the weed hype this week, and have lost another few thousand dollars. All in all, I've lost 90% of my money in the past month. I'm young so I can recover, and this wasn't money I needed urgently. But my money I worked for and saved is completely gone because of my decisions. \n\nI'm writing this mostly for myself because I needed a reality check for myself and don't have anyone to talk to. I can't sleep at nights, and can't really focus on anything else. I've lost all interest in playing video games, and my grades are starting to take a hit. This is really embarrassing for me, and nobody knows I lost my money on stocks (nor do I want them to). I don't know if anyone needs to here this, but please be careful with your money, and don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Especially for young investors, we have such a long time horizon. There's no need to try and get rich quick. Conservative investing will compound over our lives.",

        "selftext": "Corona\\`s main economic impact is supply chain disruptions that are unprecedented. Before Covid supply chain was running smooth as a glove, think of it as a highway full of cars flowing at exact same speed and spaced equally. This supply chain was being perfected for over a decade. And then this shitstorm happened. The highway is clogged, ships are standing loaded with crap they cannot effectively unload quick enough, there aren\\`t enough ships to move products that are needed. Including basic materials for industries and intermediate components to make a final product.\n\nFor those who don\\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Spanning from AMD/NVDA CPUs and GPUs, to auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics. Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.\n\nThe main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead) \n\nThe perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)\n2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.\n3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . \n4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.\n\nTo recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID \n\nI have my retarded position 80x 150c mid June",

        "selftext": "###**Abbreviation Index:**\n\nBB -- Blackberry\n\nAWS -- Amazon Web Services\n\nIVY -- Intelligent Vehicles Yo. I don't actually know if this stands for anything\n\nQNX -- Quick-Unix perhaps? It's a Unix-like embedded microkernel RTOS (real-time operating system)\n\nEOY -- end of year\n\nPT -- price target\n\nSP -- stock price\n\nEV -- electric vehicle\n\nSoC -- System on a Chip\n\nIoT -- Internet of Things\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n**TL;DR:** Blackberry ($BB) is almost daily announcing new partnerships and new clients for their software, including new deals with companies that are just now or just this year launching autonomous vehicles that run on QNX software. The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY\n\n**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**FAQs:**\n\n**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**\n\n**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.\n\n**2) Should I invest now or later?**\n\n**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP\n\n**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**\n\n**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.\n\n**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**\n\n**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**Now for the details.**\n\nRead this for DD on BB's achievements, certifications, markets, QNX products, EV growth, Spark software and clients, BB Radar, software pricing, and BB challenges:\n\n[Comprehensive Guide about BB and how it shall take off in coming years](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lc67bo/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Full List of Clients and Partners:**\n\nBlackberry Clients and Partners\n\n**Automakers:** Honda, Audi, Jeep, Mitsubishi, Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Bentley, Lamboghini, Byton, Mini (cooper), Toyota, Subaru, Fiat Chrysler, Mazda, Nio, BMW, Porsche, Lexus, Kia, Land-Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Buick, Jaguar, Visteon, Skoda, Chevrolet, Nissan, Acura, Continental, General Motors, Baidu, Motional\n\n**Other:** Denso, Aptiv, Bosch, Panasonic, Harman, Bugatti, LG, Vodafone, Bell, Carahsoft, CACI, Telus, iSec, KPMG, Tableau, Qlik\n\n**Major:** Amazon, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, Li Auto, NVIDIA, Canoo, Microsoft, Intel, Verizon, Qualcomm, IBM, LG, Samsung\n\n**Major Investors:** PRIMECAP, Hamblin Watsa, Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension, Vanguard, Harris Associates, ETF Managers Group, Wells Capital, Arrowstreet Capital, Kahn Brothers Advisors, Norges Bank Investment\n\n**Governments:** Albania, Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Congo, Croatia, Czech Republic, DR Congo, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Gibraltar, Greece, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Macedonia, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, Marthinique, Mauritania, Mauritus, Mayotte, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, R\u00e9union, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Turkey, USA, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vatican City, Western Sahara, Zambia, Zimbabwe\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry Current Revenues:**\n\n[BlackBerry Revenues: How Does BlackBerry Make Money? -- Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/stock/bb/articles/472099/blackberry-revenues-how-does-blackberry-make-money/2019-09-17)\n\n--&gt; This display the biggest bearish argument to BB.

This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX\nmore commentary on this: [Analyzing Blackberry Bear Argument - Case No. 1: Ford Deal](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldcahf/analyzing_blackberry_bear_argument_case_no_1_ford/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n##**Pretty Charts**\n\n[The New BlackBerry Everyone is Talking About $BB](https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/t.bb/blackberry-limited?postid=32093887)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Facebook Settlement with BB**\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)\n\nThis is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents.

Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry New Partnerships**\n\nWithin the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.\n\n[A sum-up of all the recent news on $BB](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lhpztu/a_sumup_of_all_the_recent_news_on_bb/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**BB's Technical Page on QNX Security**\n\n[Link](http://support7.qnx.com/download/download/26406/QNX%20OS%20Security.pdf)\n\n--&gt; Very technical. But cool stuff.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Rumor: Blackberry Buyout? Here's why that's not happening:**\n\nJust read this post. It's quite revealing:\n\n[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)\n\n**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**\n\nAlright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)\n\nFor one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.\n\nAs for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)\n\nsee \"Is BlackBerry Stock Undervalued?\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\nsee \"Roadmap to $180 a share (BlackBerry Stock)\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**\n\nBlackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Really, no competitors?**\n\nWell it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Conclusion:**\n\nAll eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&amp;ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&amp;LangLocaleID=1033&amp;Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.\n\nInitially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n*This is not financial advice, just my own opinions.

        "selftext": "It seems like people are finally starting to realize that BlackBerry, in fact, **is NOT a meme stock.**\n\nYou might ask, why is that? Well, here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing (and have *already* developed):\n\n\\- Partnership with Amazon: On December 1st, [BB announced a multi-year agreement ](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform#:~:text=OverviewContact%20Us-,AWS%20and%20BlackBerry%20Join%20Forces%20to%20Accelerate,New%20Intelligent%20Vehicle%20Data%20Platform&amp;text=SEATTLE%2C%20WA%20and%20WATERLOO%2C%20ON,%2C%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.)with AWS, which is Amazon\u2019s cloud service business. The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.\n\n* Partnership with Baidu: On January 25, BB announced the [expansion](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX\u00ae Neutrino\u00ae Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.). The milestones build on the company\u2019s [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry-leading operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's \u2018Apollo\u2019 autonomous driving open platform.\n* BlackBerry QNX: BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real-time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi, BMW, Subaru, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota, and Honda. NVIDIA is even building its AI self-driving platform off of BlackBerry\u2019s QNX technology.\n* BlackBerry IVY: [In addition to the QNX](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/) Operating System, their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy, which is a cloud-based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles.\n* BlackBerry Spark: Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security, which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints. Through their UES, they plan on improving **cross-platform visibility, cyber threat prevention, and remediation,** while **simplifying administration.**\n\n**Okay, so why is this important?**\n\n1. BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 *million* vehicles.\n2. BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers (Audi, BMW, Ford, etc) view data and insights on their vehicles. This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle, even like a problem with the sensors, **the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update.**\n3. They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products. \\*\\*In the future, we could see a shift from hardware-driven vehicles to software-defined vehicles.\\*\\*\n4. Not only are they focusing on this, but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the **HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise** [**Unmanaged/BYO use case**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/09/blackberry-achieves-highest-score-in-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-unmanaged-byo-use-case)**.**\n\nGartner Research (who published the study) even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare, IBM, and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors. In fact, NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack. And the stock price is still $12.\n\n**The Sobering Part of this DD:**\n\nAfter taking a look at their balance sheet, I can agree with the skeptics that they\u2019re not raking in a ton of money right now, but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued, especially when compared to their competitors.\n\nI mean, based on this information ALONE, the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now. BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion, with its competitors like Palantir, a software company that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard other YouTubers talk about, hovering at 60 billion. And funny enough, Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity, just like BlackBerry. **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir, its stock price would be $110.**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nHere\u2019s what the skeptics don\u2019t realize though. They don\u2019t realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition, and that boomers probably still think it\u2019s a phone company. Well, it\u2019s not.\n\nWith their partnership with Amazon, Baidu, their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark, BlackBerry IVY, and their QNX operating system for vehicles, it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry\u2019s **future growth**.\n\nMaybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now, maybe then it\u2019ll be taken much more seriously. **But only, once people realize that it\u2019s not a meme stock.**",

        "selftext": "In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term\n\n\\~Very Long Post\\~ \\[Do NOT Read if you don't like comprehensive analysis\\]\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation.\n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also working with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with Xilinx , which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. Xilinx has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would create synergies. They are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they expect an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA.\n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach.\n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high demand the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax.\n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\n\nI think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, these are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.\n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology.\n\nThe company also has very good financials, with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once Intel also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all.\n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Lisa SU has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the company has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future\n\n2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.\n\nEven Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).\n\nTHE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).\n\nThis industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto\n\nu/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: \"Zombie cars and QNX\n\nQNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.\n\nBlackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.\n\nFast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?\n\nSONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.\n\nYou might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\"\n\n3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down. \n\nBB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\\_interest\\_in\\_bb\\_its\\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/) \n\nTLDR: hedge funds caught with their dicks in their hands are about to get Royally Fucked as the market corrects itself with a BB rise over the next month",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021.\n\n# **Stronger economic data could power stocks that thrive in a rebound in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stronger-economic-data-could-power-stocks-that-thrive-in-a-rebound-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound \u2013 financials, airlines and industrials \u2013 stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.\n*****\n&gt; Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.\n*****\n&gt; The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. \u201cIt is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; # Improving forecasts\n&gt; Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.\n*****\n&gt; The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u2033[Powell\u2019s] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He\u2019s going to be supportive of the administration\u2019s effort to get a big package through,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n*****\n&gt; # Key data during the week\n&gt; Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy\u2019s and TJX.\n*****\n&gt; Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday\n*****\n&gt; The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.\n*****\n&gt; He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that\u2019s going to go away sooner than we think,\u201d Keon said. \u201cRight now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That\u2019s also due to the fact we\u2019re likely to get a big stimulus package.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We\u2019re still bullish. We\u2019re still overweight stocks,\u201d Keon said.\n*****\n&gt; He said a flood of money could hit the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,\u201d Keon added. \u201cHouseholds now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see an incredible boom.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KHikwKA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qGZEgZB.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/E5ZhAnt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Y65lpFs.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EY3NC9X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wmMRYoi.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VasEMj8.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uOalt0h.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/SMspx2i.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RP7xVdo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Value Outperforming Growth But Only for Large Caps\n\n&gt; While the S&amp;P 500 traded lower today, value stocks had a strong finish to the week. Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-DVY.png))**\n\n&gt; Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n\n&gt; Value's outperformance today only applied to large caps, though. While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Industrial Metals Shining Bright\n\n&gt; While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals\u2014as proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index\u2014are up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-3.png))**\n\n&gt; Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains. As shown in the charts below, both year to date and over the past year, these three metals have risen the most with tin in the number one spot in both respects.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-2.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-4a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak\n\n&gt; \u201cBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.\u201d Old Wall Street saying.\n\n&gt; Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage \u201cstairs up, elevator down\u201d certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&amp;P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.\n\n&gt; The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&amp;P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn\u2019t looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?\n\n&gt; **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it\u2019s difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.\n\n&gt; **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in \u201cstay at home\u201d themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.19.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. \u201cIt\u2019s our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,\u201d noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cDrawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.\u201d If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year\u2019s volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.\n\n&gt; Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.\n\n&gt; Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December\u2014ordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales\u2014consumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau\u2014the most in seven months\u2014and greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.\n\n&gt; Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.\u201d\n\n&gt; Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January\u2019s retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn\u2019t receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.\n\n&gt; Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4\u20134.5% to 5\u20135.5%. Yesterday\u2019s retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target\u2014and may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.\n\n&gt; However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden\u2019s fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Tech Leading in New Highs\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&amp;P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&amp;P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH.png))**\n\n&gt; On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH-Tech.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead\n\n&gt; One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-TA.png))**\n\n&gt; We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&amp;P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-Small-vs-large-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness?\n\n&gt; Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.\n\n&gt; This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.\n\n&gt; We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e5f4b2427b7d5d4b28aae29e57eecf9b/74d4cbea052ab1c5-33/s500x750/45f747ae1ae952b17ebfa05517216899ec4f49ae.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jtxCols.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/b6PPTlQ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.22.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EcVeV4l.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iz5xLzt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  2.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4p4q8a9.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EgzN86P.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ODRTBoH.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3udXvVZ.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sMcEWeM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EHTrDMd.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bzVMSxO.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/79N1qSy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/WwOgLCj.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wZD3pAb.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FztoNlM.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MuAL2DJ.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gkCoskC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.26.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UCHvMLo.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.26.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/To6WCZh.png))\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NVIDIA Corp. $597.06\n**NVIDIA Corp.

        "selftext": "Every time I see another pump article on the \u201cnext Chinese Tesla\u201d because deliveries, I get triggered and have to put on chilled cow on spotify for 3 hours. Although entertaining, \u201cNIO is going to squeeze like GME, all aboard!\u201d comments on stocktwits is making my testicles feel like tiny furrowed cerebrums and not because it\u2019s cold AF outside.\n\nSo I had to put together some pleb research on TSLA, NIO, XPENG &amp; LI for you to scoff at. This is NOT financial advice, I just don\u2019t like these stocks.\n\n**1. Positions**\n\n[https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo](https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo) Yeah my lazy ass needs to switch off.\n\nA few more 2023s, I just went sniping randomly yesterday. Full disclosure, I also hold and sell CCs on my Tesla shares, so this play doubles as somewhat of a hedge for me. Sorry, not up to YOLO standards, I'm a lil biatch.\n\n**2. The Chosen Ones: NIO &amp; XPENG**\n\nDid you ever look at TSLA and think, god damn that shit is overpriced? Then look at the price to sales and realize, holy fuck it is? Then looked at it a month later and the price doubled? Well guess what, NIO and XPENG are trading even higher than TSLA.\n\nCurrent PS as of 2/10/2021\n\n\\- TSLA: \\~25\n\n\\- NIO: \\~40\n\n\\- XPENG: \\~41\n\n\\- LI: \\~19 (It\u2019s because their flagship SUV is hybrid electric +ICE, insane PS reserved for pure bloods only)\n\nLet\u2019s compare. These guys aren't coding the next Gran Turismo 8, but let\u2019s look at high margin tech anyways.\n\n\\- NFLX: \\~10\n\n\\- ABNB: \\~28\n\n\\- PLTR: \\~72 (peter pan stock)\n\nActual automotives, old, unsexy, fell from grace, like your grandma\u2019s teets\n\n\\- TM: \\~0.8\n\n\\- F: \\~0.4\n\n\\- VWAGY: \\~0.5\n\nI did some monkey spreadsheet math to forecast their updated TTM Revs after Q1. Don\u2019t ask me how I did that, the answer either won\u2019t impress you, or straight up glide over your smooth brain and I need you to focus on what\u2019s important right now.\n\nQ1 2021 PS if MC doesn\u2019t change\n\n\\- TSLA: \\~22\n\n\\- NIO: \\~29\n\n\\- XPENG: \\~26\n\n\\- LI: \\~14\n\nYep, still overvalued AF. Before we get into the nuts and butts, there is always the risk (lotto upside in our case) that macros choke and correct &gt;20% because of some black swan (I mean it\u2019s 2020s, Murphy has been trying to prove a point). When this happens, we know what gets hit hardest, the ones with the high forwarding looking, rosy multiples. These EV stocks will get beat up worse than that washed up highschool varsity prom king\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nSome other lotto events include China stocks being delisted, and who can forget the audit risk on those poorly cooked books, but enough to win the Great Chinese Bake Off.\n\nCan they grow Revenues though? Let's look.\n\n**3. Revenue Growth Stunted**\n\nYou might be one of those Stocktwats and you\u2019re thinking; \u201cbut but... they\u2019ll ramp deliveries exponentially and grow Revenues just like TSLA did back in 2018!\u201d \\*Smacks you in the face\\*, no they won\u2019t and here is why.\n\nChinese people love brand name shit. I repeat, Chinese people love brand name shit. Quantitatively, go look at LVMH sales in China. The figures on Chinese tourists going on vacation, spending without looking at the price tag (naw they definitely check for them deals) is incredible. They\u2019re not there to look at some antiquated tower (way better architecture back home), they tryin to get those furry Gucci Slips on discount (they are ugly AF btw). Tesla is no different, people worship Musk over there. You could probably sell his panties online, and some Chinese billionaire will pay millions for it, just like they did for his Gene Wilder house in LA. Qualitatively, I called my cousins in China, confirmed, he couldn\u2019t stop jizzing at the slight mention of Tesla.\n\nWhy does this matter? Owning a TSLA is like owning any other brand name shit in China, social status. Social status is EVERYTHING to much more of the population in China vs. RoW. The biggest difference is, you\u2019re not going to be able to buy a knock-off TSLA in some shady, cigarette smoking thug\u2019s closet on the 2nd floor of a Chinese dumpling street stand.\n\nTSLA just ramped the Model Y in China and started deliveries in Jan. [That shit sold out in a matter of days.](https://electrek.co/2021/01/06/tesla-sells-out-model-y-electric-suv-china/) If you\u2019re not buying one, you basically have to settle for an uglier wife (this is probably not much of an exaggeration). Well guess who has been selling mostly midsize SUVs without much competition from TSLA and achieving recording breaking deliveries up until now?\n\nNIO: 100% SUVs\n\nXpeng: 40% SUVs\n\nBrand aside, some triggered specs nerd out there is thinking \u201cWell, ultimately people will decide based on specs and value, not brand alone.\u201d Fine, let\u2019s take a look at what aspects of an EV people care about.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down apples to apples for these SUV EVs\n\nTesla Model Y- Price: \\~$52,800\n\n\\- Range: 594 km (Kilometers for the apes)\n\n\\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.1s\n\n\\- Charger network: 20,000+\n\nNIO EC6\n\n\\- Price: \\~$57,200\n\n\\- Range: 430 km (605 if you pay \\~$9k for a bigger battery)\n\n\\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.4s\n\n\\- Charger network: 290+\n\nXpeng G3 520\n\n\\- Price: \\~$30,580\n\n\\- Range: 520 km\n\n\\- 0-100km Acceleration: 8.6s\n\n\\- Charger network: 866+\n\nYou may be thinking the G3 520\u2019s price tag is looking pretty attractive. Then you imagine the future wife you\u2019ll be banging, yeah, trade up for that Tesla boi.\n\n\u201cBut JJ, NIO has battery swap tech! It\u2019s perfect for China\u2019s dense cities!\u201d If you know anything about product market fit, battery swapping for EVs is like trying to bang a gerbil's anus. First of all, battery swap stations are way more expensive to build, stock and maintain. Crazy upfront build out costs and battery requirements kill your rate of expansion (shit is important for demand). [Tesla superchargers are spreading like wildfire](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3120578/tesla-starts-v3-supercharger-production-new-shanghai-factory) and become recurring revenue generators over time, while battery swap stations stay cost centers over time, breakeven at best. That\u2019s why NIO tries to charge a $150 subscription fee, I\u2019d rather get pornhub subs for the whole family. Oh btw, you can\u2019t even do it yourself, you have to give it to a service technician to do the swapping for you. Be realistic, these wealthy, classist Chinese dirtbags (I\u2019m Chinese and know some first hand) don\u2019t want some lowlife service tech to sit on their mothball leather.\n\nBack to battery swapping and product market fit. Look, [Tesla tried this in 2013](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/tesla-shows-off-a-90-second-battery-swap-system-wants-it-at-supercharging-stations-by-years-end/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE0JxnRip8JKTQ9hYnvdEiU-EGgAt6RW47Mq0A7ZuzTcGFLVQKn_NUtf1M3CkQ2cr8dUxg3JtIp_G19l7z2s00l9g0WiGbkkMioZLCFNMr5D73kJ3LgwEAEXxNaD11mDTZCLIhfebIWvDzxCab8BRiANI1OHd1pocFU69FweZwNd), decided it was dumb, abandoned it and decided to make charging super fast and let you watch the actual Great British Bake Off while you wait. In 20 fuckin 13 some of you were still going through behavioral therapy and reading Robinhood as a picture book.\n\nLastly, the people buying EVs above the $50k range have easy access to charging, especially Tesla\u2019s network. So, battery swapping for cars above $50k is serving a niche market, a handicap, and a money losing operation.\n\n\u201cBut JJ\u2026 China EV Market Growth! They may have a smaller share right now, but the Pie grows for everyone!\u201d Maybe, but if you look at [the 2020 EV market growth](https://insideevs.com/news/481465/china-plugin-car-sales-december-2020/), most of that came from guess who? Tesla. Oh, and a $8k mini, pretty much a golf kart that Tyrian would be uncomfortable in.\n\nSolar &amp; batteries are money losing businesses right now for Tesla, but people are pricing in some of those rosy projections into the valuation. Nio and Xpeng haven't even hinted at the idea because people in China live in 3D printed skyscraper boxes. Home solar and battery doesn\u2019t make sense, but this also means no revenue opportunity.\n\nOh and let\u2019s not forget about autonomy\u2026 no, let\u2019s forget about it (for now).\n\nInternational expansion you say? Sure Nio and Xpeng trying to expand oversees to... Norway. No way has the population size of a small Indian wedding. Let's be honest here, would americans buy a \"made in china\" EV over a Tesla or even Ford/GM EV? I'm Chinese and I wouldn't even fuckin touch that shit.\n\nBack to Cars, to make matters worse for Chinese EV players, [Tesla has already designed a budget model](https://insideevs.com/news/486843/tesla-confirms-25k-car-sold-globally/). Unfortunately, it\u2019ll be hard, like wiping ass with sandpaper, for Xpeng and Nio is follow suite in this space because of... MARGINS. Let's look at this next.\n\n**4. Your margin is my opportunity - JB Retiree**\n\nHistory lesson; how did China become #2 in GDP globally? They industrialized their massive population, kept the RMB artificially deflated to undercut the world through exports. Sure, quality suffered, but everything was \"made in china\" at some point. This is all to say, you can always increase demand by reducing price, and you can optimally reduce price if you have better margins than your competitors (or have the cash to sustain a loss to not bleed out before they do).\n\nLet\u2019s look at the current state of margins.\n\nQ3 2020 Gross Margins\n\n\\- Tesla: 23.5%\n\n\\- Nio: 12.9%\n\n\\- Xpeng: 4.6%\n\n\\- Li Auto: 19.8%\n\nWe\u2019ll have to revisit Q4 margins when everyone reports in a few weeks. But wow, it\u2019s not even close for Nio and Xpeng. This is not even taking out Tesla\u2019s solar &amp; battery margins, which are negative, like when your mom finds out you YOLOed your college tuition on \\[redacted\\] at $400.\n\n\u201cBut JJ, that\u2019s not fair, Nio and Xpeng are still ramping!\u201d First of all, so is Tesla, just on a larger scale. I mean, they are building factories like Starbucks locations. But fine, just taking a peak at margins for Tesla in earlier \u201cramp\u201d years.\n\n2017: 18.9%\n\n2016: 22.8%\n\n2015: 22.8%\n\nThis may not look right, something must be wrong you\u2019re thinking. Well, let\u2019s we take a look under the hood, you won\u2019t find Trayvon Martin.\n\n\\- Battery is the main cost of an EV. Tesla has been working on battery tech from the beginning, they invented and are [retiring the \u201cskateboard\u201d design, saying it\u2019s obsolete](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-retires-skateboard-vs-structural-batteries/) because they got something better, while Chinese EV companies are busy copying it. Ay caramba!\n\n\\- For the batteries them selves, just look at battery output distribution. Both Nio and Xpeng rely on CATL for their batteries in China. But so does everyone else at an Indian wedding, including Tesla. Either everyone is going to be supply limited, or someone is going to have to pay more. You can pay more when you have better margins to work with/bleed cash. At least Tesla will have their own way out soon enough.\n\n[https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz](https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz)\n\nCan you find Nio, Xpeng or Li Waldo?\n\n\\- Tesla\u2019s electronics are industry leading, [Mario knows](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-sandy-munro-analyst-data-video/). Neo and Xpeng on the other hand outsources most of the Chips (Nvidia) and hardware (Mobile eye). When you outsource, you ultimately have less margin, control, speed and ability to freely synergize.\n\n\\- Tesla is also [literally stamping entire cars](https://electrek.co/2020/08/25/tesla-start-operations-worlds-largest-casting-machine/) like crispy cream donuts. It's almost if Chinese EVs are trying to take on Megatron\u2019s fuckin Fusion Cannon with blow darts. Nio on the other hand [abandoned plans to make their own factory](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18252244/nio-ev-startup-factory-shanghai-cancelled-jac-motors) due to cash shortage and [partnered with JAC](https://cntechpost.com/2020/12/05/how-does-nio-build-cars/). A short term plat that won't help margins in the long run.\n\n\\- You know how Tim Apple gets a hard on every time he talks about service margins, EVs have some of that too.\n\n\\- In car entertainment: Tesla is building an app store, while Nio and Xpeng outsources\n\n\\- EV Charging: Tesla has the biggest network, Nio has $ losing battery swap, while Xpeng relied on and pays government network\n\n\\- Connectivity: Startlink? \\*shrugs\\*\n\n\\- Autonomous driving: Tesla is rolling out subs for FSD, and I wouldn\u2019t trust Nio and Xpeng\u2019s software with your wife\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s life\n\n**5. Closing**\n\nLook, Nio is backed by Tencent and Bidu. Xpeng is backed by Ali. Their balance sheets pass the acid test with flying colors, so they can bleed cash for awhile. But Tesla has a meme lord at the helm. Let\u2019s not forget some of the giant local players like BYD, who is backed by Bigly Buffet himself. There is also SAIC, Great Wall, Geely, BAIC, Chang Jiang, Kandi, and dozens more names you don't know, just like the name of your cousin's mail in bride. Tesla copy cats are literally coming out of the woodworks, when buyers have a paradox of choice, the clear pick defaults back to the trusted brand, guess who?\n\nCCP has already been 3 steps ahead of Biden (I mean, who isn't, lol) and EV bullish years ago. Matter of fact, EV subsidies (which Nio and Xpeng survive off of like a bums on opioids in the streets of San Francisco) are already [getting cut by 20% in 2021, and phased out by 2022](https://fortune.com/2021/01/05/china-electric-vehicle-subsidies-sales-tesla/). I'll let you figure out what happens to deliveries when subsidies get cut, again comes back to magins and cash. If it comes down to EV price wars, I don't think it'll be Nio and Xpeng winning the bleed out. It'll be more like Matrix 3, rather than 1.\n\nI\u2019m no voodoo magic chart nerd, but Nio tested $65 resistance again yesterday and failed. Xpeng in general looks like it\u2019s peaked. Google search interest has spiked and all the little virgin armchair analysts on YouTube have pumped it 10 times over. I\u2019ll wait for their earning numbers in a few weeks to take the temperature again. I'll likely add more to the position then, will update.\n\nAt the end of the day, Nio and Xpeng may trade sideways for much longer than I can stay solvent, but fuck it, I\u2019ve spent too much time on this, so sunk cost is set in hard, change my mind.\n\nTL;DR Not sure when, but bet on EV bubble popping with Puts on Nio and Xpeng. Better to sit on the side lines for Tesla and Li Auto",

A chip company  growing revenue at 80% should be valued more like AMD or NVDA.\n\nFor some reason, I still associate Corsair with their peripherals such as mice and keyboards. They also do gaming chairs, ring lights, green screens, microphones, headphones... If you compare them to their peer Logitech (LOGI), Corsair is growing revenue at a faster rate, but has lower profit margins. I have all the aforementioned stockerinos, but I generally favor growth over profitability. \n\nThe YOLO trade in all of this is Friday 2/19 calls at $45 but the larger brain play is simply to go long or maybe 3/19 because the premium on most of these seems way too high for a lowly gorilla. \n\nAlso they make rainbow LEDs for \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b",

        "selftext": "#  Let's get some facts down\n\nIntel recently replaced its CEO with [Pat Gelsinger](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-appoints-tech-industry-leader-pat-gelsinger-as-new-ceo/). He worked at VMWare as their CEO and has worked at Intel when he was 18. Right now [Rocket lake](https://www.pcgamer.com/new-benchmarks-show-intel-rocket-lake-chips-leading-comet-lake-and-amd-zen-3-in-single-core/) is set to release soon. Based on the success of [Tiger lake](https://www.theverge.com/21440302/intel-tiger-lake-hands-on-tests-core-i7-1185g7-processor-release) this might put intel back into the game. They are also releasing [a GPU](https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-xe-hpg-tease-3dmark-mesh-shader/) soon. For more news like this, I would watch GamerNexus( Bot won't let me link it) who does really great reviews from the technical standpoint. They are planned to release 3nm and 5nm chips later this year or in 2022( They are just getting the contracts right now. No date yet). Also, they had an outstanding year despite losing their crown to $AMD back in Q4.\n\nJust on their own their looking to bounce right back up from the pandemic. They still have some grow room from a lower revenue year. I bet this stock could go to $90 or even to $100 with rocket lake, and that's a short term gain meaning tendies in time for summer. But what about the long term or market correction.\n\n# Data Analysis\n\n|CompanyMarket|Market cap|Dividends /share price|Q4 '20 revenue|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$INTC|250.07 billion|0.0213557676751335|20 billion|\n|$AMD|113.58 Billion|0.0154633678148662|3.24 billion|\n|$NVDA|370.44 Billion|0.0010694293591779|3.11 billion|\n\nAs someone who has been in the hardware space and is up to date on info Intel is underpriced compared to $AMD and $NVDA. What was holding intel back was the management and it changed. Intel is about to beat AMD and I would hop on the spaceship before it goes to the moon. so what is a reasonable price?\n\nif intel sock matches $AMD's Market Cap to revenue then its market cap would go to 700 billion. The positive press of the stock could bring it to 750 billion. But Intel's revenue is about to spike. President Joe Biden is planning to increase supply and if Intel can take advantage of that they can produce more chips where chips are out of stock. In 2020 GPU's sold out in a second leaving gamers without new gear. The 1050 ti, a failure when it came out, got rereleased and became one of the biggest successes this year. that's how desperate people are. [r/pcmasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/) was hit the hardest and many of them want the fastest gear. Intel could fill this void left by AMD and NVDA. if Intel can get enough stuff out then I could see a trillion-dollar market cap( with market correction, meaning that intel gets a fair price).\n\nI currently do not have a position in INTC right now, but I plan to do so as soon as my wife's boyfriend will let me.\n\n^(This is not LEGALLY financial advice. this was written by an ape with 6 brain cells.)",

        "selftext": "Hello again lazy slush brained degenerates. I'm putting rocket emojis just for you guys! I know you love them  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\nTLDR: There are a few short term catalysts that can propel this sleeper stock to the moon. Buy INTC on Tuesday, or wait till the end of the week and see if I am right and its at near 70$ and buy then. Or just wait till its already overvalued and spiked parabolically to enter as usual. \n\nYesterday I expressed (but not nearly enough) how Intel is like a beautiful meal. You got an appetizer yesterday with Mobileye and today I planned on giving you a dessert focused on Intel's AI/machine learning/neural network play but ill leave that for another day like I will with the main dish (Data). \n\nIll wait for the price to be more ripe (which it will in the coming weeks) to expose these valuable long term prospects for the legacy chipmaker. I think you will take my valuations more seriously when INTC is around 70$ per share. \n\nToday I want to look at possible catalysts for INTCs 2021 bull run.  \n\n1.) The most obvious is one that is already partially in play, and also partially responsible for INTCs 24% YTD returns. The changing of leadership at Intel. As you might know this Monday (markets closed) Pat Gelsinger officially takes over as CEO of Intel. Catalyst 1.1 was his appointment, catalyst 1.2 is him stepping in officially as CEO and his first announcements. When he stepped in for the earnings call last month he mentioned he had many ideas and thoughts that he would share publicly when he was officially in the role and had a chance to look through things more carefully (which he has been doing lately). There is guaranteed to be interesting chatter in the grapevines this coming week. If you believe Pat is one of the good ones this chatter is bound to be positive. Ill leave your uncreative brains to think of the myriad possibilites of the things Pat can say in the first few days/weeks that can tremendously impact the market price and corporate perception.  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\nSmall side note, the leadership change is not exclusive to Pat, there are several top silicon valley pros coming back at Pats request (some returning from retirement). INTC knows it has been hit and is rallying its troops. All hands on deck to get this shit rolling back to the top. These people don't fuck around and they bleed Intel. \n\n2.) Semiconductor shortage. As you may or may not know there is a relatively large chip shortage that is affecting many industries. GM for example had to shut down two of its plants recently, but this is not just affecting the auto industry, it is affecting dozens of different industries (some more than others). What does this mean for Intel? Well, Intel makes chips. They have the largest foundries in the world and there are at least a handful of ways a company like Intel can leverage this situation to their advantage.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n3.) This one is at least in part linked to the second point, but goes beyond that. Biden administration intervention in the US semiconductor industry. Last week the SIA (Semiconductor industry association sent a letter to President Biden calling for governmental support of the industry). Please read the one page letter, and your conclusion will be the same as mine. This rally call is exceptionally bullish for the industry. [https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf](https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf) It is especially bullish though for one of the signatories of the letter: Intel. Intel unlike AMD actually makes the chips and does not outsource the production to a foreign company (a Taiwanese company for that matter (risks associated with this I have discussed in another post)). Having an actual American fab is extremely big both short term and long term. This is a national asset and Intels future and well being is intertwined with Americas. Any Presidential administration will come to this conclusion. What does this mean? It is in the best interest of the United States for Intel to be bigger, richer and more dominant than TSMC and there are many ways American top brass can go about this.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\nExpect tax breaks and subsidies soon (that will asymmetrically impact Intel positively). In fact, as part of Covid relief packages you can expect executive action pretty here pretty soon.\n\n4.) Look at the power of memes and momentum over the last year. The market has been permanently tainted and so the unexpected can happen. Intel is one of the few profitable tech companies that has not shot parabolically (yet) although from a technical standpoint its starting to hint at that this year. Soon people especially retail will want a play that hasn't already been exhausted, that can still give them strong returns. I mean is it really appetizing to buy TSLA or even AMD after they have multiplied so much? There is a cognitive bias for a pre parabolic company with potential, and in a parabolic industry (semis). This bias may not be super rational but if price action continues to side with INTC it will be part of the reinforcement process for the potential parabolic play. You get this stock to be memetic and it flies.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n5.) Strong market correction. As you know many smart and stupid analysts have been predicting a crash since last March. They have all turned out to be wrong (so far). Last week though several bearish indicators started reappearing (from bearish insider transaction numbers, yield on the 10 year, and the bizarre VIX action). To be clear I do not think the market will crash anytime soon and I'm quite bullish on all sectors for the coming months (so long as the fed and white house play along(and they have no reason to not until inflation actually passes 2% or something crazy happens with commodities including that coin that cant be named)). \n\nIn any case in the event a crash happens INTC will be in a much better position than most. Speculation in the stock is low for now, large long term (boomer holders). The company has very little debt and is extremely cash rich. It can self fund all its operations for years and even lose revenues. Essentially Intel is an underleveraged company. AMD and NVIDIA for example are much more leveraged companies as is normal with rapidly growing tech companies. The reality is a market crash would damage the competition much more than it would INTC and it could even benefit Intel's market share. \n\nFurther if the correction is not a full blown panic it is quite possible that Intel may actually appreciate in price as the majority of the nasdaq depreciates (again due to risk perception and lack of leverage) Intel can easily be seen as a safehaven.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\nI get it, its not easy for you to part with your emotional investment in NVIDIA and AMD, besides they have treated you spectacularly especially the past year. You like their product and are angry at the fact INTC has been treating their retail customers poorly the last few years. You are sick of the machinations of the INTC leadership and their total focus on $$ losing track of the most important thing, product quality. \n\nDon't let the past cloud your judgment for future investment opportunities.  \n\nYou see Intel has its tentacles in everything that matters related to chips. They truly are Chipzilla as you will discover, in time.\n\nCome back to this post when Intel opens Tuesday up 2% and closes the week up 10% sniffing 70$ per share. \n\nI reiterate my position:\n\n1700 shares, 500 April 16 80$ strike calls, and 50 February 26 65$ strike calls.  \n\n **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**",

This is a real solid play with very limited downside, and unlimited upside.\n\nDD: I believe $INTC (Intel) will be the greatest value play in this year.\n\nKey points:\n\n* Extremely undervalued P/E ratio of only 12.37x\n* Industry competitors P/E ratio AMD: 40.88x\n* Industry competitor 2 P/E ratio NVDA:  79.67x\n* Fair evaluation of P/E means to match AMD's PE ratio INTC should be sitting around $200/share.\n* Although Intel has missed its progression on nm competition vs AMD and NVDA, Intel is entering the GPU market and also remains one of the largest market caps in the industry.\n* Biden recently formally requested a supply chain review to become more independent from Chinese suppliers for the semiconductor industry, which both AMD and NVDA heavily rely on, but INTC is producing everything in house.\n\nCurrent assessment of INTC is all bearish, which means you can get the stock at a heavy discount. INTC won't stay behind forever as nm tech progression isn't linear, it becomes harder and harder to progress to the next nm phase, and INTC owning its own supply chain is a significant industry advantage.\nAlthough AMD and NVDA is currently ahead in the nm processes, they do not own their own proprietary chips or processes, while INTC does. This puts INTC at a huge strategic advantage to boost up the US supply chain for chip supply, in the future for both CPU AND GPU. NOT just CPU. If INTC becomes fairly valued at industry PE ratios of their competitors of even just AMD, then fair value INTC stock price should hit near $200 per share levels. Currently INTC sits at around ~$60/share. Intel entering the GPU market will add significant value for the stock in addition to its strong internal supply chain in the US.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardsegal/2021/02/24/bidens-supply-chain-executive-order-should-remind-all-business-leaders-to-be-prepared-for-a-crisis/\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/biden-signs-executive-order-to-address-chip-shortage-through-a-supply-chain-review.html\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/giant-fund-bought-ev-stocks-nio-tesla-intel-sold-ge-51613755670\n\n\nPositions Disclosure:\nI currently hold 300 shares of $INTC and 4C $100 strike EXP 1/21/22\n\n\nDisclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

        "selftext": "This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or \"counterfeit\" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split('|');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':\n                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res['volume']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.\n\nIf everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value &gt; 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.\n\n**The Results**\n\n    Data for Jan 4\n    RMO    $10M   455173

        "selftext": "So I saw headlines about semiconductor demand far outpacing supply. There\u2019s also news of Intel finally giving up and no longer taking losses trying to make chips. \nCars have created an especially huge demand for semis and virtually every car now needs one. \n\nhttps://www.extremetech.com/extreme/319627-semiconductor-shortage-could-cost-automakers-61b-in-lost-sales\n\nhttps://www.google.ca/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN29T04V\n\nI came across TSM Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturers which had just over 50% market share. Their biggest customer is Apple. \n\nhttps://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionSEG2.php?code=TSM\n\nNow, I couldn\u2019t believe the numbers I saw for TSM. I figured every site was wrong because the following cannot possibly be true: \nMarket Cap- 571 billion\n2020 revenue - 1.4 Trillion (yes trillion). the revenue is up 30% from 2019 (yes during a pandemic). \nEarnings- 530billion.  \n\nThis means that they are trading at 1:1 P/E ratio. \n\nCompare that to AMD (106bil market cap - 2.5billion earnings - 38 P/E and NVDA 321marketcap - 2.8bil earnings - 140 P/E.\nIntel has market cap of $230bil - $20bil earnings - 11 p/E\n\nSo shouldn\u2019t TSM have a market cap of at least 5 trillion?? How is no one talking about the fact that their revenue during a pandemic is 1.4 trillion with profit margin of 40%??? \n\nI think there are some seriously sweet tendies to be made. The IV is pretty low and you can get 2022 calls with a 200 strike for $5. Or a 2023 call with 200strike for $12. \n\nSomeone please explain how this is possible and what I am missing. This is a no brainer. \n\nAlso, for the first time ever, TSM will be building a plant in the USA \n\nhttps://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2020/11/25/intels-ceo-just-asked-joe-biden-to-do-this/\n\nLastly, Biden has a phone call with TSM this Friday.\n\n\nEDIT: thank you for pointing out that my numbers were in TWN not USD.  I effed up.  Still a great company.",

INTC won't stay behind forever as nm tech progression isn't linear, it becomes harder and harder to progress to the next nm phase, and INTC owning its own supply chain is a significant industry advantage. Although AMD and NVDA is currently ahead in the nm processes, they do not own their own proprietary chips or processes, while INTC does. This puts INTC at a huge strategic advantage to boost up the US supply chain for chip supply, in the future for both CPU AND GPU. NOT just CPU. If INTC becomes fairly valued at industry PE ratios of their competitors of even just AMD, then fair value INTC stock price should hit near $200 per share levels. Currently INTC sits at around ~$60/share. Intel entering the GPU market will add significant value for the stock in addition to its strong internal supply chain in the US.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/biden-signs-executive-order-to-address-chip-shortage-through-a-supply-chain-review.html\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/giant-fund-bought-ev-stocks-nio-tesla-intel-sold-ge-51613755670\n\nPositions Disclosure: I currently hold 300 shares of $INTC and 4C $100 strike EXP 1/21/22\n\nDisclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

        "selftext": "It\u2019s been a crazy past week+ into today with rising yields and stocks that were on breakout tracks for new highs pulling back.\n\nSo what do you do when all hope seems lost?\n\nIdk, I\u2019m not a financial advisor, but what I did was double down.\n\nAfter experiencing a net loss this year of over $30k with GME, AMC, TSLA, AI, and more, I\u2019m more determined than ever to ignore the pullback while my options bleed in delta and time decay and instead just buy more and hold.\n\nThis brings me to NVDA. NVDA is the undisputed king of semiconductors (although some AMD fans try to dispute) with a market cap of $355B and a P/E ratio of 93.83. That P/E ratio is arguably high even for a bull market but let\u2019s be clear, not even 1 week ago NVDA reached a new ATH $614.90 blowing past its previous one of $582ish in this most recent breakout run.\n\nSo what has changed from last week to today? Absolutely very little except a massive increase in fear due to a slight 10yr treasury yield increase from 1.25%ish to 1.36%ish. \n\nA treasury yield increase is actually good as it indicates sentiment from bond holders that the economy will grow faster than expected. Inflation of 1% - 3% is even healthy for large tech companies such as NVDA as they can increase the price higher than the increasing cost resulting in greater earnings, especially in high profit margin areas with its Mellanox acquisition. \n\nFor the fundamentalists in the room that don\u2019t buy stocks because they like the company nor believe in their long-term values, high P/E ratio is justified in believing the E (earnings) will grow higher in the coming year. Chip shortage (indicating growing demand) is expected to continue for another year, https://www.marketwatch.com/story/worldwide-chip-shortage-expected-to-last-into-next-year-and-thats-good-news-for-semiconductor-stocks-11614020156, which will massively increase that earnings potential and the data center will continue to grow with growth from last quarter 162% YoY - https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/nvidias-rapid-data-center-growth-is-here-to-stay/. \n\nInflation increases the cost of debt but NVDA doesn\u2019t need debt and has been cash positive for a while. It\u2019s debt-to-assets ratio has been decreasing YoY (short of 2020 because of COVID and growth expenses) and it\u2019s on track for record breaking results this earnings report on Wed.\n\n \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 A growing economy is good for profitable companies like NVDA and even if this price is a premium, it\u2019s worth it because NVDA delivers the goods. Even Wall Street agrees with analysts raising PTs to $700. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nNote: I\u2019m long NVDA because you would be crazy not to be.\n\nWarren Buffet said, \u201c... be greedy when others are fearful\u201d and now there is a lot of fear with TSLA and large tech stocks and high valuations. Now is the time to double down in this bullish market because here is the best news, on Wed 2/24, our buddy, Powell, is gonna buy a ton more 10yr bonds driving the price up and yields back down. https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/treasury-securities/treasury-securities-operational-details#current-schedule. And in a few weeks from then, he\u2019s gonna do it again, and then again and again and again. Yield rises will be capped at an upper limit because of $80b/mo coming into them. The Fed has made it very clear that it has no intention of reducing that for years+ as it will allow inflation  to rise beyond 2% to average 2% across a multi-year period. The government wants inflation to rise because it wants to wane away its debt and so there will be Yellen support to keep the money press printing longer than people think. \n\nIn conclusion, patience is key \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc = \ud83e\udd11\n\nI\u2019m not a financial advisor, buy/sell at own risk.",

        "selftext": "So I think we can all agree that the chip shortage will be great for all the Semiconductor companies (AMD, NVDA, ON, TSM) but I think TSM is the most solid play out of all of them. Why? They have longterm growth and uptrends and they basically control the majority of semiconductor manufacturing, which AMD and NVDA rely on to make their products. For example, they control 70% of the automobile chip industry while it makes up only 3% of their revenue (Wallstreet Journal). Crazy right? Also, TSM has a lower P/E ratio than AMD and NVDA, which makes it a better valued play than the other companies in general. With its low IV, its partnerships with companies like apple (VR chips), its soon to be chip factory in Arizona, and the fact that so many companies outsource to TSM, I think calls are a safe mid term play on TSM.

        "selftext": "AI is poised to keep growing, with GPUs and other hardware used in AI becoming stronger, and with the eventual arrival of Quantum computers, we should see a great boom in AI in the next decade. What are your investment plans to profit out of this industry? \n\nI see a few different ways to capitalize on this:\n\nInvesting in companies that provide hardware for AI: Here I'm most referring to AMD and NVIDIA, their GPUs have become very useful for training AI models and are heavily used all across the industry. They are also not just dependent on AI but gaming as well since their GPUs are used for that as well. [This](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ARK%E2%80%93Invest_BigIdeas_2021.pdf?hsCtaTracking=4e1a031b-7ed7-4fb2-929c-072267eda5fc%7Cee55057a-bc7b-441e-8b96-452ec1efe34c) should be a good read. Cathie woods is expecting a huge rise in the deep learning / AI Chips market which should definitely benefit these industries. Even at AMD/Nvidia's current levels I think they have room to grow.\n\nInvesting in core AI applications company: I'm taking about companies like [C3.AI](https://C3.AI), PLTR (I am very bulling on PLTR) and other companies that provide AI/data analysis based solutions. These have heavy exposure to just AI and are sort of high risk high reward plays, even in the long term.\n\nInvesting in big corps that have exposure to AI: Good old MSFT, GOOG and other similar companies. This should keep your money comparatively safer while also giving you think opportunity to capitalize on AI boom.\n\nWhat are your plays? Your plans, specific companies you are interested in?",

        "selftext": "It\u2019s only a matter of time before it is discovered by more and more people. Do your own research and you will know. But here are some key points which made me think seriously about ACEV Achronix merger . The whole SPAC market is filled with companies with absurd financials and negative growth but this one stood out for its potential \n\n1. Achronix is the Only independent FPGA and eFPGA maker. FPGA falls under the category of data accelerators such as GPUs but it\u2019s faster, flexible  and more power efficient than GPUs\nTheir target market is high growth AI apps, cloud computing, 5G and automotive driver assistance \nand the crypto industry\n\n2. There are only 2 other main players\nAlterra was acquired by Intel few years ago, and Xilinx was acquired by AMD , that leaves Achronix as the only independent FPGA maker. This is important as it could also become a prime candidate for acquisition by Nvidia ( just a thought) \n\n3. Their latest product speedster 7 is geared more towards AI/ML AND data acceleration\nThis is crucial If you look at Ark big ideas 2021, They have mentioned Compounded annual growth rate ( CAGR) of 17% for deep learning. The Arm big ideas also talk about Data center reinvention where majority of the processor change is driven by data accelerators  ( GPUs and FPGA likes ) which again grows at 21% CAGR. \n\nAchronix has a huge dependency on Intel for their previous generation product but also gives them a committed revenue for next year and the dependency is projected to go down to 23-26% by 2023 . Their latest product speedster 7 has secured offers from atleast 6 customers and many more are in pipeline \n\nOn the merger - \n\nhttps://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix_Ace_Merger_Presentation_VF.pdf\n\n79% gross margin for 2020 with CAGR of 20-25% in coming years\n\nThey have a non cancellable order of 160mn next year with 1.1 billion in identified opportunities in next year driven by speedster product \n\nMerger is estimated at about 2.1 bn approx 12 times their sales compared that with AMD Xilinx merger ( done at 30 times sales )\n\nACEV team - are industry veterans. They grew netlogic for  3.7 bn $ by Broadcom and TDK invensense acquisition of 1.3 bn \n\nOne of the founding members Dr. Sunny Siu has deep ties with the academia. These are the guys who are part of the cutting edge research and have a passion for entrepreneurship - these are the people who I see as capable enough to change the world. Among his many academic accomplishments, he was the founding director of MIT auto ID ( pioneer of IOT research) at MIT. They have been around semis and am sure they know what they are doing not some rich guy trying to acquire some random company\n\nhttp://acev.io/investor-info/board-of-directors/default.aspx",

        "selftext": "TLDR: INTC options are much cheaper and have a higher ROI than competitors options. Intel is having a stronger price action of late relative to competitors and IV in INTC should be higher than is currently priced. \n\nLast week I exposed my view that Intel is an undervalued company and a very attractive short/medium/long term investment. In the interest of brevity I will not reiterate those points (go to my profile if you wish to read my thesis). \n\nToday I simply want to point out a somewhat hidden but obvious attribute of INTC's short term option play.  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nINTC options 65$ strike expiring February 26th (1 week of gametime) are the move. The main reason for the 65$ strike is that the volume and open interest is high so transacting these contracts is easy and the  ask/bid gap is very small (in this case .37/.36) **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast price for this option contract was at .36$ \\* (100) = 36$ per option contract\n\nAs of market close and after hours INTC shares are trading at 63.06$  or 3.08% way from being in the money. Given the current hype in the semiconductor industry (justified and for more than one reason), and given Intel's market performance of late in combination with the several catalysts, (which I outlined in my previous post) I find \"beating\" this option contract a more than 50% probability. \n\nTo illustrate the absolute value of INTC relative to its competitors I will take a target price of 67$ by Friday (2$ in the money) and my current position of 50 contracts. \n\nFor every dollar above 65$ my contracts are worth 5k$ so at 67$ they would be worth 10k$. Assuming Monday you are able to buy at its last sold price of 36$ per option contract it would cost you 36\\*50= 1800$. The ROI for this hypothetical play would be 555% (10,000/1,800) . To reach 67$ from the current price it would require a 6.24% increase in INTC stock price. \n\nReiterating, 3.08% up to be in the money and 6.24% up for ROI of 555%.\n\nNow I would like to show you the price/return potential for other companies in the space. \n\nFan favorite AMD closed trading at 89.48$ per share. Applying the same parameters to AMD a 3.08% increase in AMDs stock next week would bring it to 92.25$. Options for 92$ closed last price at 78$ per contract and options at 92.5 at 63$, average them both to get a fair value for what an option price at 92.25$ would be and it comes to 70$ per option contract. This makes AMD weekly options 94.4% more expensive than INTCs. To get 50 of these it would cost you 3500$ and to finalize the comparison an increase of 6.24% would bring AMD to 95$. Assuming you could get the hypothetical 92.25$ contracts you would have 13750$ and an ROI of 393%. **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSparing you from going through the same process with the other examples I will just summarize (feel free to check and correct my math). \n\nMicron: 3.08% upward move contracts &lt; 90$ (they would be more expensive I am using 95 strike but its actually lower 94.4 to be precise) with an ROI at a 6.24% upwards move of 244%.\n\nTSM: 3.08% upward move contracts last price would be at around 83$ (volume and open interest is lower so last price is more divergent than ask/bid and would likely be higher than 83$) with an ROI at a 6.24% move of 518%. Also looks attractive but the ask/bid gap is quite high and low volume/open interest.\n\nI wont even do the example for NVDA because implied volatility is so high for these ranges the ROI example would be really low. Other semiconductor companies have the problem of having low volume as well, but I am sure there are others out there and you may even finda better deal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow before you call me stupid I understand the reason why the INTC contracts are much cheaper than these other. The IV (Implied volatility is lower).  The premiums are lower because the contract writers don't expect as big of swings in INTC as they do others. My thesis is though that the market makers for these contracts are incorrectly modeling the IV of INTC stock lower than it should be. Much the same way they were with Micron a couple weeks ago.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis week INTC closed up 1.6%, Micron was up 1.95%, AMD down 4.8%, and TSM down 3.6%. This week as we know most of the markets had a small correction. As I had expected INTC outperformed its competition as well as the broad markets. The week before this one  INTC closed up 4% and YTD INTC is up 26.2%. \n\nGiven the combination of factors surrounding the semiconductor scene and Intel specifically, I find that the implied upward volatility on INTC should be higher, and that in not too long it will increase as it has done the past few weeks (although still very low). The main reason why INTC contracts are so cheap relative to competitors in the industry is a simple question of supply and demand. These more memetic and loved stocks options are more sought after by retail and on top of the \"real\" volatility premium another demand heavy premium accrues. Intel being hated in this sub for example has kept option premiums much lower than they would be if it was a fan favorite. \n\nSimilar things happen in sports betting. A favorite with a lot of demand will often move the lines beyond the house spread and sometimes produce an edge for an underdog. Intel is the underdog of this story, and an underdog with very high expected value. You might hate Intel but this could still be the play for you (so long as you believe the semiconductor scene is bound to profit these weeks). \n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks are not favorites to win the championship this year (odds at +750). They probably wont win the championship and I don't see much value in that bet at the moment, but if someone was selling me Bucks futures at +5000 Id snag them up. This is the analogy I will use for the current Intel option market. \n\nI am a degenerate. There is no shame in coming out as one in this sub, a family of autistic degenerates from all over the world. I like to gamble and so do you, but more than gamble I like to make money. I like to win and I do win. \n\nI have 50, 65$ INTC contracts expiring the coming Friday, 500 contracts at 80$ strike for April 16 , as well as 1700 shares long. I believe in this play in the short term and long term. \n\nFor the short term, a long shot bet, but not nearly as much as the option writers have them. \n\nThis is deep fucking value.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**",

        "selftext": "###**Abbreviation Index:**\n\nBB -- Blackberry\n\nAWS -- Amazon Web Services\n\nIVY -- Intelligent Vehicles Yo. I don't actually know if this stands for anything\n\nQNX -- Quick-Unix perhaps? It's a Unix-like embedded microkernel RTOS (real-time operating system)\n\nEOY -- end of year\n\nPT -- price target\n\nSP -- stock price\n\nEV -- electric vehicle\n\nSoC -- System on a Chip\n\nIoT -- Internet of Things\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n**TL;DR:** Blackberry ($BB) is almost daily announcing new partnerships and new clients for their software, including new deals with companies that are just now or just this year launching autonomous vehicles that run on QNX software. The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY\n\n**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**FAQs:**\n\n**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**\n\n**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.\n\n**2) Should I invest now or later?**\n\n**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP\n\n**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**\n\n**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.\n\n**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**\n\n**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**Now for the details.**\n\nRead this for DD on BB's achievements, certifications, markets, QNX products, EV growth, Spark software and clients, BB Radar, software pricing, and BB challenges:\n\n[Comprehensive Guide about BB and how it shall take off in coming years](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lc67bo/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Full List of Clients and Partners:**\n\nBlackberry Clients and Partners\n\n**Automakers:** Honda, Audi, Jeep, Mitsubishi, Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Bentley, Lamboghini, Byton, Mini (cooper), Toyota, Subaru, Fiat Chrysler, Mazda, Nio, BMW, Porsche, Lexus, Kia, Land-Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Buick, Jaguar, Visteon, Skoda, Chevrolet, Nissan, Acura, Continental, General Motors, Baidu, Motional\n\n**Other:** Denso, Aptiv, Bosch, Panasonic, Harman, Bugatti, LG, Vodafone, Bell, Carahsoft, CACI, Telus, iSec, KPMG, Tableau, Qlik\n\n**Major:** Amazon, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, Li Auto, NVIDIA, Canoo, Microsoft, Intel, Verizon, Qualcomm, IBM, LG, Samsung\n\n**Major Investors:** PRIMECAP, Hamblin Watsa, Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension, Vanguard, Harris Associates, ETF Managers Group, Wells Capital, Arrowstreet Capital, Kahn Brothers Advisors, Norges Bank Investment\n\n**Governments:** Albania, Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Congo, Croatia, Czech Republic, DR Congo, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Gibraltar, Greece, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Macedonia, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, Marthinique, Mauritania, Mauritus, Mayotte, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, R\u00e9union, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Turkey, USA, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vatican City, Western Sahara, Zambia, Zimbabwe\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry Current Revenues:**\n\n[BlackBerry Revenues: How Does BlackBerry Make Money? -- Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/stock/bb/articles/472099/blackberry-revenues-how-does-blackberry-make-money/2019-09-17)\n\n--&gt; This display the biggest bearish argument to BB.

This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX\nmore commentary on this: [Analyzing Blackberry Bear Argument - Case No. 1: Ford Deal](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldcahf/analyzing_blackberry_bear_argument_case_no_1_ford/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n##**Pretty Charts**\n\n[The New BlackBerry Everyone is Talking About $BB](https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/t.bb/blackberry-limited?postid=32093887)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Facebook Settlement with BB**\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)\n\nThis is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents. They settled in February, and the day that the settlement was finalized, John Chen (BB CEO) tweeted reminding everyone that BB is used on the ISS\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JohnChen/status/1358853064153784321?s=20\n\nWell, the connection and speculation here is that Blackberry is going to the moon, and that the settlement is rather significant. Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry New Partnerships**\n\nWithin the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.\n\n[A sum-up of all the recent news on $BB](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lhpztu/a_sumup_of_all_the_recent_news_on_bb/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**BB's Technical Page on QNX Security**\n\n[Link](http://support7.qnx.com/download/download/26406/QNX%20OS%20Security.pdf)\n\n--&gt; Very technical. But cool stuff.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Rumor: Blackberry Buyout? Here's why that's not happening:**\n\nJust read this post. It's quite revealing:\n\n[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)\n\n**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**\n\nAlright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)\n\nFor one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.\n\nAs for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)\n\nsee \"Is BlackBerry Stock Undervalued?\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\nsee \"Roadmap to $180 a share (BlackBerry Stock)\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**\n\nBlackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Really, no competitors?**\n\nWell it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Conclusion:**\n\nAll eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&amp;ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&amp;LangLocaleID=1033&amp;Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.\n\nInitially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n*This is not financial advice, just my own opinions.

        "selftext": "Greetings, apes. Today I humbly offer my opinions - and they are opinions, not financial advice - on four predominantly UK-based stocks I firmly believe will make fat bank by the end of the year or earlier. I\u2019ll break down each stock individually and my reasoning, as well as a potential risks section at the end.\n\nThe stonks, pt.1: Mitchells and Butlers.\n\nMitchells and Butlers is one of the largest pub chains in the UK. Chances are, if it\u2019s not a wetherspoons or an independent, it\u2019s a M&amp;B joint in one way or another. With a wide variety of brands under its name, M&amp;B enjoys a massive market share of UK booze outlets. Last year saw pubs get utterly decimated, and accordingly, M&amp;B\u2019s stock price crashed hard, but with reopening dates now announced by the government, sentiment towards the pub industry will likely rise, as will M&amp;B profits, as thirsty patrons flock back to their favourite watering holes. The trend will likely only continue to rise, as restrictions are lifted, and more people rush to enjoy cheap steaks and watered down pepsi in summer. In the short term, the value of the stock may go down, but I expect that by the end of May, firm profits will start flowing in, and the stock price will only go up, until it reaches a plateau in about September-October, as the novelty begins to wear off.\u00a0\n\nThe stonks, pt.2: Restaurant group.\n\nLike Mitchells and Butlers, Restaurant Group owns a significant portion of the mid-to-high class restaurants across the UK, with numerous brands under its umbrella. While Restaurant Group has enjoyed a better recovery over the worst of the pandemic, owing to delivery services, Restaurant Group stock price is still well below its all time high, and the consistent price for the last few non-fucked years. Assuming a rapid increase in stock price upon reopening in late May to July, Restaurant Group could see anywhere from a 120% to 300% increase in value. Theoretically, Restaurant Group has the same plateau, but I anticipate that the stock price will level off at a higher value after the spike than M&amp;B.\n\nThe stonks, pt.3: AMD.\n\nAt approximately $85 a share right now, AMD is around the highest it\u2019s been for years. The last few days have seen a contraction in price, but AMD is all but guaranteed to bounce back in November/December time. With the release of the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, AMD silicon is in more homes than ever before, and orders from Sony and Microsoft are only going to keep coming in. However, 2021 also sees the pending release of Ryzen 6xxx processors, as well as a brand new socket platform, DDR5 RAM, and the potential release of RDNA 3-based graphics processors. Given previous company performance, the new Ryzen processors are likely to offer a reasonable increase in performance, as well as a host of new features inherent to a new platform. This will make the systems attractive to both home enthusiasts and laptop/desktop manufacturers looking to put fresh new chips in their computers. Assuming RDNA 3 releases this year, gains could also be boosted by what is likely to be a series of graphics cards that can soundly outperform Nvidia\u2019s current offerings in traditional rendering, and has the potential to be the top dog until Nvidia releases 4xxx series. Even assuming a worst case scenario, where their new processors and GPUs are beaten this year, improvements in market share and product performance over last gen will likely still bring about an increase in value, or at least break even.\n\nBut that\u2019s small fry. Because all the above is just a squirt of precum compared to the hot, thick, recoil-inducing money shot that is stonk number 4.\n\nThe stonks, pt.4: Rolls Motherfucking Royce.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cDon\u2019t they make fancy cars? Who\u2019s buying those?\u201d Nobody, my dear ape, but you know what else they make? Jet engines. Rolls-Royce has approximately 36,000 engines in service with airlines around the world, and guess where those engines are right now? In hangars, missing their scheduled maintenance. With air travel being pretty much dead right now, a huge amount of aircraft are now squirreled away, awaiting reactivation. While it\u2019s true that a lot of airlines went bust over the crisis, the planes and engines will be kept around and should eventually be brought back into service, while the airlines that survived will have to un-mothball their fleets EN MASSE. With a year of sitting around, the spike in repairs and maintenance to Rolls-Royce will be huge, and after that, a steady rise in air travel in the central and western Europe region will soon get the stock price right where it was before the pandemic. Travel between the USA and Europe, and places like Japan and Australia, who have handled the pandemic relatively well, will also help to get air travel back up. Not only that, but Rolls-Royce carries the patented \u201cliterally can\u2019t go tits up\u201d guarantee, courtesy of Boris Johnson, who gets an erection just thinking about starting a colony, and who will absolutely bail out Rolls-Royce in the event they go tits up. Moreover, with a programme for \u201cSmall Modular Reactors,\u201d Rolls-Royce are in a prime position to enter the Nuclear power industry, adding further value to their long term profits. \u201cThat\u2019s all well and good, but then, what about other areas in aviation?\u201d I hear you say, you surprisingly handsome monkey. Well, Airbus and Boeing are both recovering from their slumps, but with recent news, Boeing stock is likely to go into freefall for a while, and Airbus stock is on its way back up to normal. Rolls-Royce\u2019s biggest competitor, GE, has their stock chart look like a fucking line. But not Rolls-Royce. Rolls Royce\u2019s stock price right now is only just beginning to recover. Rolls Royce stock prices looked like the trajectory of a Javelin missile in the pandemic, and have only today risen above $100 a share. In comparison, their normal stock price rides around $700, to a peak just shy of $1100. That\u2019s up to an 11 times return on investment, folks.\n\nRisks: the less publicised of the aircraft failures yesterday could have been a Rolls-Royce engine, though the lack of a stock price fall today suggests otherwise. Nonetheless, it is possible that a catastrophic accident could happen, wiping out Rolls-Royce stock price overnight, and severely delaying a recovery. Restaurant Group and M&amp;B both rely on the public running out in droves to enjoy food and drink. While I believe this is all but certain, it is possible that a given percentage of UK patrons no longer wish to go out and have become so accustomed to having their food delivered that they are unlikely to visit these establishments in future. Finally, while I believe AMD\u2019s future is bright, the current shortage of manufacturing is likely to hurt their stock price, and may dampen future product releases, if it continues into the end of the year and next year. Nonetheless, I believe AMD is going from strength to strength, and will only gain value in the long run. Or until they make another bulldozer.\n\nIn conclusion: While I\u2019m not an expert and this isn\u2019t financial advice, I have firm belief in the value of these stocks. While I don\u2019t have the capital to go ham on these, I will be purchasing a Rolls-Royce share as soon as I can, and will be following its progress with great interest. The other stocks also represent a firm investment, albeit ones with less potential to go to orbit. Options on any of these would likely also bring profit to potential buyers, if you can\u2019t buy a share yourself, or wish to use calls and puts to potentially make even more money.\n\nThat\u2019s all, apes. Remember to wash those diamond hands, and also, buy a GME if you can.",

        "selftext": "American Based semi conductors are primed to explode in growth over the next few years.\n\n**There is a semiconductor shortage:**\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)  \n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-how-the-great-chip-shortage-happened-and-how-it-gets-solved-11613505761](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-how-the-great-chip-shortage-happened-and-how-it-gets-solved-11613505761)  \n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/chip-shortage-spirals-beyond-cars-to-phones-and-game-consoles](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/chip-shortage-spirals-beyond-cars-to-phones-and-game-consoles)  \n[https://ihsmarkit.com/Info/0221/semiconductor-shortage.html](https://ihsmarkit.com/Info/0221/semiconductor-shortage.html)  \netc...literally googling this will give you hundreds of articles explaining this.\n\n**What do semiconductors do?**\n\n[https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/diode.htm](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/diode.htm)  \nL2Read -   \nIn short, they are used in chips to make electronics work.\n\nDemand for electronics is at an all time high.  EVs, phones, laptops, gaming consoles, fridges, thermostats, doorbells, toasters - i dont know - everything.  \n\n\"The Semiconductor Industry Association [said in December](https://www.semiconductors.org/global-semiconductor-sales-increase-6-percent-year-to-year-in-october-annual-sales-projected-to-increase-5-1-percent-in-2020/) that global chip sales would grow 8.4% in 2021 from 2020\u2032s total of $433 billion. That\u2019s up from 5.1% growth between 2019 and 2020\"\n\nThat was before Biden's announcement that he will be [signing an executive order to address the chip shortage.](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order) Looking primarily at US companies.\n\nBiden recently announced that he is fearful of China's control of the semiconductor market [And that he will look at US companies for military functions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/biden-to-order-supply-chain-review-to-assess-us-reliance-on-overseas-semiconductors.html).\n\n[https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/07/30/why-semiconductor-chip-making-based-u-s-critical/5536083002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/07/30/why-semiconductor-chip-making-based-u-s-critical/5536083002/)\n\n**Why $ON?**\n\nThey make a large array of different components that fit throughout the electronic market.  Unlike AMD or INTC or CRSR - $ON produces components for automotive, personal, medical, cloud, and aerospace and defense.\n\nAll of these are important - but the last bit is an important focus.  Because again - Biden is scared of China, and wants to move to become more independent of their chip makers.  \"The White House plans to review gaps in domestic manufacturing and supply chains that are dominated by or run through \u201cnations that are or are likely to become unfriendly or unstable.\"\n\nChina's biggest semi conductor company TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.) currently sits with a market cap of $588.98B. $ON is at $16.70B.  TSMC's hegemony over the semiconductor market is hardly surprising, considering that it makes silicon for industry bigwigs such as Apple, Nvidia, and AMD and soon to be INTEL as well.\n\nWell - that was the case - until biden steps in and starts giving incentives to use US semi's and gives companies like $ON $$$$ to expand production capabilities.   Thats a lot of potential clients and revenue.\n\nLONG - this company will do very well.\n\nSHORT TERM - it will see steady growth.  Although - I believe this company will explode as soon as any real steps are taken under biden's initiative.  \n\nDisclaimer \n\nI'm in for 50k April 16calls at 41strike\n\nI am an idiot, and all this is BS that I think sounds great! So if you think so too, we might get along.",

It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/\"boomer\" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.\n\n**Key:**\n\n* Penny stocks are very risky.\n* Pharma companies are very risky.\n* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.\n* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.\n* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).\n* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.\n* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.\n* Take the \"Calls\" as very discounted, and \"Potentially A Call\" as somewhat discounted.\n* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.\n* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.\n* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**At Close of Thursday**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Batch 1:**\n\n* BA\tBoeing Co\t216.45\n* UAL\tUnited Airlines Holdings Inc\t51.78\n* ADBE\tAdobe Inc\t459.16\n* ANSS\tANSYS, Inc.\t338.46\n* ADSK\tAutodesk, Inc.\t284.03\n* PAYC\tPaycom Software Inc\t368.31\n* CRM\t[salesforce.com](https://salesforce.com), inc.\t231.08\n* SNPS\tSynopsys, Inc.\t244.09\n* TSLA\tTesla Inc\t682.22\n* FBHS\tFortune Brands Home &amp; Security Inc\t83.48\n* BBY\tBest Buy Co Inc\t102.94\n* PYPL\tPaypal Holdings Inc\t253.94\n* CTAS\tCintas Corporation\t328.05\n* CPRT\tCopart, Inc.\t106.92\n* HSIC\tHenry Schein, Inc.\t61.89\n* RMD\tResMed Inc.\t194.98\n* WELL\tWelltower Inc\t70.28\n* DHI\tD.

        "selftext": "Hey there. So, i'm looking for some advice guys or guidelines on the direction of where to look. I'm quite new to investing, my first shares being bought in january 2020 (it was apple) and we all know what happened starting january/february . In no time, the portfolio was something like -60% :)). I knew very few things but i knew not to panic sell and just ride with it, and it turned out to be a great decision. Now, since then, i've constantly made small purchases every know and then (regardless of how the market was doing) and here is how my portfolio is divided (i started investing knowing that i don't need this money in the near future, so i wanna do mostly, if not all, just buy and hold for as long as i can, big/stable companies. I don't wanna try to time the market or day trade (not that i even know how that works lol) ). Here it is:\n\n**23%** \\- Nvidia    **22%** \\- Apple     **14%** \\- Google     **9.2%** \\- Mastercard     **6.7%** \\- Amazon     **6.6%** \\- Microsoft     **6.4%** \\- NextEra Energy     **4.7%** \\- Tesla     **4.4%** \\- Visa     **3.5%** \\- Boeing\n\nHad pretty good returns on everything so far (best ones on Nvidia and Apple) so although these days were rough, everything it's still in green so i'm pretty happy with that, BUT, i see everything now as a good opportunity to buy at \"sale prices\". But rather than buying more of the stocks i have, i feel like i wanna use this opportunity to diversify the portfolio a little bit (i feel like it's too much towards the tech; by all means correct me if it's not the case here). I kept looking at Coca Cola and Disney (i see this keep going up especially in the coming years, in the idea of everything coming back to normal) for some time now, but i don't know if i should get them or not. Now my question is: If YOU would have this portfolio, what would you buy to diversify it (i don't know, maybe more towards health-care, more consumer , etc) . ANY advice is more than welcome, as i said, i'm pretty new to this, although i think i know a thing or two. Thank you in advance and enjoy the sale i guess :)",

        "selftext": "This is not financial advice. This is my first DD so please leave feedback. \n\n\nI believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. \n\nFollowing their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.\n\n\nQcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&amp;D.\n\n\nAll sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? I\u2019ve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. \n\n It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so you\u2019d expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)\n\n\n\n\nProbably some bad DD. Not financial advice. Please tell me how to improve.",

        "selftext": "I've been seeing some well-written posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/li0rpg/blackberry_a_dormant_giant/) one and [this as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lfuoe9/bb_is_not_a_phone_company_heres_some_dd/), as I'm sure you have as well. It seems like people are finally starting to realize that BlackBerry, in fact, **is NOT a meme stock.**\n\nYou might ask, why is that? Well, here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing (and have *already* developed):\n\n\\- Partnership with Amazon: On December 1st, [BB announced a multi-year agreement ](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform#:~:text=OverviewContact%20Us-,AWS%20and%20BlackBerry%20Join%20Forces%20to%20Accelerate,New%20Intelligent%20Vehicle%20Data%20Platform&amp;text=SEATTLE%2C%20WA%20and%20WATERLOO%2C%20ON,%2C%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.)with AWS, which is Amazon\u2019s cloud service business. The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.\n\n* Partnership with Baidu: On January 25, BB announced the [expansion](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX\u00ae Neutrino\u00ae Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.). The milestones build on the company\u2019s [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry-leading operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's \u2018Apollo\u2019 autonomous driving open platform.\n* BlackBerry QNX: BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real-time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi, BMW, Subaru, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota, and Honda. NVIDIA is even building its AI self-driving platform off of BlackBerry\u2019s QNX technology.\n* BlackBerry IVY: [In addition to the QNX](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/) Operating System, their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy, which is a cloud-based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles.\n* BlackBerry Spark: Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security, which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints. Through their UES, they plan on improving **cross-platform visibility, cyber threat prevention, and remediation,** while **simplifying administration.**\n\n**Okay, so why is this important?**\n\n1. BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 *million* vehicles.\n2. BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers (Audi, BMW, Ford, etc) view data and insights on their vehicles. This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle, even like a problem with the sensors, **the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update.**\n3. They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products. \\*\\*In the future, we could see a shift from hardware-driven vehicles to software-defined vehicles.\\*\\*\n4. Not only are they focusing on this, but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the **HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise** [**Unmanaged/BYO use case**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/09/blackberry-achieves-highest-score-in-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-unmanaged-byo-use-case)**.**\n\nGartner Research (who published the study) even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare, IBM, and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors. In fact, NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack. And the stock price is still $12.\n\n**The Sobering Part of this DD:**\n\nAfter taking a look at their balance sheet, I can agree with the skeptics that they\u2019re not raking in a ton of money right now, but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued, especially when compared to their competitors.\n\nI mean, based on this information ALONE, the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now. BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion, with its competitors like Palantir, a software company that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard other YouTubers talk about, hovering at 60 billion. And funny enough, Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity, just like BlackBerry. **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir, its stock price would be $110.**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nHere\u2019s what the skeptics don\u2019t realize though. They don\u2019t realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition, and that boomers probably still think it\u2019s a phone company. Well, it\u2019s not.\n\nWith their partnership with Amazon, Baidu, their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark, BlackBerry IVY, and their QNX operating system for vehicles, it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry\u2019s **future growth**.\n\nMaybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now, maybe then it\u2019ll be taken much more seriously. **But only, once people realize that it\u2019s not a meme stock.**",

        "selftext": "# $ON - ON Semiconductor\n\nFirst time posting DD - please do provide constructive feedback on what other areas you would have looked into / found useful and overall formatting. Additionally, if you have arrived at different conclusions / can poke holes in the theory I look forward to reading rebuttals in the comments.\n\nAll currency in USD and Millions unless otherwise specified. Please read the disclaimer at the bottom of the post.\n\n### TL; DR - Why I'm Long $ON.\n\nON Semiconductor Corporation, manufactures and sells semiconductor components for various electronic devices worldwide (see below for a detailed breakdown of products / services).\n\n- The **semiconductor industry** as a whole is expected to **increase by 8.4%** in 2021^(1). Personally, I think it will continue throughout 2021 and possibly into H1 2022 as macroeconomic should continue to improve and pent-up demand is released.\n\n- ON has historically struggled and maintained **lower revenue growth and profit margins** over FY19, FY20 Q1 and Q2 both historically and especially when compared with its peers.\n\n- FY20 Q3 and Q4 have shown a significant turnaround which have allowed it to exceed average quarterly revenue growth for FY19. This is in part due to macroeconomic recovery.\n\n- They have recently brought on a **new CEO and CFO** to turnaround their business. The new CEO has **experience growing both revenues and margins** at Cypress Semiconductors. He was also a moving force behind the **merger** of Infineon Technologies and Cypress which could point out the eventual direction of the organisation.\n\n- A primary reason for the **lower margins** are the use of several global semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) which increase the overall cost of goods. The organisation is in the process of **building a new fab** (in Fishkill, NY) and releasing multiple fabs (e.g., Belgium, Japan). The use of Fishkill should significantly **improve margins** and bring it more in-line with competitors.\n\n- A key source of revenue (**~30%**^(2)) has been the **automotive sector**. As vehicle electrification (conversion of non-electrical vehicle systems) and the focus on the development of electric cars increases over the next few years the amount of $ON products within vehicles is likely to increase. As a result, **revenue will increase** from this sector. This area is likely to also be higher margin.\n\n- Additionally, $ON products find their ways into **vehicle charging** and **battery technology** which is also a growing area. Global drive for **power efficiency** will also increase in the face of the \"Green Deal\" and increasing global drive for **CO2 reduction**.\n\n- The business currently has the **free cash flow** and **shareholder backing** necessary to re-focus their business away from low-margin and revenue declining products to focus on **high growth and high-margin** areas. While this does depend on management execution at the present time, I see no reason why given historical track records of the new leadership they would be unable to deliver on this promise.\n\n- Current P/E remains high (~69^(nice)x) however **forward P/E at 23x** is a lot more attractive particularly with the view presented above.\n\nPlease do have a read of the Bear / Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced view and an idea of drawbacks / considerations.\n\n### Key Data\n\nAll data believed to be accurate as of 08/02/2021\n\n1. Share Price: $39.81\n\n2. Market Cap: 15.787 B\n\n3. Next Earnings: 31-03-2021\n\n4. Analyst Day - 05-08-2021 (This is a day where they will talk about overall strategy and financial targets).\n\n# Detailed Analysis\n\n### Organisation Summary\n\nManufactures and sells semiconductor components focussed on 3 main segments:\n\n1. Power Solutions Group \u2013 Target markets are industrial, and power focussed.\n\n2.  Advanced Solutions Group \u2013 Target markets are industrial including automotive (this is a growing market segment and includes electric vehicles^(3) and autonomous capability^(4)), consumer including personal electronics e.g. laptops etc. (this is a slowly growing and relatively stable market segment barring unforeseen macroeconomic issues^(5)), computing (cloud power management - growing particularly due to remote working requirements and increasing cloud focus from organisations^(6)) and industrial communications (IoT \u2013 growing area^(7)), medical (medical imaging \u2013 stable, clinical point of care e.g. quick diagnosis / testing \u2013 most likely growing, patient monitoring \u2013 growing, portable medical devices \u2013 growing^(8)) and aerospace / defence (stable, commercial aerospace most likely shrinking to a degree^(9), space related chips \u2013 possibly growing longer term?). Also provides custom design / fabrication (probably small market segment / overall revenue contributor).\n\n3. Intelligent Sensing Group - Image sensors, proximity sensors etc. across similar markets to ASG. Again, expected to grow both from an industry perspective but also from a product perspective^(1).\n\n### Bull Considerations\n\n- The Fishkill fab at maximum capacity is expected to allow for the generation of **2 B in revenues**. The current timeframes expectations are that this capacity can be reached by **2023**.\n\n- The ramping of Fishkill is a few months ahead of schedule and the organisation is actively seeking to **sell two fabs** in Belgium and Japan which should make available some cash.\n\n- Continued growth expected in higher margin product areas incl. automotive, communications (e.g., 5g), medical etc. (See Organisation Summary for details).\n\n- ON may prove to be a **viable merger / acquisition target** - M&amp;A isn't an area I'm too sure on how to research so this may be way off base.\n\n- Weiss Asset Management **increased holdings** by 4.3% (as a portion of portfolio) around the last half year / year to 5.2% could signal bullish institutional sentiment.\n\n- Relatively high level of cash flow will mean they are likely to be able to maintain the interest payments of ~140 / year. Additionally, their assets more than cover their liabilities.\n\n- Good growth in both EPS ($0.38 and $0.21 in Q3 and Q4 FY20 respectively - Q3 was higher due to income tax return) and free cash flow (101.8 and 283.9 for Q3 and Q4 FY20) on a quarterly basis over the last year.\n\n### Bear Considerations\n\n- For FY19 the largest 5 customers across each business unit (PSG, ASG, ISG) comprise 41%, 35% and 48% of revenues respectively. This means a loss in even one of the largest customers would have material downwards impact on revenue. 10 of the largest customers represent 27% of total group revenue.\n\n- Increases in prices of raw materials e.g., gold, copper, silicon etc. would cause significant negative impact to profit margins.\n\n- While not fully cyclical in nature they are expecting fluctuations in results from quarter to quarter over the next year. While I don't expect the dips to be significant especially when compared with '20Q1 and '20Q2, or FY19 this could still put a damper on my price expectations.\n\n- Any significant dips in revenues and free cash flows would impact ability to repay loans, this could impact ability to repay loans.\n\n### Neutral Considerations\n\n- Moody\u2019s gives $ON a credit rating of **Ba1** which is sub-prime i.e., reasonable credit risk / risk of default but speculative in nature so could have upside^(9).\n\n- The new Head of Intelligent Sensing Group has significant experience in automotive products (incl. at Nvidia) which could indicate additional product focus on the autonomous driving side.\n\n- No insiders have been purchased shares since 2016 and have been selling since then. However, one thing to note is that organisation executives / leadership are typically long-standing employees, and this is presumably not atypical behaviour.\n\n- If the demand drops again then ON face underutilisation charges for their facilities and machinery which would reduce gross margin.\n\n- Failure to execute on streamlining business would result in large capital expenditures on new / re-focussed product areas without the required return.\n\n- Weak track record on M&amp;A activity with acquisitions to date being sub-optimal and not really synergising with current offerings or opening significant new markets. If this continues would negatively affect price and waste free cash flow.\n\n### Resources Used\n\n1. [Industry Report](https://www.wsts.org/76/Recent-News-Release)\n\n2.

        "selftext": "Every time I see another pump article on the \u201cnext Chinese Tesla\u201d because deliveries, I get triggered and have to put on chilled cow on spotify for 3 hours. Although entertaining, \u201cNIO is going to squeeze like GME, all aboard!\u201d comments on stocktwits is making my testicles feel like tiny furrowed cerebrums and not because it\u2019s cold AF outside.\n\nSo I had to put together some pleb research on TSLA, NIO, XPENG &amp; LI for you to scoff at. This is NOT financial advice, I just don\u2019t like these stocks.\n\n**1. Positions**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img kurgz1t5dyg61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few more 2023s, I just went sniping randomly today. Full disclosure, I also hold and sell CCs on my Tesla shares, so this play doubles as somewhat of a hedge for me. Sorry, not up to YOLO standards, I'm a lil biatch.\n\n**2. The Chosen Ones: NIO &amp; XPENG**\n\nDid you ever look at TSLA and think, god damn that shit is overpriced? Then look at the price to sales and realize, holy fuck it is? Then looked at it a month later and the price doubled? Well guess what, NIO and XPENG are trading even higher than TSLA.\n\nCurrent PS as of 2/10/2021\n\n\\- TSLA: \\~25\n\n\\- NIO: \\~40\n\n\\- XPENG: \\~41\n\n\\- LI: \\~19 (It\u2019s because their flagship SUV is hybrid electric +ICE, insane PS reserved for pure bloods only)\n\nLet\u2019s compare. These guys aren't coding the next Gran Turismo 8, but let\u2019s look at high margin tech anyways.\n\n* NFLX: \\~10\n* ABNB: \\~28\n* PLTR: \\~72 (peter pan stock)\n\nActual automotives, old, unsexy, fell from grace, like your grandma\u2019s teets\n\n\\- TM: \\~0.8\n\n\\- F: \\~0.4\n\n\\- VWAGY: \\~0.5\n\nI did some monkey spreadsheet math to forecast their updated TTM Revs after Q1. Don\u2019t ask me how I did that, the answer either won\u2019t impress you, or straight up glide over your smooth brain and I need you to focus on what\u2019s important right now.\n\nQ1 2021 PS if MC doesn\u2019t change\n\n\\- TSLA: \\~22\n\n\\- NIO: \\~29\n\n\\- XPENG: \\~26\n\n\\- LI: \\~14\n\nYep, still overvalued AF. Before we get into the nuts and butts, there is always the risk (lotto upside in our case) that macros choke and correct &gt;20% because of some black swan (I mean it\u2019s 2020s, Murphy has been trying to prove a point). When this happens, we know what gets hit hardest, the ones with the high forwarding looking, rosy multiples. These EV stocks will get beat up worse than that washed up highschool varsity prom king\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nSome other lotto events include China stocks being delisted, and who can forget the audit risk on those poorly cooked books, but enough to win the Great Chinese Bake Off.\n\nCan they grow Revenues though? Let's look.\n\n**3. Revenue Growth Stunted**\n\nYou might be one of those Stocktwats and you\u2019re thinking; \u201cbut but... they\u2019ll ramp deliveries exponentially and grow Revenues just like TSLA did back in 2018!\u201d \\*Smacks you in the face\\*, no they won\u2019t and here is why.\n\nChinese people love brand name shit. I repeat, Chinese people love brand name shit. Quantitatively, go look at LVMH sales in China. The figures on Chinese tourists going on vacation, spending without looking at the price tag (naw they definitely check for them deals) is incredible. They\u2019re not there to look at some antiquated tower (way better architecture back home), they tryin to get those furry Gucci Slips on discount (they are ugly AF btw). Tesla is no different, people worship Musk over there. You could probably sell his panties online, and some Chinese billionaire will pay millions for it, just like they did for his Gene Wilder house in LA. Qualitatively, I called my cousins in China, confirmed, he couldn\u2019t stop jizzing at the slight mention of Tesla.\n\nWhy does this matter? Owning a TSLA is like owning any other brand name shit in China, social status. Social status is EVERYTHING to much more of the population in China vs. RoW. The biggest difference is, you\u2019re not going to be able to buy a knock-off TSLA in some shady, cigarette smoking thug\u2019s closet on the 2nd floor of a Chinese dumpling street stand.\n\nTSLA just ramped the Model Y in China and started deliveries in Jan. [That shit sold out in a matter of days.](https://electrek.co/2021/01/06/tesla-sells-out-model-y-electric-suv-china/) If you\u2019re not buying one, you basically have to settle for an uglier wife (this is probably not much of an exaggeration). Well guess who has been selling mostly midsize SUVs without much competition from TSLA and achieving recording breaking deliveries up until now?\n\nNIO: 100% SUVs\n\nXpeng: 40% SUVs\n\nBrand aside, some triggered specs nerd out there is thinking \u201cWell, ultimately people will decide based on specs and value, not brand alone.\u201d Fine, let\u2019s take a look at what aspects of an EV people care about.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down apples to apples for these SUV EVsTesla Model Y- Price: \\~$52,800\n\n\\- Range: 594 km (Kilometers for the apes)\n\n\\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.1s\n\n\\- Charger network: 20,000+\n\nNIO EC6\n\n\\- Price: \\~$57,200\n\n\\- Range: 430 km (605 if you pay \\~$9k for a bigger battery)\n\n\\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.4s\n\n\\- Charger network: 290+\n\nXpeng G3 520\n\n\\- Price: \\~$30,580\n\n\\- Range: 520 km\n\n\\- 0-100km Acceleration: 8.6s\n\n\\- Charger network: 866+\n\nYou may be thinking the G3 520\u2019s price tag is looking pretty attractive. Then you imagine the future wife you\u2019ll be banging, yeah, trade up for that Tesla boi.\n\n\u201cBut JJ, NIO has battery swap tech! It\u2019s perfect for China\u2019s dense cities!\u201d If you know anything about product market fit, battery swapping for EVs is like trying to bang a gerbil's anus. First of all, battery swap stations are way more expensive to build, stock and maintain. Crazy upfront build out costs and battery requirements kill your rate of expansion (shit is important for demand). [Tesla superchargers are spreading like wildfire](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3120578/tesla-starts-v3-supercharger-production-new-shanghai-factory) and become recurring revenue generators over time, while battery swap stations stay cost centers over time, breakeven at best. That\u2019s why NIO tries to charge a $150 subscription fee, I\u2019d rather get pornhub subs for the whole family. Oh btw, you can\u2019t even do it yourself, you have to give it to a service technician to do the swapping for you. Be realistic, these wealthy, classist Chinese dirtbags (I\u2019m Chinese and know some first hand) don\u2019t want some lowlife service tech to sit on their mothball leather.\n\nBack to battery swapping and product market fit. Look, [Tesla tried this in 2013](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/tesla-shows-off-a-90-second-battery-swap-system-wants-it-at-supercharging-stations-by-years-end/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE0JxnRip8JKTQ9hYnvdEiU-EGgAt6RW47Mq0A7ZuzTcGFLVQKn_NUtf1M3CkQ2cr8dUxg3JtIp_G19l7z2s00l9g0WiGbkkMioZLCFNMr5D73kJ3LgwEAEXxNaD11mDTZCLIhfebIWvDzxCab8BRiANI1OHd1pocFU69FweZwNd), decided it was dumb, abandoned it and decided to make charging super fast and let you watch the actual Great British Bake Off while you wait. In 20 fuckin 13 some of you were still reading Robinhood as a picture book.\n\nLastly, the people buying EVs above the $50k range have easy access to charging, especially Tesla\u2019s network. So, battery swapping for cars above $50k is serving a niche market, a handicap, and a money losing operation.\n\n\u201cBut JJ\u2026 China EV Market Growth! They may have a smaller share right now, but the Pie grows for everyone!\u201d Maybe, but if you look at [the 2020 EV market growth](https://insideevs.com/news/481465/china-plugin-car-sales-december-2020/), most of that came from guess who? Tesla. Oh, and a $8k mini, pretty much a golf kart that Tyrian would be uncomfortable in.\n\nSolar &amp; batteries are money losing businesses right now for Tesla, but people are pricing in some of those rosy projections into the valuation. Nio and Xpeng haven't even hinted at the idea because people in China live in 3D printed skyscraper boxes. Home solar and battery doesn\u2019t make sense, but this also means no revenue opportunity.Oh and let\u2019s not forget about autonomy\u2026 no, let\u2019s forget about it (for now).\n\nInternational expansion you say? Sure Nio and Xpeng trying to expand oversees to... Norway. No way has the population size of a small Indian wedding. Let's be honest here, would americans buy a [\"made in china\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rILKm-DC06A) EV over a Tesla or even Ford/GM EV? I'm Chinese and I wouldn't even fuckin touch that shit.\n\nBack to Cars, to make matters worse for Chinese EV players, [Tesla has already designed a budget model](https://insideevs.com/news/486843/tesla-confirms-25k-car-sold-globally/). Unfortunately, it\u2019ll be hard, like wiping ass with sandpaper, for Xpeng and Nio is follow suite in this space because of... MARGINS. Let's look at this next.\n\n**4. Your margin is my opportunity - JB Retiree**\n\nHistory lesson; how did China become #2 in GDP globally? They industrialized their massive population, kept the RMB artificially deflated to undercut the world through exports. Sure, quality suffered, but everything was [\u201cmade in china\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rILKm-DC06A) at some point. This is all to say, you can always increase demand by reducing price, and you can optimally reduce price if you have better margins than your competitors (or have the cash to sustain a loss to not bleed out before they do).\n\nLet\u2019s look at the current state of margins.\n\nQ3 2020 Gross Margins\n\n\\- Tesla: 23.5%\n\n\\- Nio: 12.9%\n\n\\- Xpeng: 4.6%\n\n\\- Li Auto: 19.8%\n\nWe\u2019ll have to revisit Q4 margins when everyone reports in a few weeks. But wow, it\u2019s not even close for Nio and Xpeng. This is not even taking out Tesla\u2019s solar &amp; battery margins, which are negative, like when your mom finds out you YOLOed your college tuition on \\[redacted\\] at $400.\n\n\u201cBut JJ, that\u2019s not fair, Nio and Xpeng are still ramping!\u201d First of all, so is Tesla, just on a larger scale. I mean, they are building factories like Starbucks locations. But fine, just taking a peak at margins for Tesla in earlier \u201cramp\u201d years.\n\n2017: 18.9%\n\n2016: 22.8%\n\n2015: 22.8%\n\nThis may not look right, something must be wrong you\u2019re thinking. Well, let\u2019s we take a look under the hood, you won\u2019t find Trayvon Martin.\n\n\\- Battery is the main cost of an EV. Tesla has been working on battery tech from the beginning, they invented and are [retiring the \u201cskateboard\u201d design, saying it\u2019s obsolete](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-retires-skateboard-vs-structural-batteries/) because they got something better, while Chinese EV companies are busy copying it. Ay caramba!\n\n\\- For the batteries them selves, just look at battery output distribution. Both Nio and Xpeng rely on CATL for their batteries in China. But so does everyone else at an Indian wedding, including Tesla. Either everyone is going to be supply limited, or someone is going to have to pay more. You can pay more when you have better margins to work with/bleed cash. At least Tesla will have their own way out soon enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 72et2w9ddyg61...*\n\n\\- Tesla\u2019s electronics are industry leading, [Mario knows](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-sandy-munro-analyst-data-video/). Neo and Xpeng on the other hand outsources most of the Chips (Nvidia) and hardware (Mobile eye). When you outsource, you ultimately have less margin, control, speed and ability to freely synergize.\n\n\\- Tesla is also [literally stamping entire cars](https://electrek.co/2020/08/25/tesla-start-operations-worlds-largest-casting-machine/) like crispy cream donuts.

        "selftext": "Swear to god if the automod removes this... \n\nAlright listen up retards. NVDA is going to print at earnings. \n\n#Retard Analysis\nOver the last three quarters, Nvidia EPS growth averaged 81%. They have earnings on the 24th, probably going to do well. CHRISTMAS could have some helpful effect as more people get into PC gaming. Especially with the shortage of PS5 and Xbox X that could have pushed some over the edge to switch. Regardless it would be a minor, but still positive impact. \n\n#Expanding Business \nLooking at Q3 2020 reports we can see some great news in expanding their business. Saw revenue and sales up 57%, a new record for them. \n\n* \"Launched the NVIDIA\u00ae EGX Intelligent Edge Computing Platform to bring accelerated AI to retail, manufacturing, telecommunications, logistics and other industries, with Walmart, BMW, NTT East, Procter &amp; Gamble and Samsung Electronics among early adopters\". \n \n* USPS is going to use their AI tech to improve packaging process. \n\n* Loads of updates to software and companies adding RTX support showing they are becoming a standard in the industry. \n\n* The push forward on AI with self driving that is surely to increase going forward long term. \n\n* Their data center division revenue passed their gaming division and we all know data is the gold mine *PRPL autist PTSD*. Data center sales increased 162%.\n\n#Red Hat\nBut the item im most interested in is the Red Hat collab they are starting. They are trying to get more involved with 5G telecom market by making virtualized 5G RAN networks using their GPUs. Retardedly put, they want to simplify how current telecom traffic works and make it more harmonized: to bring down maintenance and management costs; increase flexibility; allow multiple vendors to work on the same hardware and share resources. Further, Red Hat is going to become a major player in the cloud services industry. Azure and AWS just don't have the same capabilities as Red Hat's open source infrastructure and having a good relationship with NVDA looks great for future projects.   \n\n#Semiconductor shortage easing\nThe world is coming off the end of a semiconductor shortage that was showing some recovery before COVID. Likely there will be no shortage going further into this year, maybe even early as Q2. Many of the car manufactures have been feeling the effects of the semi conductor shortage, even having to shut down factories temporarily before the situation improves. Bodes well for NVDA, supply is constricted and the pent up demand will blow its metaphorical load heavily at NVDA and other semis. \n\n#Bear case\nThe only hiccup: ARM merger deal is running into problems from anti-trust complaints by competitors. Likely to not happen when China reviews it and says no. The merger would make ARM US based and have the same US restrictions on exporting tech to Huawei or other blacklisted companies. Same thing happened with Qualcomm and N_X_P (automod removing small cap tickers) semiconductors. But on the off chance it does go through from both 1) The US taking a different stance towards China and 2) NVDA convincing regulators that ARM would still have impartiality for how it does business, the upside is massive. Not too concerned with it not happening since NVDA will adapt and move on. Its more of a bonus to NVDA and would only add to their underlying business that is already doing very good.\n\n\n#What the big money is doing\n\nIncreased from 150 hedges funds with NVDA in their top 10 holdings to 218 in Q3 2020.\n\n3% increase in institutional ownership from Q2 to Q3 2020\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/eGmb4cy\n\nThey are mostly buying more and some are trimming their positions slightly. Big bois are cool with it so you can be confident that ThE hEdGe FuNdS wOnT bUrN yOu \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21.\n\n\n#TA for mentally ill\nHas been largely stagnant since September, just now hitting new highs. Summarized crayons TA: Some major resistance at ~590 and just broke it and has been holding for the last 2 days. RSI is a little over bought, Id be guessing there is some sideways action for a couple days and then a run up and beat at earnings.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/zAQoat2\n\n#Positions\n2/26 650C\n\nFuck you, this is financial advice because I want more people to go yachting with after \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. Can we stop with the not a financial advisor disclaimers? Its just retarded, we know that making investment choices from an absolutely autistic public forum is how you catch downs syndrome.

        "selftext": "Every time I see another pump article on the \u201cnext Chinese Tesla\u201d because deliveries, I get triggered and have to put on chilled cow on spotify for 3 hours. Although entertaining, \u201cNIO is going to squeeze like GME, all aboard!\u201d comments on stocktwits is making my testicles feel like tiny furrowed cerebrums and not because it\u2019s cold AF outside.\n\nSo I had to put together some pleb research on TSLA, NIO, XPENG &amp; LI for you to scoff at. This is NOT financial advice, I just don\u2019t like these stocks.\n\n**1. Positions**\n\n[https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo](https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo) Yeah my lazy ass needs to switch off.\n\nA few more 2023s, I just went sniping randomly yesterday. Full disclosure, I also hold and sell CCs on my Tesla shares, so this play doubles as somewhat of a hedge for me. Sorry, not up to YOLO standards, I'm a lil biatch.\n\n**2. The Chosen Ones: NIO &amp; XPENG**\n\nDid you ever look at TSLA and think, god damn that shit is overpriced? Then look at the price to sales and realize, holy fuck it is? Then looked at it a month later and the price doubled? Well guess what, NIO and XPENG are trading even higher than TSLA.\n\nCurrent PS as of 2/10/2021\n\n\\- TSLA: \\~25\n\n\\- NIO: \\~40\n\n\\- XPENG: \\~41\n\n\\- LI: \\~19 (It\u2019s because their flagship SUV is hybrid electric +ICE, insane PS reserved for pure bloods only)\n\nLet\u2019s compare. These guys aren't coding the next Gran Turismo 8, but let\u2019s look at high margin tech anyways.\n\n\\- NFLX: \\~10\n\n\\- ABNB: \\~28\n\n\\- PLTR: \\~72 (peter pan stock)\n\nActual automotives, old, unsexy, fell from grace, like your grandma\u2019s teets\n\n\\- TM: \\~0.8\n\n\\- F: \\~0.4\n\n\\- VWAGY: \\~0.5\n\nI did some monkey spreadsheet math to forecast their updated TTM Revs after Q1. Don\u2019t ask me how I did that, the answer either won\u2019t impress you, or straight up glide over your smooth brain and I need you to focus on what\u2019s important right now.\n\nQ1 2021 PS if MC doesn\u2019t change\n\n\\- TSLA: \\~22\n\n\\- NIO: \\~29\n\n\\- XPENG: \\~26\n\n\\- LI: \\~14\n\nYep, still overvalued AF. Before we get into the nuts and butts, there is always the risk (lotto upside in our case) that macros choke and correct &gt;20% because of some black swan (I mean it\u2019s 2020s, Murphy has been trying to prove a point). When this happens, we know what gets hit hardest, the ones with the high forwarding looking, rosy multiples. These EV stocks will get beat up worse than that washed up highschool varsity prom king\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nSome other lotto events include China stocks being delisted, and who can forget the audit risk on those poorly cooked books, but enough to win the Great Chinese Bake Off.\n\nCan they grow Revenues though? Let's look.\n\n**3. Revenue Growth Stunted**\n\nYou might be one of those Stocktwats and you\u2019re thinking; \u201cbut but... they\u2019ll ramp deliveries exponentially and grow Revenues just like TSLA did back in 2018!\u201d \\*Smacks you in the face\\*, no they won\u2019t and here is why.\n\nChinese people love brand name shit. I repeat, Chinese people love brand name shit. Quantitatively, go look at LVMH sales in China. The figures on Chinese tourists going on vacation, spending without looking at the price tag (naw they definitely check for them deals) is incredible. They\u2019re not there to look at some antiquated tower (way better architecture back home), they tryin to get those furry Gucci Slips on discount (they are ugly AF btw). Tesla is no different, people worship Musk over there. You could probably sell his panties online, and some Chinese billionaire will pay millions for it, just like they did for his Gene Wilder house in LA. Qualitatively, I called my cousins in China, confirmed, he couldn\u2019t stop jizzing at the slight mention of Tesla.\n\nWhy does this matter? Owning a TSLA is like owning any other brand name shit in China, social status. Social status is EVERYTHING to much more of the population in China vs. RoW. The biggest difference is, you\u2019re not going to be able to buy a knock-off TSLA in some shady, cigarette smoking thug\u2019s closet on the 2nd floor of a Chinese dumpling street stand.\n\nTSLA just ramped the Model Y in China and started deliveries in Jan. [That shit sold out in a matter of days.](https://electrek.co/2021/01/06/tesla-sells-out-model-y-electric-suv-china/) If you\u2019re not buying one, you basically have to settle for an uglier wife (this is probably not much of an exaggeration). Well guess who has been selling mostly midsize SUVs without much competition from TSLA and achieving recording breaking deliveries up until now?\n\nNIO: 100% SUVs\n\nXpeng: 40% SUVs\n\nBrand aside, some triggered specs nerd out there is thinking \u201cWell, ultimately people will decide based on specs and value, not brand alone.\u201d Fine, let\u2019s take a look at what aspects of an EV people care about.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down apples to apples for these SUV EVs\n\nTesla Model Y- Price: \\~$52,800\n\n\\- Range: 594 km (Kilometers for the apes)\n\n\\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.1s\n\n\\- Charger network: 20,000+\n\nNIO EC6\n\n\\- Price: \\~$57,200\n\n\\- Range: 430 km (605 if you pay \\~$9k for a bigger battery)\n\n\\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.4s\n\n\\- Charger network: 290+\n\nXpeng G3 520\n\n\\- Price: \\~$30,580\n\n\\- Range: 520 km\n\n\\- 0-100km Acceleration: 8.6s\n\n\\- Charger network: 866+\n\nYou may be thinking the G3 520\u2019s price tag is looking pretty attractive. Then you imagine the future wife you\u2019ll be banging, yeah, trade up for that Tesla boi.\n\n\u201cBut JJ, NIO has battery swap tech! It\u2019s perfect for China\u2019s dense cities!\u201d If you know anything about product market fit, battery swapping for EVs is like trying to bang a gerbil's anus. First of all, battery swap stations are way more expensive to build, stock and maintain. Crazy upfront build out costs and battery requirements kill your rate of expansion (shit is important for demand). [Tesla superchargers are spreading like wildfire](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3120578/tesla-starts-v3-supercharger-production-new-shanghai-factory) and become recurring revenue generators over time, while battery swap stations stay cost centers over time, breakeven at best. That\u2019s why NIO tries to charge a $150 subscription fee, I\u2019d rather get pornhub subs for the whole family. Oh btw, you can\u2019t even do it yourself, you have to give it to a service technician to do the swapping for you. Be realistic, these wealthy, classist Chinese dirtbags (I\u2019m Chinese and know some first hand) don\u2019t want some lowlife service tech to sit on their mothball leather.\n\nBack to battery swapping and product market fit. Look, [Tesla tried this in 2013](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/tesla-shows-off-a-90-second-battery-swap-system-wants-it-at-supercharging-stations-by-years-end/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE0JxnRip8JKTQ9hYnvdEiU-EGgAt6RW47Mq0A7ZuzTcGFLVQKn_NUtf1M3CkQ2cr8dUxg3JtIp_G19l7z2s00l9g0WiGbkkMioZLCFNMr5D73kJ3LgwEAEXxNaD11mDTZCLIhfebIWvDzxCab8BRiANI1OHd1pocFU69FweZwNd), decided it was dumb, abandoned it and decided to make charging super fast and let you watch the actual Great British Bake Off while you wait. In 20 fuckin 13 some of you were still going through behavioral therapy.\n\nLastly, the people buying EVs above the $50k range have easy access to charging, especially Tesla\u2019s network. So, battery swapping for cars above $50k is serving a niche market, a handicap, and a money losing operation.\n\n\u201cBut JJ\u2026 China EV Market Growth! They may have a smaller share right now, but the Pie grows for everyone!\u201d Maybe, but if you look at [the 2020 EV market growth](https://insideevs.com/news/481465/china-plugin-car-sales-december-2020/), most of that came from guess who? Tesla. Oh, and a $8k mini, pretty much a golf kart that Tyrian would be uncomfortable in.\n\nSolar &amp; batteries are money losing businesses right now for Tesla, but people are pricing in some of those rosy projections into the valuation. Nio and Xpeng haven't even hinted at the idea because people in China live in 3D printed skyscraper boxes. Home solar and battery doesn\u2019t make sense, but this also means no revenue opportunity.\n\nOh and let\u2019s not forget about autonomy\u2026 no, let\u2019s forget about it (for now).\n\nInternational expansion you say? Sure Nio and Xpeng trying to expand oversees to... Norway. No way has the population size of a small Indian wedding. Let's be honest here, would americans buy a \"made in china\" EV over a Tesla or even Ford/GM EV? I'm Chinese and I wouldn't even fuckin touch that shit.\n\nBack to Cars, to make matters worse for Chinese EV players, [Tesla has already designed a budget model](https://insideevs.com/news/486843/tesla-confirms-25k-car-sold-globally/). Unfortunately, it\u2019ll be hard, like wiping ass with sandpaper, for Xpeng and Nio is follow suite in this space because of... MARGINS. Let's look at this next.\n\n**4. Your margin is my opportunity - JB Retiree**\n\nHistory lesson; how did China become #2 in GDP globally? They industrialized their massive population, kept the RMB artificially deflated to undercut the world through exports. Sure, quality suffered, but everything was \"made in china\" at some point. This is all to say, you can always increase demand by reducing price, and you can optimally reduce price if you have better margins than your competitors (or have the cash to sustain a loss to not bleed out before they do).\n\nLet\u2019s look at the current state of margins.\n\nQ3 2020 Gross Margins\n\n\\- Tesla: 23.5%\n\n\\- Nio: 12.9%\n\n\\- Xpeng: 4.6%\n\n\\- Li Auto: 19.8%\n\nWe\u2019ll have to revisit Q4 margins when everyone reports in a few weeks. But wow, it\u2019s not even close for Nio and Xpeng. This is not even taking out Tesla\u2019s solar &amp; battery margins, which are negative, like when your mom finds out you YOLOed your college tuition on \\[redacted\\] at $400.\n\n\u201cBut JJ, that\u2019s not fair, Nio and Xpeng are still ramping!\u201d First of all, so is Tesla, just on a larger scale. I mean, they are building factories like Starbucks locations. But fine, just taking a peak at margins for Tesla in earlier \u201cramp\u201d years.\n\n2017: 18.9%\n\n2016: 22.8%\n\n2015: 22.8%\n\nThis may not look right, something must be wrong you\u2019re thinking. Well, let\u2019s we take a look under the hood, you won\u2019t find Trayvon Martin.\n\n\\- Battery is the main cost of an EV. Tesla has been working on battery tech from the beginning, they invented and are [retiring the \u201cskateboard\u201d design, saying it\u2019s obsolete](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-retires-skateboard-vs-structural-batteries/) because they got something better, while Chinese EV companies are busy copying it. Ay caramba!\n\n\\- For the batteries them selves, just look at battery output distribution. Both Nio and Xpeng rely on CATL for their batteries in China. But so does everyone else at an Indian wedding, including Tesla. Either everyone is going to be supply limited, or someone is going to have to pay more. You can pay more when you have better margins to work with/bleed cash. At least Tesla will have their own way out soon enough.\n\n[https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz](https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz)\n\nCan you find Nio, Xpeng or Li Waldo?\n\n\\- Tesla\u2019s electronics are industry leading, [Mario knows](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-sandy-munro-analyst-data-video/). Neo and Xpeng on the other hand outsources most of the Chips (Nvidia) and hardware (Mobile eye). When you outsource, you ultimately have less margin, control, speed and ability to freely synergize.\n\n\\- Tesla is also [literally stamping entire cars](https://electrek.co/2020/08/25/tesla-start-operations-worlds-largest-casting-machine/) like crispy cream donuts. It's almost if Chinese EVs are trying to take on Megatron\u2019s fuckin Fusion Cannon with blow darts. Nio on the other hand [abandoned plans to make their own factory](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18252244/nio-ev-startup-factory-shanghai-cancelled-jac-motors) due to cash shortage and [partnered with JAC](https://cntechpost.com/2020/12/05/how-does-nio-build-cars/). A short term plat that won't help margins in the long run.\n\n\\- You know how Tim Apple gets a hard on every time he talks about service margins, EVs have some of that too.\n\n\\- In car entertainment: Tesla is building an app store, while Nio and Xpeng outsources\n\n\\- EV Charging: Tesla has the biggest network, Nio has $ losing battery swap, while Xpeng relied on and pays government network\n\n\\- Connectivity: Startlink? \\*shrugs\\*\n\n\\- Autonomous driving: Tesla is rolling out subs for FSD, and I wouldn\u2019t trust Nio and Xpeng\u2019s software with your wife\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s life\n\n**5. Closing**\n\nLook, Nio is backed by Tencent and Bidu. Xpeng is backed by Ali. Their balance sheets pass the acid test with flying colors, so they can bleed cash for awhile. But Tesla has a meme lord at the helm. Let\u2019s not forget some of the giant local players like BYD, who is backed by Bigly Buffet himself. There is also SAIC, Great Wall, Geely, BAIC, Chang Jiang, Kandi, and dozens more names you don't know, just like the name of your cousin's mail in bride. Tesla copy cats are literally coming out of the woodworks, when buyers have a paradox of choice, the clear pick defaults back to the trusted brand, guess who?\n\nCCP has already been 3 steps ahead of Biden (I mean, who isn't, lol) and EV bullish years ago. Matter of fact, EV subsidies (which Nio and Xpeng survive off of like a bums on opioids in the streets of San Francisco) are already [getting cut by 20% in 2021, and phased out by 2022](https://fortune.com/2021/01/05/china-electric-vehicle-subsidies-sales-tesla/). I'll let you figure out what happens to deliveries when subsidies get cut, again comes back to magins and cash. If it comes down to EV price wars, I don't think it'll be Nio and Xpeng winning the bleed out. It'll be more like Matrix 3, rather than 1.\n\nI\u2019m no voodoo magic chart nerd, but Nio tested $65 resistance again yesterday and failed. Xpeng in general looks like it\u2019s peaked. Google search interest has spiked and all the little virgin armchair analysts on YouTube have pumped it 10 times over. I\u2019ll wait for their earning numbers in a few weeks to take the temperature again. I'll likely add more to the position then, will update.\n\nAt the end of the day, Nio and Xpeng may trade sideways for much longer than I can stay solvent, but fuck it, I\u2019ve spent too much time on this, so sunk cost is set in hard, change my mind.\n\nTL;DR Not sure when, but bet on EV bubble popping with Puts on Nio and Xpeng.

Demand remains high and the company has indicated their  gaming segment is already sold out through Q1.\n\nThe  blog below has an interesting take on the overlap of these two  companies.    It describes how NVIDIA\u2019s technology covers every single  point in ARK Invest\u2019s 2021 \u201cBig Ideas\u201d presentation.   I really doubt  there is another \u201cdisruptively innovating\u201d company making such an impact  against their \"big ideas.\"   Certainly ARK\u2019s #1 holding TSLA, isn\u2019t  anywhere near significant to their future as NVDA, let alone the others  rounding out their top 5: Square, Teledoc, Roku or Baidu.\n\nThe  mysterious part is NVDA is one of ARK\u2019s smaller holdings.   All NVDA  shares in the three ARK funds they\u2019re held in make up only 0.5% of all  assets in ARK\u2019s actively managed funds.   Counter intuitive.\n\nARK  has started buying NVDA more prominently in late Dec.   With positive  earnings and a big fund acquiring looks like there could be plenty of  upside in NVDA.\n\n[https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/243082-grxbstrd/5558092-ark-invest-deal?v=1613924121](https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/243082-grxbstrd/5558092-ark-invest-deal?v=1613924121)",

        "selftext": "[Welcome back to the casino](https://i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg). \n\n**Last week\u2019s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA \n**Last week\u2019s losers: BIDU XPEV**\n\n**On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD\n\n*I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I\u2019m playing.* \n\n**UPDATE: DOCU CEO** speaking at Morgan Stanly TMT conference Monday AM. [This 300c 3/5 came through last week](https://i.imgur.com/dD2cqVp.jpg). Suicidal strike, but I like the sentiment. \n\n****\n\nWhen the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.\n\n**Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can\u2019t afford it, don\u2019t play it.** There are opportunities every day. \n\nAnyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.\n\n****\n\n**1.\tThe SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**\n\nOn Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an \u201cinvestor day\u201d**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.\n\nI hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.\n\nThen, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**\n\nIt was time to get to work.\n\n****\n\n**2.\tThe investigation**\n\nI wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.\n\n1) [SNAP](https://investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https://investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https://investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.\n\n2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.\n\n*All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump. \n\n*NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No \"investor day\" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*\n\nThese companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said \"WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT\".\n\n****\n\n**3.\tDefining RAMBO**\n\nAs I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**\n\nI also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https://esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present \ud83d\ude2c \ud83d\ude09.\n\n**Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I\u2019ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**\n\n****\n\n**4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO** \n\n**What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**\n\n**My theory is that the current ER environment\u2014where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference. \n\n**5. So what am I saying?**\n\nI'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.\n\n**Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I\u2019ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**\n\n[EPD](https://i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\nDipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.\n\nThe real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https://www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.\n\nYou know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.\n\nAs always pick a good entry point.\n\n[BIDU](https://i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\n**EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn\u2019t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright \n\nYeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:\n\n&gt;BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (\"Baidu\" or the \"Company\"), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the \"EGM\") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China.\nA proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (\"Share Subdivision\") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.\n\nYes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.\n\n[CRM](https://i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude2c \n\nCRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.\n\n[ZNGA](https://i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude2c \n\nWhale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https://investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)\n\n[NVDA](https://i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\nI'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.\n\n**Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I\u2019m a bandwagon hopper \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble\n\n****\n\n**TLDR**:\nCheck the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.\n\nI like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates",

        "selftext": "I posted this to the Og reddit as well so forgive me.\nI'm stuck in the snow and figured I'd do this now. I have articles saved on my pc I'll post to support this later. My DD is based on articles and the general energy of my coworkers. Disclaimer* I work for Intel and I love it and I have to point out my views are my own and do not represent Intels*. So to jump in  Intel has a history of being shit on by institutions and have usually Outperformed revenue estimates. There's been several record breaking quarters especially since covid. Now the first topic I would like to bring up is foundry fabs. These fabs exist to build miscellaneous IC chips for customers, in toy cars, alarm systems, and the like. Back during the onset of covid, Bob Swan wrote a letter to the dod explaining the need for a DOD backed foundry plant in the US to combat China. The primary purpose is to build secure micro electronics under the complete auspices of the US military. This would cement INTEL as the defacto chip supplier for the US and its military allies,, in the ban on Chinese companies electronic devices down to contracts being voided if there was a single Chinese built security camera. This also means labor would be subsidized in part. https://evertiq.com/news/48238 . The second part I would  like to bring up is Intel has a new CEO starting tomorrow. For those that want a sense of who he is, listen to Intel last earnings call https://www.intc.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/8508/q4-2020-intel-corporation-earnings-conference-call . The man has a PLAN. He studied under the greats of intel. Royce Moore and Grove, I'm pretty sure it was all 3 but I could be wrong. He rise through the ranks from technician to CTO. His rise was metoric. He is the hope of Intel. He was shaping intels culture in its heyday, he knows how to recreate the Intel of old. The third point I would like to bring up is Intel recent purchase of Israeli company Habana Labs. They are producing a chip that allows machine learning to occur with GPU's at 20% faster than invidia can. (Disclaimer I might be misquoting the article and over simplified it)   No one has been able to make a dent in  Nvidia like this before.  Not the article that I had in mind but here's one https://newsroom.intel.com/news/aws-leverages-habana-gaudi-ai-processors/#gs.szvwf3 . Now coupled with a separate Intel circuit board that allows better interconnection and data transfer speeds between AI modules allowing for more efficient processing and a huge increase in data processing speeds. Again not the article but it gives some insight https://www.theregister.com/2019/12/17/intel_habana_buy/ .  In essence, Intel will corner the AI market, even if they don't have process leadership. They can dominate in how things connect together and communicate.  Now the last topic is the loss of product leadership. It matters.......to a point. How we classify our chips ie, 7nm 5nm and the like is kind of archaic. What actually matters is transistor density. It doesn't matter that you can build chips at 7 or 5nm and can't use all the space. Intel has a track record (sorry for using that phrase alot.) Of having a higher transistor density than its competitors. https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/21/is-smaller-always-better-in-chips-intels-new-10nm-superfin-technology-suggests-otherwise/ but I couldn't find articles simple enough for me to understand to fully support or disprove this, so take it with a grain of salt. The second part of this is Intels manufacturing capabilities. Theres a shortage of Intels competitors chips. Tsmc can't build what amd needs to actually make a dent in intels revenue stream. The same goes for NVIDIA but imo to a lesser degree. The third part of this is the massive shortage of IC chips in general,  in particular the auto industry. This means Intel will hit 70 within a few weeks for sure. This also means IMHO there's no end price target I could think of, I would gage, depending on how the new ceo behaves. Hopefully charismatic and daring. I love Intel and working here. I'm not giving investment advice, im just betting on a few hair brained ideas and the innovation and Indomitable spirit of the people I work with. You should see the grit and the ideas that are being sprung forth. Also for the simple fact we do not associate ourselves with forced labor in our supply chains (except TSMC) And in my opinion more change has happened recently in the last few months than the last few years. Bob Swan did great with what he knew how to do. He gave Intel cash and was the bad news bear so the new CEO could have a clean record. Tear me a new one guys tell me I'm autistic.",

        "selftext": "Didn't qualify as a Loss post so have to post as Disussion. \n\nFirst time:\n\nBought INTC at around March 2020 for a price of $51 per share. Idea back then was pandemic lockdown coming, everything was shifting online, 5G just started to popularize, thought that 5G &amp; gaming could have a go. Was thinking among TSM, NVDA and INTC and finally chose TSM and INTC as the Big 2 Battle (really should have bought NVDA!).\n\nWatched INTC climb to around $60 then this sucker announced in July 2020 it had to delay its 7nm production. Shares slumped to $47-$48. 23% loss over one week. Took it three months to finally climb back to over $52 in October 2020. Sold my shares with minor profits plus tiny bits of dividend.\n\nSecond time:\n\nINTC had major reshuffling across Nov.2020 to January 2021 and the new CEO talked a good game. Thought that INTC had a bit of a \"catch-up\" play ahead. Re-entered INTC at around $58 in early January 2021. Saw the price climb to $62 on Jan.20 2021. Then some hacker hacked into the company's database and exposed part of the financial data and the company was forced to release 2020 Q4 reports early (not a great report anyway, net profit dropped 15% YoY). Took another two weeks for shares to recover to $60. Sold at $59. Again negligible profits.\n\nYes I did earn some breadcrumbs in these two trades but overall I consider it a loss since these two big ass black swans grabbed the big piece of bread from my hand.\n\nBut three times might be a charm. I am planning to enter INTC again and see if Karma is on my side this time.",

        "selftext": "I know you all seem to be mostly into video games, weed, and rainbow colored keyboards, but businesses make many more things than that. One thing they make and is in insanely high demand right now are semiconductors, little things that act as both conductors and insulators and make all your electronics do electronic things.\n\nTrust me, they are very important.\n\nSome of you have no doubt seen $AMD, $NVDA, and $MU on here before. I am sure you have heard of Texas Instruments, since they made the calculators you played Pac-Man and Drug Lord on in high school.\n\nAnyway, for people like me who have many people depending on them for food and shelter and lack the testicular fortitude or smooth brain cells to throw thousands of dollars at one company, here are some more affordable companies based in the US and poised to grow in the coming months/years as demand skyrockets and supply lags behind.\n\n**MaxLinear $MXL**: These guys just keep growing and beating all of their earnings and revenue targets, net revenue up 24% in Q4 of 2020, and have beaten earnings in 6 straight quarters. Their RoE routinely beats the competition, and their projected sales growth is good.\n\n**Chip_MOS $I_MO_S**: (Sorry for the formatting, this guy is just under 1B cap, but did not want to leave it out) Just another small company with good financials and ever increasing sales/revenues, the latter up 24% in January. They have consistently good P/E and P/S ratios, and even offer a pretty generous dividend if you are into that kind of thing.\n\n**Advanced Energy Industries $AEIS**: If you like consistent gainers, this is for you. They basically never fail to meet earnings expectations, and essentially always outperforms competitors in RoE and cash flow.\n\n**ON Semiconductor Corp $ON**: Another consistent gainer that I almost never see in the red regardless of the rest of the market. Revenues that just keep improving, they keep making good acquisitions, some analysts are suggesting 20% or higher gains from these guys in 21-22. Reported earnings per share of 35 cents, just another great surprise form $ON. Options for this company are cheap right now as well, but rising fast. Institutional investors are flocking to this one too, so if you want to follow the smart money, $ON is a good bet.\n\nThere are a few more, but I can not mention them due to relatively low market caps. If you do not have much to invest, but want to get in on this sector, check out Magna Chip ($ M X) too.\n\nAll these companies have great growth potential and financials, have consistently gained, have excellent analyst scores, and are in a huge growth sector with massive demand and a supply that is so low governments worldwide are seriously looking into how to improve it.\n\nThe Biden administration is working on executive orders and funding/tax credits to help these companies pump out more and more product.\n\nThink about some of the big growth industries right now. Well, they all depend on semiconductors. EVERYTHING has a computer in it, and they all need semiconductors, from your car, to your PlayStation, or the lighting/irrigation systems used to grow all that Canadian weed.\n\nThese are just my opinions, look into it yourselves before you spend any money. But these are not hyped stocks, so do not expect them to pump or dump, or make you a millionaire overnight. But they sure are green a lot.",

        "selftext": "**Ebang International Holdings Inc**  \nNASDAQ: EBONDATE: 02/25/2021\n\nEBANG International Holdings Inc. is a relatively lesser-known company in the realm of crypto. Sitting at an 1.02B market cap and share price of $7.36 USD, it is not nearly the smallest player, however when compared to MARA and RIOT with respective 3.53B and 3.14B it is clearly undervalued.\n\nWhat does Ebang International Holdings Inc do and make them different?\n\nEbang is creating a vertical platform for crypto and it will save a lot of money. The best part is there will be multiple channels of cash flow.\n\n**FINANCIALS (Unaudited  Results for the first six months of 2020)**\n\n**June 30, 2020**Total assets: 75,076,267Total liabilities: 57,658,628\n\n**December 31, 2019**Total assets: 82,611,046Total liabilities: 57,040,422\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**REASON ONE**  \n**Ebang is an ASIC Chip Designer/Crypto Miner Manufacture**\n\n\u201cEbang International Holdings Inc. is a blockchain technology company with strong application-specific integrated circuit (*ASIC*) chip design capability. With years of industry experience and expertise in *ASIC* chip design, it has become a leading bitcoin mining machine producer in the global market with steady access to wafer foundry capacity.\n\n**With a shortage of ASIC chips globally, manufacturers just aren\u2019t manufacturing enough products for everyone. This even includes Nvidia, which is gigantic. Nvidia even released their CMP HX chip for mining.**\n\n**Ebang next gen miners are set out to be released soon 2nd Quarter of 2021 utilizing their 8nm/7nm ASIC Chip. With Crypto being more popular, it's very likely the chips have been overclocked to boost overall performance to squeeze everything they can push out.**\n\n**R&amp;D: Currently designing 5nm ASIC Chip**\n\n**Reference:**[ **https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/cmp/**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/cmp/)**Reference:** [**https://www.asicminervalue.com/**](https://www.asicminervalue.com/)\n\nImportant Note: Ebang newest miners are not released yet and probably is going undergoing some tweaks prior to their release due to BTC sudden bullrun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**REASON TWO**  \n**Ebang is a Server Farm**\n\nEbang started machine hosting in 2017 and as of 2021, they have expanded. Crypto miners can be rapidly deployed and can be set up in about 1 day. It\u2019s expected Ebang new crypto exchange will be hosted by Ebang datacenters too to reduce cost in maintenance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**REASON THREE**  \nEbang has its own Crypto Exchange. With Coinbase valued in the billions, it's possible that their exchange can attract a small percentage of these users too.\n\n**Coinbase's market cap the week after its IPO will be around $63 billion, this is huge!**\n\n**Reference:** [**https://www.bqintel.com/post/coinbase-revenue-profit-201**](https://www.bqintel.com/post/coinbase-revenue-profit-2019)**Reference:** [**https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2021/01/29/coinbase-investors-say-it-could-hit-100-billion-valuation-when-it-goes-public/?sh=bee56c95b50f**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2021/01/29/coinbase-investors-say-it-could-hit-100-billion-valuation-when-it-goes-public/?sh=bee56c95b50f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Logic Theories**: For 2020, there\u2019s definitely a huge impact from COVID-19 as noted from their CEO. This has definitely impacted their business. Cash holding is definitely down significantly probably due to future investment of their crypto exchange and upgrades in their mining host services (This can be seen by their non-current assets report). Property, plant and equipment net is 13,224,761 in 2019, compared to 20,904,153 in 2020.\n\nTheir current liabilities for their debts seems to be completely repaid but there was an increase in their long-term loans - related party, meaning they did this to clear up some credit to increase new investment for new projects.\n\nWithout a doubt, I believe Bitcoin will easily hit $75,000 per BTC to $100,000 per BTC. So for the next 6 months to 1 year, EBON is definitely going to be a BUY.\n\n  \n**Bitcoin is** **NOT A FAD**, if it was it wouldn\u2019t have come back this strong. Numbers don\u2019t lie and Square/PayPal/Tesla have already invested into Bitcoin, why? Because more people are starting to notice it, more countries are using crypto integration with their payment systems.\n\n[Google Trend as of 02\\/25\\/21](https://preview.redd.it/8uly7fqzonj61.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78898cf6903cb5d6746dc11cfcc16fae07366f04)\n\n[Projected Route as of 02\\/25\\/21](https://preview.redd.it/pysbvblyonj61.png?width=1546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5e03ccbf5d16af4a1fc4f58af71ccd70277332b)\n\n**EBON Price Target: $12.00 USD (Realistic Estimation)EBON Estimated High: $35.00 (This number is relatively high because until Ebang finish their exchange and get a high rate of customers, this won\u2019t happen)**\n\n**EBON RISKS: The only thing that can ruin everything for EBON is if BTC crashes below it\u2019s profit point under the value of $25,000 per BTC and we all know that\u2019s not happening anytime soon because hedge funds and ETFs are holding to keep values up.**\n\n*This does not constitute financial advice, as with all investments it is your financial responsibility to conduct your own due diligence and ask whether the investment aligns properly with your short-term and long-term strategies.*",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, February 25th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-25-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Stocks set for mixed open after another major comeback\n\n&gt; * Dow futures hold on to slim gains Thursday, one day after the 30-stock average wiped out a 110-point loss and climbed 424 points, or 1.4%, to a record closing high. S&amp;P and Nasdaq futures dropped in the premarket. The tech-heavy Nasdaq on Wednesday erased a 1.3% drop and closed 1% higher. The S&amp;P 500 finished 1.1% higher after recovering from a 0.6% decline. Two days of reassuring words on interest rates and inflation from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell helped push stocks higher and tempered bond yield gains Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield on Thursday rose to 1.45%, around the highest levels in a year. B/itcoin rose 2% early Thursday, back above $50,000.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Jobless, GDP, durable goods data all out before the bell\n\n&gt; * The government is set to release weekly jobless claims, revised fourth quarter gross domestic product and January durable goods orders at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect a drop in new filings for unemployment benefits to 845,000. GDP in Q4 is seen rising slightly from the initial estimate to a 4.2% annual growth rate. Forecasts call for a 1% rise in durable goods orders last month, double December\u2019s increase.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. GameStop shares surge again as Reddit favorites rally again\n\n&gt; * GameStop climbed more than 70% in Thursday\u2019s premarket trading as heavily-shorted stocks favored by Reddit traders surged again. Shares of the video game retailer doubled Wednesday to nearly $92 each after Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell resigned. The GameStop frenzy last month sent shares skyrocketing, causing a short-squeeze on a number of Wall Street hedge funds. GameStop traded below $20 per share in early January, before soaring to an intraday high of $483 on Jan. 28, a surge of more than 2,300%. The stock crashed below $50 by mid-February before Wednesday\u2019s spike higher.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Pfizer, Moderna work on shots against strain first discovered in South Africa\n\n&gt; * Pfizer and BioNTech said on Thursday they\u2019re testing a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine to better understand the immune response against new variants of the coronavirus. They are also in talks with regulatory authorities about testing a vaccine modified to protect specifically against the new variant originally found in South Africa.\n\n&gt; * Moderna has shipped to the National Institutes of Health doses of a new Covid-19 vaccine designed to provide better protection against the variant spreading in South Africa. The new vaccine is ready to be tested in an early stage clinical trial to determine if it can be used as a booster shot against the highly transmissible strain.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. GOP rallies against Democrats\u2019 Covid relief package\n\n&gt; * Republicans rallied solidly against Democrats\u2019 proposed $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill as lawmakers awaited a decision by the Senate\u2019s parliamentarian that could bolster or potentially kill a pivotal provision hiking the federal minimum wage. Despite narrow majorities on Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders were poised to push the sweeping package through the House on Friday. They were hoping the Senate, where changes seem likely, would follow quickly enough to have legislation on President Joe Biden\u2019s desk by mid-March.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/cMtfcj3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hQSCDGR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/SQdkCZb7/econcal1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/7Bu1KiL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/iJIWrht.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/TGSsG6Z.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/jLYSBwB.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/7x6BL9M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nRANzSs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gIMTkdc.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/sX4d6Cd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/roCiE2I.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VZXsdqE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/E0eGZ2A.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/gJcNHhMB/divical1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/PqQSDyMw/divical2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/N0cNLSRt/divical3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR #4!](https://i.postimg.cc/JzJ6rMDK/divical4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-gamestop-k/oss-corp-wayfair-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **GameStop (GME)** \u2013 GameStop remains on watch after another Reddit-fueled surge Wednesday in the video game retailer\u2019s shares, as well as other so-called \u201cReddit stocks\u201d like BlackBerry (BB), AMC Entertainment (AMC) and K/oss Corp.

It is dropping again and am wondering (more likely waiting for someone to co-sign my bullshit) if other people this that their value will rise again, I know their GPU's are very popular and I even own one.

        "selftext": "Hi  all, NrdRage here.  You might remember from such recent hits as \"buy   $PLTR 25p's as it's ripping here\", \"$CLNE June 13c's are literally free   money\", \"sell your $NCLH leaps in the 33 area and buy back later the   next day near 29\" (you're welcome, btw, as that trade probably saved   your week) and \"$NVDA June 580c's are going to make you rich\".  Today   we're gonna talk about the semiconductor chip space.\n\n# Fluff content\n\n\"B...b....b.....BUT   NrdRAGE, you called  $NVDA, you already talked about them!\"  I really   didn't.  Be honest, when I say chips/semis, the first things you think   of are $NVDA, $AMD, and $INTC.  Those are a wholly different thing than   what's on everybody's lips these days in relation to the vaunted   shortage, dealing in high performance silicon that is being produced at   full blast.  They're not going to be given a ticket to the feed trough   of free taxpayer money (supposing somebody informs Buyden that by chip    shortage, they're not indicating he needs to send his interns to  the   snack aisle of the grocery store to hoard.  Not a sure thing).\n\nWhat   we're going to be talking about are the lower grade ASIC (application   specific chips) that are used more in infrastructure.  These are the   commodity level products that are used for things like the computers in   vehicles, mobile phones, wireless towers, specialized digital binary   money mining, and so Elon can implant them in chimps for evil genius   mind control experiments.\n\n***Placeholder:  Chart for expected 5G tower growth***\n\n***Placeholder:  Chart for automotive chip demands and supply bottleneck; chart to Q3)***\n\nYour   bigger players here are going to be Taiwan Semi ($TSMC), Lam ($LRCX),   and ST ($STM).  2 of them are boring to trade, and Lam I'm not allowed   to talk about because of a conflict of interest w/ my VC.\n\n# Let's talk about the government for a minute\n\nOK,   be honest:  Half the reason you're here is because you heard Buyden is   going to dump loads of free money into these companies so they'll make   more chips.    After all, that's what CNBC has told you, and they  never  lie, right?  Right?  That's actually not what has happened in  Washington  (and, god help us, that line about Buyden thinking the chip  shortage  has to do with potatoes was only half joking).  What the  government has  done was signed up to spend money STUDYING why there's a  chip shortage.   The concern here is that even the US based semis  outsource out their  chip production to places like China and Vietnam,  and there's a growing  push to incentivize companies to bring production  domestically.  This is  especially spurred by $NXPI, who is  bottlenecking the automotive  industry by selling too much overseas.   Now, let's be honest:  It's  about 75% that all they do is waste money  on the study and never  actually make the investment, because getting  things like this done is  hard, and it's much easier to focus on social  issues that are already  covered by other laws but make it look like  something is getting done.   We have talkers and not doers right now,  that's just the nature of the  beast.\n\nSpeaking of, let's talk about....\n\n# $NXPI - The Laggard\n\n$NXPI   represents the only true foreign company we're going to examine today,   based in the Netherlands.  $MRVL is technically based in Bermuda, but   they're a US company (more on that later).  At the time of this  writing,  they're trading in the low 180's with a market cap of about 51  billion.   Their specialty is in chips that power infotainment systems  for cars.   So when you hear $F whine about how they can't get enough  chips,  they're low-key throwing shade at $NXPI.  The only reason  they're being  included in this list is because, as a big automotive  chipmaker, in  spite of the whole \"Buy American\" virtuing from the  current government,  if they spend money to ramp up manufacturing,  they're going to hand  money to $NXPI to set up factories here - and  will be dumb enough to not  make it contingent upon $NXPI keeping the  chips here in the country, so  they'll continue to sell them to the rest  of the world.\n\nLooking  under the  hood, 47% of their money comes from cars, another 13% comes  from  phones, 20% comes from infrastructure (think wireless towers) and  about  20% of their money comes from selling chips to AMazon and Google  so  their virtual assistants can spy on you and listen to your wife's   boyfriend having sex on your dining table, with his balls rubbing right   against where your plate of Hungry Man frozen dinners sits when ~~he takes her out on a date~~   she goes out \"with the girls\".  Hey, I think one of those peas fell on   the table.  Pick it up and put it in your mouth.  Yeah, roll it around   in there, tastes like taint, doesn't it?  They're b asically a smaller   representation of Trevor's nuts - or a life size version of yours, you   dirty little bitch.  So one could say they've got a pretty good  product  mix and were one of the earlier players in the sector to  recover (yet  still lagged behind them overall), unlike the other  players we're gonna  talk about later.    Or, you could say that they're  a bunch of flip  flopping non-committers who create a schizophrenic  company in some weird  attempt to not be cyclical.  They trade at a  lower multiple to their  competitors, but this is largely due to the  fact that they're leveraged  more deeply than the rest.  The best  comparison to these guys would be $TXN if  you want something else to  track it by\n\n**(Placeholder:  I might put a chart here later in an edit that compares price in relation to EBITDA)**\n\n**(Placeholder:    I might put a chart here later in an edit that shows forward earnings   estimations based upon the increase in auto and IoT chip costs)**\n\nWhat  do they think they're going to be long term?  That's the thing, it's  impossible to  tell if they're going to become a big player in cars or  IoT (they're not  compelling in infrastructure) because....\n\nWhat   makes $NXPI interesting here in spite of the fact that everybody is   pissed at them for spreading themselves too thin is the fact that   they're such whores with who they sell to that they've become something   of an interesting M&amp;A speculative play, as it's entirely possible a   company just comes along and buys them to bolster their supply chain  for  chips once and for all.  In particular, there is a strong  indication  that Samsung has been kicking the tires for over a year.\n\nOK, moving $ON (get it?  Dad joke)\n\n# $ON - The Overachiever\n\n$On   represents the only true domestic semi on this list, so if you're   playing the \"corporate welfare\" trade, you'll be interested here.  If   $NXPI is the BPD-afflicted ex who \"loves strongly and that's why she lit   your car on fire\", $ON is that super-focused new girlfriend who's   dating you because she knows somewhere in your contact list is a local   celebrity she can use to get her closer to being the Bachelorette after   she dumps your ass.  ON is all-in on 2 things:  the vehicle revolution   and 5G.  They're positioning themselves as the place to go to if you're   making EV's or autonomous cars, as they are focused on LIDAR sensory   chips and power management.  Why?  It's simple - ON was, is, and always   will be, interested in the highest margin businesses possible, cyclical   nature of them be damned.  Sure, they stick the tip of their johnson  in  the industrial sector, cross-selling their sensory chips for  purposes of  machine vision (think automated Amazon warehouse part  pickers), but  it's not something they spend a lot of time on.  Does  this strategy work  (at least for right now?).  Let's look under the  hood.\n\nThey  had a MASSIVE beat  last quarter and then upgraded forward guidance by  8%, and this stonk  has already had quite a run - more than 30% to date,  which has outpaced  its competitors by almost double.  The automotive  section of their  portfolio rose 17% and represents about 33% of their  revenue at this  point, but it's clear to see that if we have this  conversation in a  year, that number will be well over 50%.  Their  infrastructure revenue  (wireless towers) lagged, but that was due to  their vendors, and  actually represents a forward opportunity.  They beat  in spite of a  major part of their portfolio dumping.  So the answer is  yes.\n\nHow?    Simple:  Mind control and cancer technology from the lizard people   who's secret society is bustling under the ice of Antarctica, aka 5G.    The telecoms, as a result of the virus, really slowed down their rollout   of 5G last year.  It was suspected that might carry through this year,   as well.  You may have noticed the news a day or two ago that $T and  $VZ  caught downgrades because of unexpectedly high prices paid in the  most  recent bandwidth spectrum auctions.  That changes all of that.   Since  everybody had to pay so much more for the spectrum space, look  for these  players to be very aggressive in trying to shorten the ROI  frame on  those expenses by aggressively expanding out their 5G  infrastructure.   There are 3 companies that this is very good news for:   $SWKS (another  stock I can't comment on because of conflict of  interest, so do your own  DD with them), $ON, and the next participant  in this, which we'll get  to in a moment.  So there are about to be a  lot more chips from $ON in  your kid's school, shooting ovarian cancer  rays into that boy.  You  likely won't see this reflected on the balance  sheet until their Q3  earnings, but since everybody knows it's coming,  it's going to get baked  into the price.  Which is why you're very  likely to see a melt up over  the next months.\n\nThe   one thing that sets $ON apart from the rest of the equities on this   list is that they're not a a mini-fab.  That meaning, they're not a   company that simply outsources chip production to other people   (overseas) and who has shown a willingness to keep some production in   house.  Matter of fact, their CEO recently came out and affirmed that he   wants to maintain a balance between outsourcing and in-house.  Which   means when it's time to get some of that sweet, sweet taxpayer money to   build out US production, they'll have their hands out.\n\nTL:DR:    If you're bullish on EV's, self-driving cars, and the Illuminati,   you're bullish on $ON.  If you're playing the gubmint corporate cheese   play, $ON\n\n# $MRVL - The Duke Brothers\n\nMarvell   is functionally a US company (Santa Clara), but is technically   headquartered in Bermuda because they're filthy tax dodgers.  If you're   one of those \"ethical investors\", stay far away from this company,   because they're as dirty as they come in a lot of ways. They also trade   at a lower multiple than the others.  On the upside, if the government   starts offering money to \"Build American, sell to China\", they will   elbow their way to the front of the line to take the free money...and   then build a 3 person operation somewhere in Iowa that makes hard drive   chips and pocket the rest, which will definitely pad their bottom line.\n\nOne   thing that's different with $MRVL here is that they completely   outsource their chip production right now, so if they were to take   government money, they would have to build their infrastructure from the   ground up and figure out how to make it work.  Anyways, let's look   under the hood:\n\n40%  of their  revenue comes from the storage sector.  Meaning the lion's  share of  their money is legacy, selling chips that go in hard drives.   On the  consumer side, it's in platter discs, their SSD play is in the   enterprise space because they're not high performance chips.    BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-RIIIIIIIIING.   \"But NrdRage!\", I can hear you saying   \"That means they're gonna be huge in the cloooooouuuuuuud!\".   Sure,   except margins in t he cloud computing space keep shrinking at   exponential rates as it becomes more commoditized, so it's a lot like   investing in EMC in 2014.  They've invested heavily in automotive in the   last year, but they're a day late and a billion dollars short there.    It will take at least 3 years before that investment starts bearing   fruit, so they're not an interesting play in that aspect, and likely   would use that free taxpayer money to try and close their gap there,   because they weren't forward thinking in that regard.  They've been   active in acquisitions lately, most recently buying Inphi, which serves   to just attempt to keep up with $NVDA in the ARM chip space for data   centers.  For the record, they cannot keep up with $NVDA in that space,   so don't think you're paying for a dominant player there.    It's a  high  profit sector, but not exciting and dependent on their continued   contract winning in the whitebox space.  All this sounds like they're   big spenders, but that's not really true.  They've actually been   excessively cautious in leveraging debt, which is why they're so far   behind in the auto space.  As only 4 or 5% of their revenue came from   things like industrial or IoT, MRVL is actively winding down t hose   sectors of their business, and abandoning t hem.\n\nWhat   they are that's interesting, however, is almost exclusively a 5G play,   and in that regard, they are fucking rock stars.   5G alone represents   about a billion dollars per quarter as things get more heated there,   because they're not just a domestic 5G play - they're really well   positioned to be the dominant chip maker in both the Land of the Hentai   Sun and for the Europoors.  If you're investing in $MRVL, this is the   SOLE reason you're doing so, and it's a compelling case.  There's no   chart data I can provide as-yet that can accurately project their   positioning in the market in this area, but rest assured, when that data   can be quantified, they're going to be a big time player in it.   Matter  of fact, just yesterday they announced they were partnering with   Fujitsu in a 5G baseband agreement with regards to Fujitsu's base   stations.  Bad day to announce that news, since the best performing   stonks were the ones that only closed down 1%.\n\n**(Placeholder:  Chart goes here for 5G chip earnings and market share)**\n\n**(Placeholder:  Chart goes here for telecom expansion analysis)**\n\n# So, to summarize:\n\n* The   entire sector is very cyclical, and presently it represents a perfect   storm of an upgrade in telecommunications technology, automotive   advancements, and IoT\n* Don't   bet on them just because you hear Buyden is virtue signalling some   bullshit about solving Ford's chip crisis, because it's probably going   to be another example of lifetime politicians being all talk and no   action\n* They're   all healthy financially, none of them are heavily shorted, and  pressure  is to the upside, albeit not in any sort of extreme adrenaline releasing way\n* If   you really want to bet on government, the real bet here is the stimmy   money getting handed out again.  DC is basically telling everybody to  go  buy a new phone with the next installment of checks, and those  phones  are going to be 5G capable and the people are going to want to  leverage  that.\n* Don't tell the lizard people I know about their secret base\n\n# That's all well and good, fucker, but how do I play them?  Can I FD?\n\n$NXPI:    You actually can.  You can expect daily movement of between 2-4% with   some regularity, with a ITM Delta of about 58 and a Gamma approaching 2   and a half (spoiler alert: All these are going to have garbage gammas,   just a nature of the industry).  Don't go crazy out of the money, but   weeklies are absolutely something you can do here.\n\n$ON:    You can't really.  This is really more of a melt up play.  You don't   necessarily have to play leaps, but weeklies are gonna be a bad idea.    Stay close to in the money and go 2 or 3 months out at a time.    Currently I'm sitting on 4/16 41c's, which I will roll over into June   calls as we get closer to expiration.  You always want to stay a little   in front of these dudes.  ITM Delta is almost always sub-50 and Gamma  is  often times about 12 short term.  Stay a little ahead of them and it   improves dramatically.\n\n$MRVL:    They're OK there, but like $ON, you're probably going to want to stay   ahead of them, though you can fiddle with this a bit.  Delta is pretty   good, but the gamma is absolute dogshit.  If you target something about   10% one direction or another, you should be happy as long as you pick   the right side of the coin flip.\n\n# Outlook and Price Targets:\n\n$NXPI:    I'm neutral on them, bordering on bullish.  They're the biggest  reason  we keep hearing about this silicon crisis right now, but they're  being  coy about whether the reason they're not keeping up is because  they  don't or won't produce enough or if it's just because they won't  sell  enough to us.  They represent a potential speculative play if  somebody  who really needs chips for their business decides to just  solve the  problem by throwing money at it and bringing that development  in house.   3 month price target 200-210.\n\n$ON:    Bullish.  They're laser focused and well positioned to take advantage   of all the highest margin business in this cycle, and as the demand  for  these products ramps up, their outlook is going to exponentially  outpace  everybody else in the space, even the chips I didn't talk about  today  (exempting gaming chip makers).  45 in the short term, but if  you manage  to stick your dick in your wife when she's sleeping one  night and  dribble your Downs-afflicted swimmers into her, you could  very well see  75-80 by the time that chromosome hoarding bundle of joy  licks your  wife's vag.  I expect to see this one in triple digits at  some point.  A  darling.\n\n$MRVL:    Bullish for 5G ONLY.  Once you start seeing the telecoms advertise   they've got 97% nationwide 5G coverage (and research studies to back   that up), their cycle will be over and they'll go back to legacy   revenue, but expect big things from them as $T and $VZ try to keep up   with T-Mo's breakneck pace.  Short term price of $75, long term...eh,   whatever.\n\n# Positions:\n\n$NXPI:   I don't hold a position with them, and don't anticipate doing so  unless a strong momentum trade forms.  I think they can move, but  they're not interesting to me.  Some of you will like them, especially  since you can FD them because of the occasional spikes and craters.\n\n$ON:    1000 4/16 $41cs and 500 7/16 44c's.  I also have 85,000 shares at   30.59.  I grabbed some weeklies for next week at 38 during yesterday's   bloodbath, but that was just me feeling cute.  You can't really shadow   trade that since it's already back up to 40.25.\n\n$MRVL:  2000 5/21 $65c's and 50,000 shares at 33.35\n\n# NRDRAGE DOUBLE FEATURE:  BONUS \"DD\": $UTZ\n\nI   keep making those \"Buyden hears chip shortage and thinks Frito Lay is   in trouble\" jokes, but the thing is, I'm only half kidding.    That has   nothing to do with this equity other than it got me thinking about my   favorite snack brands.  A week ago, I had no idea this company was even   publicly traded -  I always knew them as a family run northeast niche   thing.  One thing I did notice, however, was a couple of years ago  their  chips started showing up in grocery stores near my Colorado  homes,  which I had been assuming meant they were having things shipped  from the  East coast.  And, when we spent a couple of weeks at our LA  home  recently so I could get in some motorcycle riding and away from  the  snow, I found them on the shelves out there, too.  Somewhere along  the  way, they decided to become a national brand and have started   penetrating markets all over the place.  I have no idea what their   financials look like or any other solid DD besides knowing that they're   fucking delicious and, if you're a believer in the product, then   believing in the company shouldn't be hard.  So I bought a thousand   shares at 24.35 in solidarity with them.  Then I saw Cramer hyped them a   couple of nights ago and cursed myself for starting to turn into a   shitty Boomer.  Maybe they become a big player in the snack food space   on their own, maybe a company like $PEP comes along and buys them out.    Regardless, if you like the product, go out and buy some equity, you  fat  fuck.  Plus, there's always a non-zero chance Joe gives them a  bailout  by mistake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll my love,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChad Dickens",

        "selftext": "Guys\n\nA lot of \u201cexperts\u201d have been giving us advice on the rule of thumb in trading/investing etc.  I\u2019ve been in the market long enough to honestly tell you that the only rule I follow is:  There is no rule.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been in the market during the \u201clost decade\u201d where the NASDAQ hit ATH then crashed and stayed down for a decade,  you\u2019ll learn that it\u2019s a lot easier to find 10 stocks that give you 1% gain than one stock that gives you 10% gain a month/week/day.  That\u2019s the reality. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with FOMO \u2013 as long as you are realistic in your expectation.  Buying at the absolute peak is extremely rare.   If you bought GME at 300 and got out at 305 you are fine.   In fact, buying stock on the way up is the definition of momentum trading.  If you bought at the absolute peak then be thankful.  The fact that you were on your computer buying that stock may save your life \u2013 with that luck, a meteorite would have crashed on you if you walked out outside at that exact moment.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with cutting loss early.  A single big loss can wipe out months of little gains.  If you are willing to take a loss that equals last week\u2019s gain then that\u2019s fine to sell there.   You may miss out if that was a temporary correction, but you could have saved weeks of gains you\u2019ve accumulated if it was not.\n\nThe fact that you are putting money in the market (index ETFs are recommended by people smarter than I am) means you already on a winning track.  It takes a significant amount of hard work, dedication, and ass-kissing to get an extra 2%-3% raise in your salary (compared to the average salary raise).  It takes an extraordinary amount of effort to get 5%-10% on top of the average raise.  \n\nThe market is the same way.  It takes no work to get a 3-5% gain in the market a year.  It takes little work to match the SPY/VOO \u2013 just buy it.  It takes much more work to beat the SPY/VOO.  There\u2019s no easy way out.   Either way, money in the market goes up quicker than your salary and that is the winning position.\n\nI day trade mostly and here is where I am at:\n\nDate / YTD realized gain\n\n2-19 / 129,556 (last Friday)\n\n2-22 / 133,738 (Monday)\n\n2-23 / 145,436 (Tuesday)\n\n2-24 / 145,591 (Wednesday)\n\n2-25 / 149,100 (Thursday \u2013 last night)\n\n2-26 / 152,696 (Friday) - End of a red week.\n\nAfter a while, you will develop your own way of making money on red days/weeks/months.  I\u2019ve learned more during the dot-com crash, the housing crash than the bull market following that.\n\nI bought Nvidia, TSLA yesterday just before closing. I bought PLTR, HD, AAPL early this morning pre-market.  We\u2019ll l see how that works out for me but so far I like the direction TSLA, Nvidia, PLTR, and HD moving up until 9:10 which is now.  \n\nKeep in mind; I am not shooting for the stars.  I\u2019ll get out of Nvidia the moment it goes above 560, for example, and will do the same with HD @ 260, etc.  If Nvidia doesn't get there quick enough and hover around 550,  I'll take that too.  What if HD stays at 257 for a while?  I'll cash out too.  There's no fixed rule, no fixed target - that's how I roll.\n\nEdit:  Put in the data for Friday.  That closes out a red week.",

        "selftext": "I think this might be my first post, so please bear with me.  I'm trying to learn the craft of Options trading.  I'm currently doing ALL my trading on TD's ThinkorSwim platform with paper money, and I saw something today that I couldn't understand.  I hope you fine folks can help.\n\nUnderlying:  NVDA   Date:  Today, February 23, 2021\n\nIn two orders, I bought 20 ITM 550 Calls at a price of 18.50 per contract during the morning downslide of the stock.  My strategy is a gap play whereby I buy CALLs on the opening downgap, expecting the stock price to rise to close the gap by Contract Expiration (even better if it's the same day).  At that point, I sell the CALL Options to exit the Position(s).\n\nEDIT:  Based on the first reply below, I did buy 10 NVDA shares during the downturn about midday, an Equity Position, not an Option Position.\n\nTotal cost for the two (2) Filled Orders was $37,000, or $18,500 each.  I used the green \"POS\" (funny to type that) flags on the Trade tab to initiate a Closing Order on the 20 Open 550 Contracts.  In the Order Entry section, I selected the following:SINGLE,  SELL,  -20,  TO CLOSE,  NVDA,  26-FEB 21, (WEEKLY),  550,  CALL,  29.10,  LIMIT,  DAY,  BEST\n\nOther OPEN positions include (NVDA):\n\nEXP                               STRIKE  TYPE     QTY    PRICE       MARK                MARK VALUE  \n26 FEB 21 (WEEKLY)  580       CALL     +10     18.30        12.55                $12,550\n\n26 FEB 21 (WEEKLY)  590       CALL     +10     20.95         9.30                 $9,300\n\nWhat is confusing me is my Account Statement section called Profits and Losses now shows \"Margin Req\" of $2826.95 where there was none before selling the 20 550 Call Options.  Do you know why that triggered a Margin requirement if I was closing a Long Call Position?\n\nA screenshot of my account statement is attached.

        "selftext": "Hey all, I'm very new to trading, had always  wanted to dive in but never really have the disposable income to do so.  \n\n\nI know it can be a risky move, especially for those who don't really have money to play with. But with apps like Robinhood making it a bit simpler to get into the game and buy/sell etc. I figured I'd finally try my luck.  \n\n\nNow I know there's some out there that can drop a few thousand into the market like it's nothing and move from there. However I'm not in that boat and so taking risky chances with what I do have to throw in on a chance that something will jump up is a harder decision for someone like me. At my current rate I figure I can throw in about $50 a week or so, and sometimes more depending on the money I have coming in.  \n\n\nI was wondering what some might think of the decisions I made, based on me assuming the companies I bought into being more 'safe bets' compared to some other options. The stocks I had bought, along with how much I put in (It will be added to and adjusted more evenly over time) are as follows:  \n\n\n**Skyworks (SWKS) - $5**  \n**Intel (INTC) - $5**  \n**Nvidia (NVDA) - $5**  \n**Microsoft (MSFT) - $5**  \n**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) - $30**  \n\n\nNvidia is the one I was most unsure on after buying it, but with what seems like everyone buying GPUs these days, along with a mining surge again, I figured it'd be an okay pick. Not necessarily looking for advice or any of that in the sense of making a bad investment based off of something someone may suggest. Just the thoughts on my choices and possibly adding more to these in the future.  \n\n\nOther options I had considered were Amazon, Apple, and Google.

        "selftext": "With stock shortages on many different nodes from the likes of Samsung, TSMC and even Intel (which has a very dominate position in the server-space), there have been problems getting various products to market. Entire automative factories have been shut-down due to constraints on on getting chips in their vehicles. This phenomenon was predicted to be less unrelenting, but recently, many manufacturers (particularly Microsoft regarding the Xbox Series X) have basically admitted that they simply can\u2019t sell their products due to the limits on chips designer\u2019s limits of wafers of a given process node.\n\nAs a rundown, Intel, TSMC are the \u201cbig fabs\u201d that you hear about in advanced computing technology. AMD uses TSMC, but AMD is on a 4-front battle with its console, desktop CPU, server CPU, and GPU market, as well as mobile chips.\n\nEssentially, chip *designers* are being constrained by their ability to gain access to various chips. But the fabs behind these \u201cbig-name\u201d computing technology companies that you\u2019re used to hearing about are.\n\nTSMC is producing process nodes that perform very well. Except, their supply is very limited. Keep in mind, Chip *designers* will often times outsource their designs to be made on different nodes. Intel uses TSMC, even though it has its own fabs, for instance. And Intel also rents out their own fabs.\n\nThis is where $UMC and various other lesser-known semi-conductor manufacturers come in. They will likely fill the massive demand for *any* process node that chip designers can get their hands on to fill the unprecedented shortages which seem to be pushed back farther and farther.\n\nEventually, your average, run-of-the-mill devices will need chips in them, and they are likely to have difficulties working with more well-renowned chip-makers to actually put their architectures on a given node. In general, chip-manufacturers have had the lion\u2019s share of consistent performance over the past year due to increasingly innovative products from high-profile designers. It\u2019s quite possible many device-manufacturers will opt not to use larger semi-conductor fabs as big-names like AMD, NVidia, and even Apple are competing for the same nodes.\n\nAt the very least, a lot of the previous success of semi-conductor manufacturers and chip designers may potentially trickle down to lesser-utilized and less glamorous fabs.\n\nThere\u2019s already a precedent that very specialized chip designs will often go to these manufacturers, and now that the big names literally are fighting for these advanced nodes, many chipmakers have used Global Foundries and other \u201cless sexy\u201d fabs to meet demand for chips that they *need* now.\n\nIn general, companies with semiconductor fabs are likely to do well, simply due to the fact that the world in general needs more wafers, substrates etc... as infrastructure becomes more complex, digitally.\n\nI recommend researching semi-conductor manufacturers who have long been underdogs.\n\n**This is not financial advice, I am \ud83e\udd8d and I am currently sauteeing crayons in a pan**",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, February 25, 2021**\n\nStocks plummeted Thursday as a spike in Treasury yields spooked equity investors. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell by 2.4% and 1.73% respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell by 3.5%, recording its worst day since October 2020. In other news, \u201cmeme stocks\u201d favored by retail traders in Reddit and other social media users surged once again, with shares of Gamestop (GME) spiking more than 150% in the last two days, reigniting rumors that the short-squeeze is back on. The reasons behind the latest surge or unclear. While we will always support retail traders\u2019 right to freely invest in the equities they choose, we recommend a lot of caution if you decide to open a position here.\n\nUS Treasury yields rose to fresh one-year highs, breaking above 1.45% for the first time since February 2020. As a reminder, the Treasury yield represents the return on investment, or the interest, the US government is willing to pay out on their debt obligations, such as bonds. For example, if a person buys a Treasury bond with a 10-year expiration, they are lending the US government money with the expectation of being repaid the face value of the bond, plus some interest (which is the yield). In practice, higher yields make money more expensive to borrow and bonds more attractive, putting pressure on equities, especially high-growth equities like tech stocks that rely on the ability to borrow lots of money.\n\nDuring his semiannual testimony on monetary policy this week, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we\u2019ll have a robust and ultimately complete \\[economic\\] recovery.\u201d Powell\u2019s logic seems to be that higher yields in the 10-year notes are positive because it means investors are willing to bet the US economy will be able to pay them back plus interest when the timeframe of the bond expires.\n\nFurthermore, Powell reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was going to maintain its current accommodative policy posturing for the time being, keeping benchmark rates near zero and asset purchases at the current pace of $120 billion per month. He said, \"The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases.\"\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Twitter (TWTR) spiked after the company announced plans to introduce a subscription service for content creators and said it looks to double its annual revenue and accelerate user growth over the next few years. One of the only stocks to perform well today.\n* Boeing Co faces a new fine from U.S. regulators as part of an expected settlement with U.S. regulators over quality and safety-oversight lapses going back years. This comes shortly after a Boeing 787\u2019s engine caught fire mid-flight. Boeing will also have to inspect and retrofit existing 787 Dreamliners, which could potentially cost the company billions of dollars.\n* Coinbase Global made public on Thursday the prospectus for its much-anticipated initial public offering, setting up the company to possibly launch its IPO in March. Coinbase in the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, with more than 43 million verified users last year, up 34% from 32 million users in 2019\n* Target (TGT) is creating enclaves for Apple (AAPL) products at its retail stores that would double the space for the tech company's products in certain Target locations.\n* China's Geely Automobile and its Swedish sister company Volvo Cars will abandon merger plans but launch a new entity to combine their powertrain operations and expand cooperation on electric vehicles, the companies said.\n\nPrice Targets are Written in the morning premarket and do not include intraday movement\n* Booking (BKNG) with two target raises.

        "selftext": "I have been a long-term investor of AMD over the past few years and I have been rewarded immensely for it. But a trend I have been noticing for the past half-year is that despite meeting and beating expectations and guidance, high-growth stocks in the semiconductor sector seems to have hit a wall in SP. In particular, I am not just referring to AMD but NVDA as well. On the contrary, stocks with higher earnings but lower growth seem to be regaining momentum, most notably Intel, MU, TSM and others.\n\nThis has led me to exit my AMD position and take a serious look at the stock market as a whole. Over the past half-year, there has been an unjustified exuberance in EV stocks. I don't think it takes much convincing to see that the SP of multiple EV stocks (most notoriously TSLA) seem to be out-of-whack with reality and future expectations.\n\nThis has led me to think that more rational investors are either exiting the market or moving into stocks with lower growth/risk. If the EV bubble is being propped up by inexperienced investors that are not trading in-line with fundamentals, then a market correction could easily accelerate into a crash for these stocks. And investors moving into low-risk stocks prior to a crash has precedence as well (dot-com bubble). \n\nOne more bit that has me thinking: The GME and related meme stocks seem to be crashing and the shorts and more rational investors seem to be regaining the upper hand. This could serve as a momentum for others to re-look their investments in very risky and overvalued assets. Could this be the trigger for the EV bubble popping?",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, February 25th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-25-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Stocks set for mixed open after another major comeback\n\n&gt; * Dow futures hold on to slim gains Thursday, one day after the 30-stock average wiped out a 110-point loss and climbed 424 points, or 1.4%, to a record closing high. S&amp;P and Nasdaq futures dropped in the premarket. The tech-heavy Nasdaq on Wednesday erased a 1.3% drop and closed 1% higher. The S&amp;P 500 finished 1.1% higher after recovering from a 0.6% decline. Two days of reassuring words on interest rates and inflation from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell helped push stocks higher and tempered bond yield gains Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield on Thursday rose to 1.45%, around the highest levels in a year. Bitcoin rose 2% early Thursday, back above $50,000.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Jobless, GDP, durable goods data all out before the bell\n\n&gt; * The government is set to release weekly jobless claims, revised fourth quarter gross domestic product and January durable goods orders at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect a drop in new filings for unemployment benefits to 845,000. GDP in Q4 is seen rising slightly from the initial estimate to a 4.2% annual growth rate. Forecasts call for a 1% rise in durable goods orders last month, double December\u2019s increase.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. GameStop shares surge again as Reddit favorites rally again\n\n&gt; * GameStop climbed more than 70% in Thursday\u2019s premarket trading as heavily-shorted stocks favored by Reddit traders surged again. Shares of the video game retailer doubled Wednesday to nearly $92 each after Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell resigned. The GameStop frenzy last month sent shares skyrocketing, causing a short-squeeze on a number of Wall Street hedge funds. GameStop traded below $20 per share in early January, before soaring to an intraday high of $483 on Jan. 28, a surge of more than 2,300%. The stock crashed below $50 by mid-February before Wednesday\u2019s spike higher.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Pfizer, Moderna work on shots against strain first discovered in South Africa\n\n&gt; * Pfizer and BioNTech said on Thursday they\u2019re testing a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine to better understand the immune response against new variants of the coronavirus. They are also in talks with regulatory authorities about testing a vaccine modified to protect specifically against the new variant originally found in South Africa.\n\n&gt; * Moderna has shipped to the National Institutes of Health doses of a new Covid-19 vaccine designed to provide better protection against the variant spreading in South Africa. The new vaccine is ready to be tested in an early stage clinical trial to determine if it can be used as a booster shot against the highly transmissible strain.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. GOP rallies against Democrats\u2019 Covid relief package\n\n&gt; * Republicans rallied solidly against Democrats\u2019 proposed $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill as lawmakers awaited a decision by the Senate\u2019s parliamentarian that could bolster or potentially kill a pivotal provision hiking the federal minimum wage. Despite narrow majorities on Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders were poised to push the sweeping package through the House on Friday. They were hoping the Senate, where changes seem likely, would follow quickly enough to have legislation on President Joe Biden\u2019s desk by mid-March.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/cMtfcj3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hQSCDGR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/SQdkCZb7/econcal1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/7Bu1KiL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/iJIWrht.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/TGSsG6Z.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/jLYSBwB.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/7x6BL9M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nRANzSs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gIMTkdc.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/sX4d6Cd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/roCiE2I.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VZXsdqE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/E0eGZ2A.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/gJcNHhMB/divical1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/PqQSDyMw/divical2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/N0cNLSRt/divical3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR #4!](https://i.postimg.cc/JzJ6rMDK/divical4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* LI\n* LOTZ\n* KOSS\n* NVDA\n* XL\n* CLF\n* ALT\n* MRNA\n* TDOC\n* VIRX\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-gamestop-koss-corp-wayfair-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **GameStop (GME)** \u2013 GameStop remains on watch after another Reddit-fueled surge Wednesday in the video game retailer\u2019s shares, as well as other so-called \u201cReddit stocks\u201d like BlackBerry (BB), AMC Entertainment (AMC) and Koss Corp.

I'm heavily invested in stuff like TSLA, NVDA, FANGM, GM, NIO, BLNK. \n\nAre there stocks that the retail environment has missed and are appropriately valued?

        "selftext": "Hi everyone! I\u2019ve been following this sub for a few months and have found it very helpful, so I was hoping to get some advice from experienced investors such as yourselves. \n\nI\u2019ve been investing since December 2018. I started with five stocks (TD, FTS.CA, CNR, NVDA, &amp; ACB), and for my first year, I didn\u2019t add much money or even look very often. This proved to work out in some cases (e.g., NVDA) and screwed me over in others (e.g., ACB), but I considered it a learning opportunity and invested in a few more stocks at the start of last year. I didn\u2019t spend much time in the market until Fall 2020, where at the start of November, I began my tuition and really started to love investing and longer term swing trading (2 months average).\n\nLong story short, across a TFSA, a cash account, and a crypto account, I\u2019ve invested about $64,000 and as of today, it\u2019s grown to about $115,000, nearly doubling my money. While I can attribute some of the gains to research and due diligence, I really feel like almost everything I invest in has been going up a crazy amount lately. I\u2019m nervous for the inevitable pullback and wondering how others are approaching this? I don\u2019t typically keep much money in cash, and worry that if I did, the market will keep booming without me. Then again, I don\u2019t want to lose all my gains because this money will help my fianc\u00e9 and I buy a house and support our future family sometime next year. How are you all approaching the market right now and should I keep doing what I\u2019m doing? It\u2019s been working well for me so far!\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "selftext": "Hi! I've been getting into investing a lot recently, and I'm doing this mainly for my own experience. I'll take any feedback or comments y'all have. Let me know what you think of my first list!\n\nTo start off, I want to disclose how I picked this list. I used Morgan Stanley's stock screener to find tickers with their \"overweight\" rating and a price below their given price target (if applicable). Next, I would cross-reference that with RH and Zack's stock analysis. Finally, I would search for each ticker on Reddit in order to see what the sentiment towards the stock was. After compiling the list, I went through each stock individually again and assigned it a ranking of 1-5 (1 being safe, 5 being more speculative/risky), as well as providing a hypothetical dollar amount that I would invest in at the current price.\n\nThe goal of this list was to pick a balanced portfolio between aggressive growth and long term consistency. I have a huge bias towards semiconductors, biomedical, tech, and industrial/material.\n\nI'll start with the stocks I gave a 1 rating\n\n1. MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, FB, AAPL ($8k in each)\n\nI believe these will be here for a loooong time as well as continue to grow. These seem pretty safe to me and make up the foundation of this portfolio\n\nNow we get to stocks with a 2 rating. These are my favorites, as I see them having high growth potential and staying power (still riskier than 1s, however)\n\n2. NVDA, AMD, TXG, AMAT, MT, VALE, RTX, TDG, QRVO, NIO, TSLA ($5k in each)\n\n Now we get on to the 3s! These will follow a similar pattern of higher risk, less amount invested.\n\n3. TER, LRCX, ON, MCHP, FSLY, CRSR, RDSB, DOCU ($3k in each)\n\nNow we get to the 4s. These are mostly speculative\n\n4. SPCE, ANTM, NET, ACAD, ABCL ($2k in each)\n\nThat list was pretty short. The 5s will be the most risky/most speculative. They will have the lowest amount invested in them.\n\n5. TGH, SEDG, HUM, AMKR.\n\nOh and positions: 20 VOO, 62 QQQ, 28 LIT, and 54 PLTR.

Both TECL and SOXL are coming up on fairly substantial splits soon, with a 10-1 for the former and a 15-1 for the latter, and I'm thinking of making some short term moves on one of them, but I'm not sure which. Both have seen massive growth in the last year. \n\nMy conundrum is obviously picking one. I'm hoping FNGU does decently enough before March 1st so I can cash out, take some profits, and spread some of it into my current holdings, but also a chunk of it into one of these funds. \n\nTECL has some pretty smart holdings with Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, among others. I believe in these companies and feel like they're poised to keep growing. On the other hand, SOXL has seen tremendous growth and seems to just deal with semiconductors, which aren't going away any time soon. \n\nI'm considering a fairly short hold. While both have seen a lot of growth, I also understand both are hilariously volatile, so I'm thinking of just seeing where each ends up in maybe 6 months tops and just taking whatever I get and moving most of it back into safer bets. I know 3x leveraged funds aren't popular here, I see a lot of people recommending to stay away from them, but I'm willing to take a chance. \n\nAny insight would be appreciated.",

        "selftext": "We all know of the infamous Becky portfolio.  Our wives wake up in the morning, put on their $LULU's and head off to get their daily fix of $SBUX.  They scroll through $ETSY enjoying their coffee and while they are out they stop by Nordstrum ($JWN) and $ULTA so they can buy makeup so they look really nice for when they're riding their BF's cock.  We all know this is true, because these stocks kick ass.  They are some of the best performers of their time, because us guys simp our dicks off for women and shell out our hard earned tendies so we can hopefully have permission to jerk off during the weekly cuckoldry session.\n\nBut you know what else we simp our dicks off for?\n\nGaming, motherfucker.\n\nYeah, that's right.  The boys all game, and we all game together.  This shit is going to explode because there's nothing men spend more money on collectively outside of women and beer.  And until PornHub IPOs there isn't a better investment sitting in the market right now.  Let me paint you a picture:\n\nYou wake up Saturday morning after a long Wendy's shift the night before.  You have plenty of tendies sitting in your bank account from your last direct deposit and despite your Robinhood being -69% from your GME \"investment\" and the $600 you spent on hookers in the last week you've got enough money to buy yourself some vidya games.\n\nBut wait, you need something to play them on!  You've got some options here.  If you're a financially responsible peasant you're probably going to want to go with a Console like $MSFT Xbox or the $SNE Playstation.  You'll buy your games from $GME, $AMZN, or $BBY and you'll call it a day.\n\nBut you?  You're a rich motherfucker.  That stimmy check just hit and your peener is erect in all of its 3 inches of glory.  You're about to upgrade yourself to a gaming PC.  First off, your Gaming PC needs some parts.  Your $CRSR power supply, fans, and RAM look rather sharp.  Your $AMD processor is lightning fast and leaves $INTC chips in the dust.  And your latest generation graphics card from $NVDA can't be beat.  You'll also need some gaming gear too!  Good thing we have our old friend $CRSR and $LOGI to help us out here.\n\nBut what will you be playing?  The new Grand Theft Auto from $TTWO of course.  And maybe for the more morally bankrupt among us (sus) even $EA games.  And what powers these games?  Game engines.  Unity ($U) will be powering many of your favorite steam games.\n\nSo that's it.  You are ready to game with the boys.  But wait!  We have to throw $DKNG in as well.  Gaming with the boys wouldn't be the same without competing to see who can lose the most money over some bullshit.\n\nGaming is taking off my friends.  Keeping Gaming PC's up to date and the culture around gaming will become to men what the daily $SBUX fix is to women.  Men will begin treating PC gaming like we do cars.  We all strive to drive something nice and to take care of her.  You want to position yourself into the Chad portfolio now, because by the time the Wall Street Journal is talking about it it will already be too late.\n\nSo, do I have your vote of confidence boys?",

        "selftext": "Curious about this one. Consolidation for 6 months with a very narrow channel. \n\nAll the air got let out of the bull run when the Nomura whale gamma push ended (?) beginning of sept.
