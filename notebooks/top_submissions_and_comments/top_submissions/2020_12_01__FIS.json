        "selftext": "*#Clown Market DD:*# Buckle up buckaroos I'm gonna show you how to wine and dine on tendies at Wendys this very Wednesday. Neither Bull, nor Bear, I am full-on Clown and this is my native market. Given the recent Clownish trends, which unequivocally guarantee future results (*cf.* \"New Paradigm\" inflection point of [Figure A](https://transportgeography.org/?page_id=9035), the contents of Airbnb's S-1 disclosure statement (available [here](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-306257/)) and other SEC filings (available [here](https://sec.report/CIK/0001559720)) are completely irrelevant, like seatbelts on a seadoo. \n\n**TLDR;** Imagine an amount of money you are willing to lose and then double it. Buy ABNB at Fidelity on IPO day, shares on Wednesday afternoon, and calls the following week.\n\nNow before you parade down the street blasting your kazoo, let's go over WHY to buy. UBER IPO'd last year at $41. This was a typical case of insider investors realizing their shares of a shitty, unprofitable company were better off in the hands of retail mothershmuckers. UBER has become even less profitable in the interim, so naturally the stock price has risen to $54. Now some of you bigbrains might be furrowing your fiveheads--ABNB has a clear path to profitability and has indeed [turned a profit](https://www.cnet.com/news/airbnb-first-profit-home-rental-travel-startups/) on multiple occasions. My elf ears hear you ask:\n\n&gt;\"Under Clownmarket rules doesn't this mean ABNB will trade flat like a boomer bond?\" \n\n\"Nein!\" is my reply. Fear not, for ABNB posted a [$322m loss](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/12/21134477/airbnb-loss-profit-ipo-safety-tech-marketing) last year. Although it's not as sexy as [TSLA's $862m loss](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272130/net-loss-of-tesla/) in the same year, we can hope ABNB's costs of expanding into China will swell like an ass-eater's lymph nodes. The analysts certainly think so. Cordwell has a price target of [$75 a share](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ABNB/price-target/) following the likely $45-$50 IPO target.\n\nAlthough Airbnb is clearly just Uber for your mattress, some skeptics demand more metrics. Compare Booking.com (BKNG) which IPO'd at $483.99 in 1999 and dropped to $7.88 by 2001. Could this happen to ABNB? Absolutely not. Why? Because I got bedbugs once at a booking.com dive with fake pics, and I didn't even call their customer service to get my eleven dollars back. Contrast that with when I got kicked out of an Airbnb in Bali six years ago, I got on the phone with a **specialist** who **investigated** my **case** and gave me a bunch of store credit for shit I didn't even ask for. Add in the fact that BKNG now trades at $2125 and you've got yourself a real *fuck it why not* scenario.  \n\nAnd finally, *Google Trends* [shows \"airbnb\" is half as hype as \"tesla\"](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=airbnb,tesla) which logically puts ABNB at 50% of TSLA's $558b valuation, =$279b, which would put ABNB's share price at $465.\n\nPut the kazoos away boys, this 10-bagger calls for a fanfaronade of vuvuzelas!",

        "selftext": "[From the article](https://www.reuters.com/article/cryptocurrencies-sp/sp-dow-jones-indices-to-launch-cryptocurrency-indexes-in-2021-idUSL1N2IJ0TG):\n\n&gt; LONDON (Reuters) - S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, a division of financial data provider S&amp;P Global Inc, said on Thursday that it will launch cryptocurrency indices in 2021, making it the latest major finance company to enter the nascent asset class.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P DJI-branded products will use data from New York-based virtual currency company Lukka on more than 550 of the top traded coins, the companies said.  S&amp;P\u2019s clients will be able to work with the index provider to create customized indices and other benchmarking tools on cryptocurrencies, S&amp;P and Lukka said in a joint statement.  S&amp;P and Lukka hope more reliable pricing data will make it easier for investors to access the new asset class, and reduce some of the risks of the very volatile and speculative market, they said.\n\n&gt; \u201cWith digital assets such as cryptocurrencies becoming a rapidly emerging asset class, the time is right for independent, reliable and user-friendly benchmarks,\u201d said Peter Roffman, global head of innovation and strategy at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. The move by one of the world\u2019s most well-known index providers could help cryptocurrencies become more mainstream investments. It comes as bitcoin continues to soar to record highs against the dollar, boosted by increased demand from investors who say the virtual currency is a hedge against inflation and a safe-haven asset.\n\n&gt; Bitcoin was trading at $19,300 in latest trading on Thursday, having soared around 170% this year. Cryptocurrencies have been around for more than a decade, but have started attracting more interest from large financial companies over the last few years.\n\n&gt; Large firms including Fidelity Investments and Japan\u2019s Nomura Holdings Inc have starting safeguarding bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for institutional investors, while major exchanges have started offering bitcoin derivatives. The emergence of more mainstream market infrastructure has made the asset class more accessible for institutional investors, with hedge fund managers such as Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller saying they include bitcoin in their broad investment strategies.",

I was encouraged by several to share my work with this sub and while I am not familiar with the sub I thought why not?\n\nUltimately, I regret posting in WSB. It is a strange place. I've tried to answer them in the comments but it is an amazing casino. Its literally a casino. I think the quality of my DD (regardless of whether you know about the SPAC) speaks for itself.\n\nThe post below is really a primer. The link to the first DD is where the money is.\n\nHere's the PSTH S1\n\n[**https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811882/000119312520175042/d930055ds1.htm**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811882/000119312520175042/d930055ds1.htm)\n\nCheers,\n\nxxoo\n\n\\----------------\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **$PSTH \u2013 Activist Investor Bill Ackman\u2019s Gigantic SPAC \u2013 Updated DD** \ud83d\ude80\n\nI last wrote on PSTH roughly 30 days ago and at the time the SPAC was getting very little press attention. Ackman announced the SPAC in the spring of 2020 and it started trading in July at an NAV of $20. Ackman has steadily collected an impressive investor list, filled with long term and reputable names.\n\nSince then and since my last post, a lot has happened. This DD serves to provide an update and recap for those new to the stock and considering a play here.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nPSTH is a gigantic SPAC with a reputable CEO and the most impressive investor list ever created. For context, Chamath's largest SPAC (IPOF) is worth $1.6B. PSTH is worth $5B with the option to increase to $7B. It is enormous. The company is on record for a Q1 announcement and is targeting a \u201cmature unicorn\u201d. At an NAV of $20, the downside risk is capped significantly while the upside potential is very high depending on target.\n\n**Two Key points in addition to the TLDR:**\n\nTwo aspects of this stock that most people miss to begin with (I've engaged with enough of them online to know):\n\n**1)** Tontine: detailed below but in essence, for every common share you buy now AND hold through the merger and ticker change, you get 2/9 a warrant exercisable at $23. That means for every 9 commons you own, you will receive another 2 commons later at a price of $23 (the stock trades at $26 today)\n\n**AKA if you own 99 commons through the merger, you get 22 more shares at $23 cost each simply for holding through the merger.**\n\n**THIS is what 2/9 Tontine means. It can grow to 3/9 or 4/9 if people choose not to hold through the merger, because the number of warrants is constant and will all be given out to someone.**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*Another note here: beware the manager's right to redeem warrants. This is in the S-1 but the manager's have the right to redeem warrants if the share price meets or exceeds $36 on 20/30 trading days. They have to give you 30 days notice, so just keep that in mind. The warrants are exercisable at the later of 1) 30 days post merger or 2) 1 year post listing which was in July 2020. So as long as you are keeping an eye on events, you will be okay. Don't fall asleep on the stipulation though.**\n\n**For example, if the stock price was to jump to $50 on LOI and then the merger happens 2 months later, 30 days post that merger you warrants go live but so does the manager's right to issue a redemption notice. At that point you would likely consider redeeming the warrants since at the end of that window they could be taken by manager for pennies each. No upside cap based on my reading of the S1, but just be vigilant once the merger is announced.**\n\n**2)** The bank set up. Typically the big banks gouge the eyes out of IPOs and traditional SPACS with fees, etc. We have seen big big misses on the order of $3-4B for both Snowflake and ABNB. With PSTH, Ackman has went a different route abandoning the large cap banks and instead giving underwriting privileges to a ton of small and minority owned banks and credit lenders. This is a legacy move. He's more interested in changing the landscape because he believes (and has explained) that quality public entry structures are the best improvements we can make for the economy, society, and the common retail investor. The structure also incentivizes him to make an exceptional deal, that's the only way he makes money through the warrant system, if the deal goes well. This is why HUGE names are on board, but only one big bank is. This SPAC is opposing the conventional bank-led IPO process. That in itself, is a game changer and once this pops and gets press you can bet your boots that future SPAC leaders (Chamath, etc.) will transition to this method.\n\n**Background information and recent events**\n\n\u00b7 In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH \u2013 the SPAC raised $5B in proceeds with the option to take it to $7B (leveraging funds from PSCM, Ackman\u2019s hedge fund) making it the biggest SPAC ever created.\n\n\u00b7 In multiple interviews following the SPACs debut, Ackman has been clear about several things:\n\no He is hunting for a \u201cmature unicorn\u201d - unicorn is defined as $1B or more but \"mature\" here is the key, he's looking for a company worth tens of Billions.\n\no He has stipulated a predictable business is most ideal with steady cash flow or guarantees along the lines of predictable growth\n\no This means a large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company according to Ackman. He has explicitly said he's also friendly to a FINTECH\n\no He has a buying power of approximately $7B dollars at present and is hoping to capture a minority stake of between 15-20% of a large enterprise. This means a valuation in the ballpark of $30-40B.\n\n**o Ackman has recruit an incredible board of directors at PSTH, leveraging raw talent from both media and fintech sectors:**\n\nLisa Gersh - Former management executive at NBC News\n\nMichael Ovitz - Former President at The Walt Disney Company\n\nJackie Reses - Former executive at Square, mobile payment company\n\nJoseph Steinberg - Current Chairman of Jefferies Financial Group Inc.\n\n**\\*\\*We don't want to jump to conclusions, but on review of the board, this is certainly a MEDIA and FINTECH heavy group of executives\\*\\***\n\no He has delivered on developing an incredibly impressive list of investors thus far\n\no **Investors in the SPAC so far include:**\n\n\u00a7 Baupost Group (headed by Seth Klarman, $30B hedge fund manager, \u201cthe next Buffet\u201d and noted value investor) = $450M position\n\n\u00a7 Guggenheim Capital = $560M position\n\n\u00a7 Ontario Teachers Pension Plan = $290M position\n\n\u00a7 Soroban Capital = $290M position\n\n\u00a7 Wells Fargo = $290M position\n\n\u00a7 Kevin \u201cSharktank\u201d O\u2019Leary = undisclosed position to be reported in Q1\n\n\u00a7 **Warren Buffet\u2019s** position remains speculative. He recently left his JPM position and is secretly adding to a big position (pushing the filing deadline requirements as he does whenever he builds a big position as to not cause an overprice of the stock before he finishes buying). There is also a large undisclosed position in PSTH held by someone from Q3. This remains completely speculative and it may not be Buffet but another large stakeholder or pension fund.\n\n**\u00a7 KEY Point: \\*\\*No other big banks have secured big positions in PSTH\\*\\***\n\no The investor list above is just a sample of the top holders. Each of these positions were made at the end of Q3 of this year. The stock has risen $2 or 10% of NAV since this time (not much considering the size and runway ahead).\n\n**PSTH SPAC Design**\n\n\u00b7 PSTH is called a SPAC, but as others have pointed out, it does not resemble any other SPAC, in size or design. Some details:\n\n\u00b7 PSTH incentivizes long-term holding and only dramatic upward shifts in the stock price through its unique \u201ctontine\u201d structure. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional warrant is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long-term holding of the company and is referenced in the \"tontine\" name - look it up, pretty cool.\n\n**Targets**\n\nMuch speculation exists online as to what companies Ackman is targeting. Here are some key points:\n\n\u00b7 Earlier in the year he commented publicly on Air B&amp;B, Stripe and Bloomberg. He praised all three companies publicly.\n\n\u00b7 Since that interview, Air B&amp;B has gone public via IPO and notably lost out on $3.8B during the valuation process and IPO\n\n**\u00b7 Stripe has generated intense interest online.** Despite the hype, the Collison brothers (head of Stripe) have publicly commented via tweet that \u201cno such deal\u201d had been struck after a WSB twitter account congratulated the brother\u2019s in a silly way. Despite this, many (including me) believe that Stripe is still very much in play and that some of this is a negotiation tactic. When questioned on Stripe, Ackman was gracious but said that the company was not ready to go public, citing managerial and personnel deficits only. In the immediate aftermath of that comment (literally the next week), Stripe went on an insane hiring spree specific to Public Managerial positions. This has been documented extensively by [u/YoloCapitalMgmt](https://www.reddit.com/u/YoloCapitalMgmt/) on twitter. Ackman is on record saying his biggest regret in investing was not getting in on MasterCard due to regulation uncertainty. He said the best investment you could ever make, assuming valuation made sense, was in a company that made royalties on others spending money. He has since commented that PSTH would very much be in favor of merging with a FINTECH. Big name FINTECH EXEC Jackie Reeses (former head of square) has been added to the board of PSTH, creating even more speculation around Stripe as a target).\n\n**\u00b7 Bloomberg remains in play.** There has been no definitive declination by Bloomberg and rumors in the past exist in both directions. Michael Bloomberg has both commented that he would not take the company public and that there could be interest in a minority stake being sold.\n\n\u00b7 Other potential targets that have been floated with little in the way of momentum include SpaceX, Fidelity, Inspire Brands and Subway.\n\n**Target summary based on my view**\n\nTargets in order of likelihood of Q1 merger announcement\n\n1. Bloomberg\n2. Stripe\n3. Fidelity\n\n**Bill Ackman**\n\nA few notes on the CEO of the SPAC, William A. Ackman:\n\n\u00b7 A billionaire activist hedge fund manager with a highly interesting track record if you\u2019re interested in looking into it.\n\n\u00b7 He has had some misses in years gone by most notably Herbalife short (where he was correct but still lost money) and Valeant.\n\n\u00b7 In recent years he has mounted an insane comeback poster annualized return of 50 and 60%.\n\n\u00b7 Some of his most iconic recent plays include Chipotle (take a look at that story) and Canadian Pacific\n\n\u00b7 Notably he shorted the market prior to COVID, correctly predicting a financial collapse. Through the use of CDS (made popular during the 2008 financial crisis, he turned a $27M insurance policy into a $2.6B trade in March of this year. He subsequently used the funds to advance positions in high quality companies he was a holder of (when these stocks were at their absolute lows in March).\n\n**Some other notes**\n\nThis is a highly interesting play and to get in you are betting on Ackman and the impressive investor list he has obtained.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t objective financial advice, this play is incredibly enticing and one worth looking into.",

        "selftext": "\ud83d\ude80 **$PSTH \u2013 Activist investor Bill Ackman\u2019s Gigantic SPAC \u2013 Updated DD** \ud83d\ude80 \n\nI last wrote on PSTH roughly 30 days ago and at the time the SPAC was getting very little press attention at all. Ackman announced the SPAC in the spring of 2020 and it started trading in July at an NAV of $20. Ackman has steadily collected an impressive investor list, filled with long term and reputable investors.\n\nSince then and since my last post a lot has happened. This DD serves to provide an update and recap for those new to the stock and considering a play here.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nPSTH is a gigantic SPAC with a reputable CEO and the most impressive investor list ever created. The company is on record for a Q1 announcement and is targeting a \u201cmature unicorn\u201d. At an NAV of $20, the downside risk is capped significantly while the upside potential is very high depending on target.\n\n**Background information and recent events**\n\n\u00b7 In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH \u2013 the SPAC raised $5B in proceeds with the option to take it to $7B (leveraging funds from PSCM, Ackman\u2019s hedge fund) making it the biggest SPAC ever created.\n\n\u00b7 In multiple interviews following the SPACs debut, Ackman has been clear about several things:\n\no He is hunting for a \u201cmature unicorn\u201d\n\no He has stipulated a predictable business is most ideal with steady cash flow or guarantees along the lines of predictable growth\n\no This means large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company\n\no He has a buying power of approximately $7B dollars at present and is hoping to capture a minority stake of between 15-20% of a large enterprise. This means a valuation in the ballpark of $40B.\n\no He has delivered on developing an incredibly impressive list of investors thus far\n\no **Investors in the SPAC so far include:** \n\n\u00a7 Baupost Group (headed by Seth Klarman, $30B hedge fund manager, \u201cthe next Buffet\u201d and noted value investor) = $450M position\n\n\u00a7 Guggenheim Capital = $560M position\n\n\u00a7 Ontario Teachers Pension Plan = $290M position\n\n\u00a7 Soroban Capital = $290M position\n\n\u00a7 Wells Fargo = $290M position\n\n\u00a7 Kevin \u201cSharktank\u201d O\u2019Leary = undisclosed position to be reported in Q1\n\n\u00a7 Warren Buffet\u2019s position remains speculative. He recently left his JPM position and is secretly adding to a big position (pushing the filing deadline requirements as he does whenever he builds a big position as to not cause an overprice of the stock before he finishes buying). There is also a large undisclosed position in PSTH held by someone from Q3. This remains completely speculative and it may not be Buffet but another large stakeholder or pension fund.\n\n\u00a7 KEY Point: \\*\\*No other big banks have secured big positions in PSTH\\*\\*\n\no The investor list above is just a sample of the top holders. Each of these positions were made at the end of Q3 of this year. The stock has risen $2 or 10% of NAV since this time (not much considering the size and runway ahead).\n\n**PSTH SPAC Design**\n\n\u00b7 PSTH is called a SPAC, but as others have pointed out, it does not resemble any other SPAC, in size or design. Some details:\n\n\u00b7 PSTH incentivizes long-term holding and only dramatic upward shifts in the stock price through its unique \u201ctontine\u201d structure. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional warrant is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long-term holding of the company and is referenced in the \"tontine\" name - look it up, pretty cool.\n\n**Targets**\n\nMuch speculation exists online as to what companies Ackman is targeting. Here are some key points:\n\n\u00b7 Earlier in the year he commented publicly on Air B&amp;B, Stripe and Bloomberg. He praised all three companies publicly.\n\n\u00b7 Since that interview, Air B&amp;B has gone public via IPO and notably lost out on $3.8B during the valuation process and IPO\n\n\u00b7 Stripe has generated intense interest online. Despite the hype, the Collison brothers (head of Stripe) have publicly commented via tweet that \u201cno such deal\u201d had been struck after a WSB twitter account congratulated the brother\u2019s in a silly way. Despite this, many (including me) believe that Stripe is still very much in play and that some of this is a negotiation tactic. When questioned on Stripe, Ackman was gracious but said that the company was not ready to go public, citing managerial and personnel deficits only. In the immediate aftermath of that comment (literally the next week), Stripe went on an insane hiring spree specific to Public Managerial positions. This has been documented extensively by u/YoloCapitalMgmt on twitter. Ackman is on record saying his biggest regret in investing was not getting in on MasterCard due to regulation uncertainty. He said the best investment you could ever make, assuming valuation made sense, was in a company that made royalties on others spending money. He has since commented that PSTH would very much be in favor of merging with a FINTECH. Big name FINTECH EXEC Jackie Reeses (former head of square) has been added to the board of PSTH, creating even more speculation around Stripe as a target).\n\n\u00b7 Bloomberg remains in play. There has been no definitive declination by Bloomberg and rumors in the past exist in both directions. Michael Bloomberg has both commented that he would not take the company public and that there could be interest in a minority stake being sold.\n\n\u00b7 Other potential targets that have been floated with little in the way of momentum include SpaceX, Fidelity, Inspire Brands and Subway.\n\n**Target summary based on my view**\n\nTargets in order of likelihood of Q1 merger announcement\n\n1. Bloomberg\n\n2. Stripe\n\n3. Fidelity \n\n**Bill Ackman**\n\nA few notes on the head of the SPAC, Ackman:\n\n\u00b7 A billionaire activist hedge fund manager with a highly interesting track record if you\u2019re interested in looking into it.\n\n\u00b7 He has had some misses in years gone by most notably Herbalife short (where he was correct but still lost money) and Valeant.\n\n\u00b7 In recent years he has mounted an insane comeback poster annualized return of 50 and 60%. \n\n\u00b7 Some of his most iconic recent plays include Chipotle (take a look at that story) and Canadian Pacific\n\n\u00b7 Notably he shorted the market prior to COVID, correctly predicting a financial collapse. Through the use of CDS (made popular during the 2008 financial crisis, he turned a $27M insurance policy into a $2.6B trade in March of this year. He subsequently used the funds to advance positions in high quality companies he was a holder of (when these stocks were at their absolute lows in March).\n\n**Some other notes**\n\nThis is a highly interesting play and to get in you are betting on Ackman and the impressive investor list he has obtained.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t objective financial advice, this play is incredibly enticing and one worth looking into\n\n**Resources**\n\n\u00b7 Ackman interviews: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzz5SGpDrc4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzz5SGpDrc4) \n\n\u00b7 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaCarSyBk4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaCarSyBk4) \n\n\u00b7 Klarman position: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-does-seth-klarman-pershing-165111126.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-does-seth-klarman-pershing-165111126.html) \n\n\u00b7 Guggenheim position: [https://whalewisdom.com/schedule13d/view/guggenheim-capital-llc-sc-13g-2020-08-10-psthu](https://whalewisdom.com/schedule13d/view/guggenheim-capital-llc-sc-13g-2020-08-10-psthu) \n\n\u00b7 Buffet leaves JPM: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-built-8-billion-jpmorgan-stake-slashed-2020-11-1029846193](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-built-8-billion-jpmorgan-stake-slashed-2020-11-1029846193) \n\n\u00b7 Buffet secret position: [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/warren-buffett-could-be-building-a-secret-position.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/warren-buffett-could-be-building-a-secret-position.html) \n\n\u00b7 PSTH (Ackman) recent letter to investors, see PSTH section: [https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/08/28125504/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-June-2020-Interim.pdf](https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/08/28125504/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-June-2020-Interim.pdf) \n\n\u00b7 My original DD (pinned by mods, is here): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth\\_dd\\_klarman\\_buffet\\_ackman\\_the\\_unicorn\\_hunter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth_dd_klarman_buffet_ackman_the_unicorn_hunter/) \n\n\u00b7 u/YoloCapitalMgmt on twitter provides an exceptional documentation around PSTH with a specific focus on Stripe: [https://twitter.com/yolocapitalmgmt?lang=en](https://twitter.com/yolocapitalmgmt?lang=en) \n\no Many of the other PSTH related twitter accounts are just opinion accounts attempting to either pump or dump specific stocks.

Short interest died on 20th of November then literally the next trading session (that following Monday) started that week of back to back 10-20% gains.

This is roughly a 3.4x increase in float volume. PLTR is going from \\~.5B to \\~1.7B float (a 3.4x increase in float).

        "selftext": "Alright you *shrimp-dick fuck nuggets*, listen up because we\u2019re making fucking tendies. QS or QuantumScape has been seeing crazy momentum in the market recently. They are trading at around 63, but I think this is going to absolutely DUMP on December 21st and possibly longer.\n\nSo let\u2019s look at Quantum Scape, they are a battery company that merged with KCAC (Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp), and what is even more interesting, is that Volkswagen has been invested and partnered with this company since 2012.  \n\nAccording to this source\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/)\n\n\u201cVolkswagen entered the picture in 2012. The automaker has invested a total of $300 million in QuantumScape, including $200 million this year.\u201d *Pay attention to the 200 million this year, it may be very big, but we will come back to that at the very end.* \n\nThe same article states the following, \u201cQuantumScape said it was able to raise more than $700 million through the business combination, a figure that includes $500 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. The raise was anchored by institutional investors including **Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company** and **Janus Transaction**\u201d\n\nSo we see 500 million of 700 million dollars are from PIPE shares. Here\u2019s the part where our dick go a slack 2.5in, to firm 3in\u2026\n\n**Pipe shares can be sold after a certain amount of time**, and we all know what happens when massive sell off\u2019s happen.  \n\nAccording to the Registration Statement published by the SEC about Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp, \u201cPursuant to the Subscription Agreements, Kensington **agreed** that, **within 15 business days** after the Closing (the \u201cFiling Deadline\u201d), Kensington will **file** **with** the SEC (at Kensington\u2019s sole cost and expense) a registration statement **registering the resale** of the PIPE Shares.\u201d\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811414/000119312520290474/d14810ds4a.htm\n\nLet\u2019s break down what this means exactly because the language can be confusing (at least it was to me at first because I\u2019m retarded, why else am I here?).\n\nThere is a 15 day countdown starting AFTER their closing day, this was Nov 27th when they officially merged, which was a Friday. Because this 15 day \u201ccountdown\u201d only includes business days, that means the countdown actually starts the following Monday, Nov 30th, since that is the next business day that follows the closing day. Now, during this countdown Kensington will file WITH the SEC a \u201cregistration statement registering the resale of PIPE shares\u201d. So this registration statement will register the shares to be sold. Now, the word \u201cregister\u201d for the resale of the shares may sound ambiguous. Does it mean they now have the potential to be sold, but maybe on a different day? Does this registration mean they CAN IN FACT be sold once they\u2019re registered? Well this next piece of info will be useful to understand, hopefully making your smooth marble brains get some fucking wrinkles.  \n\n\u201cSince this offering was a PIPE, the buyers cannot sell their shares until the company files its resale registration statement with the SEC.\u00a0**However, an issuer generally cannot sell more than 20% of its outstanding stock at a discount without receiving prior approval from current shareholders**.\u201d *(We will get to the importance of the bolded area at the end)*\n\nSource: \n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe.asp#:\\~:text=Since%20this%20offering%20was%20a,prior%20approval%20from%20current%20shareholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe.asp#:~:text=Since%20this%20offering%20was%20a,prior%20approval%20from%20current%20shareholders).\n\n\u201cOnce the SEC declares the registration statement effective, the PIPE investors are then generally able to freely resell their shares in the trading market.\u201d\n\n[https://www.paulhastings.com/docs/default-source/PDFs/715.pdf](https://www.paulhastings.com/docs/default-source/PDFs/715.pdf)\n\nYou might ask \u201cIs there a lock up for these PIPE shares?\u201d And the answer to that is that it is contingent on whether or not the resale registration statement is *effective* or not. So far as I can tell (once again, am retarded), at the end of the 15 day countdown, it\u2019s merely a countdown to have a resale registration agreement written up in general, not necessarily an effective one.  \n\nHowever, from the same SEC document it states \u201cKensington is separately required at all times to maintain an **effective** resale registration statement for the benefit of the Holders.\u201d\n\nSo, now we know they have to make this registration AND they have to do it in a 15 business day period. With some math we can figure out exactly what day PIPE shares can be sold off. I\u2019m not going to talk down to you autists, even though you\u2019re retarded, but 15 business days after November 30th is December 18th. But December 18th is the fifteenth day of the countdown, so it can\u2019t be sold then. Keep in mind that December 18th is a Friday also, so we can expect a BLOODY RED MONDAY for QS if they are going to sell their PIPE shares. Now that\u2019s a big IF.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at just how much PIPE shares make up of the total shares.  \n\nFrom the same SEC document\u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018PIPE\u2019 means the sale of PIPE Shares to the Subscribers, for a purchase price of **$10.00 per share** and an **aggregate purchase price of $500\u00a0million**, in a private placement.\u201d\n\nSo what we are looking at is 50 million shares potentially sold off on Monday the 18th. How much is this in reality?\n\nWell according to [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qs/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qs/institutional-holdings)\n\nTheir outstanding shares right now are 189 million. This means that these pipe shares make up 26.5% of ALL of QS\u2019s shares. If we were to see a sell off of this amount, the value of QS would plunder to such an inconceivable amount we could walk away with major tendies.\n\nNow the question is\u2026.are they going to sell their shares? Well if we take a look at WHO bought these PIPE shares, we can most likely answer that. Fidelity and Janus are both investment companies who are involved in mutual funds and have clients that they make money for. Because these pipe shares were valued at 10 dollar each, while also looking at QS\u2019s current price. They are currently up 600%+ with 50 million shares\u2026would you take that profit?\n\nNot only that, but the discussion of the \u201cSPAC bubble\u201d has been trending for a few weeks now. As we know, SPAC\u2019s have been huge this year, and the \u201cSPAC bubble\u201d is the fear of overvaluing company\u2019s that IPO in mass quantities which results in a huge crash later on.  \n\nDo you think Fidelity hasn\u2019t heard of this? Why would Fidelity and Janus take a risk of getting more money when they are up 600%+ AND they have clients to look after? The fact of the matter is, is they won\u2019t take this risk, the amount of money gained and any potential of a SPAC bubble popping would have any investor taking profits ASAP.\n\nNow, there were two things I mentioned in the post that I would discuss now. That is Volkswagens involvement in QS and this quote \n\n\u201cHowever, an issuer generally cannot sell more than 20% of its outstanding stock at a discount without receiving prior approval from current shareholders.\u201d\n\nIn regards to Volkswagen, they have been involved with QS since 2012, they could potentially have shares that they want to sell. They also gave 200 million dollars this year, could this be the purchasing of PIPE shares? Who knows\u2026.I sure as fuck don\u2019t, but the potential of more shares being sold from another company involved in QS is something that is good for this. If not, it doesn\u2019t matter all that much given the other information, since it still stands true with or without Volkswagens involvement.\n\nNow, in regards to the quote mentioned before, it could be the case that on December 21st, only 20% of the 50 million shares that Fidelity and Janus hold will be sold. Even so, 20% of 50 million is still 10 million shares or around 5.3% of the outstanding shares that QS has.  \n\nIn conclusion, I think we are looking at a great opportunity to make tendies boys.  \n\nTLDR; Eat grass, smoke ass, short QS, make tendies\n\nPositions to get in on: Dec 24 50p \n\nYou could go further expiration, or you could go further OTM. Who am I kidding though, you idiots are gonna grab FD\u2019s. Just make sure it\u2019s not December 18th.",

        "selftext": "Background: I've published peer-reviewed journal articles on China's politics and markets before. \n\nAlibaba (and Ant)'s getting pulled into a meeting with regulators today on the heels of a new anti-trust probe. Expect a correction, but much of the uncertainty had already been priced in. \n\nA quick sentiment analysis of the press releases from Chinese government mouthpieces like\u300a\u4eba\u6c11\u65e5\u5831\u300b\\[the People's Daily\\] shows their tone is much more mellow now than before. Where before they hawked on Ma and Alibaba, they're now focusing on \u201cthe country\u2019s focus on the healthy development of the platform economy in China\u201d. This talking point is repeated a significant number of times in the releases. \n\nThis stark shift in tone suggests regulators already have a for-show compromise in mind and BABA will only need to kiss the ring when they meet with said regulators today. It also suggests regulators are putting on this show for political grandstanding to send a message to digital companies and the billionaire class to do the same. \n\nTo put this into an even broader context, this episode is just the latest in a chest-puffing government campaign going on over the last couple of years to stress deference to the CCP. China's state-run banks have dragged their heels in performance for a while, and ever since private-sector digital platforms (BABA, JD, Meituan, TCEHY) have forged ahead in innovating much more efficient payment systems, the CCP felt left behind and wanted to be included in the party. What's key is we\u2019ve observed this campaign to be much more discursive and cultural in practice and effect (e.g. prodding individual people and companies to be more humble and thank the party, put on the frills, yaddi-yadda) than it has been economic (e.g. quashing entire companies). \n\nWhy? And where are we headed? BABA and the digital platform economy it's a leader in are essential to China. The CCP has been ramping up efforts to digitalize in a bid to take a lead in the global (fin)tech race and strengthen the yuan at the same time. The innovation of the new China digital currency is a game-changer. The Bank of China filed over 70 patents related to the digital currency in the past year. The patents will likely be approved 2021, which will be BABA's time to shine because the CCP will need the networks and infrastructure of Alipay to make the digital currency a success. \n\nMore bullish sentiment: in Q3 2020, close to 1800 hedge funds/financial institutions had BABA in their holdings, over 200 opened new positions, and \\~700 added to their positions. Bigger names who bought more over Q3: Cathie Woods' Ark, Ray Dalio's Bridgewater, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity, Barclays, Susquehanna, Deutsche, Canada Pension Plan, etc. It remains Blackrock's #8 holding and has become Bridgewater's #4 holding. \n\nMy take: buy and hold. I literally bought more yesterday and I intend to keep buying.",

There are a lot of rumors floating regarding PSTH. Speculation without an LOI announced as of yet. Some moves seem much more likely than others ***but we are still in the dark.***\n\nIn August, PSCM CEO Bill Ackman wrote a letters to investors. In it he has a section dedicated to PSTH. You can find some of that below. I have bolded what I think are the most important parts highlighting the biggest clues. People like Ackman are careful with these letters, they are legacy, like with Buffet's letters.\n\n**Top Contenders**\n\n1. Stripe\n2. Fidelity\n3. Enterprise \n4. Subway\n\n***---------------------------*****Discussion Points below but check out the letter*****---------------------------***\n\n***Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd. - Letter to Shareholders***\n\nOn July 22nd, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd. (\u201cPSTH\u201d) completed a $4 billion IPO on the New York Stock Exchange. We designed PSTH to be the most investor- and merger-friendly SPAC in the world. Apparently investors agreed, as we had more than $12 billion of demand for the offering when we stopped marketing the IPO on the second day of the road show. We capped the IPO at $4 billion, which, when added to the Pershing Square funds\u2019 minimum $1 billion commitment, created the largest blank check company in the world. \n\nWe capped the size of the public offering so that we would not materially limit the potential universe of merger candidates in which our shareholders would, via a merger, become a minority owner of the newly public company. We are seeking to own a minority interest in the newly merged company because we believe our willingness to be a minority owner will differentiate PSTH from the substantial majority of other private equity and strategic buyers who require control, and are therefore prepared to pay a substantial control premium. \n\n**Sellers are much more price sensitive when selling 100% or even a controlling interest in their business for obvious reasons. A seller\u2019s price sensitivity declines, however, when they are selling a smaller interest that allows them to achieve other important strategic objectives. We therefore expect that a potential PSTH merger partner will be much less price-sensitive in a transaction in which it, in effect, sells a minority interest in a merger with PSTH, which also allows it to raise $5 billion of equity capital and retain control of a newly public New York Stock Exchange listed company. In fact, the smaller the interest they are selling, the lesser the price sensitivity, which makes mergers with larger companies more likely to come on more advantaged terms than with smaller companies. PSTH\u2019s targeting of companies that are multiples of its size is designed to enable it to acquire a minority interest in the newly merged company at an attractive valuation.** \n\nWe have always believed that SPACs are interesting investment constructs. We have had an excellent experience and strong investment results from the first SPAC we co-sponsored in 2011 that merged with Burger King, the predecessor company to Restaurant Brands, which remains a core holding more than eight years after the merger. In principle, a properly structured SPAC with a strong sponsor should offer a much more attractive alternative to going public than through an initial public offering. This fact has begun to be appreciated more widely, including by members of the venture capital community. Recently, Bill Gurley, one of the world\u2019s leading venture capitalists, wrote a detailed blog post comparing SPACs and direct listings with initial public offerings. Bill makes a powerful case for SPACs. We encourage you to read his post: https:// [abovethecrowd.com/2020/08/23/going-public-circa-2020-door-3-the-spac/](https://abovethecrowd.com/2020/08/23/going-public-circa-2020-door-3-the-spac/) \n\nIn order to address these alignment issues, with PSTH we eliminated all forms of compensation, advisory fees, and founder shares. We further improved alignment issues by the Pershing Square funds committing to purchase a minimum of $1 billion of common stock and shareholder warrants on the same terms as PSTH\u2019s public shareholders. In addition, the Pershing Square funds purchased so-called Sponsor Warrants for $65 million \u2013 their estimated fair market value at the time of the IPO \u2013 that will become 10-year warrants on 5.95% of the newly merged company shares, only if we successfully complete a transaction. \n\nWe also negotiated and capped the underwriting fees payable at 1.8% of the SPAC\u2019s minimum equity capital, further reducing frictional costs. We paid two-thirds of these fees with the purchase of the Sponsor Warrants, which reduces the total frictional costs of PSTH in a merger borne by shareholders and our merger partner to a *de minimis* amount. \n\n**We used the excess demand for the PSTH IPO to curate a shareholder list that would be the envy of any public company. We selected investors for their reputation as long-term, value-added owners. We expect our shareholder registry will contribute to PSTH\u2019s appeal as a merger partner for a high-quality company.** \n\nWe also made a number of changes to the typical shareholder warrant structure of SPACs that minimizes the risk of shareholder redemptions. These structural changes, when coupled with our large amount of committed capital to the entity and our curated long-term shareholder base, reduce and likely eliminate the need to raise expensive so-called PIPE capital at the time a transaction is identified, a de facto requirement in nearly every other SPAC transaction. \n\n**The result of all of the above is that we now control a publicly traded, NYSE-listed company with $5 billion of equity capital that is seeking to merge and take public a large capitalization private company that meets our investment criteria for business quality, growth, and an attractive valuation. PSTH is the largest SPAC in the world with the least amount of frictional costs in a merger, making it a highly attractive alternative to an IPO. As such, we expect that PSTH will give Pershing Square\u2019s investors and PSTH\u2019s public shareholders unique access to an untapped universe of bespoke, large-capitalization investment opportunities.** \n\n**To give you a better understanding of the unique, large scale of PSTH, there have been only three U.S. IPOs in the last decade of $5 billion or more \u2013 Alibaba, Uber, and Facebook \u2013 and the degree of difficulty for completing an IPO increases materially with its size.** This makes PSTH an extremely attractive alternative for a company that would like to raise $5 billion or more of capital and go public, particularly during a period in the capital markets which is likely to be highly volatile and uncertain because of the economic impact of the virus, the upcoming presidential election, and the challenging political, social, and economic environment. Uncertainty is the enemy of the IPO and the friend of a $5 billion SPAC with the largest amount of committed capital.\n\n**We are in discussions with a number of potential companies that are owned and/or controlled by private equity firms, families, start-up company founders, as well as other private companies, and are encouraged by the initial interest that we have received.** \n\n\\-\n\n**William A. Ackman**\n\n**August 2020**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\n**Discussion Points**\n\n* How seriously are people taking the  Collison's Tweets. They seem very benign to a potential deal. They have never said never. Couldn't this just be the mating dance Ackman talks about. 3D Chess?\n* Fintech is still most likely? Think Klarman, Guggenheim, Ackman already being deep in food service industry\n* Subway wouldn't be that bad. Am I wrong? Ackman would get it at a steal of a price. It could be a fixer upper like Chipotle?\n* Agree with my contender list?",

        "selftext": "People may remember my older IPOB posts from when it was trading in the high teens (now trading at nearly $30 / share)\n\n[\\- IPOB - institutions buying up the shares on the dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jyh6zs/ipob_opendoor_nameplate_institutions_piling_in/)\n\n[\\- IPOB - momentum building with merger date announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2rmss/ipob_opendoor_merger_vote_announced_for_1217/)\n\nSince my first posts, the price has gone from $18 to $30. **The merger was voted successfully on Thursday and the ticker changes to OPEN tomorrow.** \n\nTo recap, [OpenDoor is disrupting the $1.3 trillion dollar](https://www.opendoor.com/w/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Opendoor-overview-investor-presentation.pdf) (annual) real estate market, with a leading market share in ibuying, and reducing a complex, tedious, and costly process to transact on a home to something simple, easy, and straightforward. The company will generate nearly $4B in revenue in 2021 after $2.5B in 2020. Not many flashy or disruptive SPAC combinations are already driving that much growth and proof of concept. This is a real company, not a story. \n\nWith Carvana trading for 6x 2021 and Zillow trading for north of 6x 2021 revenue, that positions OpenDoor to land a $21B market cap, or roughly $40/share assuming it trades in line with its comps day one. With OpenDoor the clear leader with the best market position and technology, it arguably should get a premium - maybe $50-$60 a share or more. If people take a long term view that this should be a $100B company in 3-4 years (and much more long term), even greater potential remains.\n\nTicker change days have proven volatile for a number of SPACs. Most go down as many retail traders don't see the pop they were hoping for. Fortunately, IPOB is supported by Ark Funds (\\~4MM share position), Fidelity, Soros, Sulvetta, and other nameplate institutions. Separately, the shares have consolidated and maintained gains vs. rocketing up just in the last few days - the fast money has been churned out. With the OpenDoor CEO ringing the bell of the NASDAQ, this will get as much visibility as a traditional IPO. \n\n400 May 21 20c.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/f26g6oa95e661.gif",

At this point im not expecting any ipos to be cheap just purely based on the hype were seeing right now. But here is just a DD i did for it. The company has **an interesting business model in which that the company will partner up with another company to create an application that is proven to increase efficiency, reduce cost, track measurements for analysis purposes and so on and will then proceed to sell the same implementation to other companies that may benefit from the applications**. The revenue is mainly based on the subscription models to create steady stream of revenue. The company is lead by Tom Siebel, the pioneer of the customer relationship management software business that sold his company to Oracle for 6 billion in 2006 and C3.AI is his next level creation to revolutionize the world. **C3.AI is listed as one of the top disruptors of 2020 is backed up by Microsoft and spring creek capital with 50 million of stocks and $ 100 million investment respectively. C3.AI announced the partnership with Raytheon Technologies to develop AI solutions for aerospace and defense missions for government customers, including the U.S. Air Force and intelligence community. They also announced partnership with Microsoft and Adobe for a new customer \u2013 relationship management software seeking to comeback Salesforce INC.** The potential **for C3.AI is limitless because of how broad the scope can be. With a successful implementation of an application, C3.AI could easily spin it off to implement such applications to other industries with incredible scalability and tremendous reduction to developing cost**. Before we dive into what the company actually does, here is the overview of the company. \n\n**Financial wise, the company has**\n\n\\- **A whopping 71% yoy growth**\n\n\\- **86% subscription revenue**\n\n\\- **A $271 billion TAM by 2024.** \n\n\\- **Narrowing income loss thanks to the rapid growth**\n\n**The AI technology is a proven technology and is one that is being used daily to help industries moving faster into digital transformation.

With the established applications. \n\n**C3.AI is then able to** \n\n**1.** **Expand those same use cases across similar companies**\n\n**2.** **Establish middle market sales organizations, including tele sales, and online sales**\n\n**3.** **Leverage on marketing partners as enterprise and mid-market distribution channels**\n\nReal world user case:\n\nEngie \u2013 largest power producer in the world with\n\n\\- 114.4 GW power production capacity\n\n\\- $67 billion annual revenue in europoors money\n\n\\- 153k employees, operated in 70 counties \n\nWith the partnership with Engie, C3.Ai developed and deployed performance optimization for gas power plants, efficiency optimization of heating and cooling plants, energy analysis and management for enterprise and consumer customers, and anomaly detection of wind turbines. **C3 was able to bring the scalability required to build industrial AI based application with over 1million sensors, 5 million end points and 17mil measurements per day with the end result of bringing estimated 1.5 billion in annual economic benefits**\n\n\\- Wind turbines with in 12 weeks of deployment sees 2-3% increase in performance resulting in 15-22Mil annual economic value\n\n\\- Heating and cooling plants see 2-3% saving in energy consumption costs with $3mil annual economic value\n\n\\- Application in analyze energy for metered facility on the Ohio State university campus and is expected to see 25% energy saving within 10 years within 16 weeks of deployment \n\n\\- Application to analyze and forecast consumption for electricity and gas retail customers in France of 2.6Mil electricity consumers and 8.6mil has consumers with deployment of 6 months \n\n**Revenue model**\n\n\\- **Term subscriptions of the C3.AI Suite**\n\n\\- **Term subscriptions of C3.AI applications**\n\n\\- **Monthly runtime fee of C3 AI Applications and customer-developed application built using the C3.AI suite, usage based upon CPU- hour consumption**\n\n\\- **Professional services fees associated with training and assisting customers**\n\nIn the case of Engie, C3.AI would be making money from subscriptions to C3.AI suite and applications, setting up required trackers for measurements, developing AI applications, a monthly runtime fee if Engie is continuing to develop new applications with C3.AI. With the proven applications and set up, C3.AI then would be able to sell them to other companies that could also benefit from same implementation. **With Biden focusing on green energy infrastructures, one could expect the demand of the applications to increase.**\n\nTheir AI has also been used in sectors like utilities, banking, aerospace &amp; defense, healthcare, retail, telecommunications, smart cities, and transportation. **With already proven and prebuilt applications listed below that could be implemented into broader and more general sector.** \n\n\\- **Anti-money laundering**\n\n\\- **COVID-19 Data lake**\n\n\\- **AI CRM**\n\n\\- **Energy management**\n\n\\- **Fraud detection**\n\n\\- **Inventory optimization**\n\n\\- **Predictive maintenance**\n\n\\- **Production schedule optimization**\n\n\\- **Readiness**\n\n\\- **Sensor health**\n\n\\- **Supply network risk** \n\n**As C3.Ai continues to work with various more different sectors to create more applications, C3.AI will be able to reach into more boarder market. With already established applications in various broad sectors, C3.AI is going to take AI to the next level by focusing on deep penetration into business solutions, aerospace and defense with the partnership with Microsoft, Adobe and Raytheon Technologies to fully dominate the sectors.** \n\n **TLDR:** \n\n**There is none cause im too lazy to type one.**",

And if you're unsure if you have a margin account or not, [by default](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/), you have a margin account. Keep options and whatever other not crazily shorted shit in your RH account, but for stuff like GME, why make it easy for Melvin? \n\nSo what can you do to screw over those greedy shorts who have manipulated GME for far too long? Either switch your Robinhood account to a cash account (but then no more instant deposits), or if you still want those instant deposits, move over your GME holdings to another broker like Fidelity or Schwab with a non-margin account. \n\nBest of all, if you buy from some toilet paper hands on Robinhood that get scared off on days like today, then you're helping fortify the front line!

I'm just a guy with a regular job. My own due diligence starts with financials. Financials, in my opinion, are the foundation. I hold for long periods, and I accumulate on the dips. Also, and most importantly, I do not use rocketships in any of my posts. My broker is Fidelity. You will need a broker that allows for OTC trades. Fidelity is free. Some charge a flat fee. The most difficult decision I've had to face is stomaching the dips - sometimes they get scary. It's part of the game, and many people lose right before they were about to win. Market makers will try to shake the tree and get your shares at a discount.\n\n$JNSH / Market Cap: $2mm / OS 317mm / PPS .0065 / Current Pink Status (https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/JNSH/security)\nInitial reason it caught my attention was the daily average traded volume. A month ago maybe $7,000 worth of shares traded in a day. And now, $30,000+, a spike at $905,000 on 11/23, settled back down, but volume is steadily higher. And relative to the price per share, still quiet and unknown. So, now, financials...\n\nFirst thing that caught my attention was their investment of $274,000 in Blink (Nasdaq: $BLNK) at the end of September. On Sept 30th, BLNK traded for $10 per share. Today it is trading at $27 per share. This is just a bonus. Nothing to do with the company's core. If the price per share holds true through next financials, this tells me the current price per share is 20% undervalued. This is almost $500,000 that will be automatically added to the next quarter financials.\n\nAnother thing that caught my attention was ZERO debt securities, including promissory or convertible notes. That ugly box that is usually filled in with companies we despise? Blank. Nada. Last conversion was June 2018 and laughable from an impact perspective. Clean.\n\nTo review the most recent financial statement: https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/JNSH/disclosure\n(I could include a link direct to the PDF but people don't seem to like opening direct PDFs)\n\nJNS Holding Corporation is made up of three wholly-owned subsidiaries. JNS Power &amp; Control Systems, Inc., S&amp;H Leasing, Inc. and Evolve USA Charging Corp., specializing in (EV) charging station installations. This is where I had to BLINK twice. Digging in a little further, mostly in 2018, they installed over 160 (at that time) charging stations covering the greater Chicago area. ICC-certified, temperature control systems, design build - reputable and qualified in the world of electrical.\n\nThis is a profitable OTC company flying under the radar with over $900,000 in assets and $183,000 in liabilities. There is stockholder equity of $700,000. EQUITY. But factor in the BLINK investment. Over a $1.2mm in equity as of today. Regular, re-occuring profits, and equity. Come on now. \n\nI have no future catalyst here. I have no reason to tell you this is going to boom. But everything looks like a solid, small cap company, in a space that has been exploding. I just don't think many people know about it. I believe this one is in a good position to be loading and holding until the catalyst comes. They always do. You have to have patience. Patience has been the key to my success with the OTC. With $JNSH, I see very little downside risk compared to the upside potential. Each of my OTC plays comes with a sense of confidence, not hope, that allows me to continue to accumulate.\n\nCurrent PPS: $0.0065 / Short-Term Target: $0.045* (6X to 8X)\n*This would place a market cap of $14mm, and with the equity, industry growth, and profitability, I believe that is a reasonable estimate. Please review my previous targets on the older posts. Everything is higher than my short-term targets, and I try to be as realisitc as possible. I know I am not going to always pick a winner but I'm on a pretty good streak so far.\n\nSupporting links:\nhttps://www.jnsholdings.com/index.php\n\nCompleted projects:\nhttp://www.jnspower.com/completed-projects.php\n\nIndustry growth potential:\nhttps://cleantechnica.com/2020/06/02/bloomberg-to-compete-with-tesla-ev-charging-infrastructure-needs-to-evolve/",

        "selftext": "Finally put some money into my Fidelity account to get access to more units and other SPAC plays. Robinhood is great and all until you realize they are horrible if you want to actually make money with SPACs. Anyway, I have been digging a ton over the past month or so, and started a position in 4 SPACs today that are extremely close to NAV when you factor in the warrants thrown in with the units. I listed this as discussion, because I'd like to get feedback on these picks and genuinely learn more.\n\nMy strategy with SPACs is to play it very conservative with picks as close to NAV as possible while still having an interesting management team or target industry.\n\n1. SPRQU ($10.90) - 1/2 warrant - $345M trust - This is the one furthest from NAV and probably most discussed on here so far. Same folks you brought Fisker. Their website says, \"Focused on the energy value-chain in North America, with a particular focus on opportunities aligned with energy transition and sustainability.\" You will have a long wait with this one probably, but I'm totally fine to park cash here and see what happens. I'm happy to see they still offer 1/2 warrant. Some prominent teams are starting to do units with 1/5 of a warrant, which is crazy to me.\n2. GNRS ($10.06) - \\~$175M trust -  I've started to see a few post about these guys. Cannabis focused. Some rumors of Leafly are swirling, but that's all it is at this point. Their website is one of the cleanest I've ever seen from a SPAC with detailed plans on different aspects of the industry. I know a lot of pot stocks get a bad rap because of the run-up and subsequent crash, but I like this play because you basically get pre-IPO access to something intriguing, hopefully. In an industry that has some CAGR around 30%, I think there will be massive value here.\n3. SVOKU ($10.50) - 1/2 warrant - \\~260M trust - I've only seen one post on here about this, and it was just an introductory one when it IPOd. The team is diverse with a ton of private equity experience. They are committed to an ESG play, but don't necessarily specify what industry they are looking at. I see this as a Chamath-type play without paying the 20% premium out the gate. This is basically brand new, so you'll be waiting a while.\n4. CTAQU ($10.37) - 1/3 warrant - \\~$402M trust - Same as above. One post on here with not much info. Very interesting management team. Lloyd Carney had another SPAC that had a successful merger, and the company looks to be doing decent (Grid Dynamics). You also have a former CIO with the Army and a SVP from McAfee. It also just started, but the team and focus lead me to believe this could have a Palantir tech/government type target.\n\nI think all of the above are great plays with the upcoming administration in the US, so I'm excited to see where these go. My strategy is to hold all of these until at least LOI unless they get a crazy pump before. Would love to get your feedback. I haven't been in SPACs long, so I'm sure some of you know these companies or management teams much better than I.",

        "selftext": "QS has been a great stock, but near term caution is warranted. QS is required to file a registration statement to enable the sale of the 50m PIPE shares they issued in conjunction with the KCAC merger. They are required to file within 15 business days of the merger close - that would be today (Dec 16) or tomorrow.\n\nOnce this registration statement is filed, it usually takes the SEC 15-30 days to approve. Once it is approved, PIPE shareholders are free to sell the stock with no restrictions. Note that the current diluted share count is 448m shares (mkt cap $28B). BUT, the current float is only 23m shares (the original KCAC shares). Once the registration statement is approved, the float will more than TRIPLE to 73m shares!\n\nWhile not all PIPE holders will sell immediately, I am sure that most will, given that they just made 6x their money in less than a month. The PIPE holders are mutual funds like Fidelity and Wellington.\n\nBottom line: Be careful since the supply of QS shares available to trade is about to more tham triple in the next 2-4 weeks.",

        "selftext": " **$STIC -- Northern Star Acquisition Corp. (merging with Bark aka Barkbox which will become $BARK)**\n\n**Current stock price:** $13.95\n\n**Enterprise value:** $2.1 billion\n\n**2020 fiscal year revenues (est):** $224 million\n\n**2021 fiscal year revenues (est):** $370 million\n\n**2022 fiscal year revenues (est):** $516 million\u00a0\n\n**2023 fiscal year revenues (est):** $706 million\n\nWebsite: [https://bark.co](https://bark.co/)\n\nInvestor Presentation, December 2020 \\[[click here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fc915303436806905d7150e/t/5fdae20279e44d2bcf557f77/1608180228067/BARK-Overview-12162020.pdf)\\]\n\n **Price Target:**\n\nIf we consider $BARK\u2019s 40-50% revenue growth potential over the next few years plus their 60% gross margins plus their current operating margins and net cash positions I think it\u2019s very fair to consider a 12x sales multiple (conservative) on FY2022 sales of $516M (conservative). This would put the market cap in 15 months (end of FY2022) at around $6.2 billion / 202M outstanding shares equals 15-month price target of $30 to $31 which would be 140-150% upside from Friday\u2019s closing price of $12.40\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wriyaz8tst661.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e7918abb733f67427b726177119bf8239fd63c0\n\n***Here\u2019s why I\u2019m really excited about $BARK and why I started a 2.5% position in the company last Thursday as soon as the news broke that $STIC was merging with them\u2026***\n\n**1.** $BARK\u2019s current retention rate of 95% is phenomenal for a consumer products company. This retention rate is more evidence on how much Barkbox customers love their products and see tremendous value in the monthly pricing options. Consumers are realizing you can save a lot of time and money by buying directly from the manufacturer in bulk which is essentially what you\u2019re doing with Barkbox plus you\u2019re not paying all the overhead costs associated with retail locations.\n\n**2.** People love their dogs which means making them happy as much as possible. I have friends that post videos of the \u201cunboxing\u201d every month of the Barkbox with their dogs because it\u2019s such a fun event for them. The dogs go wild as soon as they see the Barkbox coming towards them. As we return to a more normal world after Covid and millions of people are back in offices (at least part-time) they will start to feel the regret and guilt of being away from their dog(s). I believe Barkbox can be one of the solutions to help relieve some of these feelings. We love to spoil our dogs but why deal with the inconvenience of going to the pet store every month when you can just subscribe to Barkbox, save some money, make your dog happy, bring a smile to your own face and take one more errand off your to-do list.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/o873gn7ast661.jpg?width=950&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4cbc38d1b603332b7250d90788782c8a882c25a)\n\n**3.** Through the first 3 quarters of FY21 $BARK\u2019s customer acquisition cost on subscriptions have dropped from $56 to $42 (25% decrease). They\u2019ve also been able to increase their gross profit per subscription by 20% during the same time period. These are both strong trends to watch closely as the company stays in growth mode. I think these numbers are moving in the right direction because of my #6 reason down below (social media &amp; influencer marketing).\u00a0\n\n**4.** When Barkbox first launched they were using toys and treats from other companies but over the years as they\u2019ve gotten to know their customers and analyzed the data...now they design and manufacture more than 90% of their SKUs. On average they design 15 new products every month which means they are always trying to stay ahead of the competition and create the next cool toy or treat rather than playing catch-up. $BARK wants to be the premier innovator and disrupter in the pet industry which I love.\u00a0\n\n**5.** Bark has embraced the omni-channel strategy which means selling across multiple platforms, both ecommerce and in retail locations. Not only are they doing phenomenally well with their subscription boxes and BarkShop.com website but they are landing huge retail partnerships.\n\n**6.** Bark does an amazing job on social media, they are one of the best I\u2019ve seen at sharing great content although let\u2019s be honest\u2026 the cute dogs make it easier. Across all social media platforms Bark and Barkbox now have more than 8 million followers and fans. I\u2019ve also noticed that they\u2019re doing a great job working with influencers and affiliates to help drive website traffic, brand awareness and subscription customers.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b50t8gtlst661.png?width=932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2fe6b48bff48d5c8f01f0c36286b1d7b3275a6b\n\n As of Friday\u2019s close I had a 2.5% position in $STIC which reflects my early excitement and enthusiasm for this company. The stock did rally a little bit last week on the merger announcement however I still think the current stock price and impending enterprise value of $BARK is not yet reflecting the growth potential of this company. I did own $CHWY earlier this year and exited with a decent profit but personally I felt the valuation was getting too rich. I still love the pet industry and I want to be involved but no other company got me excited until I heard that Barkbox was coming public via $STIC. Once I dug into the numbers I knew that I needed to start a position right away which I\u2019ll continue to add to in the coming weeks especially on any pullbacks.\u00a0 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75bz1ckrrt661.jpg?width=1456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f571720190209f99bfef9ea6211a0614dcbc11e3\n\n Last Thursday, December 17th, Northern Star Acquisition Corp (SPAC) announced they will be merging with Bark to take the company public. Bark is the parent company of Barkbox and several other similar pet brands. The deal which is expected to close in approximately 3-4 months (early 2021Q2) gave Bark an enterprise value of $1.6 billion. This included $454 million of cash proceeds, $200 million of which came via PIPE from firms/funds including Fidelity and the Federated Hermes Kaufmann Fund). Bark will use these funds to accelerate growth through product development &amp; new product launches as well as customer acquisition via retail channel partnerships and DTC marketing. After the deal closes the ticker symbol will be changed from $STIC to $BARK.\u00a0\n\nThe image below gives you a rough idea of the capital structure and balance sheet:\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ku2t5nurt661.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65dcfd389b15e835ab2347bb75285d088005160a\n\n \n\nBark is the global omni-channel brand leader for dogs which includes their main brand [Barkbox](https://www.barkbox.com/) as well as their other brands [BarkEats](https://hello.barkeats.com/), [BarkBright](https://www.barkbox.com/brightdental), [BarkPost](https://barkpost.com/), [BarkShop](https://barkshop.com/) and [Super Chewer](https://www.barkbox.com/super-chewer).\u00a0\n\nBarkbox is a subscription service that delivers customized boxes of toys and treats \\[[website](https://www.barkbox.com/)\\]\n\nBarkEats creates custom meals for your dogs based on their nutritional needs \\[[website](https://hello.barkeats.com/)\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkr45pcxrt661.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5093bab7aa9f1b4a900df0c6695ad20474ec4d9\n\n BarkBright is their doggie dental brand to keep your dog\u2019s mouth, teeth and gums healthy and fresh \\[[website](https://www.barkbox.com/brightdental)\\] \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8l9v2fd0st661.jpg?width=955&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa7ac6f15e6be130a04b65090febf3ab30e624be\n\n SuperChewer is a subscription box full of extra tough toys and treats \\[[website](https://www.barkbox.com/super-chewer)\\] \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/91t40jd1st661.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88443e0ae61034a1f94965ce559d353c255c5ed7\n\n \n\nAcross their multiple brands $BARK has more than 1.1 million active subscriptions and 6.5 million lifetime customers which includes sales on Amazon and 23,000 retail locations through Target, Petco, PetSmart, Costco and others. Here are some of Bark\u2019s toys being sold on Target.com \\[[click here](https://www.target.com/b/bark/-/N-iskuo?Nao=0)\\]\n\nWith more than 300 million pets in the US and the global pet industry expected to reach $100+ billion in sales this year it means $BARK is operating within a massive TAm. With that large TAM means plenty of competition but I strongly believe $BARK has carved out a nice niche for themselves which means plenty of room for exponential growth.\u00a0\n\nPart of $BARK\u2019s strategy going forward is to launch new products and services they can upsell to their 1.1+ million subscription customers. This strategy should keep customer acquisition costs low leading to better operating margins and quicker profitability. In the first half of FY2021 $BARK saw 179% YoY revenue growth from new product lines so this could be a massive growth engine moving forward. $BARK knows what their customers want and now they have the capital to build it for them. Since the company has so much data on both dogs and pet owners they are able to create new products and launch new brands with a high probability of success.\u00a0\n\n$BARK is also planning to expand their relationships with Amazon and their other retail partners. Over the past year $BARK\u2019s sales on Amazon were up 2.5x so it makes sense why this is a focus for them.\n\nFor Bark\u2019s current fiscal year which ends on March 31, 2021 the company expects $370 million of revenues which is 65% revenue growth over fiscal year 2020. The company is also forecasting 60% gross margins (was 61.2% in the first half of FY21). These gross margins are superior to any other public companies in the pet industry such as $CWHY and $FRPT\u00a0\n\nGoing forward the company is forecasting $516 million for fiscal year 2022 and $706 million for fiscal year 2023 -- they are probably low-balling the forecasts because it\u2019s always better to under-promise and over-deliver once you\u2019re a public company.\u00a0\n\nIf these forecasts come to fruition it would represent 40% revenue growth and 37% revenue growth respectively for FY2022 and FY2023. $BARK expects gross margins to stay around 59-60% for the foreseeable future. The company expects to lose money through 2023 which is slightly disappointing but not surprising for a consumer products company in growth mode. Personally I think the company\u2019s estimates in their investor presentation will prove to be too low and the company should beat them quite easily. Don\u2019t underestimate the increased brand awareness that goes along with being a public company. Once $BARK is trading under its own ticker symbol and being talked about in the media, on blog sites, on trading platforms and of course on FinTwit it means this really awesome company is now getting exposure to millions of new potential customers.\u00a0\n\nIn terms of public company comparisons, I\u2019d say Chewy which trades under $CHWY is the best one to use. Chewy was founded a year earlier than Bark and is forecasted to do $7 billion of revenues in their FY2021 with a current market cap of $42 billion. As of Friday\u2019s close, $CHWY\u2019s stock price is now up 245% YTD for 2020. $CHEWY's revenue growth is expected to decline from 45% YoY in their FY2020 to 25% YoY in their FY2021. Throw in their 25% gross margins and it\u2019s easy to see why I think $BARK could be the better growth stock going forward.\u00a0\n\nNot that I ever invest in companies based on the potential of them being acquired however that is a real possibility for $BARK. I can think of at least 3-4 companies that could be potential acquirers in the future -- $CHWY, $AMZN, $WMT and $TGT just to name a few.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdv7pce4st661.jpg?width=742&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f876f4f21251bfd470bd57200a5e3a14f74d2377\n\n I'm not saying that $BARK is going to be the next $CHWY because they are very different companies with very different business models but it does show how large the opportunity is for pet focused e-commerce and omni-channel companies especially ones that put a priority on making the customer happy. \n\nSource: [https://jonahlupton.substack.com/p/jonahs-weekly-growth-stock-ideas](https://jonahlupton.substack.com/p/jonahs-weekly-growth-stock-ideas)",

        "selftext": "**\ud83d\ude80TWLO DD \u2013 When Opportunity Knocks You Blow the Door Open** \n\nNo, this isn\u2019t about PSTH. It\u2019s about my other favorite stock and second biggest holding, Twilio ($TWLO). \n\nI believe this to be a sleeping giant heading into 2021. Twilio ($TWLO) is a cloud services company that has seen exceptional gains over the course of the last three quarters. \n\n**Overview** \n\nTwilio ($TWLO) is a developer of communications software, cloud-based platform, and services. **Twilio is a leading communications platform firm that enables developers to integrate communications capabilities such as messaging, voice, and video into client-facing products, thus helping businesses strengthen customer engagement worldwide.** Its platform consists of the following sectors: engagement cloud, programmable communications cloud, and super network. \n\nVia TWLO, businesses can integrate real-time communications capabilities into business applications, expanding the number of touchpoints with their customers. Twilio\u2019s value proposition comes from the building blocks available to developers who can use software to assimilate new customer-facing offerings within their applications. Some simple use cases include automatic text notifications for appointments and two-factor authentication for secure services such as WhatsApp. The Programmable communications cloud software is a set of tools that enables developers to embed voice, messaging, and video capabilities into their applications. The super network is a software layer that allows customers' software to communicate with connected devices globally. \n\n**In other words, they are involved in sales happening online re: e-commerce and get a chunk of that action.** \n\nLet the tendies rain down amongst thee [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tony-montanas-little-friend-story-874414](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tony-montanas-little-friend-story-874414) \n\nTwilio has done its own research on this and that coronavirus response accelerated digital communication strategies by about six years for businesses. \n\nThe CEO cites this in the Cramer interview and uses the very interesting of NIKE as a digital salesforce using TWLO platforms to reach out to customers. The change in focus can be illustrated by Twilio\u2019s stock run this year, growing 277% year to date. The shares climbed 1.6% higher Tuesday to new highs, closing at $370.75. \n\n**Fundamentals** \n\n\u00b7 Most Recent Price = 362.88\n\n\u00b7 52 Week High = 374.49\n\n\u00b7 52 Week Low = 68.06 \n\n\u00b7 Average Daily Volume = 2.75M\n\n\u00b7 Market Cap = 54.85B Consensus \n\n**Analyst Ratings** \n\nBuy 20/Overweight 1/Hold 1/Underweight 1/Sell 1 \n\n**Price Targets** \n\nRanges from high 300\u2019s to $550 \n\nFinancials (an actual \u201cFortress Balance Sheet\u201d as Jamie Dimon would say) \n\nI really cannot say enough about their balance sheet. Its bananas. \n\nTotal Assets = 5.15B \n\nTotal Liabilities = 871.11M\n\nTotal Equity = 4.28B \n\n\\*KEY Financial: TWLO has a Current Ratio (CR) of 8.22, which is insane. For reference, JPMs is 0.88. It\u2019s a metric used to convey overall financial strength using current assets and liabilities, fyi. \n\n**Big Shareholders:** \n\n\u00b7 The Vanguard Group, Inc. \n\n\u00b7 Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Inc.\n\n\u00b7 Fidelity Management &amp; Research Co. LLC \n\n\u00b7 BlackRock Fund Advisors \n\n**MORNING STAR REPORT SUMMARY**\n\n\u00b7 Twilio has elite retention rates within the software industry, with gross retention hovering around 97% and net dollar retention north of 120%. \n\n\u00b7 We think this is indicative of the stickiness of the firm\u2019s platform. \n\n\u00b7 The proposed acquisition of Segment ties together Twilio\u2019s software stack and will increase business reliance on the firm for customer engagement. \n\n\u00b7 As Twilio invests more in Solutions APIs, there should be a shift away from lower margin products such as messaging, which should also contribute to increased recurring revenues.\n\n\u00b7 \u201cWe view narrow-moat Twilio as having a long growth runway ahead, as the company continues to make strategic organic and inorganic investments to expand its platform.\u201d \n\n**Key Points re the Bull Case** \n\nSeveral big-time analysts/names have come out calling for a big bull session for TWLO in 2021 \n\n**Alex Zukin** \u2013 hugely respected and respected analyst from RBC ranked TWLO as the top software pick for 2021 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5IXWtG9jQU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5IXWtG9jQU)\n\n**Jim Cramer**, you know him \u2013 He\u2019s also come out as a big TWLO bull. [https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1341822886043070469](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1341822886043070469) \n\nEnough from analysts and Cramer though, there are people in the background that lead these people to post about stocks. The managers at Baron Funds are who I am talking about. Baron Funds is incredibly bullish on TWLO. Chief among their managers is **Alex Umansky**.  \n\n[https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-fund-soaring-despite-coronavirus-51596060341](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-fund-soaring-despite-coronavirus-51596060341) \n\n**Oh, and if you don\u2019t know who or what Baron Funds are, look into it. Ron Baron is who laid the groundwork for me becoming bullish on TSLA in Q1.** \n\nBaron has been in on TSLA since 2013. He has been mocked and laughed at over the years for his huge position. Through the pandemic, he has not sold a single share, and only laments not being able to buy more. Even ARK got out of TSLA to some degree on this bull run. Baron Fund has done DD on TSLA and are projecting, based on numbers, revenue, and management (not hype) another 5-10x gain over the next 5 years. Some Ron Baron Balling on YouTube. \n\nBasically, DUNKING on the silly TSLA bears: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5QJlTMADGQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5QJlTMADGQ) \n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/10/14/billionaire-investor-ron-baron-tesla-will-become-a-2-trillion-company.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/10/14/billionaire-investor-ron-baron-tesla-will-become-a-2-trillion-company.html) \n\nAnyways, these are the people placing TWLO in their funds in big numbers now. These are the people who actually make money. Do you like Bill Ackman? I do too. Ron Baron is the quieter guy in the background managing 3X as much as Ackman. Baron Fund\u2019s Alex Umansky, the architect of the TWLO play is amazing though, he\u2019s been on a killing spree basically\u2026. Up 60% on the year with his 1.5B portfolio at Baron. He has tripled his investment on TWLO thus far with no intent on selling. \n\nMore on his insights here: [https://www.baronfunds.com/sites/default/files/Business-Insider-Article-Reprint-Alex-Umansky-Profile-11.11.20.pdf](https://www.baronfunds.com/sites/default/files/Business-Insider-Article-Reprint-Alex-Umansky-Profile-11.11.20.pdf) \n\n**Resources** \n\nTWLO CEO Interviewed by JAMES \u201cWSB\u201d CRAMER: [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/22/coronavirus-sped-up-digital-transformation-by-6-years-twilio-ceo-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/22/coronavirus-sped-up-digital-transformation-by-6-years-twilio-ceo-says.html)\n\nBaron Funds: [https://www.baronfunds.com/sites/default/files/Baron-Global-Advantage-Strategy-Letter-6.30.19.pdf](https://www.baronfunds.com/sites/default/files/Baron-Global-Advantage-Strategy-Letter-6.30.19.pdf)\n\nTwilio Stock calls: [https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/twilio-could-climb-to-new-heights-after-another-pullback-15524416](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/twilio-could-climb-to-new-heights-after-another-pullback-15524416)\n\nCEO Discussion: [https://techxplore.com/news/2020-12-twilio-ceo-discusses-pandemic-tech.html](https://techxplore.com/news/2020-12-twilio-ceo-discusses-pandemic-tech.html) \n\nTwilio Buy opportunity: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twilio-inc-twlo-stock-sinks-224510121.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twilio-inc-twlo-stock-sinks-224510121.html)\n\n**Plays** \n\nCommons are a great move, imo \n\nOptions are where some serious money can be made in the next 2 quarters though: \n\nApril 2021 $450 calls are selling for around $12 premium \n\nApril 2021 $400 calls are selling for around $30 premium \n\n\\*\\*\\*Jan 2022 $500 calls are selling for around $35 premium\\*\\*\\* \n\n**Positions** \n\n100 shares @ $315 (up around 12% for me in the last 3 weeks)\n\nWill dive into 2022 options this week, 5 or 10K worth \n\n**Good Luck to all!**",

Not looking for \"You are better off taking the $5k to the roulette wheel\" comments. While $5k is definitely not an insignificant amount of money to me, I am willing to take the risk on this market. I plan to actively monitor and manage this \"Fund\". I know that people will say I should just put it all in MindMed and/or NUMI, but I am pretty set on spreading the investment over a basket of 5-10 stocks. At best, I am hoping this is the next big thing and one of these companies emerges as a leader in the space. More likely is that I think it could just be a good trading opportunity. At worst, I lose my $5k. FTRP was initially on this list but due to foreign investing fees I took it off.\n\n**Questions:** Thoughts on this list and the allocation? I use fidelity which has 0 trading fees and was planning to dollar cost average in. Over what time period do you think I should average in? Should I try to play the dips or determine a set amount to put in each day/week/etc (I know you can't time the market but should I try to time the market lol).  All of these stocks tanked today, should I throw in a significant amount tomorrow? \n\nNot new to investing but new to investing in small/micro caps and OTC's.

Emerging markets fund managers have been swapping U.S. listings of widely held stocks like Alibaba Group Holding (BABA), JD.com (JD), NetEase (NTES) for their secondary listings in Hong Kong listings for months, in anticipation of the measure. \n\nThat's right. The absolute *worst* thing that can happen is that your shares get swapped to Hong Kong's stock exchange. The article explained that Interactive Brokers, Fidelity, and Schwab, for example, already offer retail traders like us access to HK's exchange.\n\nGranted that NIO and XPEV are not on the Hong Kong exchange yet. But they have three years to comply with the US rule. That's plenty of time to secure a spot on the Hong Kong exchange. And Hong Kong would *love* to have them. This move could also benefit the companies themselves, as it makes them available to both American *and* Chinese investors:\n\n&gt;A Hong Kong listing means a company\u2019s stock can be traded during the Asian day and is likely to broaden its investor base. If shares are later added to Hong Kong\u2019s so-called stock connect program, they could also become accessible to investors in mainland China. [WSJ](https://archive.fo/XRXPe#selection-2677.0-2677.262)\n\n**tl;dr** Worst thing that happens is you have to open another account to give you access to HKEX.

        "selftext": "Don't really know exactly the point of this post. I do both since online gambling legalized in my state and am just consistently amazed by this. Hope everyone finds it insightful. Feel free to ask me any questions / make other points.\n\nOnline sports betting is now legal in a variety of states (most legalized this year) &amp; is rapidly expanding to others. Sports betting is very, very similar to derivatives trading.\u00a0\n\n**Similarities:**\n\n\\- It's a f'ing thrill.\n\n\\- The markets move, *quickly*. We see this in derivatives trading with earnings, regulation changes, central bank policy, etc. Volatility can shoot up or crash down, the underlying price moves as people trade, expressing their opinions in the market. Similarly, the Ravens may be -400 before the game, but Lamar gets COVID and they're quickly -200. Or sharp bettors come in and massively move a line. In trading &amp; sports betting, you are using mathematics, statistics and all of the information you have at the time to make informed \"trades\" (e.g. bets).\n\n\\- This isn't investing where you're holding for years and hoping to realize some expected return. Especially for weekly/daily expirations, it's super similar to sports betting in that usually you know whether you were right or wrong fairly quickly. If you're buying a call option on AAPL for earnings, you'll know shortly after that earnings call if you're winning or losing. Just like buying an NBA team in a game and checking the score in the 1Q.\n\n\\-You're trading/betting against algorithms.\n\n\\- You can win. We see all the time here people consistently making money trading derivatives. It's the same in sports. This isn't slots or roulette; you can beat the house.\n\n**Differences:**\n\n\\- US sportsbooks are inefficient markets.\u00a0Arbitrage exists. You can't go onto Fidelity and buy an option for $1 while simultaneously selling it for $1.10 on Robinhood. You can in sports betting; the\u00a0books all have different, independent lines.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\\- Promotions exist; a lot of these sportsbooks (such as DraftKings, a $20 billion company) offer hundreds of dollars in site credit to new users when they join.",

Will my account will be suspended? Will I immediately receive another automated restriction once my current restriction ends? Perhaps I am confused and the PDT only applies to margin accounts. My account is strictly a cash account.",

        "selftext": "I have a margin account with Fidelity since July 2020, but have never borrowed margin for any of my tradings. However, it keeps putting my orders as margin something that I noticed recently as result of constantly losing money when averaging down my position during the day. The issue has been when I open a position (always and always a limit order) with my cash money, and I want to average it down during the day, it keeps buying as WASH SALE ADJUSTMENT at a price waaaay above my LIMIT order!!! for example, first I put order or 100 limit but @ 2$, 2 minutes later want to average it down and buy 200 @ 1.80 and after half an hour  I put another limit order of 3000 @ 1.50. Strangely it buys my last limit order  @ 5$!!!!!!! a price that is not even within the 6 month range of that stock!! and they add a W, standing for WASH SALE adjustment to that order. This is an order that I didn't put and on open position of a stock I am buying for the first time in my portfolio (so no wash sale adjustment rule applies to it) ..... So at my shock my green position suddenly becomes red with a huge LOSS with half an hour of opening that position. a price that I can an no time in my life cover it or average it down!!! I can see that my unadjusted G/L is green but adujsted G/L is very red with big big loss, and if I sell it  I will lose and not gain.\n\nThis has happened to me each time I have been trying to average down my open CASH position! and Each time I called Fidelity, support team kept telling me what's the rule for WASH SALE ADJUSTMENT RULE is! and they told me you sold it before with Loss that's why your new purchase is adjusted for TAX purposes, and I keep explaining them and I have not sold my position yet... \n\nAfter six months one of the reps told me, NO you didn't sell it, WE  SOLD IT BECAUSE IT WAS ON MARGIN AND AT RISK AND WE SEND YOU EMAIL!!! and you cannot see that FIDELITY-MADE sell in your History or closed positions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nso when I was working on my open position, buying and averaging it down, FIDELITY was selling them and creating WASH SALE purchase!!! I am using my own CASH money, and still see cash in my non-marging Buying Power and in my Cash(Core), but they without calling me keep selling my shares, because AUTOMATICALLY, al my orders regardless I buying them with my CASH will get purchased with MARGIN... so they can easily manipulate my portfolio and make money.... Now after six months realizing this, I removed margin from my account and also I need to move to Ameritrade or WeBull. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease be extremely careful if you have a margin account, even if you don't trade on margin.",

        "selftext": "Hi there, I'm an 18 year old who started his first job and getting into investing immediately after his birthday in September. I love staying on top of my finances and just want to be rich as an adult. I plan on continuing on investing, opening up a Roth IRA in January, and want to get into real estate in my 20's as a side income. I opened up a student credit card with Chase (the only popular local bank in my town) and I went after 3 months of having the student card, which gives 1% back on everything to try for Chase's Freedom Flex card, which gives 5% on things, 3%, and 1% on everything else. I was advised against it because I'm new to having a credit card and my credit score is only 650 as a result of being new.\n\n I make my payments in full, but my real question is how to go about continuing my investing and opening up my Roth IRA. While at Chase, the man I talked to told me all about their app \"YouInvest\" and said that it would be great for investing. I've used Robinhood since my 18th birthday 3 months ago and have $800ish in my account split among companies and have been pretty successful. I also am trying to get into WeBull, but it's kind of confusing so I'm going slow.\n\nThe man advised me to use \"YouInvest\" for my investments since J.P. Morgan is so big and it would be much better. I knew he was basically trying to sell me the idea and he even said to open my Roth IRA with them. I planned on opening my Roth IRA with Fidelity after doing lots of research. I just want some advice on thinks like:\n\n\\- Has anyone used \"YouInvest\" through Chase? Is it superior to Robinhood or other apps in any way? Does it even make sense to stick to my bank's app or just use other apps once I've been into investing for a while like that Think or Swim one?\n\n\\- Do I open up the Roth IRA with Chase or Fidelity? And do I manage it myself and diversify with index funds or do I let them manage it?\n\nThanks for any help!",

I scalp stocks for a 2% gain from buy to sell.\n\nI effectively got about 8% more of a gain (gain %, not total %)(total % of about an extra 0.2% of profit--significant for me) on Fidelity. I noticed that the Fidelity limit buys and/or sells executed at a better price than my limit order price (something that never happens on RH). Fidelity lists what amount of money they make off your trades while RH does not.\n\nFidelity pros: **can execute at a better price than you list as a limit**. live support with a real human being on the phone. Unlimited day trades (but no instant/margin feature).\n\nFidelity cons: you have to call to get support, no emailing (bad for introverts like me). No instant account (you have to wait for funds to settle before making another trade with that money-- bad for a small fish like me who moves nearly 100% of my total portfolio per trade \\[yes I know that's not recommended\\]). Less intuitive use of the app. Order summary does not go past $0.01 in detail--I've yet to talk to support to see if that is something I can enable (bad for penny stock traders)\n\nRobhinhood pros: More intuitive app. Possibly more feature rich. Ability to email support instead of having to call someone. Instant feature (but need PDT protection +/-). Trade appeared to execute more quickly, but I think there is just lag on the Fidelity end because even though the price lowered on RH, I still filled at the spike price on Fidelity.\n\nRobinhood cons: a bitch can't get a better buy or sell--Robinhood be getting rich off that shit.\n\nUnknowns: I don't have enough experience to see if Fidelity can settle trades quickly enough for it to be worth it to day trade there with an entire portfolio invested in one stock.\n\nAnywho, I thought I'd pass this info along/see how it goes!",

Appreciate any help or pointers to reading material! \n\n1) If I want to get rid of a stock that looks bubbly (e.g. Lemonade) at a profit, and a stock that I don't want to be invested in anymore (e.g. Root) at a loss, can I get these to cancel out, and pay no taxes? Can I buy Lemonade again after &gt;30 days and avoid the \"wash sale\"?\n\n2) Can I get a short-term capital gain to be canceled by a short-term capital loss?  For example, if my Lemonade shares gained $100, and my Root shares lost $100, these would cancel to $0?  \n\n3) Can I get a short-term capital gain to be canceled by a long-term capital loss? \n\n4) Are dividends treated as long-term capital gains, if you've only owned the security for &lt;1 year? \n\n5) Can I use tax-loss harvesting to offset taxes that I'd normally pay on my dividends? \n\n6) How does tax-loss harvesting work across multiple brokerage accounts? I stopped using Robinhood after their glitches and used Fidelity instead, but I never closed my Robinhood account. \n\n7) For the purposes of tax optimization of my brokerage accounts, should I just ignore my Wealthfront/Betterment automated tax-loss harvesting?\n\n8) Do I need special tax reporting software for all this, or is the premium version of TurboTax good enough?",

Before asking I do want to say that I\u2019m going to use Fidelity (seems easy to use) and I have about 3,000 dollars lying around that I can use to initiate investing. \n\nMy questions: \nBy imputing my bank info to create my account on fidelity, will I have to pay fees any time I purchase stock? I know it takes several days to get verified and actually start investing. \n\nAlso which companies are good for beginners like me? My peers say a bunch of different companies but I\u2019m not sure which ones to look into but I always hear Tesla being mentioned. \n\nOverall I\u2019m still a bit confused and I\u2019d really appreciate any info.
