        "selftext": "# The Definition Of Market Manipulation\n\n&gt;\"Market manipulation is the act of artificially inflating or deflating the price of a security or otherwise influencing the behavior of the market for personal gain.\" - Investopedia\n\nAccording to most retail investors this means that market manipulation is when an entity with a huge portfolio that buys or sells a large amount of stock can cause large price movements. This is one type of market manipulation, but not what I want to talk about today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How in 1930 Wyckoff Described What's Happening Today\n\n[Richard D. Wyckoff](https://preview.redd.it/r0dndnl3zk671.jpg?width=324&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b39741d9950f15d90c73b5b49e384104492e03)\n\n**Who Is Wyckoff?**\n\n&gt;*Richard Demille Wyckoff (1873\u20131934) was an early 20th-century pioneer in the technical approach to studying the stock market. He is considered one of the five \u201ctitans\u201d of technical analysis, along with Dow, Gann, Elliott and Merrill. At age 15, he took a job as a stock runner for a New York brokerage. Afterwards, while still in his 20s, he became the head of his own firm. He also founded and, for nearly two decades wrote, and edited The Magazine of Wall Street, which, at one point, had more than 200,000 subscribers. Wyckoff was an avid student of the markets, as well as an active tape reader and trader. He observed the market activities and campaigns of the legendary stock operators of his time, including JP Morgan and Jesse Livermore. From his observations and interviews with those big-time traders, Wyckoff codified the best practices of Livermore and others into laws, principles and techniques of trading methodology, money management and mental discipline.*\n\n**Why I'm Including it in This Post?**\n\n&gt;*From his position, Mr. Wyckoff observed numerous retail investors being repeatedly fleeced. Consequently, he dedicated himself to instructing the public about \u201cthe real rules of the game\u201d as played by the large interests, or \u201csmart money.\u201d In the 1930s, he founded a school which would later become the Stock Market Institute. The school's central offering was a course that integrated the concepts that Wyckoff had learned about how to identify large operators' accumulation and distribution of stock with how to take positions in harmony with these big players. His time-tested insights are as valid today as they were when first articulated.*\n\nBasically in 1930 near his death he started writing books about what he learned during his life to make retail investors understand the market better, illustrating all his knowledge in a reddit post is impossible and today I want to focus only on market manipulation.\n\n# Who Is The \"Composite Man\"\n\n&gt;*\u201c\u2026all the fluctuations in the market and in all the various stocks should be studied as if they were the result of one man\u2019s operations. Let us call him the Composite Man, who, in theory, sits behind the scenes and manipulates the stocks to your disadvantage if you do not understand the game as he plays it; and to your great profit if you do understand it.\u201d* (*The Richard D. Wyckoff Course in Stock Market Science and Technique*, section 9, p. 1-2) \n\nBased on his years of observations of the market activities of large operators, Wyckoff taught that:\n\n1. The Composite Man carefully plans, executes and concludes his campaigns.\n2. The Composite Man attracts the public to buy a stock in which he has already accumulated a sizeable line of shares by making many transactions involving a large number of shares, in effect advertising his stock by creating the appearance of a \u201cbroad market.\u201d\n3. One must study individual stock charts with the purpose of judging the behavior of the stock and the motives of those large operators who dominate it.\n4. With study and practice, one can acquire the ability to interpret the motives behind the action that a chart portrays. Wyckoff and his associates believed that if one could understand the market behavior of the Composite Man, one could identify many trading and investment opportunities early enough to profit from them.\n\n# The Importance Of Liquidity\n\nLet's say a stock is sitting at $20 but a \"Pro\" thinks it could make it to be worth $40, large investors may not accumulate a high number of shares at one time as this would cause a sudden change in the stock price. Instead they will take advantage of weak market sessions to slowly accumulate their target number of shares.\n\nOnce they have accumulated their target number of shares and want to sell for the same reason as before, they can't unload everything at once or they would affect the market again.\n\nBut how can they unload their shares at maximum profit? Through manipulation. They can do it by making that shady little company look like it will become the next Apple, and they manipulate the newspapers to do it.\n\n[FOMO](https://preview.redd.it/4ikowb6j5l671.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=949686266619575afa3c565a32df772ddf11aa1b)\n\nThey create FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) in small retail investors, and that brings a lot of volume on that stock. If you thought the goal of the market makers was to inflate the stock price through this type of manipulation, you're wrong.\n\nConsider an institutional investor who bought 5,000,000 shares of a company at $1 that now sits at $3, has a lot more information about that company than you do, and knows that company is bad and likely to release bad news in a few weeks. Everyone knows that in order to sell something you need a buyer willing to pay the price you're offering, so how can he dump 5,000,000 shares of stock unnoticed in a few weeks and get away with it? He's going to start making people think that this company has something very big coming up, that he's going to make a 500% move and you're going to miss out. People start \"FOMOing\" and bring huge volume to that stock, with more people willing to buy he can sell all his shares faster and get out of that stock as quickly as possible. He doesn't care if the stock makes a 100% move in the meantime because of this sudden interest, he only cares about getting out. And guess what, later on, when the bad news is released, the market maker will be the winner while a lot of retail investors have been burned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cYou have often noticed that a stock will sell at the highest price for many months on the very day when a stock dividend, or some very bullish news, appears in print. **This is not mere accident.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The whole move is manufactured.** Its purpose is to make money for inside interests \u2014 those who are operating in the stock in a large way. And this can only be done by fooling the public, or by inducing the public to fool themselves.\u201d\n\nThis was written in 1930! 90 Years ago! Buy the rumour sell the news.\n\n# Market Manipulation 5.0 And How You Are Helping To Make It Happen\n\nAfter what happened with meme stocks in the last month a lot of people started looking to invest, without any knowledge and trusting the advice of people on reddit and other social media many found themselves losing a lot of money on some stocks that look very good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is happening now is that some big institutions probably pay influencers and use bots to make some companies look much better than they really are. The problem is that many people trust other DDs (Due Diligence) too much and end up thinking that a stock is really good and they buy some stocks. What's worse is that a lot of times people who have invested in some companies end up becoming like extremists and start \"propagandizing\" when they see that they are losing money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically what is happening is that I (and probably you too) am noticing a lot of people or groups who buy for example a stock at $10 because it is full of potential (pumped by a market maker) and when they find themselves owning it with a 30% loss they start trying to convince people that it will soon go up. This is ethically wrong and to avoid getting caught in this you should ALWAYS do your research. If you don't know how to research ask the person who posted the sources.\n\n# How Can You Stop Losing Money On Bad Stocks\n\n* Don't trust anyone, do your own research\n* Ask for sources from those who publish DDs\n* Stay away from stocks that come from scam countries\n* If you see a lot of people saying a stock is going to go up stay away\n* Don't buy a stock that people say will CERTAINLY have good news coming (example: \"stock X will get FDA approval next week\" usually won't and will fall into oblivion)\n* If you're losing on a stock, stop saying on social media that it will surely rebound\n* If you buy a stock you MUST stay current on it, you can't just buy and forget about it\n* If a stock has a news related to a sector unrelated to it stay away (for example a tourism stock says it will do something in the hot sector of the moment, this is usually done to temporarily pump up the stock)\n* SELL THE NEWS\n\n# Conclusion\n\nEnglish is not my first language, I hope I have expressed myself correctly. I used information from StockCharts and Financial Post. I know this is a different post than the average one here, so I hope you enjoyed it!

        "selftext": "Hey All,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm brand new to WSB but bear with me. Once upon a time, when I was very down on my luck, I walked into a temp agency and asked for any job they could give me. What they had was a factory assembly worker on the line at Blackberry in my hometown of Waterloo, Canada (yep...Canadian alert!). It was a 12hr job with day/night swapping shifts. It was a repetative, monotonous job putting screws into things and doing it all in style in a zero static white suit and blue boots. It was most definitely NOT what I had envisioned for myself for the rest of my life. However, that job would turn out to be one of the most rewarding short-term jobs I've ever had because I sat next to some truly wonderful people on the assembly line. \n\nWith nothing to do for 12hrs but shoot the sh\\*t, I soon discovered that I was sitting next to doctors from Iran, lawyers from Indonesia, CEOs from Pakistan. Each of them had come to this job out of desperation just like me. Each of them were deemed \"overqualified\" by most other jobs just like me. Each of them had worked hard, invested in company shares (BB had an amazing employee share program) and had made more money there than they could have dreamed. BB had given them the promise of a real future in Canada and you could see the passion they had for this company in their faces. Also, BB once a year rented out the Air Canada Centre (or Rogers or whatever the hell its called now...) and rented a rock band for their employees! Like...ALL of their employees...not just management. I saw ACDC, Steven Tyler, Van Halen and the Tragically Hip. All thanks to BB. They wanted to spread the love. \n\nSo I got over myself and how I wasn't where I wanted to be, and I used this job to give myself a crash-course on global politics from the amazing people I worked with. I learned about the so-called \"scary\" parts of the world and how beautiful they actually were. When the time came to leave that job and move on to other things, I left with a profound appreciation for hard-working immigrants and just how much dedication it takes to sit down at a factory bench with a $200k salary potential education, and screw things together for $14/hr. I'll never forget those people. And I'll never forget that company. Blackberry gave life, employment, education grants, city improvements and other amazing opportunities to my hometown of Waterloo. When the time came that Apple overtook them and Blackberry faltered, my hometown and the rest of Canada turned its back on them, and that disgusted me. \n\nTHAT is why I am investing in BB today. Not for a get-rich-quick scheme, but because I genuinely hold a special place in my heart for that company and can find way more emotional attachment to it than a TV channel I used to watch, and a place where I used to buy Ace Combat as a kid. \n\nTLDR; BB was once the bright future of Canadian tech industry, it carried me through tough times as an employee, and I respect it.",

        "selftext": "People underestimate Blackberry's QNX operating system as a secure RTOS (Real Time Operating System) based off of microkernel architecture. \ud83d\ude80\n\nFor those who don't know how a RTOS microkernel operates let's explain with minor detail. QNX is one of the most adopted embedded OS's in the world installed in defense systems, power plants and municipal grids, robotics, rockets, rail and 120 million vehicles and rising.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe reason for it's adoption is because of the way a QNX Neutrino RTOS operates compared to what we consider typical everyday operating systems. Most operating systems including IOS, Windows, Linux(Android) and MacOS to name the most apparent run on monolithic designs or hybrid kernels.\ud83d\ude80 \n\nA true microkernel architecture like QNX Neutrino RTOS has full memory protection which is built in meaning that any component can fail and be restarted without corrupting the microkernel or other components in the system. If failure does occur, QNX has the ability to rectify the problem without affecting any other part of the system through process monitoring and recovery components. This feature and ability equals extreme reliability and security and being a microkernel the OS is also modular.\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo what is the big deal your probably asking, Apple, ABC, and Microsoft might enter the space? Not exactly, in fact there has been work in this space from all three companies. Apple opened a facility across from QNX in Kanata and hired the ex creator of the OS Dan Dodge in 2016 to work with Mansfield on the autonomous car project called project Titan. The need for a secure and stable software is where Dodge and his decades of experience from QNX come into play.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe need for a software system as reliable and secure as QNX should be a big flag to the shear potential of QNX. It is clearly a threat and tough competition for even the biggest software companies. Not only this but project Titan continues to be illusive revealing possible setbacks and interference in trying to compete but also Apple lost several top managers from it's Apple Car project causing a potential setback to the launch revealing some attrition in the project.\ud83d\ude80\n\nQNX version (7.1) is years ahead and analysts predict the next competitor is still 5 years away from anything even remotely close.  QNX hypervisor 2.0 is 61508 SIL 3 certified and\u00a0has been recognized as ISO 26262 ASIL D compliant making it the world's first ASIL D safety-certified commercial hypervisor. \ud83d\ude80\n\nAs other's race to catch up BlackBerry has been filing patents on it's system.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe QNX Hypervisor utilizes patented and patent-pending technologies that simplifies how elements are shared on the system. Multiple OS's can use 1 display controller to render content onto multiple displays, aka digital instrument cluster and infotainment.\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "CLOV is my next TSLA\n\nThe daily suppression and manipulation of CLOV by the hedges is well known, and there are plenty of DD\u2019s on why CLOV will surpass $50-150+ in the short-midterm. However, I\u2019m not going to get into that. My goal with this post is to explain how CLOV is revolutionizing the healthcare industry, much like TSLA did in the auto industry, and give my perspective on why it will outperform its competitors.\n\n**TL;DR - First, intro - they\u2019re changing the game just like Tesla did back in the day. Next, they\u2019re growing, but the haters gon hate. Why? Because CLOV is the first of its kind and troglodytes hate change! Wrap it up - be dead inside, cuz studies show the highest returns went to people who are dead or forgot their account.**\n\n**This is 10% Luck, 20% Skill**\n\nHave you or a loved one ever gone to the doctor more than once to get a diagnosis for a problem you can\u2019t figure out? The doctor reviews your file each time, but always gives the same answer: \u201cLet\u2019s do another test. I\u2019ll refer you to\u2026\u201d It seems like you\u2019re never making progress because either your doctor has run out of ideas or isn\u2019t familiar enough with your medical history. Now imagine an elderly person navigating this same system, trying to remember what tests they\u2019ve had done and their results on their own. This is impossibly difficult for anyone to deal with, and it\u2019s exactly the problem Clover Health is trying to solve.\n\nTheir AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient\u2019s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts.\n\n**15% Concentrated Power of Will**\n\nClover Assistant is offered for free, and currently they\u2019re taking a yearly net loss to improve their AI, which will eventually pay off just like Tesla\u2019s AI. One problem they may face in future is their competitors integrating machine learning into their platforms as well, but by then Clover will be years ahead of them with no hope of any of them catching up.\n\n**5% Pleasure, 50% Pain**\n\nLast week CLOV announced new partnerships with [Upward Health](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upward-health-announces-contract-clover-124500091.html) and the [U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/09/2244291/0/en/Clover-Health-to-Scale-In-home-Primary-Care-Program-Through-Direct-Contracting.html), expanding their in-home and virtual service offerings. Considering the trend towards virtual healthcare, this is extremely good news and helps strengthen its fundamentals/growth. Everyone can clearly see how well Teladoc is doing with their in-home service, and this integration will only continue to improve and expand as they cater to our convenience/laziness. This is not priced in due to the volatility in the stock market.(Sidenote: If Hindenturd\u2019s claims were even remotely true, CLOV would not be expanding their partnership with Medicaid/Medicare only for it to fizzle out in a year.) Besides, with all the fear of inflation, it\u2019s important to remember that healthcare companies do really well during inflationary periods, unlike most other industries.\n\nIn spite of the evidence of growth, you\u2019ll continue to hear nothing but bad press about CLOV, particularly being compared to its competitors. These comparisons are nonsensical for multiple reasons: first, this is not an outdated, dying business, it has a real future in the rapidly growing healthcare tech industry. Secondly, none of CLOV\u2019s competitors currently integrate machine learning into their platform and are still using archaic methods of service delivery. Similarly, TSLA had bad PR almost daily when constantly compared to regular auto makers, even as the company continued to roll out new and improved technology like their autonomous driving tech. I did not let the bad press deter me from purchasing TSLA for $38-40 per share (price after split), and as the market and media has realized the nuance and innovation of the company my conviction paid off. CLOV is the same - it\u2019s not just a regular health insurance company, it\u2019s a disruptive tech company that uses AI to enhance its database for more profitable and superior care for their future growth. (Sidenote - One of my favorite investors Baillie Gifford has 5 million shares of CLOV, and he bought 2.3 million shares of TSLA at $8 a share during its bearish news cycle period.)\n\nCircling back, why do so many analysts have negative sentiment towards Clover Health? It\u2019s because they\u2019re constantly comparing it to the outdated healthcare insurance companies, the same exact way Tesla was compared to Ford, GM, Toyota, and Nissan. In Tesla\u2019s time, there was nothing else to compare it to - Tesla was the only one of its kind in its sector. Heck, Tim Cook wouldn\u2019t even meet with Elon when he tried to sell his company to Apple for pennies on the dollar in 2018. Imagine passing on what would become a trillion dollar company - **MISSED OPPORTUNITY EEEEEK.** \n\nIf the negative press was so convincing, it begs the question why didn\u2019t institutions and Chamath dump some or all their shares at $28 per share? Because they\u2019re not paperhand losers. These institutions rarely sell their stocks for a 2-3x return; when they invest, they\u2019re looking to hold long for a much, much greater return. They base their investment decisions on solid fundamentals, therefore if they are still holding CLOV the company must have a legitimate future of success. **Institutions are not emotional.** Retail investors, on the other hand, are the real paperhands. Many get in for the short-term, make 100% return, give away 30% to Uncle Sam, and leave with 70% in change. This isn\u2019t a bad return at all by any means, but a lot is left on the table when one makes emotional decisions. Take a look at any successful company and their stock volatility over its lifetime, and you\u2019ll see MANY major dips. Folks who sold on those dips are probably filled with regret, but the Buffets of the world, who are dead inside, have reaped the rewards.\n\n*\"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\"* \n\n* Warren Buffett\n\n**And 100% Reason to Remember the Name (CLOVER HEALTH!)**\n\nLike I said before, I\u2019m not here to talk about the short-mid term potential of CLOV $100+, but rather the long-term potential of CLOV $100+. If y\u2019all have been following Chamath as I have, you\u2019ll know he's known for making conservative valuations. In 2018, he said Tesla would triple... it actually went 22.5x at its peak (currently at 15x). Whether you like the guy or not, he has a stellar track record. On top of that, he is one of the very few who stood with retail investors against market manipulation. This short-term volatility doesn\u2019t deter me - I am long on this company, and will not sell my position for a measly 2-3x gain.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with what I think is the most succinct outlook on Clover Health that\u2019s been shared.\n\n*\u201cSo when you bring all of this forward and you think about the future, here\u2019s what I see in a nutshell: Number one\u2026 is a business that is actually delivering the promise of technology improving better outcomes and lowering costs in healthcare. Number two is a market that I think is huge and growing quickly. And number three is a business that is consistently taking share year over year over year. And so when you put all of these things together, in my opinion, this is one of the most straightforward investments I\u2019ve ever made. It\u2019s a business that I think will become extremely valuable. It will build a lot of enterprise value, and will be what I think is going to be our next 10x in 10 years investment.\u201d*\n\n* Chamath Palihapitiya",

        "selftext": "Value investing, at its core, is essentially buying great businesses at prices lower than their intrinsic value. Combine good analysis of intangibles, and you can make some really good finds. I feel, however, people have chosen to ignore the potential of lower priced, lesser known companies for companies trading well over their intrinsic values. Apple was trading at around 100$ in the early 2000\u2019s, and the fundamentals made sense for a buy back then, but people didn\u2019t buy it until it became mainstream. There are still many companies TILL THIS DAY that have amazing fundamentals, are in up and coming industries, and also have competitors doing decently well. If you can find these companies and hold on to them, then how is value investing dead? Is it easy to find the next Microsoft or Johnson and Johnson? No. It wasn\u2019t easy in 1995, it wasn\u2019t easy in 1965, and it\u2019s not gonna be easy in 2021. But the notion that value investing is some how less effective would mean that fundamentals don\u2019t matter long term. I think that\u2019s a very dangerous narrative to push. If you\u2019re not betting on a companies fundamentals for the long term, then what are you betting on exactly? Somebody to come along pay more for the stock you just bought?",

        "selftext": "Microsoft is developing dedicated streaming hardware that people will be able to hook up to their TVs to use its Netflix\\-like cloud gaming service.\n\nThe company is betting the future of video games will be a subscription-based model where people pay a certain amount of money each month to get access to a plethora of titles.\n\nIts Xbox Game Pass service does exactly that, offering access to a library of games developed both in-house and by third-party studios.\n\nThat\u2019s mostly digital downloads, but last year streaming was added with Microsoft publicly releasing Xbox Cloud Gaming. The feature is sort of like a \u201cNetflix for games,\u201d allowing gamers to play games that are hosted on remote servers and then streamed to users over the internet.\n\nA number of other companies have launched similar game-streaming services, including Google with Stadia and Amazon with Luna.\n\nNow, Microsoft is aiming to push its cloud gaming product to other platforms. It started rolling out Xbox Cloud Gaming to some users via a web browser on iPhones, iPads and PCs in April (Microsoft couldn\u2019t launch a proper mobile app for cloud gaming on Apple devices due to a dispute over App Store policies). And on Thursday, the company announced it wants to expand the service to TVs as well.\n\nOne way it plans to do that is by partnering with manufacturers to add cloud gaming to smart TVs. But Microsoft is also developing streaming devices which users can plug into their TV or computer monitor to stream games from the cloud. The company didn\u2019t elaborate on what those devices could look like, though it\u2019s reminiscent of Amazon\u2019s Fire TV and Google\u2019s Chromecast dongles, both of which now support cloud gaming.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft says it is working with mobile carriers like Telstra in Australia to offer new Xbox subscription models. It\u2019s also expanding cloud gaming to four new countries \u2014 Australia, Brazil, Mexico and Japan \u2014\u00a0 later this year, and aims to publicly launch the browser-based version of the software to all members of its $15-a-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription in the coming weeks.\n\nMicrosoft said it plans to add cloud gaming to its new Xbox Series X console, which launched last November to compete with Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5. In the next few weeks, the company will also upgrade the servers that power its cloud gaming service from its old Xbox One hardware to the Xbox Series X.\n\nMicrosoft competes aggressively with Sony when it comes to gaming. But it\u2019s taking a different strategy to its Japanese counterpart. While Sony is known for blockbuster exclusives that can only be played on a PlayStation console, Microsoft is focusing on embedding its Xbox services onto multiple platforms, including mobile and PC.\n\nMicrosoft has been stepping up its investments in gaming, buying the iconic studio Bethesda for $7.5 billion in its biggest video game-related acquisition yet.\n\nThe company is holding a joint event with Bethesda on Sunday as part of the E3 gaming conference to show off new games, with fans speculating they will reveal some details about a hotly-anticipated sci-fi game called Starfield.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/e3-microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-tv.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/e3-microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-tv.html)",

        "selftext": "Today  is the first time I feel bearish about AAPL. It's a money making  machine but stock goes higher because of future earning / innovation  potential and not because of how successful the company in the past. The  headwinds include: epic trial, chip shortage leading to reduced iPad  shipment and reduced future revenue, and possibly reduced iPhone 13  shipment due to no breaking changes.\n\nIn  addition to all these, already highest market cap in the market and  inflation fear looming the tech sector. Since AAPL is such a big part of  many indexes, the downward of indexes will affect AAPL a lot. Also,  three top car division executives just left AAPL and it does not seem  AAPL has made much progress in the car business which could be next big  growth area for AAPL.\n\nAmong a  dozen of professional analysts, only 2 are bearish and last week New  Street\u2019s Pierre Ferragu gave a $90 price target EOY. No major banks have  downgraded their outlook for AAPL and the consensus median is $160,  average is $157.10, high is $185.\n\nWhat do you think about AAPL?",

        "selftext": "\nI don\u2019t see this talked much about. If an international investor is buying US equities in dollars, they are paying in their own currency which is converted to dollars. \nSince the US dollar is the global reserve currency, we obviously had a lot of printing in 2020. 25% of all US dollar in existence was printed last year. Expectedly, this leads to inflation. Whether is temporary or not remains to be seen but it would not be surprising to see a less valuable dollar. \n\nWouldn\u2019t this also mean a smaller ROI for US stocks? For example, you may make a 10% gain on Apple and gain $13 per share. However, if the pound (\u00a3) is now 10% stronger against USD, when your USD is converted back to \u00a3, you may not even end up making a profit. \nIt seems this is likely to happen with the inflation numbers coming out. E.g UK YoY inflation was 2.1%, US was 5%.\n\nHow do you account for this, if at all, when investing for the long term? I guess you could stick to investing in companies in your own country but the growth is likely not there compared to the US. It becomes a game of balancing the numbers in to see if you end up losing money in a bullish market.",

        "selftext": "Good morning gamblers, \n\n**For a brief overview** - Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 300 employees from leading technology and automotive companies. [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/) Their unique selling point is a modular platform purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. This \u2018skateboard\u2019 platform is largely what drew Apple\u2019s interest. The platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car\u2019s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev)\n\nCanoo is bringing its first vehicle to market next year with its electric microbus/van available at a base price of $34,750 before tax incentives or add-ons. It\u2019s now taking preorders in the United States for the \u201clifestyle\u201d vehicle, as well as for its round-top pickup truck and multi-purpose delivery van. Canoo is taking a different route than many other electric vehicle manufacturers, which played a role in the interest from Apple and Hyundai. Canoo\u2019s trio of vehicles all have the same proprietary \u201cskateboard\u201d platform architecture that houses the batteries and electric drivetrain in a chassis that sits under the vehicle\u2019s cabin. This contributes to a similar design language between the vehicles, which all have the same wide front windshield and relatively low profile. [link](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/canoos-electric-microbus-will-start-under-35000-when-it-comes-to-market-next-year/)\n\nA quick glance at its balance sheet shows that they aren\u2019t at risk of running out of cash anytime soon. Their total assets are $717.8M (of which cash and cash equivalents are $641.9M) and total liabilities are $107.6M (of which long-term debt is $6.9M).[link](https://investors.canoo.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001558370-21-007431/goev-20210331x10q.htm#CondensedConsolidatedBalanceSheetsinthou)\n\n**Does it meet key conditions for a squeeze?**\n\n1. **High short interest: Yes,** ~29.7% short interest [link](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOEV) \n\n2. **Low float: Yes,** total float of 99.9M. 58.2% shares outstanding being held by insiders and 9.9% shares outstanding being held by institutions (23.7% of float) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV/holders?p=GOEV).  \n\n3. **Decent volume (also because of the high short interest there's a medium-high short ratio): Yes,** Nasdaq has the avg. daily share volume at 2.6M, [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest), Yahoo Finance has previous volume at 3.8M and average volume at 5.4M [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV?p=GOEV&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch), marketwatch has the average at 5.59M [link](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goev). \n\n4. **High short ratio: Yes,** based on the volume numbers above \u2013 we\u2019re looking at anywhere from 5.3 to 11.3 so shorts really shouldn\u2019t be able to cover within the week, possibly even two weeks. [shortsqueeze 5.3 link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&amp;submit=Short+Quote) and [Nasdaq 11.3 link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest)\n\n**Additional points**\n \n1.**There\u2019s room to run** - a squeeze would not initially be setting an ATH since the stock is currently down 51.5% [link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&amp;submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2) from its ATH with a market cap of $2.3 Billion. This is primarily due to an overhaul in management as well as a change in the business model which favored protecting Canoo\u2019s IP instead of providing it to other OEMs, still ended up bring the SP down short-term since it was radically different from when they went public. \n\n2.**Shorts running into a wall** - 150,000 shares are left available to borrow at a rate of 24.5%, which is 0.15% of the entire float so shorts are about to hit a wall in terms of how easy it is to manipulate the share price. [link](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/goev)\n\n3.**Possible PT** \u2013 unlike all the other information which is part data part speculation, this is **pure speculation** since we're talking about pre-revenue but I really think you could easily 10x the current share price if it\u2019s a momentum based squeeze since it's a short-term event that isn't based on technicals. Valuations based on fundamentals aren\u2019t really the same as they were a couple of years ago, and given the low interest rate / easy access to cash the question really is how high can it go? Since institutions don't hold the majority of the float (they currently only hold ~24% of the float but have increased their position by ~120% in the last month) and there should therefore theoretically be a smaller likelihood of shenanigans with lower price manipulation, this could easily 10x the current share price to $100 if more retail become aware of the company's potential and buy-in to their long-term vision, and additional institutions start buying in. Personally speaking, I like to look at market caps to see how high things can go \u2013 with GME and AMC both were hovering under a $20 Billion market cap before AMC blew open the gates a couple of weeks back. Other tickers that went up in the last week like WISH and CLOV however hit around a $10 Billion market cap before coming back down. If we use that $10B market cap to be conservative, that still gets us to almost $50, which is 5x the current share price \u2013 and since you can make a case for Canoo\u2019s short interest being higher than the previous two cases, I don\u2019t see why it couldn\u2019t reach that by the end of the month, or even within a week if shorts start to cover and bring the house down.\n\n**Upcoming catalysts**\n\n1. **Upcoming investor day this Thursday (June 17th)**, which will be a \u2018hybrid in-person and virtual journey into Canoo\u2019s product portfolio and business strategy.\u2019 [link](https://canooirday.com/)\n \n2. **Canoo is being added to the Russel 3000 index,** [link](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf) meaning that the stock along with other additions could be expected to \u2018trade more than their average daily volume in the Nasdaq Closing Cross on June 25, and some will trade an entire week\u2019s volume on \u201cRussell Friday\u201d.\u2019 [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-small-caps-should-know-about-the-russell-rebalance-2020-06-22).\n\nOn a final note, this is not financial advice so please don\u2019t treat it as such \u2013 do your own due diligence, read your own news, study their financials and evaluate multiple perspectives (bullish and bearish) to see what others are saying. Don\u2019t invest money you\u2019re not willing to lose, and do so at your own risk.\n\n**TLDR**:  Canoo is among the healthiest EV startups out there, $641.9 million in cash, only $6.9 million in long-term debt and a market cap of just $2.3 billion with a &lt;$10 share price. This is the company that Apple wanted to buy and Hyundai wanted to partner with. Other EVs have the same market cap and may not even have the cash to make it through the next 3 months so Canoo really should be trading at multiples of where it is atm. Price is trending upwards \u2013 11.8% in last week, 32.9% in last month \u2013 someone\u2019s been loading up while it\u2019s cheap (institutional ownership is up 119.2% over the last 3 months).

        "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nDue to a recent surge in this sort of activity I'm putting out in the public a stance /r/investing has held for some time.  This post will be linked in the rules for future clarification needs.   \n\nEver since the GME fiasco Reddit has been the site of an unprecedented amount of deliberate manipulation, bad faith interaction, and attempted pumping.  Because we are one of the larger financial subreddits we have had to deal with this front on - and we have stuck to our longstanding policy regarding brigading.  \n\nIn the last two weeks we have banned over 300 users tied to at least 7 different subreddits for this behavior.  I don't know what the fuck is going on but for whatever reason everyone forgot how to interact like an adult on Reddit in the last three months so here we are.  This is an investment sub, we talk about boring shit like stocks, bonds, markets, whatever - none of us have to be dealing with this subredditdrama style nonsense.  It's fucking childish. \n\n**First, a bit of history for the new users**\n\nThis policy dates back to mid 2013, in the origional Crypto craze there was a concerted effort by bad actors to establish subreddits focused on their new altcoin or cryptocurrency, then organize a brigade of various investment subreddits.  We reached out to the moderators of /r/cryptocurrency and they added our sub to their filters to prevent this sort of behavior from becoming an issue.  The admins also removed a few users and crypto subs that were created for this purpose.  \n\nHedgefundaspirations, Crasymike, a few older investment mods, and I held a policy way back then (Even before I was a mod here, and prior to this account even) of permanently banning anyone who participated in this activity.  The point here, is this is not a new policy, it's not reactive to any recent market events, and it's not going away.  We are not concerned with whether something is accurate, inaccurate, etc, we are not taking a pro/con stance on any given security or investment - we are taking a definitive stance against such bad faith interaction as we always have since the very early days of this sub. \n\n---------\n\n**The Policy**\n\nThe moment we determine that a brigade is occurring we will automatically and permanently ban anyone who participated in that brigade.  No questions asked, and no appeals given outside of very rare circumstances.  We will also remove the topic, lock comments, and potentially examine the idea of preventing any discussion on that topic for some time - regardless of if it may be a good faith question.   \n\n**What is a brigade?**\n\nAny attempt to gather members of a different subreddit, especially one focused on a specific security, investment, or stance, to come to /r/investing and do any of the following: \n\n - Educate the posters\n\n - Correct \"FUD\"\n\n - \"Share information\" about a given security\n\n - Correct some perception of bad actors - if you have reason to believe people in our sub are acting in bad faith then contact the moderation team.  DO NOT go post in some sub taking the opposite stance to gather reinforcements. \n\n - Share your stance/opinion, or information you believe to be true.\n\n**In short: if you are on a subreddit that is focused on a specific security, investment, or stance and you see someone there reference a post on /r/investing (link, a screen shot, a comment saying \"this is happening over at /r/investing, whatever), then you go post on /r/investing to express your stance you are getting a ban.**  If you spend all day in a subreddit focused on a given security, investment, or stance and you happen to \"innocently\" come across a post here on that subject you had better make absolutely sure nobody in the offending sub has mentioned /r/investing yet - because you're getting lumped in with brigaders if not.  \n\nI want to be very transparent about this - we do not care what you posted.  It could be a profane rant or a kind hearted link to a reputable source.  We care that you are participating in a broad bad faith engagement on Reddit.  After we lock/remove the thread we are able to see which users came from the offending sub very easily - and they will all get a ban.  \n\n**Just to be clear:** \n\nThis is not brigading: a post in /r/valueinvesting pointing out an interesting discussion on /r/investing, and users coming over to participate.  We are happy to facilitate good faith interaction between various communities.\n\nThis is brigading: a post on /r/AppleStockLovers about how someone on /r/investing talked shit about Apple stock.  And you coming over here to just let that person know you disagree.\n\nI tend to think anyone who can use a computer should be smart enough to understand when they are acting in bad faith.  So this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, but here we are.  \n\nJust to reiterate: This is not a change of policy, it is not reactive to anything that has happened in the post GME reddit environment.  We have been operating with this policy since at least 2013, probably before.  We're just seeing an absurd surge in this sort of shit so a public post was necessary.",

        "selftext": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/03/biden-bans-us-investment-chinese-military-tech-surveillance\n\nJoe Biden has signed an executive order that bans American entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance technology sectors.\n\nIn a move that his administration says will expand the scope of a legally flawed Trump-era order, the US treasury will enforce and update on a \u201crolling basis\u201d the new ban list of about 59 companies.\n\nIt also bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, and replaces an earlier list from the defense department, senior administration officials told reporters.\n\n\nChips with everything: how one Taiwanese company drives the world economy\nRead more\nThe order prevents US investment from supporting the Chinese military-industrial complex, as well as military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, Biden said in the order.\n\n\u201cIn addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside [China] and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,\u201d Biden said.\n\nA White House fact sheet on the order said the policy would take effect for those companies listed on 2 August.\n\nMajor Chinese firms included on the previous defense department list were also placed on the updated list, including Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), China Mobile Communications Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).\n\nSMIC is key to China\u2019s national drive to boost its domestic chip sector.\n\n\u201cWe fully expect that in the months ahead \u2026 we\u2019ll be adding additional companies to the new executive order\u2019s restrictions,\u201d one of the senior officials said.\n\nA second official told reporters that the inclusion of Chinese surveillance technology companies expanded the scope of the Trump administration\u2019s initial order last year, which the White House argues was carelessly drafted, leaving it open to court challenges.\n\nThe president has been reviewing a number of aspects of US policy toward China, and his administration had extended a deadline for implementation set by Donald Trump\u2019s order while it crafted its new policy framework.\n\n\nApple uses more suppliers from China than Taiwan for first time, data shows\nRead more\nThe move is part of Biden\u2019s broader series of steps to counter China, including reinforcing US alliances and pursuing large domestic investments to bolster American economic competitiveness, amid increasingly sour relations between the world\u2019s two most powerful countries.\n\nBiden\u2019s Indo-Pacific policy coordinator, Kurt Campbell, said last month that a period of engagement with China had come to an end and that the dominant paradigm in bilateral ties going forward would be one of competition.\n\nSenior officials said the treasury would give guidance later on what the scope of surveillance technology means, including whether companies are facilitating \u201crepression or serious human rights abuses\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe really want to make sure that any future prohibitions are on legally solid ground. So, our first listings really reflect that,\u201d a second senior administration official said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestors would have time to \u201cunwind\u201d investments, a third official said.\n\nThe new list provided few surprises for investors looking to see if they need to unload even more Chinese stocks and bonds.\n\nBut some previously identified companies, such as Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), which is spearheading Chinese efforts to compete with Boeing and Airbus, as well as two companies that had challenged the ban in court, Gowin Semiconductor Corp and Luokung Technology Corp, were not included.\n\nIn May, a judge signed an order removing the designation on Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, which was among the more high-profile Chinese technology companies that the Trump administration targeted for alleged ties to China\u2019s military.",

        "selftext": "Long time lurker first time poster in this sub.\n\nAbout me: very rich due to being right 20% of the time about technology trends.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nThis one is pretty simple.  \n\nThere are two stocks you can confidently buy now and hold for 10 yrs and get a 10x return.\n\nThose two stocks are Twitter and Shopify.\n\nNo shit, you say.  But I find much of this sub is looking for what we call \u201cquick wins\u201d in corporate America.  I\u2019m here to tell you, as a rich person, how to actually get rich without getting lucky and without spending all day staring at candle charts: put your money in Twitter and Shopify.\n\nImagine a guy 10 years ago telling you to bet the farm on Apple.  I\u2019m that guy, and I\u2019m telling you this now.\n\nHere is why:\n\nTwitter is now the de facto newsfeed for an increasing number of global humans.  Meanwhile it makes way less than half that Facebook properties do on a per user/session basis.  Their monetization model and ad products suck.  This is in part due to poor management but also intentional strategy to \u201cgrow now, monetize later\u201d.  Twitter is worth 1/20 of what Facebook is worth.  And Facebook trades at a very bargain price based on conventional metrics.  Value investors love Facebook, and it is unpopular because retail investors and other boomers think Facebook is going away because kids don\u2019t like it.  They are wrong.  Facebook is still a great investment in spite of it being the domain of boomers.  But before you put $1 into $fb, ask yourself how much time you spend on Facebook versus Twitter.  1/20?  That is the price.  You know as well as I do that you spend more than 1 minute on Twitter for every 20 mins you spend on Facebook/IG/etc.  Will Dorsey be the guy to figure this out?  It doesn\u2019t matter.  Twitter is a freight train with global relevance that will eventually, by hook or by crook, find a way to make money at least in the ballpark that Facebook does.  It is a matter of time.  The upside is that Twitter management might be smarter than all of us in waiting for delayed gratification. Twitter will easily be worth $1T+ within 10 years which for you is a 20 bagger.  Buy it and hold it and walk away from your computer.  You really think Twitter won\u2019t be worth $1T?  Gtfo.\n\nNow let me tell you about Shopify.\n\nI have spent 25 years in technology ranging from e-commerce to ads to subscriptions at companies you have heard of.\n\nShopify is the biggest and only threat to Amazon.  Amazon thrives on the back of merchants who undervalue their data and direct customer relationship in favor of distribution and simplicity.  You shall not pass.  Shopify has principles, namely that the merchant owns the customer relationship.  Shopify will win, as they will solve for last mile distribution and by continuing to honor the idea that the merchant has earned the customer relationship.  Shopify will pressure Amazon and eventually win.  You\u2019re betting on the idea that 1M merchants will beat 1.  That the collective mob of Main Street will beat Walmart.  They will.   Ask yourself: is your relationship with your favorite local merchant better or worse than your relationship with Walmart.   This is the equation, put simply.  Shopify will easily be worth $1T in the next ten years and that is 6 bagger.\n\nBoth of these projections are very easy to believe over a decade timeframe.  Stop wasting your time on get rich quick schemes, buy and hold these companies and go learn some skills and work hard, buy stock in these two companies.  Set a reminder to thank me in 2031.\n\nThat is all.",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR** -  HEAVY SHORT INTEREST, MULTIPLE UPCOMING CATALYSTS, LOW FLOAT, HEALTHY COMPANY WITH NO DEBT AND EXCESS OPERATIONAL CASH, BEAT DOWN BY SHORTS AND PRIMED FOR A COME BACK, RUMORS OF HIGHLY PROFITABLE PARTNERSHIPS\n\nHello degenerates, \n\nI like you have been watching the roller coasters and rocket ships that is this market and think I've found something very early with great upside. \n\n**LET'S START WITH THE BASICS** \n\nCanoo is an EV startup that will be selling commercial and passenger vehicles that are in production and are slated to be released next year. They have had a lot of unfounded trepidation surrounding their SPAC debut which has lead to shorts bombarding this stock to well below it's fair cost. As far as EVs go it is one of the healthiest EV's on the market currently with $641.9 million in cash and ONLY $6.9 million in long-term debt with a market cap of just $2.3 billion. This is huge in terms of long term potential when $GOEV can easily be a 10 bn mkt cap stock. \n\n**Let's talk shorts**\n\nThe current float available to short is **0.15%**, you apes know what this means, borrow fee is 24.5% meaning the demand is HUGE. A buy and hold can cause a monumental squeeze here and there's only 11 days to cover. I'm going to refer you guys to /u/ny92 post here because he did a great write up:\n\n**Does it meet key conditions for a squeeze?**\n\nHigh short interest: Yes, ~29.7% short interest [link](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOEV)\n\nLow float: Yes, total float of 99.9M. 58.2% shares outstanding being held by insiders and 9.9% shares outstanding being held by institutions (23.7% of float) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV/holders?p=GOEV)\n\nDecent volume (also because of the high short interest there's a medium-high short ratio): Yes, Nasdaq has the avg. daily share volume at 2.6M, [link,](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest) Yahoo Finance has previous volume at 3.8M and average volume at 5.4M [link,](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV?p=GOEV&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) marketwatch has the average at 5.59M [link](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goev)\n\nHigh short ratio: Yes, based on the volume numbers above \u2013 we\u2019re looking at anywhere from 5.3 to 11.3 so shorts really shouldn\u2019t be able to cover within the week, possibly even two weeks [link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&amp;submit=Short+Quote) Nasdaq 11.3 [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest)\n\n**Other points of interest**\n\n6/17 will be Investor Relation's day, a potential catalyst as the company is urged to share some good news because of short attacks.\n\n6/25 GOEV/Canoo will be added to the Russell 3000 index along with our other favorite meme stocks like GME. This is a tremendous catalyst for volume. \n\n\n**Keep in mind that half of the short interest here is ALREADY under water. They've been short since April and at $9 or under they have been paying a 25% rate. There will be MASSIVE covering.**\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOk so, what about the long-term? \n\nBesides their very healthy balance sheet and being vastly oversold they seem to be getting a lot institutional attention and insider ownership, in my experience this is a **VERY** bullish sign. The top institutional investors in Canoo are Vanguard, Invesco and Blackrock. Institutional holdings are at about 22,661,541 shares but more importantly $GOEV stock had 55 **NEW** institutional investments in for a total of 18,683,793 shares. This is a sign of bullish optimism in the long term. \n\n**The Covid Killer Car** [Canoo is starting to release positive news and this is the first of many](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-debuts-air-purifying-climate-control-with-uv-technology), their new interior enhances interior air quality, attacks odors and kills viruses instantly, including Covid-19, and will be pre-loaded in the Premium and Adventure packages of its Lifestyle Vehicle. Their vehicles will have both luxury and more affordable models along with a commercial line. Coupled with **INNOVATIVE TECH** the designs are so good that Apple wanted the designer which leads me to my next point.. \n\nThe juicy **speculative rumors**  - **Apple Partnership** - The co-founder and CEO of Canoo Ulrich Kranz has stepped down and been hired to help with the development of the Apple Car. A lot of people initially thought this was bad for Canoo but I see it as a bullish sign. He is still a major shareholder and his design's have been implemented into the vehicles that will be released next year and they were good enough that Apple hired him to design theirs. More importantly there have been rumors of Apple teaming with Canoo to use their self-driving software or parts of their already developed hardware since it's trademarked by Canoo. Limited Apple partnership could be imminent. This can be a HUGE partnership for Canoo and can easily 10x their stock. \n\n\n**SEC investigation** - I think I should cover this even though it's entirely baseless. This initially made the stock take a huge hit and has more or less been deemed to be nothing. There is so much positive news boiling up that once people reinvest and realize nothing will come of this I can see a lot of FOMO from previous sellers. \n\nThe Long and short of this stock is bullish, if you were just to buy it and forget about it you would do well, if you were to play an upcoming squeeze you would do well, this is a healthy and innovative company that has been unfairly shorted way below it's fair market value. I will be updating this post with more information but I want to post this on a dip, my position is shares and calls bought @~9.60.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nedit: WE HAVE TAKEOFF GENTLEMEN\n\n**This is not financial advice, please do your own research**",

        "selftext": " France\u2019s competition watchdog has fined Google 220 million euros ($267 million) for abusing its market power in the online advertising industry.\n\nThe French Competition Authority said Monday Google had unfairly sent business to its own services, and discriminated against the competition. Google has agreed to pay the fine and end some of its self-preferencing practices, the watchdog said.\n\nThe investigation found that Google gave preferential treatment to its DFP advertising server, which allows publishers of sites and applications to sell their advertising space, and its SSP AdX listing platform, which organizes auction processes and allows publishers to sell their \u201cimpressions\u201d or advertising inventory to advertisers. Google\u2019s rivals and publishers suffered as a result, the regulator said.\n\nIsabelle de Silva, president of the French Competition Authority, said in a statement that the decision is the first in the world \u201cto look at the complex algorithmic auction processes by which online advertising \u2018display\u2019 operates.\u201d\n\nShe added that the investigation revealed processes by which Google favored itself over its competitors on both advertising servers and supply-side platforms, which are pieces of software used by publishers to manage, sell and optimize ad space\u00a0on their websites and mobile apps.\n\n\u201cThese very serious practices have penalized competition in the emerging online advertising market, and have enabled Google not only to preserve but also to increase its dominant position,\u201d said de Silva.\n\n\u201cThis sanction and these commitments will make it possible to re-establish a level playing field for all actors, and the ability of publishers to make the most of their advertising spaces.\u201d\n\nGoogle announced in a blog on Monday that it will be making a series of changes to its advertising technology.\n\n\u201cWe recognize the role that ad tech plays in supporting access to content and information and we\u2019re committed to working collaboratively with regulators and investing in new products and technologies that give publishers more choice and better results when using our platforms,\u201d wrote Maria Gomri, legal director of Google France.\n\nThe investigation comes after U.S.-based News Corp, French newspaper Le Figaro and the Belgian press group Rossel filed a complaint against Google.\n\nRegulators across Europe are clamping down on the major U.S. tech giants amid concerns that they wield too much power on the bloc\u2019s 700 million plus citizens.\n\nLast week, Facebook was hit by two antitrust probes from regulators in the U.K. and Europe.\n\nThe European Commission has launched probes into\u00a0Amazon, Google and\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0over the last few years, while the U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority has also launched probes into\u00a0Google\u00a0and\u00a0Apple\u00a0since it\u00a0became an independent regulator in its own right in January\u00a0following Britain\u2019s exit from the EU.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/google-fined-by-france-for-abusing-online-advertising-position.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/google-fined-by-france-for-abusing-online-advertising-position.html)",

Battery swapping is so new (money losing right now, built infrastructure. No other company has innovated this) and they have developed swap stations all across China. Battery as a service lets customers buy a car and lease the battery, so cars are a bit cheaper up front.\n-European expansion, mainly Norway.

        "selftext": "I have been saying for about 2-3 weeks that I would do a DD on $SoFi and figured with the increased volume and mentions today, it is time lay out my own bull thesis.  \n\nSoFi was founded in 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, four students who met at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi#:~:text=SoFi%20was%20founded%20in%202011,debt%20to%20fund%20their%20education.\n\nI am just a big believer in bringing personal finances to the masses and to teach people about personal finance and how to accumulate and build wealth, most parents and schools don\u2019t teach shit on the subject matter. I absolutely love SoFi's statements/mantras:\n\n- Our number one goal is helping our members get their money right. \n\n- SoFi's mission is to help people reach financial independence to realize their ambitions.\n\nLet's go over some #s.  SoFi has been around and growing as a private company for some time now and has seen seven consecutive quarters of YoY growth w Q1 2021 producing 110% growth and ending w 2.281M members.  This is exponential to say the very least.\n\nI will be linking the data and numbers, but that is all readily available for all the see and find.  The adjusted Net Revenue and EBITDA are increasing and trending in the right direction, with 151% and 70% growth YoY respectively.  The biggest factors to me are they are scaling and accumulating data.  These 2 things are what are going to set companies apart to not only produce growth but obtain profitability to the bottom line. \n\nThe goal of SoFi is to be the one-stop shop for everything a person would need for finance.  Checking/savings accounts, personal loans, home loans, student loans, car loans, budgeting, investing in the markets, and on and on.  The total products used by members has grown by 121% YoY and financial products has grown 273% YoY.  It appears to this layman that they are figuring out to how grow members as well as total products used by member.  https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sofis-q1-earnings-beat-managements-guidance-as-company-prepares-to-trade-on-nasdaq-2021-05\n\nSoFi acquired Golden Pacific Bancorp Inc in its quest to get a federal bank charter, which is cumbersome and tedious process.  This would be an upcoming catalyst for sure if/when this happens https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/sofi-s-bank-buy-presents-blueprint-for-more-fintech-bank-deals-63129976\n\nThe Galileo acquisition was a game changer and covered well by u/havocs2 in his DD, I would just add that this has seen 130% YoY (everything seems to be growing triple digits) growth as well. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9l9x6/why_sofi_will_be_sofly_my_78000_yolo_into_sofi/ \n\n$SoFi was brought to market under the SPAC model and coverage of the stonk has just began.  Coverage was initiated by Oppenheimer w an outperform and was also initiated by Rosenblatt w a buy.  TipRanks has it rated as moderate buy and a price target of $27.50, about a 40% premium to today's closing price.  https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast\n\nI am not a bot, nor am I a shill.  I am very active (to fucking active to be honest) in the daily and I post almost all my plays in real time.  Check my post history and you can see that I have been in this play for some time and believe in the company.\n\nCurrent positions: 5 $12.50 2023 LEAPS, 2 $20.00 2023 LEAPS, and 155 shares and no intention of dumping or selling short term.\n\nIs there a high SI? is the borrow rate high? Was this targeted because it was a Chamath SPAC?  Probably, i don't know for sure and honestly don't give 2 shits if it is or it is not, I like the company and the stonk and think it is undervalued and will only grow in the future.  That is what the hell I think.  \n\nTo be a FinTech disrupter, you obviously need an app and great user-friendly UI and SoFi has a 4.8 rating w over 48K reviews on the $AAPL app store.\n\nTL;DR There is no industry/s that need more disruption than banks and brokerages.  For far too long the poors and working class have been hit w hidden fees, outrageous fees, shit even made-up accounts.  SoFi is the just the company to do this disrupting all in one beautiful app!\n\nShout out to u/OSRSkarma as he kept pushing to post this.",

        "selftext": "I am pretty much torn over SPOT. I have used Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music. I have to say that playlists and recommendations from Spotify are the best. Even though I love using Spotify, I am not sure whether I should put any money into the stock.\n\nThe main issue I have with SPOT is it is the only company in the music streaming game that needs to make money off of music streaming. All the other companies (AAPL, AMZN, GOOG) don't have to make a penny from their music streaming services because all of these companies have way more profitable lines of businesses. Besides, music streaming does not have any economy of scale to speak of. The more users you have, the more music is getting streamed, the more royalties you have to pay out.\n\nAny thoughts on why SPOT should have a spot in a stock portfolio?",

        "selftext": "I will first give you some background about myself, have been lurking in this sub for quite a while now and absolutely love the community and fellow degenerate apes who steal tendies from the suits. I was lucky to get in on the $GME trade early on when it was still around \\~$30, made some nice dough, and still hold a few shares. It was a no-brainer trade once it became clear that hedge funds fucked up by shorting too much and waited too long to cover their shorts.\n\nI know many people missed that trade or lost because of bad entry/exit. But not to worry because guess what! A similar setup is building in $CLOV a.k.a Clover Health. A company brought to market by none other than the SPAC MAN himself `Chamath Palihapitiya`. Currently, it has a short interest of \\~44% on a low float of \\~110 million. Just so you know what caused high short interest and to be transparent, Chamath somewhat fucked up on this deal as an existing lawsuit against Clover Health was hidden from investors during the SPAC merger, the reasoning was that it was immaterial. This was revealed by a research firm called Hindenburg Research, which in my opinion produces hit pieces for WallSt. hedge funds. So naturally, shorts piled in and dragged the stock lower.\n\nNow coming to what's happening currently, first of all, the stock is up 55.61% in the past 5 days. You might think it is already rocketed, but do not make the mistake of thinking that it's late to get in. I entered $GME when it was \\~$30, after stalking it from $4 and now the stock is $285. I know $CLOV is no $GME but the real value of the stock is being suppressed by greedy short sellers. There are multiple bullish catalysts: fundamental, technical, as well as market-based, all converging at once. Below is a brief list of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Fundamental- $CLOV's latest financial results were Ok while the street was expecting them to be bad. The company has $720 million in cash!!! The lawsuit, mentioned earlier which was the main catalyst for short sellers to pile seems to be going nowhere, probably something to do with powerful and well-connected board members. Chelsea Clinton is one of them.\n2. Technical- $CLOV price action today just crossed up its 200-day moving average with big green dildo up shorts asses. This is extremely bullish for the stock. And the price is supported by volume, as relative volume has exploded to 112 million, 5x of average, which means more people are piling in.\n3. Market-based- $CLOV is going to be included in Ruseel 2000 index which means passive index fund buyers will be buying CLOV shares. This has brought in a lot of traders/speculators/investor interest, think about this like you being already aware that there will big line outside the Apple store once Apple announces a new device sale and you front run everybody to get in there before everybody else.\n\nAlso options volume today was huge, probably set up for a gamma squeeze effect. I suspect a lot of folks are trying to front-run what is inevitable, and that is $CLOV is going to the moon! I don't have a price target, because, given the trade setup and environment we are in, anything I will estimate might end up being low. If you cannot handle the volatility buy shares and sit tight, for more retarded apes options are the way to go. You are going to profit anyways. \n\n[My position is total $10,000 in options.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/numqb5/clov_10k_position_lets_see_how_high_this_goes/?sort=top)\n\n**TLDR, Suit up, hop in, and don't forget to buckle up my fellow apes. The $CLOV \ud83d\ude80 is ready for liftoff! Have fun and steal those tendies from greedy short sellers. This well might be your $GME moment!**",

        "selftext": "I am halfway through an 18 hour shift, currently stationed in Turkey, its hot as fuck, idk why I\u2019m here, I\u2019m 2,000mg deep in caffeine, getting drunk as soon as I get off, getting off as soon as I get off, my wife is back home cheating, my daughter calls another man dad, *cracks knuckles* lets do this. \n\nOverview\n\n\tAMD is a global semiconductor company offering x86 microprocessors as standalone or integrated (CPU\u2019s, GPU\u2019s, server systems, Etc\u2026) and intellectual property/ services.\n\nProducts\n\n\tAMD\u2019s primary products consist of CPU\u2019s and GPU\u2019s which are on par or out performing NVIDIA GPU\u2019s and Intel\u2019s CPU\u2019s. While these other two giants have dominated the market for sometime, AMD\u2019s recent move has evolved from a slow creep to a brisk jog. \n\nCompetition \n\n\tAMD\u2019s largest competitors are Intel (CPU\u2019s) and NVIDIA (GPU\u2019s). With the release of AMD\u2019s Ryzen processors in 2017, AMD has been steadily over taking Intel\u2019s dominance over market share. AMD\u2019s current market share (over all CPU\u2019s) currently sits at 44%, levels it has not seen since 2005. AMD took 20% of the market share in past 2 years with a significant jump in 2019. Since the release of Ryzen, AMD is now on par or out performing Intel chips and has gained a significant amount of sentiment over the soy boys at intel. AMD is on track to overtake the majority of CPU market share within the next year based on current projections.\n\n\tNow NVIDIA is a whole other beast who currently has a significant advantage over the dGPU market. Nvidia at the end of Q4 2020, held roughly 82% of the market share which was a increase of 9% from the previous year. AMD\u2019s high end GPU\u2019s do not come close to Nvidia\u2019s high end models, UNTIL AMD\u2019s Radeon 6000 series, which are now on par with Nvidia\u2019s cards, either outperforming or underperforming in various tests. AMD catching up to Nvidia is the same move that AMD made against Intel in 2017, 4 years later they are on the verge of overtaking market share. While Nvidia is a monster of a company, I believe that AMD will begin taking more market share from Nvidia and establish a decent foothold over the next few years. AMD has already taken the game console market, console plebs.\n\n\tAMD has already proved they are able to take back significant market share with there current and future products, Lisa Su is a genius and I believe she\u2019ll lead the company to Valhalla. What does AMD have that Nvidia does not? Aside from many differences, I think the fact that AMD has an ecosystem will play a significant role in catching up. Now that AMD can evenly compete with both of their rivals, AMD plans on leveraging the fact that they produce CPU\u2019s and GPU\u2019s. There are already incentives to using AMD\u2019s CPU with their GPU rather than an AMD CPU with a Nvidia GPU. With AMD taking the CPU market, retail users will be more likely to stick with the ecosystem, and I\u2019m a big fan of companies producing an ecosystem (laughs in apple). \n\n\tA new player enters the battle. Intel has been working on their own dGPU and will surely be releasing in the next few years, but I believe this will be comparable to Sony vs Microsoft with Nintendo enjoying their best life staring at butterfly\u2019s, covered in drool in the corner lol.\n\nThe Merger\n\n\tNvidia set to acquire ARM, AMD set to acquire Xilinx. What are they and how are they expected to impact the company?\n\nARM - Create and dominate the mobile processor market, covering TV\u2019s, phones, tablets, and other similar products as well as some software applications. I will not be covering much more of ARM in this DD.\n\nXilinx - Designs and develops programmable logic products. As far as I can tell this is some big brain shit that I\u2019m sure some booger nosed, mothers basement living, neck beard having, nerd will easily explain in the comments cuz Wikipedia ain\u2019t cutting it.  \n\n\tIf AMD completes the purchase, which is likely and expected to happen by the end of 2021, Xilinx shares will become worth 1.723 shares of AMD. AMD is currently trading at 86.10$, meaning that shares of Xilinx will be worth 148.35$ if the deal were to go through right now. Xilinx is currently worth 133.71$, I\u2019m betting heavily that AMD will continue to pump prior to this deal as well.\n\n\tARM will be huge for Nvidia, but this is running into some major road blocks and is likely some ways off or will fall through.\n\nFinancials and projections (I had pictures but I\u2019m reddit dumb)\n\nNet Revenue\n$9.8B(2020), $6.7B(2019), $6.5B(2018), $5.2B(2017)\nNet Incum \n$2.5B(2020), $341M(2019), $337M(2018), $(33)M(2017)\n\t\n\tI like your growth G\n\n\tAMD decreased their debt to 338 million from 568 million.\n\t\n\t$1.6 billion in cash ($9 billion in total assets, I find cash on hand more important)\n\n\tGPU/CPU sales accounted for $6.5 billion while enterprise accounted for $3.3 billion, GPU/CPU sales saw a 37% increase over 2019 while enterprise saw a 65% increase in 2020. 2021 is set to continue this trend of growth.\n\n\tAMD has a high price target of $169.70, median $107.00, and an average of $103.92.

        "selftext": "Let\u2019s start with the obvious that everyone needs to be talking about; oil. \n\n\nThe disconnect and overvaluation in oil futures is so fucking nonsensical that I would bet come Oct-Nov the average national US gas price will be in the 2.3-2.4 range, if not lower. The disconnect we\u2019re seeing is something I\u2019ve only found 2 other times in the last decade plus. The last time was in 2018. [In June the price average was 2.98, by Christmas and into early 2019 it sat 2.35-2.45.](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&amp;f=m) Prior to 2018 it was 2008. A year in which the price of gas topped 4.11 avg. and by the end of the year was sitting in the 1.7-1.9 range, obviously the Great Recession contributed to it. Now here is 2021, the national average in May was 3.07 and the overvaluation is greater than 2018 but not as bad as 2007-2008 appeared. Food for thought.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNext, the stock market is more overvalued than it has ever been. Ever. The [Total Market to GDP is 198% overvalued](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/60/ratio-of-wilshire-5000-over-gnp). For reference \u2018Normal\u2019 would be in the 95-120 range. If we look at the Top Stocks by Index weight the sign is not pretty. Tesla has begun it\u2019s crack and it may just be a matter of weeks before its 50 Avg. falls below its 200 Avg. (for the dumb, that ain\u2019t good.) Amazon and Apple have somewhat plateaued in recent months and show signs that a regress is in store. Basically the big weights holding this shit together is looking not good. We can take a look at the Dow and SP500 individually and it tells roughly the same story with the both taking a dump in the last few days.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[The Fed has already begun to say the will not hike rates next year](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/feds-kashkari-opposed-to-rate-hikes-at-least-through-2023.html), we\u2019re walking on egg shells and nobody anywhere is doing anything worthwhile to prepare for the worst. We\u2019re using a condom we know has a hole in it we put there and know the partner isn\u2019t on birth control. We\u2019re playing with fire and about to get burnt, well poor people mostly because I\u2019m sure they will take the majority of the blame with [the BS stories they\u2019re pushing with UI benefits.](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/07/truth-behind-unemployment-benefits-myth)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nBasically I am expecting over the course of the next year or so for the beginning of a recession on par with or worse than 2008. I believe 2020 will be looked at as the body ache before the actual flu sets in. The signs are all there and will just become solidified over the coming months. Early this year the war was on Short Sellers now it needs to be on the bullish and the greedy because they and the current system are going to fuck us all over even more. Just my two cents.",

        "selftext": "First let me point out that I don't have any positions in Facebook.  I did however apply for options trading on Fidelity today for just this reason.  Btw, is it just me or do those option prices look steep?\n\nTL-DR: I think Facebook is dropping hard in the next 4-6 month.  YouTube is screwed as well, but I won't bet against Google.  I know FB has a ton of bright people working for them, but Apple is attacking their business model and it seems to be working.\n\nLittle background here.  I work for a D2C (direct to consumer) company and am very involved with marketing spend allocaction, analysis etc.  Basically Facebook has been a boon to these types of marketers for the past couple of years.  We spend on avg 400k-600k per month in Facebook advertising.  It's very profitable until late May when Apple fully rolled out iOS 14.1.\n\niOS 14.1 is essentially a first strike attach against FB &amp; YT.\n\nPerhaps you've seen the latest Apple ads toting how great they are for privacy.  Here's what's really going on.  Advertisers like FB &amp; YT are able to make money by tracking user behavour to deliver ads that will convert.  Apple decided to throw a huge wrench in their business model....and look like they are the champion of privacy at the same time - genius.  Seriously, this was a master stroke move.\n\nHere's the reality of what I'm seeing and have heard the same from other marketers.\n\nFacebook &amp; YouTubes advertising platforms are basically broken.  I mean campaigns that we have run for 6mo's just stopped working.  We are cutting spend by 50%.  We want to spend more, but we can't justify it.  Not only that, but it's getting more expensive.  I'm not sure if this is due to other parties trying to spend their way out of the poor performance or FB increasing rates to make up for advertiser drop off.\n\nNot every company has in depth analytics like we do.  Some can go months before they realize that they just burned a pile of money.  Side note - this is great for companies like Pinterest that are intent based.  Similar to how search works...they know you are interested in certain subject so they send you relevant ads.  Also, Google search campaigns are still performing well.\n\nHere's my view on what's happening w/FB &amp; YT.  If an iOS user upgrades to iOS 14+ they are automatically oped out from being tracked on the apps they use.  I don't know about Safari, but f you launch FB or YT on your iPhone then you look like a brand new user from an advertisers point of view.\n\nSerious advertisers use a funnel approach to FB advertising.  Top of funnel (TOF) is used for brand awareness.  Bottom of funnel (BOF) is used to target people who interacted with your ad.  BTW, an interaction could mean you hoverered over the ad, not just clicks.  With this new reality, advertisers cannot re-target iOS users on FB and YT effectively for BOF ads.  This is huge.  Now we're stuck with some basic demographic targeting for ads with no intent data points.  It's like every FB user who has opted out of tracking looks like a brand new user with not history.\n\nFrom FB &amp; YT's point of view - every iOS user has no historical data to use in targeting.  You still have your friend list and YT subscriptions, but they can't use that data to target ads.  This might be fine for brand marketing but it doesn't work for performance marketing.  Performance marketing means we want you to interact with the ad and buy something.\n\nNow let's talk about attribution.  When FB/YT delivers you an ad, they will track whether you eventually bought the product - think the normal window is 28 days.  This means if you see an ad for a t-shirt, then go to the t-shirt company's website a week later and buy it...FB/YT take credit for the sale.  Now a good marketr knows that FB/YT doesn't deserve all the credit.  You may have advertised to them on some other medium...but FB/YT does deserve some credit.  If they hadn't seen the ad on FB/YT first they would never have eventually bought the shirt.\n\niOS 14 iis changing this as well.  I think the window is 7 days now...but might be less.\n\nMy ompany's sales are down 35% since iOS 14 rolled out.  Not only that but our FB/YT spend is down approx 40%.  In fact, I remember before the rollout happened our FB rep reached out to inquire what our spend budget was going to be for the year.  This is not normal.  Usually these platforms make you come to them and beg...they never reach out...and never ever for a budget plan.  We told them we planned on spending the same unless performanc changed..  Well, we're cutting spend by 50% and I have to imagin we're not the only ones.  Don't get me wrong - we want to spend more.  It's just not working out.\n\nAlso, has anyone noticed how much stock Zuck has been selling lately?  I think he's already doubled last year's number.\n\nOh, and FB nearly hit their all time high today.  Really, how is this possible.\n\nBTW - I have not interest in placing bets against Google.   Who in their right mind would place bets agains both of those giants.\n\nHere's my guess w/FB. I think they will come in a little low on earning on 7/19.  They have been increasing rates and traditionally they are the best place to advertise.  Howver, I think the cracks will really show on Q3 earning and continue to deteriorate in Q4.\n\nMy question is - if you had 20K-40K to invest in this scenario what would you do?  I'm thinking put options winter 2021 or Jan 2022.  Im assuming the stock is going to drop a hundred bucks between now and then.   How can I maximize my play with this set of assumptions?",

        "selftext": "So this is happening right now, but the G7 summit just unanimously said China is bad news.  They listed out several reasons and China basically said that\u2019s cap and said that they view the United States as having \u201csinister intentions.\u201d  So like cool, China drama happens all the time right? But here is where it gets interesting, while the G7 shat on them we started moving a navy carrier group into the South China Sea.  Now this is a routine war drill type thing, but it has always increased tensions.  If you remember a few years back China started increasing their claim to this sea by building artificial islands.  After we just condemned them for human rights violations, supported Hong Kong, and recognized them as a threat due to their growing presence; will they take nicely to our navy in waters that they believe are theirs?  When there were just rumors about a trade war apple stock dropped 4% in one afternoon, and since cell technology is the biggest import from China any event would cause large damage to this industry.  As well as Walmart having 80% of their products from China both are almost reliant and shit bricks over 10% tariff. We don\u2019t really recognize these islands and the territorial waters that come with typically sail through them, but not typically at a time like this.  If this provokes a response I think it might drop? Idk i am kinda retarded, but I bet on space etfs before ufo report and made 50% on calls, and that was far more retarded.",

        "selftext": "I hold Google since this Jan and have made 40% on it so far, which I consider outstanding for half a year. I know, it is not advised to sell but isn't it logical to take unrealistic gains when you have them? Not unrealistic for Google probably, but in general 40% gain in half a year almost always beats the market. Is it sensible to take money out and invest in a beat down stock like Apple? AAPL had hardly moved since a few months and looks set to take off any day now. I'm aware of warnings against timing the market, but I don't feel like waiting for Google to eventually be just a 20% gain at end of year makes sense.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m 25, and recently I\u2019ve been giving a lot of thought to just how many amazing opportunities on the stock market I\u2019ve missed over the years. The once-in-a-lifetime bull run of mid to late 2020 and early 2021, much earlier thoughts of investing in Apple back in 2010/2011, the fact I\u2019ve been interested in Tesla and SpaceX and basically anything Elon Musk does since its inception yet somehow never gave any thought to buying TSLA stock early. All missed, and I have to admit it\u2019s grating on me a little bit.\n\nI\u2019ve also heard a lot of talk that the stock market is probably going to be pretty stagnant overall over the next decade, so even if I decided it was a wise idea to park most of my money in a couple of relatively S&amp;P500 ETFs and leave it it probably won\u2019t make anything. Not that I\u2019m satisfied with 5% annual return anyway, because I\u2019m not. Not that I want to be a complete gambler either, but I\u2019d rather take moderate risks for moderately higher returns than end up being too old to get the good of any small fortune I make from low-risk long-term investing. Say what you like about the folks at WSB but there\u2019s no doubt a significant amount of folks there have made a lot of money, at times very quickly, albeit with a lot of risk.\n\nThe more I think about it the more I think what I\u2019m really looking for is not the next Apple or Tesla, but the next Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. Even back in 2012 it was obvious to me that SpaceX and Tesla were going to do well, and it was obvious to everyone that Apple was already doing well, and that it would continue to do so. Today however I see no such companies. I see smaller stocks that I like the look of, being in industries I think MIGHT be big in the future and that I think are very important (nuclear thorium, battery recycling etc.), but without a powerful CEO like Musk or Branson or Gates I can\u2019t see them getting the name recognition or making the 10x, 50x, 100x or 500x returns that early investors in companies like Apple or Tesla or Microsoft have so far realised. The companies I can see doing well in the future seem to be the ones that are already too big to make any sort of meaningful return in the short to medium term (i.e the next 10-15 years). There\u2019s also the crypto market I suppose but that seems to be a place where if you didn\u2019t get in before you hear the news then you are too late.\n\nAnyone else like this? If so, how did you get over it?\n\nEDIT: oh my, my first award on Reddit. Thanks! \ud83d\ude00",

        "selftext": "It was a generational changing of the guard this year for Ita\u00fa Unibanco. \n\nThe biggest financial services company in Brazil welcomed new CEO Milton Maluhy Filho. Just 44 years old, Maluhy took over from retiring Candido Bracher, and becomes the youngest bank boss in Brazil.\n\n\nDespite their tremendous market power, Brazil's giant banks did not move to take advantage of the rapid spread of broadband internet and smartphones across the continent in the early 2010s.\n\nThat is all about to change.  Ita\u00fa has now launched app adapted for the M1 chip.  Since the first Macs with an M1 chip hit the market, Ita\u00fa customers were basically unable to access their accounts from their computer using the app \u2014 having to use only the iOS app or, of course, the browser. **This week, the bank released a version of the App Ita\u00fa no Computer duly adapted for Apple.**  (For Macs, two independent versions of the app are available for download: one for Intel (compatible with macOS 10.12 Sierra or higher) and one for M1 (compatible only with macOS Big Sur 11).\n\nMOREOVER:  Ita\u00fa has partnered with fintech Rappi to provide greater access to financial services and products for retail and mass affluent clients in Chile. The agreement will allow customers to access the Brazilian bank and asset manager\u2019s investment strategies digitally through Rappi\u2019s phone app. \n\n\nMAINTAINING CONTROL OVER SMALL BUSINESS MARKET CAP: In Brazil, Ita\u00fa and Omie launch support platform for small and medium-sized businesses. The platform, called Ita\u00fa My Business, will feature several services for entrepreneurs, such as sales and service order management, financial management, automatic invoice issue, and integration with accountants.\n\nCHAD CEO:\n\nBrazil\u2019s Itau Unibanco Holding SA will be more active in making acquisitions and forming partnerships with smaller competitors this year, Chief Executive Milton Maluhy told journalists on Wednesday. The bank is eying deals with companies in sectors such as payments and investments, he added, which will complement the portfolio of Brazil\u2019s largest lender. Itau\u2019s chief financial officer, Alexsandro Broedel, said that despite fierce competition, the bank sees its net interest income growth accelerating by year-end, with trading gains reaching the upper part of the outlook range, close to 6.4 billion reais ($1.26 billion).\n\n\nWHO IS MILTON?  Milton Maluhy Filho became a director on January 1, 2019.  Previously, he was CEO of Rede S.A. (former Redecar S.A.), a card-processing subsidiary, and Executive Director at Ita\u00fa Unibanco, responsible for the management of the credit card segment and retail store alliances.  Prior to joining the bank, he worked at J.P. Morgan, Cr\u00e9dit Commercial de France (CCF Brazil) and Lloyds.\n\nIN SUMMATION\n\n1)ITAU, THREATENED BY NOOB ECOMMERCE STARTUP COMPANIES, FIRES THEIR CEO AND HIRES GIGA CHAD MILTON\n\n2)MILTON TAKES IMMEDIATE ACTION, SPENDING ALL THE REAIS ON APP DEVELOPMENT\n\n3)\nYESTERDAY MILTON ANNOUNCES SMALL BUZINESS APP PLATFORM\n\n4)YOU ARE HERE",

        "selftext": "Berkshire has purchased $9.2 billion of Verizon stock over the last 9 months, at an average price of $59. Today VZ trades below $57, giving us an opportunity to follow Berkshire into one of its largest common stock investments at a price below what Berkshire paid\n\nVerizon appears to be a much safer and higher yielding investment than Berkshire itself, with prices where they are. The dividend yield alone is higher than Berkshire's operating earnings yield. Verizon is an example of a stock whose interest rate has NOT collapsed:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/brkb/comments/mr2jcp/verizon_a_company_whose_market_value_is_affected/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nI believe Berkshire is fully and optimistically priced right now. Here are my thoughts\n\n**Justification #1:** As a first approximation, Berkshire's operating earnings yield is well below 4%, lower than I've ever seen it. As Buffett explicitly stated at the Annual Meeting, the Q1 2021 earnings were no higher than Q1 2020 would have been without COVID. Berkshire's \"interest rate\" has recently collapsed-- price way up, earnings almost flat\n\n**Justification #2:** Berkshire is fully valued according to a recent and fairly optimistic expert estimate of intrinsic value (Morningstar):\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/brkb/comments/m80e6e/greg_warren_morningstar_berkshire_shows_stronger/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n**Justification #3:** Nobody agrees fully with the (book value)+(insurance float) price predictor, but historically, stretching back for decades, it has been a losing proposition to buy above BV+FL. Today BV+FL is $257, and the P/(BV+FL) ratio is 1.13, an extreme high. The last time this happened was in 2014, and you can see what happened then:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/brkb/comments/mhf7i0/berkshire_hathaways_market_price_follows_the_sum/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n**Justification #4:** Berkshire was rapidly tapering its buybacks at $250, far below the current market price of $290. This is a dead giveaway that we are fully valued or overvalued. Berkshire's average buyback price is well below the highest price paid, probably around $210. The buybacks likely target an average price (just like when Berkshire was buying AAPL -- Berkshire bought many shares far above $35 but never made a purchase that would raise the average above $35). Here is the Q1 2021 buyback table, where you can see the tapering:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/brkb/comments/n2h588/berkshire_q1_2021_buyback_price_table_these/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI thought I'd show you some of my Due Diligence process. No process is perfect, I'm not an expert so don't take this as advice. This isn't my full process, I'll expand further in future posts.\n\nI'll be looking at **Apple** in this case, just for the sake of this post.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzb7um69j3671.png?width=2838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2442d4e463df0c3769847a9fb51920a486849774\n\n# Profile\n\nIt may sound silly but making sure the company you're looking at is real is a big part of Due Diligence. It's a quick and easy thing to verify that can save you a lot of headache later on.\n\n**Go through all the basics:**\n\n* Where is the company located?\n* Who are the Key Executives?\n* Look through their website\n* Find out what they do\n* How many employees do they have?\n* News Articles\n* Insider Trades: Who's making them?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eslo6un9j3671.png?width=2830&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dfadfa524d437c53a20ec7bdc92b56d26b310a7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vtju49z9j3671.png?width=2852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdffa78864ea86fdfdb0a1c4c1eb019171367693\n\n# Financials\n\nThis part is harder to explain since each of us have certain criteria when looking through financial data. But regardless of what you consider most important, it's essential that you understand these reports. Spend time looking through the numbers, ask yourself questions and get a feel for the financial health of the company. Is it investing more? Are margins improving? Are their cash reserves sufficient to cover debts? Go through everything.\n\n**Financial Statements:**\n\n[Annual &amp; Quarterly Financial Statements](https://preview.redd.it/h8l3k3yaj3671.png?width=2843&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fcee4424377187f6ad4e08669b5dc4d68b3333f)\n\n[YoY &amp; QoQ Growth](https://preview.redd.it/u57h59yaj3671.png?width=2840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1887c931e649ec3fe59e793c4c80c6ad723e5766)\n\n**Ratios &amp; Metrics**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/28lgfoxaj3671.png?width=2853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cb9610273f2446bae9e29cde0e25635d8581203\n\n**Analyst Estimates, Upgrades / Downgrades and Historical DCF**\n\nI like to take a look at what **Analysts** predict will happen in the next couple of years. There are just predictions of course so take them with a grain of salt, but they can help. **Upgrades / Downgrades** are useful as well, Investment Banks have large teams that work on these ratings. Lastly a look at **current and Historical DCF figures** helps me see how the market has and is **valuing the company compared to it's fair value based on fundamentals.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzug2kecj3671.png?width=2833&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73d08d94c14360366670ef7796ae43aade75ba91\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/31pc8kecj3671.png?width=2839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=579b8efafdc14ccc113b9fe9e4641eb3153f45df\n\n# Fundamental Analysis\n\nThis is the most important part of my process. Now that I have looked at the various financial data I like to put it all together to see how it all fits together as well as seeing YoY or QoQ growth. By combining my favorite or go-to data points I can often find patterns or at least make connections that may support or go against my thesis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jv9pk6tcj3671.png?width=2847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=860b039dd3023e969f819c42fbc853f85ba72519\n\n# Documents\n\nReading through SEC filings (10K's, 10Q's, Proxies, Prospectuses etc) as well as Earning Call Transcripts are essential parts of my process. So much amazing information can be found in these filings. It takes a little patience but it's most definitely worth doing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rtl1ybddj3671.png?width=2849&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=796606df2a92a337d86c9060e22f05e3f447ca9b\n\n# Ownership\n\nIt's always good to know which Funds and Institutions own the company you're looking at. When did they buy share? How many? At what Price?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rul094qdj3671.png?width=2816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5060f5546e9d04b205024eb727a08da3ade38a7\n\n# Price Charts\n\nI look at price charts to find any large fluctuation in price. I then find out when the large moves happened and go back looking for articles, press releases, social media posts to try and understand what caused them. This helps me understand what has historically effected the price of a company so that as I track and monitor it I can hopefully spot things in advance.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/clq3ca5ej3671.png?width=2833&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e597202e5ba022d313962ec971b4b61080811259",

        "selftext": "**Recent Movement**\n\nIt's no question that Canoo has been beaten down the last few months. It's down over 50% from it's pre-merger highs and dipped well below it's former NAV of $10. The big question is : why?\n\nThe news of their cancelled deal with Hyundai during their first earnings call is what caused the most recent downward move, but was it really negative news? Why have your engineers work for another car company, helping them develop a car and giving them your valuable IP? It makes more sense to focus on your own products, which will lead to much more revenue over the years. \n\nTheir original CEO, Ulrich Kranz, leaving was also a contributor to this movement. But again, the move makes sense. Ulrich is an iconic engineer and designer. That's where his focus should be. Having him step down and putting a business oriented CEO (Tony Aquila) is the right move. Not every engineer is Elon Musk. Kranz decided not to retain an engineering position with Canoo, leading me to...\n\n **Apple Hires Ulrich Kranz for It's Rebooted Car Project** [see here](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous)\n\nLots of speculations can be made here. If Ulrich had left on bad terms, most speculation would be bad.\n\nHowever, both publicly stated the departure was made on GOOD terms. \n\nAs you know, Apple tried to acquire Canoo in early 2020, which means their technology is the real deal. What do I think they're targeting? Canoo's **Skateboard Platform**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vrul6ibmo471.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6448dc4281f18423835ddb8ac2d068b03e7f9c3\n\nIf Apple had this, it would speed up their creation of the Apple car since they would only have to design the piece that goes on top. And since Apple couldn't buy Canoo, how could they get their hand on this?    Hire Ulrich and have him make one? : No, Canoo has their technology (a.k.a Ulrich's own tech) patented. \n\nI speculate a deal is in the works where Canoo licenses out their skateboard platform to Apple to build a car on in exchange for some royalty they receive for each sale. And hiring Ulrich Kranz helps them because he knows how to build a car on the platform because **HE MADE IT.**\n\nOf course this is highly speculative, but I believe it's the simplest explanation.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. **Investor Day**\n\nCanoo is holding their Investor Day next week on the 17th in Texas where they are actually letting investors attend and see their vehicles. They currently have 3 that we know of : the delivery van, pickup truck, and lifestyle vehicle(a.k.a minivan or BANGBUS). They have teased a sedan model in the past, and it's speculated they will unveil it at this event.\n\n2. **Manufacturing Announcement**\n\nCanoo's CEO said that their contract manufacturer would be announced in Q3, likely during the Q2 earnings call. This is the only thing holding them back right now. Their product is much further developed compared to the other former SPAC EV's, with 3 models that have drive-able prototypes. They may provide an update to us during Investor day.\n\n**Long and Behold: The Short Interest**\n\nOrtex is showing a current short interest rate of 30% of the share float, up 300% from their 10% short interest rate in January. They are betting against Canoo, and there are a few upcoming catalyst that could drastically change the market sentiment and blow them up.\n\n**Disclosure:**\n\nThis post contains highly speculative predictions, and I encourage you to read up on Canoo and do your own research. This is not financial advice.",

        "selftext": "Cost per contract:\n$23.40\n\nStock price at time of purchase:\n$127.15\n\nWhy:\nApple has remained flat for most of the past year. It first reached its current price in August 2020. Since then, much new hardware and software has been released, and the stock market has not yet responded favorably. \n\nBased on the latest swaths of advances unveiled at WWDC, I believe that this trend will end soon. Companies that take advantage of users\u2019 trust will look less appealing to investors. I expect that people who sold AAPL last year and earned profits elsewhere in tech like GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, and FB will begin investing back into Apple. The outcomes of anti-trust trials and other lawsuits are unlikely to affect Apple severely in the next two years. However, investors might fear that competitors will become less profitable. All of this, along with the consumer privacy awakening, stable quarterly revenue, growth of services like fitness+ and tv+, rumors of revolutionary products (and their anticipated future announcements), plus philanthropic investments in property (Bay Area housing), will make Apple look like a smart investing opportunity for the next 5 years.\n\nWhile some people may be bearish on this stock, it\u2019s important to remember we are only months away from an iOS 15 release, macOS Monterrey release, and the traditional September hardware release.\n\nExit strategy:\n- Sell or exercise 10 contracts at $53.45. Then exercise the remainder in two years.\n- Sell all immediately if at any point the value of contract decreases to $17.55.\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/gallery/CqarM1R",

You can view the website at [stocksera.pythonanywhere.com](https://stocksera.pythonanywhere.com/)\n\nApart from identifying trending tickers on Reddit (mainly [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/), [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) and [r/stockmarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/stockmarket/) ) based on number of posts, comments, upvotes and sentiment in the last 48 hours, I included a wallstreetbets ETF, where the top 25 trending tickers on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) will be bought. I will include trending tickers on r/options in the next few days!\n\nYou can also analyse a ticker historical data by sorting it according to date, volume, closing price etc. Basic information such as beta, market cap, average volume over the last few trading days, institutional holdings are available too. I also added a section to look at the trend of a ticker on Google.\n\nThere are other information for those who buy options such as option chain, max pain, call put ratio.\n\nShort interest, failure to deliver are also available for popular tickers such as AAPL, GME, AMC etc.\n\nFinancial data of company is included. But as this is still in progress, only the cash flow of the company is available. Balance sheet and financial statement will be available in the next update.\n\nThis is my first time making a website in Django since I started learning programming on my own since one year ago so I\u2019m leaving my code open-sourced for everyone to review my code to improve the website in the future. You can view the code at [https://github.com/spartan737/Stocksera](https://github.com/spartan737/Stocksera). Please give me a star if you like my project.\n\nBONUS. If you host this application locally on your computer, you can also view the latest news and their sentiment level of a ticker. This is not available for those who use [stocksera.pythonanywhere.com](https://stocksera.pythonanywhere.com/) since I\u2019m using a free account and the website that I used to get news article (Finviz) is not whitelisted by pythonanywhere. Instructions on how to view the news sentiment are included in github as well.",

Had I done so, I would have seen significant gains, upwards of 19%. Instead, I'm still in the read 9 months later. \n\nYes, I know it's a great company. I love their products. But I can't help but think that that doens't necessarily mean anything for the share price. \n\nI've decided to sell at a loss of about $900. I'm moving everything into VTI so I don't have to worry about picking the right company... or the wrong company, even when it's an amazing, rock solid company. \n\nIt just makes me think about how much bad advice is given about stocks. Nobody really knows anything. They say \"pick great companies and you got nothing to worry about.\" You can pick a rock solid, amazing company and still end up in the red while everything else gains.",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following is not financial advice.  I just love Daddy Karp, Daddy Thiel, and the PLTR Stock.\n\nWe all know **Daddy Karp.**  This is him forcing his employees to engage in combat dancing or some shit...right, lets carry on.\n\n[Daddy Alex Karp is a character, PERFECT for the memes.](https://preview.redd.it/agr1i21kjq571.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bf213a80de565ca37a90823e90e60d97c61e95b)\n\n**So why does this matter?**  Because Daddy Karp is a founder and one of two influencial arms of Plantir.  He is the negotiator for one side of american politics.\n\nThis matters because PLTR relies on large govt. contracts and MUST maintain a neutral political position.\n\nIt's other founder is Peter Thiel, or **Daddy Thiel.**  You might say he is a powerful man, and he handles the other side of american politics.\n\n[Thiel is an extremely influential and powerful billionaire contrarian known for playing 3D chess and looking decades out...PLTR is his baby.](https://preview.redd.it/knpdewpcht571.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e83e232d334be4533531385d1ed5fe15e8297495)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why does the govt. buy their software?**\n\nTheir software can take unbelievable amounts of video data, and give predictions on where enemies might attack, and various other events on a battlefield like it's a videogame.  The **CIA** helped them create their technology, and **SOCOM** just renewed a $300M a year contract with them.  These orgs. don't buy anything that doesn't work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This shit looks like it's out of the movies, or a real time strategy game.  It works and it forms the backbone of US military operations.  It also transfers very well to the enterprise software space...](https://preview.redd.it/a3kgc5j2pq571.jpg?width=1555&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9680a8142d5345a5b694a4467cb2af3387e20f4)\n\nThis is just one use case; their engineers have been refining this tech for 17 years where they could create a secret moat.  In-fact, Peter Thiel himself has a book and has given speeches on the power of moats and \"not competing, but forming a monopoly.\"  Zero to One.\n\n**So why all this info?  It's critical to understand the facts I am about to present to you.**\n\nWith a ton of hype, and plenty of meme power, PLTR rose to past $40 a share earlier this year.\n\nMost if not all did not truly understand how special the technology was, and it fell on FUD surrounding stock based compensation and Daddy Karp selling shares.  We will get to this FUD at the end.\n\nW**hy it's special:**\n\n**MOAT:  I see people say, \"it's just data analytics, anyone can compete with them.\" no.**\n\nThis is like people saying, \"it's just an airplane copy it and it should fly great.\"  An analytics platform that is able to \"gameify\" real world problems in real time and present solutions using integrated Ai/ML is a MASSIVE engineering problem.  Think, a ton of PHD level skilled engineers making the highest salaries in Tech.  So much, that they can retire after a few years if they want.  Now imagine them working for 17 years on something before any other company even thinks to start competing.  This is a bigger moat than many darlings of the tech world have in their software, such as TSLA, which had google, apple, etc. working on competing solutions for years.  And it has saved it's clients MILLIONS in Skywise.  For anyone in the software space; you know how brutal implementation is for SAP and similar platforms.  Often it's unsuccessful and expensive.  PLTR is already demonstrating PROFITABLE implementations.  This is a sign of a massive moat for anyone who understands the enterprise software world.\n\n[This is just a summary of one application of PLTR's Skywise platform; built on Foundry.  They are going to do this to every industry; true prescriptive analytics with rapid deployment of a custom solution.  If you understand that, it's insane.  If you don't, ask a friend that is intelligent and knows about software.](https://preview.redd.it/eg2qwmim1r571.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26b9bdc63c34c5ad1b0fab1bfafe473444e34ee6)\n\n**Earnings Expectations:  They are Sandbagging Sons of Bitches**\n\nRight now we are pricing Palantir at about 40X revenue as a SAAS company.  Their margins aren't the best as they continue to invest and maintain future monopoly status, but they are landing $300M govt. deals (SOCOM) and expanding that business which is EXTREMELY STICKY.\n\nTheir revenue growth officially is about 30% per year.\n\nHowever, as all SAAS companies do, internally they have a goal/target of around 50% per year.  That is absolutely achievable, in fact a few large deals can accomplish this, AND MUCH MORE.  I would argue this in itself is sandbagging due to the potential size of their enterprise deals (just ONE big deal would annihilate that number) and they have been offering their product for literally less than a year now...\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[With two Daddy's like this, what could go wrong?  Why is PLTR hated by the media?](https://preview.redd.it/wuid619x4r571.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=998b2feb59674afacc6dad5b7217cbde56e98e0c)\n\n**FUD:  What could go wrong, why has the stock dropped after it's meteoric rise?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **It's custom software! That's expensive, time consuming, hard to scale!  Companies won't buy it.**\n\nSAP is horrible and it's implemented all the time, takes years to implement, costs HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to implement, and is often not successful.  It's actually a running joke in the enterprise software world.  Palantir has a history of successful implementations (it's custom but designed so low-code it can be developed and delivered quickly in any enterprise), a testament to the 17 years that Karp and Thiel spent training their team in high gravity (lul).  **This is like a SMART salesforce, which by the way, was the fastest growing software company IN HISTORY and is worth $400B now, and it has competition in the CRM space.  PLTR is the next evolution, and has ZERO competition.**\n\nSalesforce was created to be a single source of truth in an enterprise. \u00a0Pltr takes that a step further by allowing you to simply plug in business units and allow it to act as your \u201csky net\u201d and tell you what to do. \u00a0It literally is that incredible. \u00a0It\u2019s true mass available prescriptive analytics, sprinkled across an entire company.\n\n**Is it unreasonable to think the mkt cap of pltr could be a multiple of salesforce in the near future when it is the next evolution of data platforms, has no competition, and salesforce previously held the record for fastest growing software company in history?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2.   Daddy Karp made the most of any CEO this year and he sold hundreds of millions of shares!**\n\nThe way he is paid, his Stock granted is income.  So he pays TAXES on it.  That means he has to sell shares just to cover the taxes so he doesn't go to federal prison.  The dude can't pay it any other way he doesn't have hundreds of millions of dollars laying around...he's spent 17 years building this as his baby.  This is all stupid media FUD because it makes awesome headlines and scares the shit out of boomers that aren't used to the financing around an insanely fast growing software company.  The numbers look crazy on the surface but make sense once you realize it's all because of the meteoric rise in the stock price.\n\n**3.  They are compensating their employees with Stock! It Dilutes us!**\n\nThey are hiring the worlds best software engineer PHD Data Scientists to make sure their moat and monopoly doesn't even come close to being encroached on.  These people are expensive.  They continually train their models in their client's environments, without keeping their clients data, only evolving their own model.  This maintains privacy and creates momentum for their algorithm that makes it impossible to catch up to PLTR's Foundry.  Think google with their threatgraph for search.  They have too much data and too much time refining their algorithms for anyone to catch them in that category.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Price Targets:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Holy Fucking Shit, look at that Q1 rev. growth despite being brand new to enterprise...](https://preview.redd.it/rkgyuszcuq571.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14ea1be3ff5dbdbadd731a7ae8a69d94fcabe713)\n\nIf they grow at the internal, non-sandbagged rate they think they will hit **according to internal docs shared with public (google Q4 2020 PLTR business update, can't link).**\n\nThey will have $4B in revenue, in 4 years.  Imagine in 4 years, if a SAAS company was priced at just 10x Revenue with 50% + growth yoy....which will accelerate as proof of concept is demonstrated at large orgs.\n\n**My price target is $80 EOY** because I believe at least one HUGE contract will roll in that will provide further proof of FOUNDRY as a concept and the impact will be undeniable.  Companies will be lining up to get Foundry and projected demand will show implied growth off the charts that no one has accounted for.  The Skywise project finalized my opinion on this, PLTR told them WHEN VALVES IN ENGINES WERE BEHAVING ODDLY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED PRIOR TO FAILURE, OPTIMALLY, TO SAVE MILLIONS A YEAR PER AIRLINE IN SCHEDULING AND OTHER COSTS you can read about that on another subreddit, the info is out there if you do a google search on skywise.\n\n**Price target in 4 years: $500.  1. its Cathy Bae's Number(not for that time period)**, but also because I think revenue growth will be more like salesforce was as a necessary platform to enterprises.  This would give it a larger MKT cap than Salesforce.  **If this becomes a hyped meme to add fueld to the fire, it will accelerate beyond what we can even comprehend, TESLA style.  Just the US GOVT. alone will be TRILLIONS of dollars potentially as they are investing trillions in Ai software solutions over the next 20 years.**   [Forbes GSA Article 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2020/08/16/how-the-us-government-is-using-ai-to-help-procure-trillions-of-dollars-of-products-and-services-an-interview-with-keith-nakasone-gsa/?sh=22a1193670ac)  [2021 Article about AI spending push..$Trillions with PLTR as the clear leader](https://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2021/04/biden-budget-requests-major-investments-federal-technology-and-cybersecurity/173262/)\n\n**if this happens....then.....**\n\n**Possible Price Target with hype and diamond hands TSLA style = $1000** when everyone figures out this Stock is literally magic because it will be bigger than google.  It's data analytics and threat-graph will be more useful to smart money and BIG money than google and it will rule the world.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Conclusion:** Both Daddy's have spent 17 years using the most advanced govt. resources (U.S. DOD spends the most on R&amp;D of any industry or company in the world...by FAR) to craft a secret Ai/ML platform that allows companies and Govts. to play Starcraft in real-life, with WALLHACKS on that tell them what their opponent is going to do, and what they need to do to stay competitive.  They released  at the perfect time by going public when it was ready to scale and unable to be dethroned.\n\n**This software will be mandatory for most large companies just to be competitive.**\n\n**My positions:** 25x 40C 366 DTE, 762 shares at $24.57.  This is my entire account, i've seen enough to be 100% sure I don't need to day or swing trade anymore.  That $11k avail is just margin, i'm out of cash, this is how it displays in the TDA-TOS app.  I'm all in on this.  I actually want more leaps but I only have $26 dollars left in cash so I will buy 1 more share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Based on my positions and an addiction to optionsprofitcalculator.com, I will make millions if the $500 thesis comes true in the next year.  in fact, at this thesis approx. 25 leaps worth $6k right now would make someone a millionaire.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, June 21, 2021**\n\n***Please Note:*** *Hello friends! If you were wondering where the Daily Market has been the last two weeks, I have had a great few months in the market and decided, now that I am fully vaccinated and the US is reopening, to go on vacation to New York (I live in California). I am now back home and ready to get back to the regular schedule! The Recap will be posted every day again from now on.*\n\nStocks jumped today, with the three major indexes rising, looking to recover the losses after the volatility experienced last week after the Federal Reserve\u2019s outlook was announced. If anything, last week\u2019s volatility shows us that the game of tug-of-war between inflationary pressures spooking investors and the Federal Reserve reiterating it will maintain accommodative policies in place for the foreseeable future continues. As I have said in the past, while I acknowledge the risk posed by the elevated inflation readings, I too believe any pressure is transitory and remain extremely bullish moving forward. \n\nThe Federal Reserve in the United States has a dual mandate: maintaining inflation stable and maximum employment. In light of the pandemic and surge in unemployment following lockdown, its maximum employment mandate has broadened. The measures and tools for achieving these mandates differ and have also changed recently. On the upside, the Fed now has additional flexibility in providing and maintaining accommodative monetary policies, namely near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing, to support the economy. The downside is that as the economy continues to improve, policies may stay loose for too long, leading to inflation and forcing the Fed to respond by aggressively raising interest rates, which would pretty much tank equities. In my view, this is the fundamental risk hanging over the market moving forward: Is the Fed misinterpreting inflationary readings as transitory? In my view, they are not. \n\nLast week, the spotlight was squarely on the Federal Reserve meeting, with market participants anxious to see how the Fed interprets and plans to react to the higher-than-expected inflationary readings. Analysts broadly expected the Fed to discuss a timeline for tapering its asset purchase program and a potential timeline for interest rate hikes. Instead, the Fed made no mention of a taper timeline and signaled they anticipate the first interest rate hike to occur in 2023. Overall, the report was very positive for equities, which is why the SPY so quickly recovered after an initial dump on Wednesday. \n\nIn my opinion,  it seems the Fed\u2019s decision to leave out a \u201ctaper timeline\u201d in the latest meeting reinforces the view consistently reiterated by the members of the Fed that current inflationary readings are \u201ctransitory\u201d (meaning not permanent) and largely reflects factors caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent economic shutdown, such as global supply chain disruptions, materials shortages, and labor market imbalances. Moreover, I suspect Jerome Powell wants to avoid another \u201cTaper Tantrum\u201d like the one in 2013 and intends to be as clear as possible about the Fed\u2019s expectations in order to avoid mixed messages (Read more about the 2013 Taper Tantrum [here,](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp) but basically markets freaked out after the Fed announced it was tapering quantitative easing passed during the 2008 recession since the economy had largely recovered by that point). In the end, the market kept going unabated, something I find very likely to happen again when the Fed inevitably announces they are tapering. In the end, I expect taper talks to begin towards the end of this year, but the lack of its mention in this Fed outlook meeting is an encouraging sign the Fed is not concerned about the elevated inflation readings. \n\nMoreover, the median projection among Fed officials is now for two rate hikes in 2023 despite the Fed raising inflation expectation for 2021, another sign the central bank remains unconcerned with the current levels of inflation. While the 2023 timeline is sooner than originally predicted, the two year timeline signals that the Fed will continue to move slowly and deliberately when considering any policy adjustment. \n\nLater this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting \"base effects\" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amblin Partners, a movie studio headed by famed director Steven Spielberg, announced a partnership with Netflix (NFLX) to produce future films.  \n* Apple became the fourth major digital company to face closer scrutiny from Germany's antitrust watchdog on Monday after the cartel office said it had launched an investigation into whether the tech giant is exploiting its market position.\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a note Monday that households were the largest source of equity demand in the first quarter of 2021 after generating net purchases of $172 billion. \u201cWe estimate that households currently allocate 44% of their assets to equities, slightly below the all-time high allocation of 46% in 2000. But high cash balances and continued retail participation in equity markets should bolster household equity demand.\" \n* EU antitrust regulators will decide by July 26 whether to clear a $30 billion bid by AerCap (AER) to buy the aircraft leasing business of General Electric (GE).\n* Bank of America (BAC) said oil may surge to $100 a barrel by next year as travel demand rebounds. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price\\*\\***\n* Ameriprise Financial (AMP) target raised by Citigroup from $265 to $290 at Buy.

        "selftext": "Alright degenerates, how many times have your FDs expired worthless and left you recording your wife getting blown out for the weekend by her favorite day trader bf. Cause personally it's been far too many times for me and that's why I have developed a plan to finally make enough tendies to retire off of.\n\nFuck squeezes I've had it with those DDs and honestly, I don't think buying a stock bc another idiot dumber than you told you about the new Tesla he bought with AMC tendies is a good investment thesis. Instead, I want to invest in something real, something that has a backbone in the actual world that isn't empty movie theaters, and that something is the TESLA your fellow ape just copped.\n\nBack in the day (1 yr ago) when there were only 1 million retards instead of 10, an individual known as u/WSBgod  showered us with his glorious TSLA gain porn.  Today I am going to tell you why and how you can get your own glorious TSLA gain porn and finally fuck your own wife for once.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDD: The only reason TSLA has the market cap it has today is the potential it has in the autonomous driving market. If TSLA was only priced for cars it sold it wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar company, worth more than every other automaker. This is because TSLA isn't just an automaker and realizing this will be your greatest asset. **High conviction in a stock strengthens the diamond hands holding it!** Anyway, Musk himself believes that when they solve FSD (Full Self Driving) and update all their cars overnight to be able to drive autonomously that TSLA will see the **largest overnight asset increase in history**. IDK about you but that sounds way better than a squeaker screaming \"squeeze\" about the latest stock they saw on somebody's shirt. Elon has reiterated in earnings calls that he is extremely confident they will solve FSD this year and my own knowledge of watching FSD driving videos they have now along with Elon saying the next new update has 100s of improvements and is supposedly coming out this month tells me that autonomy is much closer than most people realize.   \n\nTLDR: FSD --&gt; Stock to the Moon\n\nDD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving ever, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA announced and showed on their Battery Day all the manufacturing and engineering improvements they made to producing batteries which reduce the battery cost by almost 2/3rds (66%). They already have a pilot plant of these new battery cells along with new battery production plants being build at their new Gigafactories in Austin and Berlin. Hopefully, by now you can tell the world is transitioning to sustainable energies and EVs are becoming much more prevalent across society. All the EVs made by other car companies will require battery packs to make and operate. The only problem is these other car companies do not have the battery technology that TSLA has. Currently, TSLA is unable to produce cars like the SEMI due to a lack of batteries as they wish to prioritize vehicles with a smaller battery pack like the 3 and Y. Once they get all their battery plants online they will produce more cars than they ever have, along with SEMIS and CYBERTRUCKS. Other car manufacturers will run into the problem TSLA is in right now. They will not have the batteries to produce all the vehicles they want to make and if they try buying excess amounts of batteries that are 200% more expensive than the batteries TSLA is using they will not be able to keep up in margins/ pricing. ( This is why the high-end F-150 Lighting is more expensive than the high-end Cybertruck)\n\nTLDR: Batteries --&gt; Stock to the Moon\n\nDD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving and they blow up all their own battery facilities, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA has all the top engineers in the world working for them (this is an underrated aspect of the company in my opinion) and they employ these engineers to do whatever they need to be done. One important team working for TSLA right now is the AI team. TSLA is currently in the development of **DOJO,** a neural net trainer. I'm not gonna pretend to know everything about this because it is way beyond my realm of understanding but what I do know is that **AI runs on DATA.** The more data you have to train your NN, the smarter your AI is. Currently, TSLA has the largest data lead as their cars have **billions** of miles driven on the road whereas the runner-up of Google's Waymo has a laughable **millions**. When DOJO is available TSLA will be able to train its NN with all its data which will result in the best autonomous driving technology available. Beyond training FSD, Dojo can be used to train any NN that Tesla or other companies will have uses for. Dojo is one of the most valuable assets for AI that will exist and that should be valued extremely high in my opinion as I believe AI will be the next largest breakout in society.\n\nTLDR: AI &amp; DOJO --&gt; Stock to the Moon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe crazy thing about this DD is that I still haven't covered many of Tesla's massive opportunities such as its entire energy business or the future MODEL 2 that will eventually come out. Note that the MODEL 2 is a 25k Tesla which after factoring in the cost savings and any EV incentives that may come out will be the most affordable and best EV for its price and utility. (will hopefully be autonomous as well)  I think basically anyone with a brain will buy the MODEL 2 and it'll kinda be like Apple unveiling the iPhone. Basically, everyone uses an iPhone for their phone now and I think once an EV like the Model 2 comes out everyone will be whipping a Tesla for their car. \n\nMore points if somehow you still aren't convinced\n\n\\- Giga factories almost complete in Berlin ( one more month) and Austin (by end of year) this will result in crazy amounts of cars being made and more importantly CYBERTRUCKS\n\n\\- Gigapresses at these factories will manufacture cars faster than anything that has been done before. This translates into the CYBERTRUCK ramp being extremely fast.\n\n\\-Tesla sells every car they make and yet many terrible news sources say TSLA has demands problems. Elon himself has stated demand is the least of their worries.\n\n\\-SEMIS are being slept on, they will start coming out by the end of this year and probably take over the trucking industry the next year. Autonomous truck convoys are the future as they are so much more cost-effective.\n\n\\-Overall TSLA is trying to save the world and make it a better place by transitioning to sustainable energy and solving crazy intense real-world problems like FSD which will reduce the driving death count drastically. If you disagree with this please comment cause I would like to understand your perspective on how I am wrong.\n\n\\- WSB says they like meme stocks so much well what other CEO is constantly posting memes on Twitter?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you actually read all this and still think TSLA is overvalued please reply why after buying puts or if you really are a man sell some naked calls.\n\nPOSITIONS: TSLA 1/21/2023 1500, 1600, 1700 strikes\n\nnote that u gotta buy leaps, not weeklies cause ELON loves to lie about the timing of things. Although they might be late, they always come you just gotta diamond hands till then. The man literally made rockets land I think he can make cars drive.",

        "selftext": "I just saw a comment on a post that said that AMZN is currently undervalued. I\u2019ve had AMZN on my watchlist for a while and I\u2019ve been trying to find a decent entry point for some time.\n\nSo, I had a look at AMZN\u2019s valuation and I saw a P/S ratio of 4.03 and a P/E ratio of 63.7, both of which would _usually_ indicate that a stock is very overvalued.\n\nI\u2019m still of the opinion that AMZN might actually still be overvalued, and that we\u2019re still going to have to wait sometime until we see some growth there.\n\nThe situation with AAPL is quite bad too; P/S is 6.49 and P/E is 28.43. GOOGL, V, MA, MSFT and pretty much any kind of large cap tech stock has ridiculously high valuation figures.\n\nSo my question is, why do people continue to think that tech stocks are a great buy with these kinds of figures? To me personally, it appears that a lot of the anticipated growth is already heavily priced in, and that growth in the stock itself will take a long time (that is until the company\u2019s intrinsic value catches up with it\u2019s valuation).",

        "selftext": "As a sequel to \"10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM\", I'm back with 10 more ETFs that have less than $1b AUM but that I think are interesting and possibly useful and some comments on each.  Too often only the biggest ETFs, or most popular, get people's attention. I think it's worth looking further to see what's out there.\n\nStarting with a Peter Lynch inspired strategy (Lynch popularized the price/earnings-to-growth ratio),\n\n1. SPGP: Invesco S&amp;P 500 GARP ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP) . \"Growth at a Reasonable Price\" (GARP).  This ETF is an interesting combination factor screener.  It only selects from S&amp;P 500 stocks, and screens them first for 3-year earnings and sales growth, and second for financial leverage (debt), return on equity, and earnings yield (trailing-twelve-month or \"TTM\" net income / market cap).  Holdings are weighted by growth score, not market cap.  GARP's historical performance is surprisingly good; it beat the S&amp;P 500 since January 2020 and beats both the S&amp;P and traditional CRSP growth/value factors YTD.  It also outperforms the S&amp;P on some longer timeframes.  Index rebalanced semiannually (3rd Friday June/Dec), and it costs a moderate 0.34% ER.  It's designed to hold 75 stocks.  Check SPGP out when it rebalances later in the month!\n\nMoving on to Factor ETFs,\n\n2.  FVAL: Fidelity Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL) .  This ETF tracks and index that calculates scores for: free cash flow yield, EBITDA to enterprise value, book value to price, and forward earnings to price. The first two factors result in it having some tech giants such as FB, GOOGL, AMZN, and AAPL in the index. But not some others, such as TSLA, which scores very poorly on... well, every factor. Banks are just scored on book to price and forward earnings to price, as their business model is not comparable to most other stocks. FVAL provides an interesting way to get exposure to possibly-not-overpriced intellectual property-heavy companies, as well as traditional value stocks.  Currently holds about 130 stocks.\n\n3.  FIVA: Fidelity International Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA) .  The international (mostly developed markets) counterpart to FVAL, this ETF fills a great niche since forward-looking international value ETFs are few and far between.  Most value ETFs are heavy on book value, and rely on backward looking metrics or ignore free cash flow.  FIVA (and FVAL) take a different approach.  Currently holds about 120 stocks.  FIVA is perhaps the single most overlooked ETF in this entire list -- it provides a unique type of international exposure, and at only 0.39% ER. International factor funds often have slightly higher ERs than total market funds, but may provide much greater total return given desirable macro-economic conditions.  For example, since the first vaccine was proven effective (which kicked off the value rally), FIVA has outperformed VEA by about 6 percent.\n\n4.  JVAL: JPMorgan U.S. Value Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753) .  JVAL's index is also a value screen. It scores via four metrics: earnings yield, book to price, free cash flow yield, and TTM dividend yield. Pretty well-rounded in that it includes earnings, book, and yield measures. It does not include forward earnings metrics. Due to the cash flow and earnings metrics, it ends up including some big tech companies like FB, GOOGL, and MSFT. While it includes a dividend metric, the JVAL ETF has a lower 30-day SEC yield than VTV or dividend-focused ETFs such as SCHD, so I would not consider it as a dividend fund.  Holds about 350 stocks.  \n\n5. FQAL: Fidelity Quality Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal) .  Quality ETFs depart from value ETFs in that they're less concerned about price/earnings metrics.   Fidelity's offering in the space weights stocks on free cash flow margin, return on invested capital (one of Charlie Munger's favorite metrics), and free cash flow stability.  For banks, it looks at return on equity and debt to assets.  This ends up having a lot of overlap with the S&amp;P 500, but it ends up filtering out companies like TSLA and as per its goal, only has about 130 companies overall.  Like FVAL, this costs 0.29% ER.  Fairly common for US factor funds.\n\n6. JQUA: JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761) .  JPMorgan handles \"quality\" a bit differently.  They have 10, yes ten, different metrics that go into measuring quality.  They're grouped into categories for \"profitability\", \"solvency and financial risk\", and \"earnings quality\".  Loosely stated, they're looking for companies making reliable cold hard cash hand over fist that are not too indebted.  Like the Fidelity offering, it ends up looking a lot like the S&amp;P 500 but with slightly different weights.  GOOGL currently sits at the top of its holdings.\n\nLet us not forget commodities,\n\n7. COM: Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf](https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf) .  A fascinating ETF, it covers 12 different commodity futures in categories for metals, agriculture, and energy.  Different from most other commodity ETFs, it's almost like a commodity trend advisor (CTA) fund because it can take both long and \"flat\" (neutral/no) position in each commodity.  This helped COM wonderfully during the commodity crash in 2Q20 because they were able to go flat and preserve value, avoiding the oil crash.  If inflation comes back big time, commodities will benefit.  And if a commodity bubble bursts, this fund may be able to avoid some of the downside.  No K-1 form.  Might be my go-to outside of GUNR (equity ETF) for commodity exposure.\n\n8. CMDY: iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund) .  A somewhat newer offering from Blackrock, this broad commodity fund systematically positions itself to best handle carry cost in the futures curve (and thus adjusts for contango / backwardation curves).  It has generally outperformed other popular long-only commodity funds, and avoid being overweight on oil/energy futures.\n\nSeeking dividends?\n\n9. SCHY: Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF, [https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy) . A new offering from Schwab, it's the international counterpart to SCHD.  Its index filters for companies that have made 10 consecutive years of dividend payments, and ranks them by cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and 5-year dividend growth rate.  After a volatility screen, the results are weighted by a capped market capitalization approach.  A wonderful mirror to SCHD for those seeking reliable income, but who also want to diversify outside of US markets.  I predict its AUM will go up by 10x in less than 2 years.  Also quite inexpensive at 0.14% ER -- Schwab is likely subsidizing this, in order to help it grow.\n\nFinally, like it or not, blockchain is here to stay,\n\n10. BLOK: Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html) .  The AUM of this ETF is right around the $1b mark, but I'm including it anyway.  It seems to be the best-of-breed actively managed ETF for exposure to stocks benefiting from bitcoin mania and blockchain tech.  Clearly, it's volatile.  And it's not a pure bitcoin/ethereum play -- some small amounts of Samsung, IBM, and so on sneak in due to them having a connection to the space.  But it does hit all the big names, including recently listed Coinbase ($COIN).  If you can't be bothered to follow or deal with crypto in general but want something that will remain correlated to it, this is the ETF.  Pricey at 0.71% ER, but, it's actively managed and still has a lower ER than ARK's funds.\n\nDisclaimers: this is not financial advice. I currently have a position in FVAL, but no position in any of the other ETFs at time of posting.  That may change at any point in the future.  I am not predicting future performance for any of these funds.  Do your own due diligence (and please post in reply with what you find!).\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?",

Changing the number you see on the screen doesn\u2019t mean you lost any less money.  Actually means you\u2019ll lose more money cause it\u2019s gonna go down again\n\n3. This is the most important reason.  When you average down it dilutes your loss porn.  It makes it way harder for me and the rest of us here on this sub to cum \ud83d\udca6 and I want to see those big beautiful red negative numbers light up while they\u2019re edging me closer and closer\u2026 getting closer and closer to -100% \ud83d\udc40.  Sure I can just imagine them being lower and know that you probably lost even more money doing this but it\u2019s not the same.  I want to see the real loss from when you conceived of this disaster and I want to see it all the way it was meant to be seen.  Thank you",

They grew revenue by 35% last year. \n\nHowever, they lost $745 million last year. Ouch. Worst of all, nearly $400M of that is stock-based compensation to pad the pockets of management, as well as $265m in G&amp;A expenses for their new lofty salaries, a 300% increase in spending from 2019.\n\nSo $WISH is burning cash to grow its revenue. They\u2019re paying management massive salaries, giving them stock compensation while stockholders suffer losses.\n\nWouldn\u2019t you rather get the same exposure and performance from a company making money?\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at $BABA.\n\nTTM Revenue $110B\n\nTTM FCF $34.5B\n\nTTM FCF growth 20%\n\nTTM Revenue growth 40% vs. $WISH 35%\n\n5 year average Revenue growth 45%\n\n3 year average FCF growth 30%, $AAPL 20%, S&amp;P 25%\n\nPrice/TTM FCF 16.5x, $AAPL 23.7x, S&amp;P 25.5x, $WISH has no FCF.\n\nPrice/TTM FCF/3yr growth .5-.85, $AAPL 1.2, S&amp;P 1\n\nMarket cap $572B\n\nBook value $150B\n\nBear Case: Assuming company maintains current FCF and dies in 20 years, generates $680B cash for shareholders. $680B + $150B book value = undervalued by $250B\n\nBull case: Company maintains 20% FCF growth for 10 years, $213B in FCF by 2031, generates $3000B over 20 years for shareholders = undervalued by $2500B\n\n5-year DCF model using 5 yr averages with a 8% discount rate and 2% perpetual growth/10yr yield puts this stock at $350.\n\nOh, and all these valuations assume no Ant group IPO, which alibaba could own a $50B stake in.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, June 1, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) modestly declining while the Dow Jones (DIA) gained roughly 0.1%. After a volatile beginning to the May, it seems over the past several weeks fears of fast rising inflation causing the Federal Reserve to prematurely tighten monetary policy have tempered. As I have said for weeks, I thought the selloff in the first two weeks of May, that saw the SPY lose 4% in a few days, was overdone, and am very encouraged by the price action in the market recently.\n\nLast week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee once again reassured market participants that they see inflationary pressures as \u201ctransitory\u201d and do not think a shift in monetary policy in the near-term is warranted. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and that the Fed was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be \u201coverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.\u201d \n\nRichard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said \u201cthere will come a time in upcoming meetings\u201d when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that \u201cit is going to depend on the flow of data\u201d. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.\n\nThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn\u2019t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes. \n* Construction spending rose only 0.2% in April over March, a sharp deceleration compared to March over February. Spending rose only 0.2% compared to 1% in March.\n* \u201cMeme stocks\u201d continue their strong performance from last week, with AMC gapping up more than 20% again today. Crazy stuff!\n* Coinbase (COIN) announced customers would be able to fund their account using Apple and Google wallets \n* The price of Tesla vehicles is increasing due to supply chain pressures across the auto industry, particularly for raw materials, Elon Musk said on Monday via Twitter.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Dollar General (DG) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $226 to $231 at Buy. Stock currently around $203\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) target raised by Piper Sandler from $385 to $420 at Overweight. Stock currently around $372\n* Hess (HESS) target raised by Wells Fargo from $86 to $98 at Overweight. Stock currently around $84\n* UnitedHealth Group (UNH) target raised by Bank of America from $450 to $522 at Buy. Stock currently around $412\n* UPS target raised by Citigroup from $220 to $235 at Neutral. Stock currently around $215\n* The Gap (GPS) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $36 to $38 at Hold. Stock currently around $33.4\n\n\u201cSomeone's sitting in the shade today because someone planted a **tree** a long time ago.\u201d - Warren Buffet",

        "selftext": "**Arguments for Apple**\n\n1) Apple Silicon chips... wowzers. Good stuff. But x86 rules the world, so it's going to be a tough slope to climb.\n\n2) Privacy focus, taking a stand against the government. This is a good thing, both morally and for customer cred.\n\n3) Their trinkets still neat, even if they're starting to feel like they're taking on years... not much innovation or change in sight either\n\n**Arguments against Apple**\n\nI think Apple is just a poor choice right now and for the mid term as well. Here are my points.\n\n1) First of all, there are just better tech stocks right now, such as Nvidia. So why not bet more on up-and-coming winners instead of buying has-beens like Apple? Diversification, maybe, but at some point just buy the Nasdaq index instead if you want the average.\n\n2) Phones are not the big growing business they were years ago (everyone has one already, and no new features are enticing enough, so customers are opting to stick with what they have). This alone has some analysts predicting Apple stock will drop 20-30%. And Apple's move to wearables has been lukewarm at best (the Apple Watch remains a mostly useless bauble)\n\n3) The truth is that buying Apple right now is buying an Apple without Steve Jobs and with the Notch. Make of that what you will\n\n4) No Steve Jobs, again. Current CEO whats-his-name is ok, but ain't no Steve Jobs. His big idea was to make a credit card? Pfft.\n\n5) The notch. It's just so wrong in so many ways (this should be my first indictment against Apple), and tells me that Apple is currently caught in one of those crap design cycles because they are beholden to some crap heavyweight employee in their company (see: the Scott Forstall saga), and the situation will not get better until they get rid of him, but that'll take at least a couple years.\n\n6) The notch also tells me Apple is also beholden to their Chinese hardware partners, who of course must have pushed hard for this stupid thing purely because it gives them a lot of work to do. A plethora of hardware goes into that thing, and with that, a lot of money and clout to the China hardware division.\n\n7) Combine 4, 5, and 6 above to see it's a pansy company led by a pansy who can't say no to the powerful vested interests within his company",

Facebook cried about it, saying it will hurt everyone (they have a point on this tbh but that's another story) but they still had unlimited tracking in place for their Android folks. Now this: \n\n[https://medium.com/big-tech/google-joins-apple-to-cancel-facebooks-trillion-dollar-empire-bet-1dbcf14a49e4](https://medium.com/big-tech/google-joins-apple-to-cancel-facebooks-trillion-dollar-empire-bet-1dbcf14a49e4)\n\nAndroid may do something similar. As you may know, it takes years til an Android version reaches the majority of devices (Android 8 came out 4 years ago yet more than like a third of the world's devices still run on 8 or older instead of 9, 10 or 11) but it's something worth looking at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow why is this so important? Look at what Facebook makes money with:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r5q3bolaut571.png?width=1264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5ea5dace7736680442161c2e6ca28d205f5cd8a\n\nI expected the majority of revenue coming from ads but I didn't expect it to be THAT much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Where else can Facebook advertise?** They still have the website in their favor. Many people browse with adblockers installed but especially boomers will never get to set these up, so these boomers will stay a gold mine for Facebook. \n\n**What will the impact be?** I have no idea, I'm too lazy to compare market cap etc. and unpersonalized advertising is still advertising - the dip in revenue may turn out to be less than 5%, but it could also be 50%. Considering how hard Facebook was pushing against Apple's decisions I suppose it's more than 5% since their own \"let us keep personalizing\" was very bad PR so it would only be worth taking that PR risk if it had potential to secure a lot of revenue. There may also be less obvious factors involved such as user tracking being important for more than just ads.  \n\n\n**What else could Facebook make money with?** The only thing that comes to my mind is what everyone's doing - making it a subscription-based service. But I really really do not think more than 5% of their users would actually sign-up, regardless of accidentally of intentional. Why? [Facebook's revenue per user is at about $35 per year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/234056/facebooks-average-advertising-revenue-per-user/). Let's say they lose $15 per user with the \"unpersonalization\" - that would force them to make users sign up for a $2/month subscription IF everyone signed up.  \n\n\nThere\u00a0are many things I'm too lazy factor in here, for example the spread between the first world and third-world countries ($2 here is something different than $2 in Nigeria) but generally what I'm saying is that I personally will not invest in Facebook at this point.\n\nI kinda only wanted to post the news but ended up typing a bit more, don't even think of me thinking this would qualify as DD, just my opinion if you are on the edge of investing or holding or selling.",

When you think about it, the economy of modern civilization is dependent on TSMC and chips only they have the tech and knowhow to make.

        "selftext": "Pure weekend speculation here based on a comment I saw on stockdimwits that thinks Apple would introduce Microvast components into consumer electronics. I however think a passenger vehicle partnership may be more plausible. While I am personally skeptical on Apple EVER manufacturing an EV vehicle, the articles on it are never ending...\n\n[One of the latest Articles is that Apple is in talks with CATL and BYD for battery production](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-apple-talks-with-catl-byd-over-battery-supplies-its-electric-car-2021-06-08/)\n\nSome key takeaways\n\n* The factory has to be in America,  confirmed by a senior official in Joe Biden's administration\n* It was not immediately clear if Apple is also talking to other battery maker\n* People familiar with the matter have previously said Apple's planned EV could include its own breakthrough battery technology.\n* Apple is in favor of using lithium iron phosphate batteries\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 1st point, is highly unlikely to ever occur for CATL and BYD as they are CCP state owned enterprises.\n\n\"CATL, which supplies major car makers including Tesla Inc , is reluctant to build a U.S. factory due to political tensions between Washington and Beijing as well as cost concerns\".\n\nOn top of this the US is still engaged with a trade war with china which includes Chinese EV battery producers and rare earth metal producers.\n\nThe 2nd point, makes it clear that this is all a rumor. It is likely that Apple is still looking for suppliers. Anyone is free game. Batteries dont start and end with CATL, Panasonic, SK etc. It was after all Apple that turned a declining bankrupt battery supplier Varta into a multi-billion dollar business.\n\nThe 3rd point is referring to Apple's [\"Monocell technology\"](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1341484482302533635) , which I agree with Musk. It doesn't make much sense. It seems this is related to having [larger cells](https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2020/12/a-credible-report-is-claiming-that-sources-have-seen-apples-next-gen-vehicle-battery-technology-that-is-described-as-radica.html)  and reducing the number of cells which has consequences described below.\n\nThe 4th point is a most likely a direct result of the above. In the simplest terms, bigger cells = less cooling = more heat = fires. Going for what's considered a technology for emerging markets (worse than NMC/NCA) is due to LFP  being more stable, operating at lower temperatures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrovast seem to be the best company that fits Apple's modus operandi which includes performance, safety, manufacturing control, and flexibility/ design control.\n\n1st and foremost they have a US factory that can process raw material, making it one of the few in the US capable of doing so, and mets the hardest condition set by Apple.\n\n2nd, They are using a kevlar based non-flammable separator that can withstand 300C, well above any other separator in the market. For point of reference thermal runaway from separator failure typically occurs around 100-150C. This solves Apple's potential issue.\n\nWhich leads to the 3rd point that it is unlikely Apple uses LFP. It just does not fit the Apple MO. Microvast's new NMC is much more stable at high temperatures reaching 50C after a 10minute fast charge without loss of cycles, and is capable of reaching 1 Million miles\n\nLastly the selling point of Microvast is customer customization. Apple fell out with Nissan when it came to the Apple Car due to lack of control. Apple would rather give suppliers its specifications, than try to design around others specifications.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut none of this is evidence, and we'll likely never get any until it's officially announced by Apple themselves. But I will point out that in one interview (and in SEC filings) they mentioned having at least 2 global customers that they are under NDAs with. In addition users have in the past leaked documents from Microvast which includes meetings. A small list of potential companies exist between what's been announced and what was in the meeting documents. I did not find the Apple Car codename \"Titan\" but I did see coded meetings, which included one for a \"High-Level Global Enterprise\". Some other soft evidence includes Apple citing microvast patents and co-authored battery related publications. In addition in a conference call Microvast revealed that the tennessee factory is being setup to recycle all their batteries. Which fits Apple's initiative to recycle and recover battery materials from their consumer products.  Lastly the US government, who knows about Microvast (and is technically invested in it) is clearly helping Apple through the process of finding a supplier.",

        "selftext": "First off, shoutout to /u/ChickenFission for putting together this DD. Now go do your homework and let\u2019s make some fucking money you filthy apes. \n\n# Overview: \"What even is an Ontrak?\"\n\nAnyone who's ever been bored, horny, caught sight of the vacuum cleaner, and thought \"what the hell\" knows that hospital visits are expensive. It's doubly true for people with chronic health conditions like diabetes, hypertension, COPD, and coronary artery disease. That's because these peeps often use the emergency room like a primary care facility. My fat-ass uncle who drinks two cases of soda a week and thinks apple fritters are a fruit waits until he can't feel his feet before he sees a doctor. At that point, his insurance company has to pay out the ass for treatment when a little bit of preventive care could've saved everybody a lot of time, money, and hassle.\n\n**That's where Ontrak comes in...**\n\nThey're a healthcare company that uses analytics and AI (ooo, ahhh) to predict which members of an insurance company's health plan could improve a chronic condition through the modification of undiagnosed behavioral issues that likely caused the problem in the first place. They assign a \"Care Coach\" and any needed medical professionals to create a step-by-step program for the member to help them change the behavior. Then they walk them through the plan over a 12-month period either in-person or through telehealth initiatives. The end result? My uncle drinks less soda, eats an actual fucking apple once in a while, and doesn't have to lose his feet to complications from diabetes. Oh, and his insurance company saves a fuckton of money.\n\n**\"Does this hippy shit actually work?\" Why yes. Yes it does.**\n\nOntrak commissioned the \"Treatment Effect of the Ontrak Program\" study (Google it) which followed 1,800 people over three years and measured stuff like hospitalizations and emergency room usage. Half went through the Ontrak program. The other half were eligible but didn't go through it. The study found that Ontrak program graduates had:\n\n* An increased use of preventive care services with a 50% increase in costs for behavioral and primary care services, or about $110/month per member\n* A statistically significant 65% reduction in inpatient utilization resulting in a savings of $488/month per member\n* A summary cost savings of a little under $12,000, or 20%, per member over 24 months\n* Effects and cost savings that were measurable even two years post enrollment\n\nSo Ontrak has a proven service that saves money and lives that's built around buzzwords like AI and telehealth. This thing can't possibly go tits up. Right? Right?!!!\n\n## Financials: \"What the fuck happened on March 1st?\"\n\nPour one out for the poor bastards who took their wives' boyfriends out for a guy's weekend at the end of February and came back to see 50% of their Ontrak holdings go up in flames. That's when Ontrak announced the loss of their biggest customer, Aetna insurance. (Keep in mind that Aetna completed a merger with CVS last year, an important factoid that'll come into play later.) The contract termination will be effective on June 26th.\n\nApparently, Aetna had evaluated Ontrak's services \"on a provider basis, not as a vendor as do all of our other health plan partners\", i.e. they measured success based on cost savings per office visit/treatment rather than clinical outcomes and the long-term cost savings that Ontrak could deliver. Basically, Aetna treated Ontrak like a fucking healthcare groupon and kicked them to the curb when they didn't save enough money.\n\nBefore that shitshow, Ontrak was lit. Highlights from their Q1 2021 financials include:\n\n* Revenue of $28.7 million, up 133% YOY\n* Operating loss of $2.9 million, down 52% YOY\n* Record quarterly cashflow from operations of $6.4 million compared to a $3.1 million loss in Q1 last year\n\nThe problem now is that the loss of the Aetna contract will reduce the total number of enrolled members from a little under 15,000 to a little over 8,000 by the end of June. Ouch.\n\n**But don't worry. They've got a plan and it's already in motion.**\n\nKeep in mind that all the previous growth had been based on their current business model, which hasn't changed. But here's what has:\n\n* **Hired a new CEO, Jonathan Mayhew** \\- Former Chief Transformation Officer of CVS Health and, before that, President of U.S. Markets for Aetna Health. Yup, that CVS and Aetna. Coincidence? Not likely. Think they'll get that contract back? Who knows, but the stock price popped 7% after the hire.\n* **Fired 35% of their full-time staff** \\- During the last earnings call the CEO said, \"the remaining engagement specialists are exceptional and perform at a higher level than our historic average\", i.e. only the brass-balled closers are left.\n* **Entered national contract with LifeStance Health** \\- They're one of the largest providers of outpatient mental health care in the country, which bumps the Ontrak network to over 15,000 clinicians.\n* **Renewed existing contracts and are working to expand Medicare and Medicaid offerings** \\- A government-focused outreach pool means more people will be able to enroll more easily since there's no insurance company bullshit like people changing plans and losing access.\n* **Looking into tiered offerings to expand their total addressable market**\n* **Launched a nationwide marketing campaign to increase brand awareness**\n\n## Squeeze Potential: \"This again?\"\n\nI know, I know. SqUeEze TeY sHOrtS. But there's something to this one. Props to u/Op-Toe-Mus-Rim-Dong for putting the numbers together. Here's a copy-paste of the highlights from his DD:\n\n&gt;658,855 Public Float Avail (probably less), with 271k left to be sold by Terren Peizer (TP) until 8/15-8/30 which is added back to the Public Float making it 929,918 afterwards. However, TP has warrants to buy back the shares sold (658,299) on 8/15-8/30. Meaning, as a back up measure if more than 271,619 shares are bought and he exercises the warrants - shorts will need to cover whatever he cannot buy from the public float. If it is a large enough amount, it could trigger a margin call and thus the entire position may need to be bought at the same time.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Either way, the gap up is $39-55 (incredibly easy to move). The avg short seller price is likely $45, and they have at least 2.5M shares short (estimated, if not more) which cannot be bought as you can see.\n\nTake a look at the chart for Ontrak and you can see that volume is pitiful. We're talking sometimes less than 1k shares traded on a 1-minute candle. But check out the close on Friday (6/18). If this thing catches even a little bit of volume, buckle the fuck up.\n\n**A note about the insider selling:** Terren Peizer is the former CEO, now Chairman of the Board, that Op-Toe-Mus-Rim-Dong is talking about in his DD. If you do some sleuthing, you'll find that he's been selling blocks of 33k shares every week or so since the beginning of May. Now, you might see that and think, \"This chump's dumping shares like he's at the titty bar with a suitcase full of dollar bills! What the fuck?!\" The selloff is actually part of a 10b5-1 plan filed with the SEC on May 11th. And a 10b5-1 is a way for insiders to sell a specific amount of shares (in this case 596,357) without being accused of insider trading since the terms of sale are established ahead of time. There's nothing nefarious about it and Op-Toe-Mus-Rim-Dong has taken those sales into account for this short squeeze thesis.\n\n## TLDR: \"Get to the fucking point!\"\n\n* Ontrak offers a proven healthcare service that saves insurance companies money and saves people's lives.\n* They lost their biggest customer because reasons, but the business model that created all the growth in the first place is still there. And there's a better than average chance they get that customer back.\n* Long story short: the stock is on sale.\n* Also, an honest-to-goodness short squeeze may be on the menu.\n\n## Price Targets: \"How do I get to tendie town?\"\n\nThe option chain sucks balls on this one. Strikes are in $5 increments and the bid/ask spreads are looser than a prolapsed anus. Anything more than a few contracts and you could get trapped trying to exit a position.\n\nThe play is shares to drive the volume needed to get the price moving.\n\nIf for some reason you believe in analyst projections, they range from $32 on the low side to $58 on the high. Even without a squeeze, there's a solid value play here.\n\n* **Short term:** $58 - 60 with the gap fill\n* **Long term:** $80 - 100 based on their trajectory before the crash in March\n* **With a squeeze:** Buy shares and ride this bitch to Valhalla.\n\n## Positions or Ban\n\n500 shares @ $33.14\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer:** I'm not a financial advisor and this is clearly not financial advice. Only an idiot would take what they read on the internet at face value and place a bet without doing their own research. Don't be an idiot.",

        "selftext": " Hello  everyone! So I was analyzing the trending stocks on reddit on the past  week and I figured out I might just do a post for you guys regarding my  analysis. Keep in mind that this specific tool does not track some  stocks, for instance $WISH, because of the way it is build.\n\nSo, this week's most mentioned stocks:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wv3vm6cb4u771.png?width=1442&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c89129f1e3f41f27943e3e6a9ce627c67dacc06\n\nI  noticed some growth compared to the previous week in TSLA, SPCE and  JPM. With regard to TSLA, we can see that the sentiment is positive, but  going south for the past days:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pe2n8hhc4u771.png?width=1738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a8b7220cb84d58e70ddda15514c3fd8a9c81e7d\n\nRegarding SPCE, the growth was quite recent (as we all know), and the sentiment was also quite positive.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tw9czad4u771.png?width=1740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ca5bbc66d66187d26e0fbe8a978167cd8846473\n\nJPM also had quite the explosion this week in post mentioning it, with the sentiment being quite positive as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7d76sy9e4u771.png?width=1743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f36f379eeed4e71df9e761d90a16c6823b87ac7\n\nNOTE:  None of this is financial advice, please do your own due diligence and  understand that the stock market is influenced by multiple factors.",

        "selftext": "This is not financial advice, I am retarded. I tried to time the bottom on the tech correction with calls and got bogged. I own shares of KNBE.\n\nKNBE - Everyone is sleeping on this stock and this sector.\n\nSector DD:\n\nAs in industry insider (systems engineer) I am finding that cybersecurity insurance companies are cracking down on practices and minimum prevention standards. I've seen multiple customers of ours edged into security testing + training by the insurance company telling them its mandatory. The insurers seem to get more strict with every major breach - and we just had a nuclear weapons company breached this week.\n\nMy investing theory for 2021 is that insurance companies are going to compel massive amounts of cybersecurity spending and produce huge earnings reports.\n\nIf you're on LinkedIn, you might have noticed job alerts for cybersecurity jobs have gone up triple or quadruple since January as companies scramble to not be the next one on cable news for getting bogged by eastern european glow in the dark boys.\n\nKNBE DD:\n\n\\- Barely recognized, almost zero results searching WSB or Reddit as a whole.\n\n\\- Good market cap but almost no volume.\n\n\\- Recent IPO - only two quarters. Price discovery still taking place.\n\n\\- Doesn't even have options yet.\n\n\\- Widely considered the industry leader for email phishing test campaigns.\n\n\\- HQ'd in Florida. Most employees are Florida Man / Florida Woman.\n\n\\- 45% rev growth YoY\n\n\\- Turned profitable this year - positive EPS\n\n\\- Financials: [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KNBE/financials](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KNBE/financials)\n\nThe product: The main product is email phish testing. Fake scam emails sent out by IT meant to get Karen in HR to click on free Apple giftcards / etc. Some more advanced and believable templates as well and the ability to customize them to internal company branding / terminology.\n\nThey also have awareness training to remediate staff and departments that are falling for the scam emails, or to proactively introduce employees to email security concepts.\n\nI did a short trial run with them for a few clients a year ago and was impressed with the platform. I also tried Microsoft's 365 equivalent.\n\nRisks:\n\n\\- Not a monopoly. Already other companies in the same security awareness / testing space.\n\n\\- Competitors includes Microsoft - premium Exchange 365 licensing grants a similar but much less developed product amongst other security tools - but minus the remediation training.\n\n\\- The greatest risk from MSFT is that companies may \"already be paying for\" their phish testing tool as part of existing security licenses - similar to business onedrive / sharepoint vs dropbox.\n\n\\- First DD I ever posted so it's probably shit.\n\n\\- Stock already up 60% this week, might correct.  \n\n\ntl;dr: Insurance companies are making small/midsize businesses spend money on cybersecurity and getting more strict about payouts. KnowBe4 has a good product and a first mover advantage. They're profitable already. Almost zero social media sentiment or press around KNBE and no options - this feels to me like an early bird special.\n\nPositions: http://imgur.com/a/buVpf7x",

        "selftext": "Every CrapCo tries to pitch themselves as tech these days, but I would like to explain why RKT is the real deal.  \n\n***TLDR: RKT is having its \"Amazon is just a book company\" moment.  Investors are over-discounting the MASSIVE upside from tech-ecosystem opportunities for this already highly profitable and fast-growing company.***    \n\nFirst things, here is my position (\\~$350k market value): 17,500 shares @ $18.54, 50x Sep 2021 $19.89c, 20x Jan 2022 $20.89c.  Now that you know I'm serious, let me start with some context.\n\nWhat do the best tech investors look for?\n\nI'll quote someone smarter than me: \"*Top tier firms like Vista Equity, Thoma, and Silver Lake focus on buying businesses with the following characteristics - mission critical products with high switching costs, growing end market, high ROI economics, market leadership, and sticky and recurring revenue base... Every software company can be run at 30-35% EBITDA margin*\"  ([Twitter: sendoh34](https://twitter.com/sendoh34/status/1350163448663982081?s=20))\n\nI work at Best Buy so I know he is right.  Whether the focus is early stage VC, tech PE or public equity, ***tech investors want nothing more than*** ***high-growth, scalable, recurring revenue*** and they look for companies with competitive advantages and moats within their industries to deliver and protect this tasty RR*.*\n\n**What does this have to do with Rocket Companies?**\n\nIn case you care at all about what they do, Rocket Companies (NYSE: RKT) is a holding company of consumer-oriented financial services, real estate and mortgage businesses.  Most think first of Rocket Mortgage (formerly Quicken Loans) which is the #1 lender in the U.S. with \\~10% share of the $3.5TN mortgage market.  Rocket Mortgage is known for their best-in-class brand, customer service and innovative, tech-driven approach to the industry.  About +/- 90% of RKT's $16BN of revenue in 2020 came from its core mortgage business.\n\n***Rocket is currently treated by investors and analysts as a TECH-ENABLED mortgage company but*** ***not*** ***a FINTECH company.***  Read any analyst research report and it is obvious.  Why is this important?  Because while tech-enabled businesses can deliver significantly better operating results, market share gains and staying power than competitors, their core business is unchanged and so the valuation metrics by analysts and the institutions are unchanged.  This is evident by RKT's current valuation: **at yesterday's close of $19.22, RKT was trading at 4.7x 2020 EPS and \\~9.0x consensus 2021 EPS.**  *Comparatively, fintech companies trade at 25-30x PE multiples or even much, much higher.*  Are they right? \n\n**Why Rocket Should Be Considered a Fintech Company**\n\nI'll give 5 reasons why you should start thinking about Rocket as a Fintech Company.\n\n**1. ROCKET ALREADY HAS AN EXTENSIVE TECHNOLOGY BASE BUILT OVER DECADES**\n\nMany don't realize that while Rocket Mortgage is their largest business, Rocket Companies also includes dozens of other businesses formed over decades of investment.  Here are just a few of them: \n\n* [Amrock Title](https://www.amrock.com/) \\- tech-enabled title insurance, valuations and settlement services. Industry pioneer in digital closings and eNotes which more than doubled last year.   \n* [Nexsys Technologies](https://www.nexsystech.com/) \\-  creates digital platforms for real estate appraisal (Nexsys Clear Path), insurance (Nexsys Clear HOI) and mortgage closings.\n* [Rock Connections](https://rockconnections.com/) \\- contact services provider leveraging technology and data to connect consumers and brands more effectively.\n* [Lendesk](https://www.lendesk.com/) \\- Canadian technology company which operates Finmo, Lender Spotlight, Gateway and Enterprise solutions, with more than 10,000 mortgage brokers using its products \n* Others include [Edison Financial](https://edisonfinancial.ca/) (Canadian digital mortgage startup), [Core Digital Media](http://www.coredigitalmedia.com/) (online consumer acquisition platform), [ForSaleByOwner](https://www.forsalebyowner.com/) and more\n\nThese companies and others in the [Rocket Ecosystem](https://www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/) create technology that Rocket can leverage in its core mortgage business which why ***Rocket consistently destroys its competitors on nearly every metric and has been able to scale a higher-margin Direct-to-Consumer business while others have not***.  These companies are also big contributors themselves already as you can see from the 1Q ER:  \n\n* *Amrock, our title insurance services, property valuation, and settlement services company, generated 348,800 closings, up 110% from Q1 '20, representing the highest level of closings in Amrock's history. This record volume was the primary driver for the* *increase in other income in Q1 '21 to $466.1 million from $243.8 million in Q1 '20.* \\[THAT IS A 91% YOY INCREASE!\\]\n\n**2.  ROCKET IS INVESTING A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL AND FOCUS INTO THEIR TECH**  \n\nOver the LTM ended 1Q21, ***Rocket generated $12BN of EBITDA on $19BN of Revenue (\\~65% EBITDA margin!) which they are investing right back into their business.***  Over 2/3 of their 276 current job openings are tech-related: big data scientist, software engineer, developer, designer, product manager, etc.  A little strange for a boring old mortgage company, eh?  Rocket has a technology team numbered in the thousands.\n\nRocket's management team has stated that their capital priorities are 1) reinvesting into the business, 2) strategic M&amp;A, and 3) only then, return of capital to investors.  Given how much money they are making, they could do all like they did earlier this year with the special dividend.\n\nRocket is clearly focused on tech going forward.  In the past two weeks alone, they have announced several public-private partnerships including backing MSU Apple Developer Academy in Detroit and a partnership between *Rocket Innovation Labs* (yet another ecosystem company) and University of Windsor in Canada.  They have participated in virtually every Investment Bank-sponsored Technology Conference this year.  There are countless others I could mention but you get the point.\n\n**3.  ROCKET AUTO AND ROCKET HOMES: THE LARGEST OPPORTUNITIES YET TO LAUNCH**\n\nRocket is quietly building massive businesses that could become multibillion standalone businesses.  \n\n**Rocket Auto** currently provides third party technology services, but they are preparing to launch their own managed e-commerce marketplace.  Read from the 1Q21 release:\n\n* *Rocket Auto, our automotive retail marketplace, facilitated the sale of* ***13,600 auto units, up more than 5,300 units, or 65%, as compared to first quarter of 2020****. Gross Merchandise Value for Q1 '21 was $360 million, which represents an annualized run rate of more than $1 billion.*\n\n***ROCKET AUTO IS DOING $1BN OF AUTO SALES ALREADY AND HAVEN'T EVEN LAUNCHED OR MARKETED TO THEIR EXISTING MORTGAGE CUSTOMERS.***   On this topic, Jay Farner said, \"We wanted to construct a business that had all of the appropriate profitability metrics before really leaning in to our client base.\"  Rocket Auto also has an existing strategic partnership with Vroom whereby they can earn up to 8.6mm shares in Vroom over 4 years worth about $365MM at today's price.\n\n**Rocket Homes** is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network which did over **$6BN of transaction volume** in 2020.  It has all of the capabilities of a Zillow or Redfin with Rocket's massive footprint and data trove backing it and it hasn't fully launched.  This is another MASSIVE, sleeper opportunity.  Redfin and Zillow are currently valued at 6-8x *revenue.*\n\n**4.  SOME OF THE SMARTEST TECH INVESTORS HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT IN**\n\nThe five largest public holders are Caledonia, Vanguard, Invesco, Blackrock and TCMI.  ***Wait who is TCMI?***  TCMI is an affiliate of [Technology Crossover Ventures](https://www.tcv.com/), one of Silicon Valley's top-tier VC firms.  Yes, one of the leading tech investors in the world held 4,450,000 shares of Rocket as of 3/31/21.\n\n**5.  THE FLYWHEEL EFFECT IS ALREADY PROVING OUT**\n\nIf you follow Rocket, you'll hear management talk a lot about [Life-time Value (LTV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value).  This is a term which expresses the net profit earned over a customer over their entire relationship with the company.  **This is what it is all about.**  *Rocket has a customer retention ratio of 91% LTM as of 1Q21 which is roughly 4x the industry average.*  It is not hard to see why this is important.  **Think about those qualities that tech investors look for... \"***growing end market, high ROI economics, market leadership, and sticky and recurring revenue base.****\"  Add to that an unrivaled brand, highly profitable existing business to fuel reinvestment, extensive customer base, and 2k+ tech force.***  *\"We should be able to look out at every American and target market or have a specific message and value about how we can help them improve on their home, saving money in some way, shape or form, buy a car or help them with a real estate transaction,\u201d Farner said.* ***\u201cWhen you put those things together, that\u2019s 30 percent of the U.S. GDP that we\u2019re talking about here. All surrounded in a multibillion-dollar brand.\u201d***    \n\n**CONCLUSION**:  Rocket Companies is incredibly cheap for both the existing business at \\~9.0x on 2021 consensus EPS and the upside opportunity.  Given the growth opportunities, it should easily command a 2-3x higher multiple as supported by fintech trading comps.  And to top it all off, RKT has tremendous short-term moonshot potential.  Third time is a charm...\n\nDisclaimer: this is not financial advice, just my personal views for discussion.",

        "selftext": "In my [previous analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/njxvcd/a_dd_on_inflation_how_it_affects_stock_prices_and/) one month back, I had given a primer on inflation and how it will affect stock prices. Given that the consumer prices have jumped 5% in May making it the fastest increase since summer of 2008 and the Federal Reserve\u2019s June meeting is expected to conclude on Wednesday (they might tweak their forecasts for interest rates), I figured it was time to dive deep into\n\n**What are the best strategies we can use to hedge against inflation?**\n\n**Data:**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/9v1yt7xcrm571.png?width=1057&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44706a74f62cee1bd1f263e8aa2d69d4b13629fe)\n\nEven though slightly higher inflation was expected due to the stimulus checks and the reopening of the economy, the current trends are worrying. As we can see from the chart, even though inflation trends till March were manageable, now it seems to be picking up pace. May\u201921 CPI is almost 2.8X May\u201919 CPI. (2020 CPI was down mainly because of the strict lockdowns following the pandemic)\n\nKeeping an inflation-hedged asset class in your portfolio during this transitionary period can work out well in case we go into a steeply rising inflation. This brings us to what are the \u00a0\n\n**Best asset classes that can be used as a hedge against inflation**\n\n**Stocks**\n\nStocks are a good long-term investment to hedge against inflation. Even though you might have a short-term impact due to the uncertainties surrounding inflation, great companies would be able to pass on the increasing price to the customers. You must look into companies with pricing power (think Apple) to raise prices on their customers without significantly affecting their overall sales. One important type of stock to avoid is high-growth stocks as the valuation of the company is heavily based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company thereby detracting a lot of value investors.\n\n**Commodities**\n\nCommodities are raw materials used for creating the products consumers buy. It provides both inflation protection and diversification to your portfolio. Because commodities are \u201creal assets\u201d, they tend to benefit from rising inflation. As demand for goods and services increases, the price of those goods and services usually rises as well, as do the prices of the commodities used to produce those goods and services. As you can see from the below chart, commodities have a weak correlation to both Equity and Bond markets.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/icm0brnerm571.png?width=363&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=754c5ee41a429861f4cfe25acef728f31c8a2618)\n\n**Real Estate and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**\n\nReal estate income rises with inflation. As inflation rises, so do property value and the amount you can charge for rent. Given the normal forms of real estate requires high initial investments, an alternative could be REITs. A REIT consist of a pool of real estate (commercial, residential and industrial properties) that pays out dividends to its investors.\n\nAccording to [this study](https://realestate.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/716.pdf) conducted by the Wharton School of Business\n\n&gt;Consumer price inflation (CPI) in the U.S. was 13.5% during 1979, the worst year since 1947. Dividend income from REITs traded through the stock exchange averaged 21.2% that year, and total returns amounted to 24.4%, more than preserving for REIT investors the purchasing power that they had lost to inflation.\n\n**Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)**  \n\nNever in my wildest dreams, I would have imagined writing about treasury bonds in wallstreetbets. Yet here we are! \n\nTIPS are a type of treasury security issued by the US govt which is indexed to inflation. As inflation rises, TIPS adjusts in price to maintain it\u2019s real value. To make it simpler, if you invest $100 in TIPS and the coupon rate is 1%, if there is no inflation you will receive $1 for coupon payments that year. If inflation rises by 5%, they will adjust the coupon so that you get $1.05 instead of the $1.\n\n**International Diversification**\n\nThere are several well-developed economies outside the US that do not rise and fall in relation to the US market (Italy, Australia, etc.). Adding stocks/bonds from these or similar countries can help hedge the portfolio against sudden local swings.\n\n**Gold**\n\nGold is often touted as one of the best methods to hedge against inflation. I have kept it last as the performance of gold during previous inflationary periods has been spotty.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/gdwkgb9grm571.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0785e15a993d10e35490f424afa862fa9a45e44)\n\nGold investors lose 10% on average from 1980-84 when the annual inflation rate was 6.5% and lost 7.6% from 1988-91 when inflation was 4.6%. But the performance of gold was spectacular during the period of 1973-79(when the inflation was 8.8%). The mixed record raises some concerns about using Gold as a hedge against inflation. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhether we like it or not, inflation is here. The only question right now is whether it\u2019s going to transitionary as the Fed\u2019s explained or whether the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force Fed to increase their interest rates. The Federal Reserve meeting that concludes today will finally give us some insight into how they are going to tackle the current spike in inflation. Whatever their decision may be, it\u2019s a good idea to prepare some hedging strategies for your portfolio! \u00a0\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*",

        "selftext": "# DEAR APES,\n\nA few weeks ago I began posting on AMD. At the time, the stock was trading in the mid-70's.\n\nToday, as expected, we crossed $90 price... but our trip is just getting **STARTED**!\n\nThe deal with TESLA was announced, as well as the next AMAZING technologies in Computex, including the stacked cache for Zen3, Fidelity FX Super Resolution, the 6900 XTX Liquid Cooled, etc.\n\nThere's a very simple reason why AMD will go past the MOON and MARS: **ENTERTAINMENT**\n\nThe world revolves around entertainment and in this new era, this activity is mandatory to deal with Covid-19, the lack of international travel, work from home, etc.\n\nTESLA adopting AMD for its new Model X and S is HUGE. It will take a Navi23 and an APU (two chips) per car, likely becoming an optional for all other vehicles in the future. More automobile brands will follow, as TESLA is leading the way in the industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TESLA selected AMD chips for its upcoming vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/aekg7gm3u8871.jpg?width=2243&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c178f47df42b4159f92d1248ac9618a3f8440643)\n\nWith autonomous driving, gaming in a long trip will be mandatory. But even without it, the rest of the passengers can game, either with their fellow companions or online, from their car.\n\nSo, yes, the current automotive revolution will have AMD as a main supplier.\n\nThen you have consumer processing, which includes CPU's and GPU's, where AMD is dominating (mostly on the former). The Zen3 architecture is a MONSTER. Intel just cannot compete. And with the stacked cache providing up to 15% more gaming performance, that lead will continue on AMD's side.\n\nOn GPU's, AMD's Navi31 is expected to be MCM (multi-chip module), aiming to repeat AMD's success with Intel, but now against NVIDIA. \"Chiplets\" allow for economies of scale to thrive. More silicon, will less defects, better binning, cheaper... it is an AMAZING IDEA. Just add cache and the latency problem can be mitigated.\n\nOn the console gaming, AMD is the undisputed KING. They're in the PS4, PS4 Pro, PS5, Xbox model and series X/S. Also in the Aya Neo and expected in Valve's next handheld, which will be a MONSTER.\n\nOn Datacenter, AMD is groundbreaking. Epyc and the new offerings from **GOOGLE** for virtual machines is an INCREDIBLE deal. **AMAZON, TENCENT, ALIBABA, AZURE** (Microsoft), they are all buying chips from AMD. More CORES means MORE power processing, lower energy, lower licensing costs and certainly better SECURITY (as INTEL has been plagued by Spectre &amp; Meltdown issues). AMD is now expected to go from 64 cores in EPYC to 96... and also 128. That's just ludicrous, 128 CORES and 256 threads. And X86 clients are THRILLED to buy more power in a more efficient chip.\n\n[Google wants AMD Milan Epyc Chips for its Datacenter](https://preview.redd.it/36x8ygt6u8871.jpg?width=2284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d96e3eab884218203d9fbe906b9ba3474902e13)\n\nDeals with the US Department of Energy (El Capitan), Singapore and Germany, all for public datacenters worth millions of dollars. That's just the tip of the iceberg, as private players are taking note of EPYC.\n\nLast, **but certainly NOT least: MOBILE**\n\nAMD will power Samsung's S22 flagship phone. It's GPU is expected to break records, as engineering samples already have it beating MALI and Apple's options, by **double digits**.\n\n**Samsung** is delighted and **Google** also wants AMD chips for its phones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Samsung wants AMD's chips for its flagship GALAXY S22](https://preview.redd.it/xu07hgobu8871.jpg?width=1919&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfea79ba818835fb83a9cb5f51d5189cf2d034e0)\n\nBut enough on the PRODUCTS. What about the fundamentals?\n\nRevenue growth is expected at 50% by the end of 2021. How many companies are growing by 50%?\n\nAnd that guidance was provided with the Q1 results in April, which were exceeding expectations. The raised the guidance from 37% to 50%... and will certainly BEAT IT.\n\nAMD is NOW a profitable company... and it literally CANNOT keep its products on shelves, as its clients are buying ALL THEIR CHIPS.\n\nAMD's valuation is $110 billion, while NVIDIA (w/slightly more revenue &amp; profit) is $500 billion.\n\nHow is NVIDIA 5 times the value of AMD???... Just because of a stock split?\n\nIt is currently trading at 38 times earnings, which if they grow by 50% in 6 months, will certainly drop.\n\nSo yeah, the stock is currently above $90 and aiming to reach its all-time high of $99 which was reached a few months ago, in January.\n\nAnalyst consensus of the stock is currently $106.54 ([https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast)) which slightly better than an 18% upside, which would take it to a mere $ 132 billion market cap.\n\nIf you ask me, AMD should be **at least HALF** of NVIDIA's $500 billion market cap.\n\nLastly, the Xilinx acquisition, which will aim to create synergies among functions (e.g. HR, Procurement, Engineering, etc.). It will also increase AMD's share of the silicon purchasing world, as TSMC will have AMD as its #2 client, only second to Apple.\n\nXilinx cancelled its dividends as its shareholders approved the merger with AMD.\n\nAMD may choose to bring dividends back after the merger... yet in the meantime, they announced a $4 Billion share buyback program. They know their stock is trading **CHEAP**.\n\n# On the positions (full disclosure): YES, I hold AMD stock.\n\nI bought $25K back in 2013, when the stock was at $2.46 (on January 18th, 2013), a bit over 10150 stocks. I saw the stock go up to $20 and sold half of it in 2018. Later, I bought back a bit (crazy ape mentality).\n\nToday, I stand with 7500 stocks. Certainly worth a couple of Lambo's, yet I drive a Nissan.\n\nIf you ask me, my next car should be a TESLA... with AMD chips (yet I'm not selling AMD).\n\nWE ALREADY PASSED THE MOON, we will pass **MARS** (Tesla) and also our **Galaxy** (Samsung).\n\n# Join me, together we will conquer the Universe!!!\n\nPack your bananas.... we're in for a journey!",

        "selftext": "Today is the first time I feel bearish about AAPL. It's a money making machine but stock goes higher because of future earning / innovation potential and not because of how successful the company in the past. The headwinds include: epic trial, chip shortage leading to reduced iPad shipment and reduced future revenue, and possibly reduced iPhone 13 shipment due to no breaking changes. \n\nIn addition to all these, already highest market cap in the market and inflation fear looming the tech sector. Since AAPL is such a big part of many indexes, the downward of indexes will affect AAPL a lot. Also, three top car division executives just left AAPL and it does not seem AAPL has made much progress in the car business which could be next big growth area for AAPL. \n\nAmong a dozen of professional analysts, only 2 are bearish and last week New Street\u2019s Pierre Ferragu gave a $90 price target EOY. No major banks have downgraded their outlook for AAPL and the consensus median is $160, average is $157.10, high is $185. \n\nWhat do you think about AAPL?",

        "selftext": "Hey All,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm brand new to WSB but bear with me. Once upon a time, when I was very down on my luck, I walked into a temp agency and asked for any job they could give me. What they had was a factory assembly worker on the line at Blackberry in my hometown of Waterloo, Canada (yep...Canadian alert!). It was a 12hr job with day/night swapping shifts. It was a repetative, monotonous job putting screws into things and doing it all in style in a zero static white suit and blue boots. It was most definitely NOT what I had envisioned for myself for the rest of my life. However, that job would turn out to be one of the most rewarding short-term jobs I've ever had because I sat next to some truly wonderful people on the assembly line. \n\nWith nothing to do for 12hrs but shoot the sh\\*t, I soon discovered that I was sitting next to doctors from Iran, lawyers from Indonesia, CEOs from Pakistan. Each of them had come to this job out of desperation just like me. Each of them were deemed \"overqualified\" by most other jobs just like me. Each of them had worked hard, invested in company shares (BB had an amazing employee share program) and had made more money there than they could have dreamed. BB had given them the promise of a real future in Canada and you could see the passion they had for this company in their faces. Also, BB once a year rented out the Air Canada Centre (or Rogers or whatever the hell its called now...) and rented a rock band for their employees! Like...ALL of their employees...not just management. I saw ACDC, Steven Tyler, Van Halen and the Tragically Hip. All thanks to BB. They wanted to spread the love. \n\nSo I got over myself and how I wasn't where I wanted to be, and I used this job to give myself a crash-course on global politics from the amazing people I worked with. I learned about the so-called \"scary\" parts of the world and how beautiful they actually were. When the time came to leave that job and move on to other things, I left with a profound appreciation for hard-working immigrants and just how much dedication it takes to sit down at a factory bench with a $200k salary potential education, and screw things together for $14/hr. I'll never forget those people. And I'll never forget that company. Blackberry gave life, employment, education grants, city improvements and other amazing opportunities to my hometown of Waterloo. When the time came that Apple overtook them and Blackberry faltered, my hometown and the rest of Canada turned its back on them, and that disgusted me. \n\nTHAT is why I am investing in BB today. Not for a get-rich-quick scheme, but because I genuinely hold a special place in my heart for that company and can find way more emotional attachment to it than a TV channel I used to watch, and a place where I used to buy Ace Combat as a kid. \n\nTLDR; BB was once the bright future of Canadian tech industry, it carried me through tough times as an employee, and I respect it.",

        "selftext": "People underestimate Blackberry's QNX operating system as a secure RTOS (Real Time Operating System) based off of microkernel architecture. \ud83d\ude80\n\nFor those who don't know how a RTOS microkernel operates let's explain with minor detail. QNX is one of the most adopted embedded OS's in the world installed in defense systems, power plants and municipal grids, robotics, rockets, rail and 120 million vehicles and rising.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe reason for it's adoption is because of the way a QNX Neutrino RTOS operates compared to what we consider typical everyday operating systems. Most operating systems including IOS, Windows, Linux(Android) and MacOS to name the most apparent run on monolithic designs or hybrid kernels.\ud83d\ude80 \n\nA true microkernel architecture like QNX Neutrino RTOS has full memory protection which is built in meaning that any component can fail and be restarted without corrupting the microkernel or other components in the system. If failure does occur, QNX has the ability to rectify the problem without affecting any other part of the system through process monitoring and recovery components. This feature and ability equals extreme reliability and security and being a microkernel the OS is also modular.\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo what is the big deal your probably asking, Apple, ABC, and Microsoft might enter the space? Not exactly, in fact there has been work in this space from all three companies. Apple opened a facility across from QNX in Kanata and hired the ex creator of the OS Dan Dodge in 2016 to work with Mansfield on the autonomous car project called project Titan. The need for a secure and stable software is where Dodge and his decades of experience from QNX come into play.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe need for a software system as reliable and secure as QNX should be a big flag to the shear potential of QNX. It is clearly a threat and tough competition for even the biggest software companies. Not only this but project Titan continues to be illusive revealing possible setbacks and interference in trying to compete but also Apple lost several top managers from it's Apple Car project causing a potential setback to the launch revealing some attrition in the project.\ud83d\ude80\n\nQNX version (7.1) is years ahead and analysts predict the next competitor is still 5 years away from anything even remotely close.  QNX hypervisor 2.0 is 61508 SIL 3 certified and\u00a0has been recognized as ISO 26262 ASIL D compliant making it the world's first ASIL D safety-certified commercial hypervisor. \ud83d\ude80\n\nAs other's race to catch up BlackBerry has been filing patents on it's system.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe QNX Hypervisor utilizes patented and patent-pending technologies that simplifies how elements are shared on the system. Multiple OS's can use 1 display controller to render content onto multiple displays, aka digital instrument cluster and infotainment.\ud83d\ude80",

As Buffett explicitly stated at the Annual Meeting, the Q1 2021 earnings were no higher than Q1 2020 would have been without COVID. Berkshire's \"interest rate\" has recently collapsed-- price way up, earnings almost flat\n\n**Justification #2:** Berkshire is fully valued according to a recent and fairly optimistic expert estimate of intrinsic value (Morningstar):\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/brkb/comments/m80e6e/greg_warren_morningstar_berkshire_shows_stronger/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n**Justification #3:** Nobody agrees fully with the (book value)+(insurance float) price predictor, but historically, stretching back for decades, it has been a losing proposition to buy above BV+FL. Today BV+FL is $257, and the P/(BV+FL) ratio is 1.13, an extreme high. The last time this happened was in 2014, and you can see what happened then:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/brkb/comments/mhf7i0/berkshire_hathaways_market_price_follows_the_sum/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n**Justification #4:** Berkshire was rapidly tapering its buybacks at $250, far below the current market price of $290. This is a dead giveaway that we are fully valued or overvalued. Berkshire's average buyback price is well below the highest price paid, probably around $210. The buybacks likely target an average price (just like when Berkshire was buying AAPL -- Berkshire bought many shares far above $35 but never made a purchase that would raise the average above $35). Here is the Q1 2021 buyback table, where you can see the tapering:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/brkb/comments/n2h588/berkshire_q1_2021_buyback_price_table_these/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

        "selftext": "As a sequel to \"10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM\", I'm back with 10 more ETFs that have less than $1b AUM but that I think are interesting and possibly useful and some comments on each.  Too often only the biggest ETFs, or most popular, get people's attention. I think it's worth looking further to see what's out there.\n\nStarting with a Peter Lynch inspired strategy (Lynch popularized the price/earnings-to-growth ratio),\n\n1. SPGP: Invesco S&amp;P 500 GARP ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP) . \"Growth at a Reasonable Price\" (GARP).  This ETF is an interesting combination factor screener.  It only selects from S&amp;P 500 stocks, and screens them first for 3-year earnings and sales growth, and second for financial leverage (debt), return on equity, and earnings yield (trailing-twelve-month or \"TTM\" net income / market cap).  Holdings are weighted by growth score, not market cap.  GARP's historical performance is surprisingly good; it beat the S&amp;P 500 since January 2020 and beats both the S&amp;P and traditional CRSP growth/value factors YTD.  It also outperforms the S&amp;P on some longer timeframes.  Index rebalanced semiannually (3rd Friday June/Dec), and it costs a moderate 0.34% ER.  It's designed to hold 75 stocks.  Check SPGP out when it rebalances later in the month!\n\nMoving on to Factor ETFs,\n\n2.  FVAL: Fidelity Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL) .  This ETF tracks and index that calculates scores for: free cash flow yield, EBITDA to enterprise value, book value to price, and forward earnings to price. The first two factors result in it having some tech giants such as FB, GOOGL, AMZN, and AAPL in the index. But not some others, such as TSLA, which scores very poorly on... well, every factor. Banks are just scored on book to price and forward earnings to price, as their business model is not comparable to most other stocks. FVAL provides an interesting way to get exposure to possibly-not-overpriced intellectual property-heavy companies, as well as traditional value stocks.  Currently holds about 130 stocks.\n\n3.  FIVA: Fidelity International Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA) .  The international (mostly developed markets) counterpart to FVAL, this ETF fills a great niche since forward-looking international value ETFs are few and far between.  Most value ETFs are heavy on book value, and rely on backward looking metrics or ignore free cash flow.  FIVA (and FVAL) take a different approach.  Currently holds about 120 stocks.  FIVA is perhaps the single most overlooked ETF in this entire list -- it provides a unique type of international exposure, and at only 0.39% ER. International factor funds often have slightly higher ERs than total market funds, but may provide much greater total return given desirable macro-economic conditions.  For example, since the first vaccine was proven effective (which kicked off the value rally), FIVA has outperformed VEA by about 6 percent.\n\n4.  JVAL: JPMorgan U.S. Value Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753) .  JVAL's index is also a value screen. It scores via four metrics: earnings yield, book to price, free cash flow yield, and TTM dividend yield. Pretty well-rounded in that it includes earnings, book, and yield measures. It does not include forward earnings metrics. Due to the cash flow and earnings metrics, it ends up including some big tech companies like FB, GOOGL, and MSFT. While it includes a dividend metric, the JVAL ETF has a lower 30-day SEC yield than VTV or dividend-focused ETFs such as SCHD, so I would not consider it as a dividend fund.  Holds about 350 stocks.  \n\n5. FQAL: Fidelity Quality Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal) .  Quality ETFs depart from value ETFs in that they're less concerned about price/earnings metrics.   Fidelity's offering in the space weights stocks on free cash flow margin, return on invested capital (one of Charlie Munger's favorite metrics), and free cash flow stability.  For banks, it looks at return on equity and debt to assets.  This ends up having a lot of overlap with the S&amp;P 500, but it ends up filtering out companies like TSLA and as per its goal, only has about 130 companies overall.  Like FVAL, this costs 0.29% ER.  Fairly common for US factor funds.\n\n6. JQUA: JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761) .  JPMorgan handles \"quality\" a bit differently.  They have 10, yes ten, different metrics that go into measuring quality.  They're grouped into categories for \"profitability\", \"solvency and financial risk\", and \"earnings quality\".  Loosely stated, they're looking for companies making reliable cold hard cash hand over fist that are not too indebted.  Like the Fidelity offering, it ends up looking a lot like the S&amp;P 500 but with slightly different weights.  GOOGL currently sits at the top of its holdings.\n\nLet us not forget commodities,\n\n7. COM: Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf](https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf) .  A fascinating ETF, it covers 12 different commodity futures in categories for metals, agriculture, and energy.  Different from most other commodity ETFs, it's almost like a commodity trend advisor (CTA) fund because it can take both long and \"flat\" (neutral/no) position in each commodity.  This helped COM wonderfully during the commodity crash in 2Q20 because they were able to go flat and preserve value, avoiding the oil crash.  If inflation comes back big time, commodities will benefit.  And if a commodity bubble bursts, this fund may be able to avoid some of the downside.  No K-1 form.  Might be my go-to outside of GUNR (equity ETF) for commodity exposure.\n\n8. CMDY: iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund) .  A somewhat newer offering from Blackrock, this broad commodity fund systematically positions itself to best handle carry cost in the futures curve (and thus adjusts for contango / backwardation curves).  It has generally outperformed other popular long-only commodity funds, and avoid being overweight on oil/energy futures.\n\nSeeking dividends?\n\n9. SCHY: Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF, [https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy) . A new offering from Schwab, it's the international counterpart to SCHD.  Its index filters for companies that have made 10 consecutive years of dividend payments, and ranks them by cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and 5-year dividend growth rate.  After a volatility screen, the results are weighted by a capped market capitalization approach.  A wonderful mirror to SCHD for those seeking reliable income, but who also want to diversify outside of US markets.  I predict its AUM will go up by 10x in less than 2 years.  Also quite inexpensive at 0.14% ER -- Schwab is likely subsidizing this, in order to help it grow.\n\nFinally, like it or not, blockchain is here to stay,\n\n10. BLOK: Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html) .  The AUM of this ETF is right around the $1b mark, but I'm including it anyway.  It seems to be the best-of-breed actively managed ETF for exposure to stocks benefiting from bitcoin mania and blockchain tech.  Clearly, it's volatile.  And it's not a pure bitcoin/ethereum play -- some small amounts of Samsung, IBM, and so on sneak in due to them having a connection to the space.  But it does hit all the big names, including recently listed Coinbase ($COIN).  If you can't be bothered to follow or deal with crypto in general but want something that will remain correlated to it, this is the ETF.  Pricey at 0.71% ER, but, it's actively managed and still has a lower ER than ARK's funds.\n\nDisclaimers: this is not financial advice. I currently have a position in FVAL, but no position in any of the other ETFs at time of posting.  That may change at any point in the future.  I am not predicting future performance for any of these funds.  Do your own due diligence (and please post in reply with what you find!).\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, June 1, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) modestly declining while the Dow Jones (DIA) gained roughly 0.1%. After a volatile beginning to the May, it seems over the past several weeks fears of fast rising inflation causing the Federal Reserve to prematurely tighten monetary policy have tempered. As I have said for weeks, I thought the selloff in the first two weeks of May, that saw the SPY lose 4% in a few days, was overdone, and am very encouraged by the price action in the market recently.\n\nLast week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee once again reassured market participants that they see inflationary pressures as \u201ctransitory\u201d and do not think a shift in monetary policy in the near-term is warranted. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and that the Fed was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be \u201coverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.\u201d \n\nRichard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said \u201cthere will come a time in upcoming meetings\u201d when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that \u201cit is going to depend on the flow of data\u201d. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.\n\nThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn\u2019t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes. \n* Construction spending rose only 0.2% in April over March, a sharp deceleration compared to March over February. Spending rose only 0.2% compared to 1% in March.\n* \u201cMeme stocks\u201d continue their strong performance from last week, with AMC gapping up more than 20% again today. Crazy stuff!\n* Coinbase (COIN) announced customers would be able to fund their account using Apple and Google wallets \n* The price of Tesla vehicles is increasing due to supply chain pressures across the auto industry, particularly for raw materials, Elon Musk said on Monday via Twitter.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Dollar General (DG) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $226 to $231 at Buy. Stock currently around $203\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) target raised by Piper Sandler from $385 to $420 at Overweight. Stock currently around $372\n* Hess (HESS) target raised by Wells Fargo from $86 to $98 at Overweight. Stock currently around $84\n* UnitedHealth Group (UNH) target raised by Bank of America from $450 to $522 at Buy. Stock currently around $412\n* UPS target raised by Citigroup from $220 to $235 at Neutral. Stock currently around $215\n* The Gap (GPS) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $36 to $38 at Hold. Stock currently around $33.4\n\n\u201cSomeone's sitting in the shade today because someone planted a **tree** a long time ago.\u201d - Warren Buffet",

        "selftext": "Gonna keep it real simple for the folks here (excuse the plain text and lack of pretty charts, I\u2019m on my phone). \n\nI know a lot of folks are focused now on AMC and GME, and I don\u2019t blame ya, but want to share with you a ripe opportunity with VIAC that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.  \n\nThree simple reasons to buy:\n\n1) It is transitioning to a streaming company, but theatricals are also big part of their business.  This is a reopening play in this regard.  It will benefit big as theatres reopen.\n\nViacom released \u201cA Quiet Place Part 2\u201d last weekend already earned $58 million in the US in only 3 days, a new post pandemic record.\n\nViacomCBS has lots more big theatre releases that will definitely be huge hits as things reopen.  Mission Impossible 7 coming later this year, and Top Gun 2 early next year.\n\nStreaming biz is doing fantastic as well.  Growing 60%+ annually, 36 million paid subs (Paramount+) plus 50 million ad supported users (Pluto TV).\n\n2) Valuation \n\nViacomCBS trades for less than 10 PE.  It pays a dividend of 2.3% (if you buy the stock before June 14, you get 0.24 cents per share).  Among the cheapest stocks you can buy in it\u2019s class.  \n\nViacomCBS has a market cap of only $28 billion, revenue last qtr of $7.4 billion and free cash flow of $1.6 billion.\n\nCompare this to Netflix which has a market cap of $221 billion, Its revenue last qtr was $7.1 billion.\n\nIt has so much going for it, yet it\u2019s stock has been pummeled and punished due to Billy Hwang\u2019s margin call and has yet to recover.  There is still decent short interest of 9-10% for some fuel when buyers appear (usual short players, including Melvin).\n\n3) Buyout candidate\n\nContent is king, and it\u2019s increasingly more expensive as studios do exclusives for their own streaming channel.  As an example, Amazon just bought MGM studio for 8.45 billion.  ViacomCBS has Paramount, Showtime, Miramax, Nickelodeon, among other studio assets.  There are few assets left for sale with the scale and quality of content that Viacom has.  It makes sense a bigger player like Apple or Netflix could buy this out for a big price.\n\nAs this has been dead in the water for months, Volatility is now relatively low.  You can buy Sept 17 50 calls for only a 1.80.   If people get interested in this, it can easily revisit the recent highs of almost $100 earlier this year before Billy got shanked by his brokers.\n\nTLDR: Check out VIAC if you\u2019re looking for a well priced stock with lots of potential, it\u2019s a bargain and ready to moon.\n\nLong with 100 calls, $40 Sept.",

(Put options)\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say a large percentage of the revenue Facebook makes is from iPhone users\u2026 because iPhones are the most popular cellphones in North America.

This will create lots of bearish sentiment against Facebook, additionally with inflation being in that talks this summer, the tech industry can see a hit.\n\nFacebook should still be able to generate revenue from targeted ads, as they have data stored already.

I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F.  So, proceed on your own risk...)\n\n# $F: Ford\n\n3 months ago, I spent so much time on part 1 and after posting it, I sadly realized that people are lazy \ud83d\ude02 Apes don't want to read mountains of DD, They just want a 5th grade level TLDR. This Ape got you and this DD will basically be a Long version of a TLDR! I'll try to make it concise and to the point as much as possible.(5 hours later, I failed at this objective lol) \n\n**Though, if you are interested in my initial DD which took 2 days of research here's the** [**link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsh9fh/ev_play_buying_leap_calls_on_america_for_the_next/)\n\nFYI, I will not include any points mentioned in part one, like for example why it's grossly undervalued, etc... Spoiler Alert, it predicted F-150 EV pump!\n\nLet's jump into it:\n\n\u201cOur ambition is to lead the electric vehicle revolution\u201d \\~ CEO Jim Farley\n\n**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**\n\n For the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.  \n\n On May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min video). It has all the features crucial for it's target buyers (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's a Truck which actually looks like a Truck. \u201cFord knows what pickup owners want,\u201d IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.\n\n Now Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla right now with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **\"Potential(because they don't exist yet)\"** competitors with superior car features. Moreover, on May 26, it was announced that 70,000 Trucks were already reserved!\n\nAs Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...\n\n^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)\n\n**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**\n\nFord-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now \ud83d\ude02(Ford is 62.50B at 14.94$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount. \n\n Farley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** \"but that's not why we invested,\" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.\n\n Farley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car. He understands that the first move is the most important one in the EV territory and until now with the Mach-E and F-150 Ford execute the mission perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices and high quality. Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.\n\n**3- Ford-SK Recent Partnership:**\n\nOn May 20, Ford and SK Innovation announced that they have signed a MOU for a joint venture(to be called BlueOvalSK) to manufacture battery cells and arrays in the U.S.\n\n BlueOvalSK to produce approximately 60 gigawatt hours (GWh) **annually with potential to expand.** To put that into perspective, By 2030, Ford expects annual energy demand for its vehicles to be up to **140 GWh annually** in North America and up **to 240 GWh globally.**\n\nThey are Taking the Battery development seriously from now and preparing to eat the EV market share.\n\n**4- Ford-Government contracts:**\n\n\u201cFord clearly has business and government fleets in mind,\u201d Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said. \n\nFord revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it\u2019s equipped with a standard battery that\u2019s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, the same as the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings. \n\n Ford's vision to lead the EV market has a \u201cno-brainer\u201d component Elon Musk lacks: a vast base of business and government fleet customers it\u2019s targeting with new battery-powered trucks and vans.  Ford\u2019s focus on converting fleet buyers to electric models \u201cbuilds on the company\u2019s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts.\n\n^(Ford is in bed with the government and they could easily scoop up most EV vehicle related contracts with their connections.)\n\n**5- Recent EV sales:**\n\nToday, Ford has reported a 184% jump in electric vehicle (EV) sales in May. Overall total sales for May, including EVs and non-electric vehicles, grew 4.1% year on year. Total sales were up 11.3% for the year to date.\n\nNow for the surprising Mach-E(Ford's first EV this year) sales, The Mach-E is eating up Tesla sales. Morgan Stanley shows that Tesla's share of the US EV market fell to 69% in February, down from 81% a year ago. \"Mach-E accounted for nearly 100% of the (Tesla) share loss,\" said Adam  Jonas, Morgan Stanley's auto analyst. \n\nNow for international sales, Mustang Mach-E was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Norway in May, the first full month of sales. On the other hand, Tesla Model 3 was sixth on the sales list.\n\nFord is not Fucking Around and they are doing it right in the EV space...\n\n**6- Price Target:**\n\n For the price target details, refer to Part 1.\n\n[Ford Price Target Forecast with Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/d619605eo3371.png?width=762&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edd8e2c20b3ef25641dd2a106709654bb57df93f)",

        "selftext": "The global semi-conductor shortage, aka chip shortage, has been crippling many industries. Demand for chips is continuing to outstrip supply and the car industry is longer the only one feeling the pain. Many auto-makers are actually limiting the amount of cars produced in 2021, including Ford recently who announced they will be canceling weeks worth of production of the F-150.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThere are a few factors at play giving analysts the impression that this shortage may last until early 2022. There\u2019s a few KEY points that come to mind:\n\n* Most chips are produced overseas: Covid-related delays in shipping ports have effected supply coming into the United States.\n* China has been stock-piling chips: Chinese businesses have bought an absurd amount of chip-producing equipment (roughly $32 billion) in an effort to protect themselves from further US sanctions.\n* Demand for electronic products have soared.\n* Often over-looked, consumers don\u2019t realize the amount of chips it takes to build cars in 2021. The trend is continuing in the same direction as many analysts expect the automative industry to begin predominantly developing cars with network connectivity.\n\nThis leaves an opportunity for those willing to look past the hardship some of these companies are experiencing of being unable to meet demand. The semi-conductor industry is expected to grow at CAGR of roughly \\~9% over the next 7-8 years. I see this as a relatively conservative number and it is my opinion that we are heading into a super-cycle of chip upgrades, processing power, and memory devices. Here are a few reasons:\n\n1. We are already seeing noticeable shift in demand and the way consumers are interacting in a new digital world.\n2. These electronics are becoming faster and more powerful, which simply requires a larger quantity &amp; quality of chips.\n3. More and more devices rely on connectivity and the car industry is now making it\u2019s way onto a similar path.\n4. Following Nvidia\u2019s earnings call we are seeing a large rise in trends for AI and machine-learning which is leading to increased demand for the required components.\n5. The rise of crypto mining will also play a role in the increased demand.\n\n**The Players**\n\nMany of the chip-related plays have already seen convincing growth over the last 12 months. However, several names have recently followed the markets to the downside and currently pose a potential good entry point. This secular trend in semi-conductor demand over the next several years is here to stay.\n\nMy semis watchlist is holding some familiar names: Applied Materials (AMAT), ASML Holdings (ASML), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Nvidia (NVDA), Intel (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM).\n\nThe ones that make my shortlist are the following: NVDA, AMD, TSM, and AMAT. Here\u2019s a look at the 2-year chart for the 4 tickers mentioned above.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xr0kge6rq2371.png?width=2380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4beece1276b8c383ed5a2c0cca07bf40f42da11\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is clear the secular trend in computer chips and processors have contributed greatly to the growth of these companies. Let\u2019s take a look at a shorter time-frame. Here\u2019s the 3-month chart for the same list of tickers.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pip83wxqq2371.png?width=2388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b353b714f1958233646a57ee5680bf2385ee2a3d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at it from another angle we see AMD and TSM have been lagging behind the performance of AMAT and NVDA, who are on a nearly identical path. TSM is a leading manufacturer of chips and actually supplies most of AMD\u2019s chips. They are based in Taiwan and there have been some concerns over the potential invasion of China. Setting those concerns aside these companies may still experience strong growth. My plays right now are in AMD and TSM and I will feel comfortable adding to any of the names I mentioned in this article if the right entry point shows itself.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nI would love to say here\u2019s why \u201cx\u201d company is in a better financial position than company \u201cy\u201d, but in this case I believe the high demand for semiconductors will benefit most names participating in this industry. Of course, not every company is made equal so please do your own research before investing in any stocks. In my opinion, this industry is in an upward secular trend and demand remains in-tact, providing tailwinds to the participants.\n\nKeep an eye on earnings reports and financial data of companies that BUY these products. Look at phone, tablet, computer manufacturers (Apple), cloud server providers, Google server expansion (also server chip REPLACEMENT rates, which is a thing), and AI/Machine learning projects (autonomous driving, video analysis, big-data processors). It may be years before the growth slows in this industry and these players will stand to largely benefit.",

        "selftext": "# Price\n\nFacebook currently trades at around $330. Its latest support is at around $296 to $300 and its latest resistance is actually around $330 so essentially the price that it's trading for right now. This is a crucial moment. If it manages to break $330, then we can see an upward movement going up to $360 which is the high ceiling of this channel that it has started forming. If you haven't invested yet, it could be a good time to wait for a couple of days or a week to see how its price will evolve. I have a feeling that it will start consolidating or it could slowly drop down to $315 or, worst case scenario, $300. It is currently trading above its 50D MA and its Relative Strength Index is near the top, but the volume is relatively low which makes me think that we probably won't see a lot of movement in the next week or two. However, as I said, I think that there is a good chance that we can see Facebook hitting $360 in a few months and maybe even $400 by the end of the year. Why? Well, Facebook has been delivering great results after great results. The fundamental performance of the company has been amazing so far. Absolutely amazing! In fact, out of ALL of its 20 earnings reports since 2016, it has only missed 1 and that was by 1 cent and it has only missed revenue ***twice***! The company outperforms analyst expectations and by a big margin, especially in the last 4 quarters. Last quarter, it beat analyst earnings expectations by 41%! This is massive! Especially for a company of Facebook's size! Essentially, what we are seeing is the pandemic boost in advertising that Facebook received was not as transitory as analysts expected. Also, there has been nothing but upward revisions for Facebook's Full Year 2021 earnings, which is a very good sign. 39 upward revisions in total! There have also been 23 upward earnings revisions for next quarter's earnings, which is almost always a good sign. Also, out of the 51 analyst covering Facebook in May, 45 have had a Buy or a Strong Buy rating!\n\n# The Business\n\nHowever, let's leave analyst opinions aside for the moment. They are good to gauge Wall Street's appetite for the company, but let's look at the business, at the fundamentals. Is Facebook really a good company? Facebook's main source of revenue are the ***advertising revenues that*** come from ads on its products, the Facebook app and website, Instagram, Whatsapp and Messenger. By gathering user data, Facebook is able to offer targeted ads which are obviously more expensive, but are also more attractive to advertisers. Even though regulators have reduced the amount of data that Facebook can gather and therefore reduced its ability to target specific audiences through its ads, the company has still managed to grow its advertising business by a LOT! Another reason why the company has done so well is because it operates the 7th most website in the world, Facebook, which is also the 2nd most visited social media website behind YouTube. Instagram is extremely popular as well, ranking in the 23rd place! As of the latest quarter, the Daily active users of Facebook's family of products are 2.72 BILLION with the number of monthly active users being 3.45 BILLION or more than 10 times the population of the US! This is literally half of the world's population! Facebook is still seeing growth in user numbers with its total user base up 15% year-on-year which is actually faster than last year's increase of 11%. So, we can see that their user base is growing, but is that translating into higher revenues? The answer: yes! In 2020, Facebook reported a 20% year-on-year advertising revenue increase, but in their last quarter alone, the advertising revenue increase was 46% compared to last year! Advertising makes about 98% of Facebook's revenue so we can see that the company is getting a serious boost in overall profits. Their net income also grew by 58% in 2020 year-on-year and an astonishing 94% in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to last year! Essentially, we can see that Facebook is reporting some serious growth for a megacap company and it is largely due to the increase in their advertising business. However, Facebook are also involved in Virtual and Augmented Reality through their Reality Labs. While this side of Facebook is still tiny, it is reporting a serious growth in revenues as well. In the first quarter of 2021, its revenue grew by almost 150% as compared to last year and now makes up 2.7% of Facebook's revenue! VR and AR are still relatively young industries, but they are growing fast as we can see. Market researchers claim that the industry will grow at an annual rate of 42% from $37B in 2019 to an astonishing $1.27T in 2030! Facebook is one of the leaders in this space along with Apple, Microsoft and Samsung so this represents a massive opportunity for the tech giant and yet another solid bullish argument for Facebook. Unlike its competitors, Facebook's business is relatively concentrated so I think this gives the company a competitive advantage when it comes to growing its VR and AR business. The company has also grown its headcount by 30% in 2020 so we can see that it is doubling down on expansion and growth. Despite that, analysts are only expecting a revenue and earnings growth of about 15% annually for the next 3 years. To some extent, that is justified as Facebook did get a big bump in earnings due to COVID. However, I think that their estimates lean towards the conservative side and I think that Facebook can actually achieve a growth of between 20% and 25%, especially when we consider the VR and AR business. This may sound optimistic, but given Facebook's record of beating analyst estimates, I am okay with sounding optimistic. The only hurdle that Facebook may run into is regulation, which is always on the table for big tech companies like it. However, it has has a record of successfully dealing with regulation and continuing to deliver good results despite of it so I'll take my chances.\n\n# The Balance Sheet\n\nNow, you may be thinking,\u00a0great, Facebook is positioned well for the future, but how are the fundamentals looking right now? We can see they are growing, but can they support that growth? Personally, I think so. Facebook has a tremendous balance sheet and a massive stockpile of cash and cash equivalents. They currently have just over $64B as of 31th March 2021 which represents a $2-2.5B increase from the end of December 2020 and an increase of almost $10B since December 2019. The huge cash positions means that Facebook has enough capital to expand without being worried about financing, it means that it can buy new companies to help its expansion or to prevent competition, but most importantly, it means that the company is doing well. We can also see that in the company's share repurchase program. Facebook has repurchased $6.3B of shares in 2020 and $4.2B of shares in 2019 and, in January 2021, it authorized an additional $25B of stock repurchases so the total right now is about $34B. This doesn't mean that they will repurchase all $34B, but that they can. Still, the fact that they have authorized that programme is a positive sign. In addition to their massive stockpile of cash, Facebook only has liabilities of $30B or less than half the size of its cash stockpile. What does that mean? It means that Facebook is healthy and it's taking its vitamins. The company is solid and is more than able to tackle any short- or medium-term challenges to its business. It has no long-term debt, meaning that if they do decide to borrow money, they will be able to do so at much better rates than some of its rivals.\n\n# The Ratios\n\nThen, if we look at some the fundamental ratios, we can see that Facebook is. A. Beast! Their Return-on-Assets is 20.3% compared to the industry's average of 10.3% and their Return-on-Equity was 25.3% last year! Lets compare it to its rivals. I think that the companies closest to Facebook in terms of business are Twitter, Google, and Snapchat although Snap is in very early stages of growth. In terms of ROA and ROE, both Snapchat and Twitter are negative so there's not much point in comparing them, but Google has a 15.3% ROA. Their ROE is also lower at 22.3% as opposed to Facebook's 25.3%. Now, Facebook's forward Price-to-earnings ration is only 21.6 whereas Google has 25.5, Twitter's is 52.4 and Snapchat has a Forward PE of 92, so again, Facebook turns out to be the best price for its projected earnings. In terms of current PE, Facebook has 28.2, Google has 32.2 and Snapchat and Twitter don't have one because they are unprofitable. The current S&amp;P average PE is 37.2 so we can see that both Facebook and Google are under the market average although Facebook is again cheaper. What these ratios tell us is that Facebook is not only operating a very efficient business, but it's also at a very good price relative to its peers. Even looking at it historically, Facebook has rarely dropped below a PE of 27-28 so the current price is, again, excellent and cheap. This is my own opinion, feel free to do your own research, but according to my personal EPS growth we can expect a roughly 12% annual return on Facebook over the next 10 years if we buy it at $330. That is assuming a 15% earnings growth next year which will taper off and assuming that we can sell it at a PE ratio of around 30-32. If the earnings grow at around 20% next year, then we can look at a roughly 15% annual return which is higher than the average return of the S&amp;P 500, meaning that Facebook is likely to beat the market, at least in my opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think? I'm sure that I've missed something in my analysis, but I think that I've covered the main bits. It can obviously be more detailed so I'll be happy if you can point out any gaps :)",

        "selftext": "Background:  I'm a gamer (console plebe) and I've been watching RBLX for the lulz because I think I'm a boomer and just don't get it.\nToday I saw that RBLX crossed over 100 per share, giving it a market cap of ~57 billion USD which is within spitting distance of NTDOF with a market cap of $73 billion USD.\n\nI've been trying to figure out how big PlayStation and xBox would be if they were their own company, as well.  PlayStation makes up about ~28% of Sony's revenue based on their latest filing (Sony is a big company, beyond games they sell imaging sensors, electronics, music, movies, and insurance.    Gaming is the biggest division, followed closely by Music and Insurance.  All are profitable, but movies and electronics dropped some in the most recent report, probably COVID related).  Sony has a market cap of 130 billion USD.  This gives the PlayStation division a market cap of around ~$40 billion.  You could probably argue it would be closer to ~$60 billion if it were its own separate company, but its not.\n\nThe xBox division is much harder to estimate.  Microsoft is a much bigger company, and it doesn't specifically call out the xBox division, but lumps it in with a much larger 'More Personal Computing' category.  They do say that Gaming Revenue is in the neighborhood of ~$14 billion, and is driven primarily by xBox, but it likely includes a bunch of other stuff (such as Minecraft).  So, its really hard to figure out and beyond my skills unfortunately.\n\nWhat does all this have to do with Roblox?  Well, Roblox markets itself as a 'platform' and the consoles are established platforms with their own social media networks.  Nintendo even has customizable avatars (Miis).  They also all have established subscription services (PS Plus, GamePass, xBox Live, Switch Online). They also all have pretty insane revenue (a minimum of 10x that of Roblox).  They have fewer 'active users', however those active users also have a much higher spend rate (Roblox is a free to play game, the other platforms require investment in hardware.  The average Roblox user spends less than $6 a month).  The other platforms are harder to determine monthly spend on, unfortunately (trade secrets I guess) but the revenue indicates it is a much larger number.\n\nThe last thing that was interesting to me was the size of the user base. It is larger than the PlayStation user base, and the Nintendo user base.  Its not the largest, though.  Unfortunately, finding details on user base (and metrics to measure them) is very difficult, but most articles and metrics I could find seem to indicate that Roblox trails several games in user counts (using various metrics), including Minecraft, Fortnite, and PUBG.  (Its hard to separate mobile from PC, but Roblox on PC is way down the list in user base beaten by classics such as CS:GO).  It is also beaten by Minecraft and several other games on Mobile, such as Pokemon: GO which currently has around 160 million mobile users.  Also, to come full circle, Pokemon is a Nintendo IP licensed to Niantic for the game.  Lastly, since Roblox is a platform, we would be remiss to not talk about games on the platform.  The biggest game, 'Adopt Me' had ~60 million users, which is pretty impressive considering the scope of the game.  But, it is a lot smaller than other popular games (such as Among Us).\n\nLastly, several games generate much more revenue than ROBLOX.  Fortnite is a good example, as it has already successfully had several 'in-game' events such as concerts that ROBLOX aspires to.  But, for perspective, according to the latest info from the whole Apple vs EPIC trial, Fortnite brings in massive revenue (over 10x the revenue of all of ROBLOX).  EPIC (in its latest funding round in April 2021) is valued at around ~$30 billion.  The caveat is that it is not a publicly traded company.  It also has the Unreal Engine lopped into that valuation.  PlayStation, xBox, and Nintendo also get a cut of that revenue, since those platforms are the largest revenue generators for Fortnite.\n\nOK what does this all mean?  Honestly, I don't know.  I'm just trying to wrap my head around why Roblox is worth almost as much as Nintendo now.\n\nTLDR:  Boomer that grew up on Nintendo and PlayStation still doesn't understand ROBLOX's market cap and is worried he's missing out on something but can't see why.",

        "selftext": "DX Pays Monthly Dividend Today\n\nMassMutual &amp; sub-Barings hold 19M of 115 shrs outstanding per 2020 10K in Novation Companies $NOVC but LT Note Holders behind CDOs Fortress/CDOs Taberna &amp; EJF Capital/Kodiak CDO I own 31M NOVC Common Shares (see below link). Fortress restructured Dynex Capital NYSE $DX with NOVC Chairman of the Board Barry Igdaloff. Add in Igdaloff cabal mostly DX investors they own 40M shares and my small count hold &amp; do not trade 30M =120M shrs. More shares of NOVC are held then outstanding per NOVC 2020 10K filed at SEC 3/4/21. Where are NOVC trading shrs coming from otcshortreport.com ? Someone has bought 100Ms of $NOVC shares since Igdaloff, Chairman and his ex-DX investors Fortress, Wesley R. Edens, COB took control of NOVC Board [**https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/08/09/1900133/0/en/novation-companies-inc-executes-first-amendment-to-senior-secured-note-purchase-agreement.html**](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/08/09/1900133/0/en/novation-companies-inc-executes-first-amendment-to-senior-secured-note-purchase-agreement.html) I ask Mr. Market who would buy one NOVC common shares on no news, a false narrative that leads to 10K GAAP \"Going Concern\"? By concealing their plans, they rent GAAP into Going Concern. Answer is someone with the true narrative is buying.\n\nBTW $NOVC holds $730M NOLs &amp; Rights that control collateral assets on most $3B portfolio (rich 600 Bpts Weighted Average Coupons &amp; seasoned). These attributes can copy Fortress' and Chairman restructuring at DX and Fortress restructuring at Newcastle NCT which changed its name to Drive Shack $DS after separating 4 tax exempt MREITs SNR, GCI and $NRZ. Read $NRZ 2020 10K NRZ [**www.newresi.com**](http://www.newresi.com/) shareholders paid Fortress $170M lucrative two-part management fees plus tens of millions in $NRZ common dividends. $DS kept $160M NOLs and is gravy for Fortress and their cabal of co investors (parent SoftBank $SFTBY, Leon Cooperman, Blackrock, etc).\n\nNOVC can spinoff 100% owned ex MREIT Novastar Financial Inc. and use rights per Service Rights Transfer Agreement Sec 5.04 (attached to back of 2007 Q3) rights called Cleanup Call Rights CCR aka called \u201c2nd Bite of Apple\u201d per these Quants. CCR are well known to MREIT experts NOVC Note Holders &amp; 31.3M common equity holds like Manny Friedman, Neal Wilson Co-CEOs of EJF Capital and Wesley R. Edens, Peter Briger, Co-CEOs of Fortress 100% owned by Masa Son CEO of SoftBank and ex Fortress executive Rajeev Misra, CEO of SoftBank www.visionfund.com &amp; ex Dynex Capital $DX Board Members Barry Igdaloff Chairman of NOVC and Thomas Akin ex DX Chairman of the Board and CEO. Akin with his HF Talkot Capital are the largest shareholders in $NOVC, $DX and $IMH.\n\nNOVC still owns 100% of www.healthcare-staffing.com HCS which is gravy to these investors that will operate tax free with $730M NOLs after $NOVC trigger or calls back collateral assets it controls on most $3B RMBS NonQM portfolio see [**www.novationcompanies.com**](http://www.novationcompanies.com/) web site for Bond Remittance Reports and Edgar Reports for Trust Agreements and Pooling Service Agreements. These collateral assets can be leveraged and resecuritized (like $NRZ and $DX uses 15:1 so 3B x 15 times= $45B portfolio x NIM 500 Bpts = $2,300,000,000 NIMs net interest margins less some SGA (probably pay Fortress another lucrative management fee like the $170M annually paid by NRZ Shareholders per NRZ 10K for 2020) less some other operating expenses and Note Holders collect est $170M annually est dividends (31.3M shr X $5.50/estimated annual dividend). If Mr. Market prices NFI like NRZ dividend off 10% yield Note Holders Fortress and EJF make $55/shr x $1.7 Billion on their virtually zero cash invested in CDOs Service Rights that hold all of NOVC only LT Debt to exit Ch 11 with $6.3M cash with no cram down. Barry Igdaloff paid Note Holders all their back interest compounded plus non-defined penalty and still gave them 31.3M right after exiting Ch 11. Is this a payback for Fortress co-investing at DX or a quid pro quo for a future event, e.g. Fortress and their parent SoftBank investing in NOVC Preferred Stock Series F shelf offering that prices one NOVC common right to dividends and votes at exactly MassMutual cost basis $2.33/NOVC common share (read NOVC Proxy 14A filed at SEC Oct 2018 pages 11 to 15 changed NOVC poison pill that protects NOLs from IRC Sec 382 including Rights Offering aka pre agreed to shelf offering). Fortress bought these CDO Service Rights same year their co investors from $DX Barry Igdaloff (per DX 8K 9/3/20 Igdaloff restructured DX with Fortress and served on DX Board for 20 years) and Howard Amster joined NOVC Board see docs that show Fortress has no cash invested in NOVC Sr Debt [**https://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/homepage/20100422\\_RAIT\\_sells\\_Taberna\\_CDOs\\_for\\_\\_16\\_5M.html**](https://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/homepage/20100422_RAIT_sells_Taberna_CDOs_for__16_5M.html)\n\nNOVC shareholders still have HCS another 100% owned sub [**www.healthcare-staffing.com**](http://www.healthcare-staffing.com/) tax free $730M NOLs -- gravy like Drive Shack $DS was gravy to Fortress after separating 3 tax exempt MREITs from DS NRZ, SNR, and GCI. Drive Shacks web site outlines $DS restructuring by Fortress Dec 2016 also attached. NOVC Board conceals these plans which rent GAAP into publishing a \u201cGoing Concern\u201d therefore engineering NOVC share price to pennies. In my opinion these investors have given themselves almost 50M NOVC shares at less than pennies (31.3M NOVC common shares given Note Holders by their past co investor from DX Barry Igdaloff plus Igdaloff and NOVC Board have given themselves 18M shares RSU by conversion of some of their board compensation into RSU restricted stock units at pennies. The same Board has engineered NOVC penny share price).\n\nThis has not been enough, so the Board continues to use Note Holders that are in substance first and foremost common equity holders owning 27% 31.3M of ALL NOVC Common Shares as also LT Debt as fodder to drive NOVC into GAAP \u201cgoing concern\u201d while someone buys hundreds of millions of NOVC commons shares at pennies off the real narrative. Over 60M shares trade just over last year. This trading is on no news, 10K GOING CONCERN, Board members transferring shares to related parties but really Filing Form 4s.\n\nWhen will the ruse end? You must ask Wesley Edens, Peter Briger, Co-CEOs/COBs of Fortress or Manny Friedman, Founder and CEO of EJF Capital or MassMutual and sub-Barings or DX ex Board Members Barry Igdaloff, NOVC Chairman and Thomas Akin ex IMH Board Member and ex Chairman and CEO of DX? These are some of the world\u2019s leading investors in CCR, MREITs, NOLs Residuals (different then CCR). Do not bother with David Pointer CEO he is a placeholder and appointee of Chuck Gillman and Jeff Eberwein made along with two others shortly after they fined hundreds of millions by SEC\u00a0https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2017/34-80038.pdf Ironically they are doing the same thing at NOVC that created almost half million of SEC fines.\u00a0\n\nThis is not investment advice.

        "selftext": "# Price\n\nFacebook currently trades at around $330. Its latest support is at around $296 to $300 and its latest resistance is actually around $330 so essentially the price that it's trading for right now. This is a crucial moment. If it manages to break $330, then we can see an upward movement going up to $360 which is the high ceiling of this channel that it has started forming. If you haven't invested yet, it could be a good time to wait for a couple of days or a week to see how its price will evolve. I have a feeling that it will start consolidating or it could slowly drop down to $315 or, worst case scenario, $300. It is currently trading above its 50D MA and its Relative Strength Index is near the top, but the volume is relatively low which makes me think that we probably won't see a lot of movement in the next week or two. However, as I said, I think that there is a good chance that we can see Facebook hitting $360 in a few months and maybe even $400 by the end of the year. Why? Well, Facebook has been delivering great results after great results. The fundamental performance of the company has been amazing so far. Absolutely amazing! In fact, out of ALL of its 20 earnings reports since 2016, it has only missed 1 and that was by 1 cent and it has only missed revenue ***twice***! The company outperforms analyst expectations and by a big margin, especially in the last 4 quarters. Last quarter, it beat analyst earnings expectations by 41%! This is massive! Especially for a company of Facebook's size! Essentially, what we are seeing is the pandemic boost in advertising that Facebook received was not as transitory as analysts expected. Also, there has been nothing but upward revisions for Facebook's Full Year 2021 earnings, which is a very good sign. 39 upward revisions in total! There have also been 23 upward earnings revisions for next quarter's earnings, which is almost always a good sign. Also, out of the 51 analyst covering Facebook in May, 45 have had a Buy or a Strong Buy rating!\n\n# The Business\n\nHowever, let's leave analyst opinions aside for the moment. They are good to gauge Wall Street's appetite for the company, but let's look at the business, at the fundamentals. Is Facebook really a good company? Facebook's main source of revenue are the ***advertising revenues that*** come from ads on its products, the Facebook app and website, Instagram, Whatsapp and Messenger. By gathering user data, Facebook is able to offer targeted ads which are obviously more expensive, but are also more attractive to advertisers. Even though regulators have reduced the amount of data that Facebook can gather and therefore reduced its ability to target specific audiences through its ads, the company has still managed to grow its advertising business by a LOT! Another reason why the company has done so well is because it operates the 7th most website in the world, Facebook, which is also the 2nd most visited social media website behind YouTube. Instagram is extremely popular as well, ranking in the 23rd place! As of the latest quarter, the Daily active users of Facebook's family of products are 2.72 BILLION with the number of monthly active users being 3.45 BILLION or more than 10 times the population of the US! This is literally half of the world's population! Facebook is still seeing growth in user numbers with its total user base up 15% year-on-year which is actually faster than last year's increase of 11%. So, we can see that their user base is growing, but is that translating into higher revenues? The answer: yes! In 2020, Facebook reported a 20% year-on-year advertising revenue increase, but in their last quarter alone, the advertising revenue increase was 46% compared to last year! Advertising makes about 98% of Facebook's revenue so we can see that the company is getting a serious boost in overall profits. Their net income also grew by 58% in 2020 year-on-year and an astonishing 94% in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to last year! Essentially, we can see that Facebook is reporting some serious growth for a megacap company and it is largely due to the increase in their advertising business. However, Facebook are also involved in Virtual and Augmented Reality through their Reality Labs. While this side of Facebook is still tiny, it is reporting a serious growth in revenues as well. In the first quarter of 2021, its revenue grew by almost 150% as compared to last year and now makes up 2.7% of Facebook's revenue! VR and AR are still relatively young industries, but they are growing fast as we can see. Market researchers claim that the industry will grow at an annual rate of 42% from $37B in 2019 to an astonishing $1.27T in 2030! Facebook is one of the leaders in this space along with Apple, Microsoft and Samsung so this represents a massive opportunity for the tech giant and yet another solid bullish argument for Facebook. Unlike its competitors, Facebook's business is relatively concentrated so I think this gives the company a competitive advantage when it comes to growing its VR and AR business. The company has also grown its headcount by 30% in 2020 so we can see that it is doubling down on expansion and growth. Despite that, analysts are only expecting a revenue and earnings growth of about 15% annually for the next 3 years. To some extent, that is justified as Facebook did get a big bump in earnings due to COVID. However, I think that their estimates lean towards the conservative side and I think that Facebook can actually achieve a growth of between 20% and 25%, especially when we consider the VR and AR business. This may sound optimistic, but given Facebook's record of beating analyst estimates, I am okay with sounding optimistic. The only hurdle that Facebook may run into is regulation, which is always on the table for big tech companies like it. However, it has has a record of successfully dealing with regulation and continuing to deliver good results despite of it so I'll take my chances.\n\n# The Balance Sheet\n\nNow, you may be thinking,\u00a0great, Facebook is positioned well for the future, but how are the fundamentals looking right now? We can see they are growing, but can they support that growth? Personally, I think so. Facebook has a tremendous balance sheet and a massive stockpile of cash and cash equivalents. They currently have just over $64B as of 31th March 2021 which represents a $2-2.5B increase from the end of December 2020 and an increase of almost $10B since December 2019. The huge cash positions means that Facebook has enough capital to expand without being worried about financing, it means that it can buy new companies to help its expansion or to prevent competition, but most importantly, it means that the company is doing well. We can also see that in the company's share repurchase program. Facebook has repurchased $6.3B of shares in 2020 and $4.2B of shares in 2019 and, in January 2021, it authorized an additional $25B of stock repurchases so the total right now is about $34B. This doesn't mean that they will repurchase all $34B, but that they can. Still, the fact that they have authorized that programme is a positive sign. In addition to their massive stockpile of cash, Facebook only has liabilities of $30B or less than half the size of its cash stockpile. What does that mean? It means that Facebook is healthy and it's taking its vitamins. The company is solid and is more than able to tackle any short- or medium-term challenges to its business. It has no long-term debt, meaning that if they do decide to borrow money, they will be able to do so at much better rates than some of its rivals.\n\n# The Ratios\n\nThen, if we look at some the fundamental ratios, we can see that Facebook is. A. Beast! Their Return-on-Assets is 20.3% compared to the industry's average of 10.3% and their Return-on-Equity was 25.3% last year! Lets compare it to its rivals. I think that the companies closest to Facebook in terms of business are Twitter, Google, and Snapchat although Snap is in very early stages of growth. In terms of ROA and ROE, both Snapchat and Twitter are negative so there's not much point in comparing them, but Google has a 15.3% ROA. Their ROE is also lower at 22.3% as opposed to Facebook's 25.3%. Now, Facebook's forward Price-to-earnings ration is only 21.6 whereas Google has 25.5, Twitter's is 52.4 and Snapchat has a Forward PE of 92, so again, Facebook turns out to be the best price for its projected earnings. In terms of current PE, Facebook has 28.2, Google has 32.2 and Snapchat and Twitter don't have one because they are unprofitable. The current S&amp;P average PE is 37.2 so we can see that both Facebook and Google are under the market average although Facebook is again cheaper. What these ratios tell us is that Facebook is not only operating a very efficient business, but it's also at a very good price relative to its peers. Even looking at it historically, Facebook has rarely dropped below a PE of 27-28 so the current price is, again, excellent and cheap. This is my own opinion, feel free to do your own research, but according to my personal EPS growth we can expect a roughly 12% annual return on Facebook over the next 10 years if we buy it at $330. That is assuming a 15% earnings growth next year which will taper off and assuming that we can sell it at a PE ratio of around 30-32. If the earnings grow at around 20% next year, then we can look at a roughly 15% annual return which is higher than the average return of the S&amp;P 500, meaning that Facebook is likely to beat the market, at least in my opinion.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, June 1, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) modestly declining while the Dow Jones (DIA) gained roughly 0.1%. After a volatile beginning to the May, it seems over the past several weeks fears of fast rising inflation causing the Federal Reserve to prematurely tighten monetary policy have tempered. As I have said for weeks, I thought the selloff in the first two weeks of May, that saw the SPY lose 4% in a few days, was overdone, and am very encouraged by the price action in the market recently.\n\nLast week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee once again reassured market participants that they see inflationary pressures as \u201ctransitory\u201d and do not think a shift in monetary policy in the near-term is warranted. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and that the Fed was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be \u201coverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.\u201d \n\nRichard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said \u201cthere will come a time in upcoming meetings\u201d when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that \u201cit is going to depend on the flow of data\u201d. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.\n\nThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn\u2019t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes. \n* Construction spending rose only 0.2% in April over March, a sharp deceleration compared to March over February.

        "selftext": "mCloud Technologies (Ticker: MCLDF) is a 10 bagger in the making. mCloud has identified a niche opportunity to optimize energy assets for all businesses to contribute to higher ESG scores and overall energy savings. Bank of America (TICKER: BAC) **HAS ALL 3,300 of their branches connected to their software and SAVED roughly $40,000,000 through improved efficiencies (5). The savings they generated EXCEEDED the amount paid for the subscription.** \n\nQuick facts:\n\n*  WILL BE CASH FLOW POSITIVE by mid Q3 2021.\n* Quick Ratio well over 1\n* Price-to-Sales below 2\n* Gross Margins of 61%\n* SaaS company with 273% Net Dollar Retention and ZERO attrition currently serving an untapped market (Unbelievable)\n* Currently have 60,000 subscribers (Connect assets) which include blue-chip customers like McDonalds (Ticker: MCD), Planet Fitness (Ticker: PLNT), Starbucks (Ticker: SBUX), Telus (Ticker: T.TO) , Longyuen (Largest wind farm in China), etc (AND GROWING).\n* Comparables: Aspen Technologies (Ticker: AZPN), Honeywell (Ticker: HON), C3AI (Ticker: AI).\n* Stock price is down because COVID-19 restricted them from going to clients and connecting them. HUGE tailwinds as resections lift. \n* Five days ago (May 27th, 2021) Jack Vander Aarde from Maxim Group reiterated a \"BUY\" rating with a **price target of $5 (242% upside).** His recommendations have generated a 110% return while being a tracked analyst on TD Ameritrade with a success rate of 74%, ranking 13th out of 7,533 tracked analysts... No fluff here just facts.\n\nThe first component of the *AssetCareTM* foundation (Their SaaS product) is the IoT sensors that are attached to client\u2019s assets (HVAC Systems, Wind Turbines, Electrical Transformers, Nuclear Power Plants, Heat Exchangers, etc.). The same way IoT sensors in an Apple Watch track the distance and speed you've ran or your sleeping patterns and heartbeat, mCloud's IoT sensors track real time asset data in buildings, oil and gas facilities, and wind farms. Some examples of the data points tracked are Kilowatt/hour usage (HVAC), outdoor temperature (HVAC), heating and cooling effectiveness (HVAC), system run-times (HVAC), heat transfer and viscosity (Oil and Gas), control systems (Oil and Gas), blade speed (Wind), etc. All of the respective information is collected, combined, and stored in the cloud where analytics are applied and correlations are made to directly decrease operating costs and provide better insight on the assets overall health (As oppose to traditional \"straight-line\" deprecation methods). These sensors years ago were very expensive and could not feasibly be used in providing a price-conscience product to consumers. With new advances in technology, the price of these sensors have dropped dramatically and the accuracy of the data they can accumulate has improved significantly. \n\nThe next foundational piece to their product is the cloud. In the 20th century companies had hardware that took up the size of entire rooms to store a fraction of data/information that can be stored today in a victual cloud. Now in the 21st century, big cloud providers such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and IBM viciously compete for customers, driving the price of storage down exponentially. With mCloud sensors tracking data 24/7/365, they now have a place to store and analyze it cheaply for its current 60,000 connected assets (and growing). The amount of storage needed for this *AssetCareTM* product was non-existent years ago and not available at a viable cost.\n\nLastly, with the cloud able to store all the data generated 24/7/365, data and analytics can now viably be applied to the entire data set. Traditionally in the late 20th century and early 21st century, organizations were only able to take a sample of the data available and come up with limited conclusions. Now with a place to store all data, companies like mCloud can provide an extremely more accurate analysis on the performance and health of any asset by identifying immensely more accurate anomalies and trends.\n\n**Summary**\n\nmCloud is unlocking the untapped potential of energy intensive assets with AI and analytics, curbing energy waste, maximizing energy production, and getting the most out of critical energy infrastructure. Through mCloud's AI-powered AssetCare\u2122 platform, mCloud offers complete asset management solutions for commercial buildings, renewable energy, healthcare, heavy industry, and connected workers. IoT sensors bring data from connected assets into the cloud, where AI and analytics are applied to maximize their performance.",

        "selftext": "People underestimate Blackberry's QNX operating system as a secure RTOS (Real Time Operating System) based off of microkernel architecture. \ud83d\ude80\n\nFor those who don't know how a RTOS microkernel operates let's explain with minor detail. QNX is one of the most adopted embedded OS's in the world installed in defense systems, power plants and municipal grids, robotics, rockets, rail and 120 million vehicles and rising.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe reason for it's adoption is because of the way a QNX Neutrino RTOS operates compared to what we consider typical everyday operating systems. Most operating systems including IOS, Windows, Linux(Android) and MacOS to name the most apparent run on monolithic designs or hybrid kernels.\ud83d\ude80 \n\nA true microkernel architecture like QNX Neutrino RTOS has full memory protection which is built in meaning that any component can fail and be restarted without corrupting the microkernel or other components in the system. If failure does occur, QNX has the ability to rectify the problem without affecting any other part of the system through process monitoring and recovery components. This feature and ability equals extreme reliability and security and being a microkernel the OS is also modular.\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo what is the big deal your probably asking, Apple, ABC, and Microsoft might enter the space? Not exactly, in fact there has been work in this space from all three companies. Apple opened a facility across from QNX in Kanata and hired the ex creator of the OS Dan Dodge in 2016 to work with Mansfield on the autonomous car project called project Titan. The need for a secure and stable software is where Dodge and his decades of experience from QNX come into play.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe need for a software system as reliable and secure as QNX should be a big flag to the shear potential of QNX. It is clearly a threat and tough competition for even the biggest software companies. Not only this but project Titan continues to be illusive revealing possible setbacks and interference in trying to compete but also Apple lost several top managers from it's Apple Car project causing a potential setback to the launch revealing some attrition in the project.\ud83d\ude80\n\nQNX version (7.1) is years ahead and analysts predict the next competitor is still 5 years away from anything even remotely close.  QNX hypervisor 2.0 is IEC 61508 SIL 3 certified and\u00a0has been recognized as ISO 26262 ASIL D compliant making it the world's first ASIL D safety-certified commercial hypervisor. \ud83d\ude80\n\nAs other's race to catch up BlackBerry has been filing patents on it's system.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe QNX Hypervisor utilizes patented and patent-pending technologies that simplifies how elements are shared on the system. Multiple OS's can use 1 display controller to render content onto multiple displays, aka digital instrument cluster and infotainment.\ud83d\ude80",
