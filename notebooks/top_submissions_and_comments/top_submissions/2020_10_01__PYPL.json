        "selftext": "  \n\nPositions: BABA, TCHEY, BIDU, NIO, TSM, AVGO \n\nThesis: These companies still have a big growth potential and will have success in pretty much every situation I can think of. If the US continues to rip and has a real V-shaped recovery, Asia will rip with it. If the US crashes due to a financial crisis or reemergence of a public health crisis, Asia has pretty much completely reopened, has almost no community spread, and will be a safe haven while the US tries to recover. I don't know if the US is in a  bubble or not, but I think the multi-trillion market cap of the US tech giants limits upside regardless of how well they perform. I'm also convinced the US is about get fucked by a convergence of a second wave and a bad influenza season. Even if they don't the risk of a US economic crisis over the next year is objectively high.  \n\nBABA and TCHEY: Chinese megacaps that are still valued at under $1T and will definitely eventually get there. I wish I could buy options in Tencent. They are basically Facebook, PayPal, Activision Blizzard, and Softbank combined. Alibaba still has potential to expand into the rest of Asia including India if India-China relations improve. Both companies have virtual monopolies in their main areas of business in China and are not subject to anti-trust legislation going forward like their US counterparts. \n\nNIO and BIDU: Have tiny market caps compared to their US counterparts. Google\u2019s market cap is almost 30x higher than Baidu\u2019s and they trade at about the same P/E ratio. I\u2019ve already made a killing on Nio, which is valued at 30B compared to Tesla\u2019s nearly 500B. Chinese EV appetite is also way bigger than that of the US and the recent upgrade of Nio predicts the Chinese EV market to quadruple by 2025. I expect Nio to eventually break into US and European markets. They\u2019ve also successfully implemented battery swapping and won\u2019t need to invest in vertical integration the same way Tesla is in trying to overcome battery charge life obstacles. Both Baidu and Nio are investing heavily in fully autonomous vehicles. \n\nTSM and AVGO: Semiconductors will continue to see growth in the coming years and it\u2019s the only sector that I have confidence in right now. Another bonus if you choose to buy stock, both of these companies have generous dividends and can represent a decent hedge over the growth companies I listed. If the trade war heats up, they are located in Taiwan and Singapore respectively and will be beneficiaries of changes to US/EU supply chain. TSM is producing high quality chips cheaply and will be a big player in data center, autonomous driving, and AI. Broadcom just inked a deal with Apple for wireless components and will be a big 5G beneficiary. \n\nHow I\u2019m playing it: Long-dated calls that are way out of the money in each of these positions. I\u2019m counting on them to all at least double in the next two years. All of my calls are either Jan 2022 or Jan 2023. I also have sold out of all US stocks in my IRA and bought long positions in only in these names. The only one I\u2019m not holding calls in is TCHEY because I use Robinhood and am not aware of any way to buy options in it.",

        "selftext": "Note: saw I have a lot of messages yesterday on my old username, MiltDavis. This is where I've been posting now cuz mods, so message me here.\nI'm not an expert or anything, but I see a lot of people in the Daily Thread comments slanging VXX around, and a lot of weird information out there. Just trying to be helpful, so here ya go:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**The most basic thing to know is that VIX (so VXX and UVXY by extension) is a measurement of market volatility, not SPY performance.**\u00a0 Let's say you buy a bunch of AAPL options of one month expiry at an implied volatility (IV) of 50 and FB at an IV of 20, but you have them ending up the same percentage higher at the strike price of your one month expiry--let's say 5% higher.\u00a0 The logic is that, due to historical and current factors, AAPL is expected to bounce around in much higher and lower swings to reach that 5%--a wilder journey, but the same destination.\u00a0 The volatility of that journey is what VIX represents, on an extrapolated level, for SPY as a whole.\u00a0 Think of it like this--VIX is the measurement of IV for the market as a whole, rather than for an individual equity. Because of this...\n\n**VIX does not have to always directly inverse SPY, but instead just often does\u201480% of the time.** VIX can rise with SPY--or fall with SPY--it's just not as common as inversing SPY.\u00a0 It can also do it's own thing entirely.\u00a0 Certain sectors can be performing one way, and SPY another, and these performances factor into the underlying measurements to prevent a break with SPY due to weighting and a shitload of other factors.\u00a0 SPY can climb rapidly, and volatility can rise with it, because the sharp movement creates just as much variation chaos in the underlyings as a precipitous drop would.\n\n**VIX is represented as an annualized standard deviation number within SPY.**\u00a0 If VIX is 25, for example, it is estimating movement of 25% in price action in SPY over the course of the next year.\u00a0 It was above 50 during the March crash, which, when you think about it in those terms, is nuts.\n\n\u00a0 **VIX is a monthly price estimation based on SPY options premiums.**\u00a0 SPY trades on it's underlyings and is also tradeable in and of itself, whereas VIX is vessel for trading a bundle of spreads, for lack of a better term.\u00a0 This is a mathematical--even theoretical--estimate on future market movement based on how much premium people are willing to pay for S&amp;P options, or in other words, it is an estimate of market volatility based on how much money people are willing to pay for insurance on their stocks.\u00a0\u00a0Equity prices are ONLY as important here inasmuch as they effect the pricing of the equity options. The more people are willing to pay for options, the higher VIX goes.\n\n**VIX is NOT the in-the-moment measurement of the underlying SPY put/call option spread\u2014it is\u00a0forward looking to the monthy expiration**.\u00a0\u00a0In the case of VIX this is a minimum of 23 days and up to 37 days out, with weighting favored toward the one month expiration.\u00a0 The math is crazy and intricate, on some Rainman shit, but the important thing to know is that VIX isn't a prisoner of the moment, but instead a look at the coming one month landscape taking in all factors over that course in time.\n\n*Real life example*: Many people have been expecting VIX to be much higher as we head into an election, but if we think of it in forward-looking, weighted terms, this moment may have passed--at least as far as the election is concerned.\u00a0 VIX is taking into consideration, at the moment,\u00a0 the perceived calmer times beginning toward the end of November after the election.\u00a0 If you go back and look at VIX values about one month prior to the election date, you can see that VIX was at it's peak on October 5th and 6th, reaching appproximately $30.\u00a0 This would correlate with the expected movement weighted one month from that day, or in other words, peak fear a day or two after the election.\n\n**Volatility is volatile, and therefore not a buy and hold: **VIX associates VXX and UVXY are known for making people rich on days like June 11th, or in September, when they suddenly climb 10, 15, 20% in a single day or a two day stretch.\u00a0 Yes, this a large part of it's appeal.\u00a0 But the real reason people get rich is that VIX IV can climb high--fast--because it's price movements are not considered lasting and great fluctuation becomes priced in.\u00a0 IV shoots up on these things like crazy, which means that the value of your VIX options shoots up like crazy.\u00a0 BUT, value also falls like crazy too, and it has intense theta burn (cost appreciation of the asset over time). So, while you are sitting around waiting to make your million dollar play with a VXX monthly you are losing a lot of money in the process.\u00a0 The VIX knows this, and it smells your weakness, and the day after you've dumped it because you've bled 50% it will rocket to new heights.\u00a0 Because of this...\n\n**VIX, VXX, and UVXY are meant as loss strategies and hedges, but not as outright plays.**\u00a0 Unless you are some Burry level TA specialist, or maybe my guy /u/winnning007, and you can pinpoint when certain events are going to happen or the market response within a day or two, you're best to keep a smaller amount as a hedge rather than go all in.\u00a0 The road to bagholding is short and full of terrors with volatility plays. B**UY SPY PUTS INSTEAD IF YOU ARE BEARISH**\n\n**VIX VXX and UVXY\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-**\n\nSo all that is cool, but VIX is a futures instrument and not a daily tradeable ETF/ETN; *enter VXX and UVXY.*\u00a0 To keep it simple, I'm going to lump the two together and just say that UVXY is a more levered version of VXX.\u00a0 So UVXY can climb higher than VXX when it rises, and fall lower than VXX when it falls.\u00a0 For the purposes of this explanation, I'm going to focus on VXX, but bottom line--if you don't really know what you're doing/aren't confident in your volatility move, stick with VXX rather than UVXY.\u00a0 The money is still good, don't be a hero.\n\n**VXX tracks the performance of VIX, but offers different expirations **(weekly ETF settlement dates like Friday/Saturday rather than the Wednesday of monthly futures), and tracks it at about a 50% level.\u00a0 In other words, if the VIX monthly futures have an 8% jump, expect about 4% for VXX monthlies.\u00a0 VXX is also an ETN, not an ETF--this is important because it means that it must have a direct tracking of the VIX unlike a fund which isn't beholden to a certain rate of correlation.\u00a0 In other words, VXX MUST track that ~50% of the VIX for efficacy.\n\nWhat's important here: VIX is the futures estimate bundle, and VXX is not VIX, but it is a\u00a0very reliable tracker of VIX price movements with few notable exceptions.\u00a0 UVXY is kind of like a levered version of VXX, meant to track with higher returns. These two can and do at times move out of sync with VIX due to something called contango.\n\n*If you want to go in depth on the intricacies of their relationship and contango and shit, I won\u2019t do that here, but this is a good resource:* https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/news/2015/02/04/the-messy-relationship-between-vix-and-vxx\n\n**Manipulation**\n\nWhenever VXX doesn't move with SPY, I bitterly joke that it's illegal and manipulated.\u00a0 This wayward movement is actually more due to the natural variance I pointed out earlier, but there is some truth to it.\u00a0 CBOE--the VIX providers--have been sued a few times over the past few years due to alleged manipulation of VIX.\u00a0 Of note, the \"Father of VIX\" as one article called it's creator, was one of the whistleblowers alleging fraud.\u00a0 The case was recently thrown out again, but the accusations speak for themselves.\n\n&gt;\tThe plaintiffs, traders in VIX-based products, filed a lawsuit alleging that certain features of the settlement process made it especially susceptible to manipulation but that Cboe chose not to enforce its rules against manipulation so it could continue to profit from the VIX products. Specifically, the complaint alleged violations of the Exchange Act antifraud provisions and the CEA and brought claims against both Cboe and anonymous \"Doe\" defendants that allegedly manipulated the settlement values for VIX options and futures by manipulating the two-zero-bid rule and employing a process analogous to \"banging the close.\"\n\nSo, ya know, innocent until proven guilty, but there is a lot of info out there to suggest that a lot of people invested in--and involved in the creation of--VIX through CBOE think it's manipulated.\u00a0 That can't be ignored.\n\n**Other tidbits to note:**\nA lot of little things matter with VIX; Quad witching dates, portfolio rebalancing dates, Congressional hearings with the FED, release of beige books, stress tests, and FOMC are all catalysts for VXX/UVXY activity if you're searching for short dated FD plays.\u00a0 Just look at the financial calendar on the FED website or Marketwatch, etc., before you make any moves against volatility. You're one JPOW speech to congress away from the big GUH.\n\n**Positions**: This was meant to be informative more than predictive.\u00a0\n\nThat said, I don't have a phenomenal read on this market--I'm not a TA guy generally, and a lot of the fundamentals are out the window as we approach the election.\u00a0 BUT, I expect anticipation of lame-duck political activity should there be a Blue Wave, PLUS uncertainty around COVID second wave restriction regression, PLUS the unveiling of a variety of coming tax changes in a Biden win, will likely bring higher pricing in option premiums and thus higher VIX.\n\n**UVXY 11/6 20c VXX 10/30 24c VXX 11/6 26c**\n**Earnings I like: NTGR, NOW, PYPL, MSFT, CVNA**\n**General shit I like: LMND, JD, DDOG**\n\n**TLDR: VIX does not always move with SPY, it may be manipulated, it is not meant to be held long term, and is future looking not day-to-day.\u00a0 Trade it thinking of a bigger picture rather than expecting it to react to every daily market event. Never go all in on a monthly, you\u2019ll theta bleed.**\n\nYou can message me and comment and stuff and I\u2019ll get to it.\u00a0\n\nI AM NOT AN EXPERT.\u00a0 A lot of the technical terminology you can probably argue with. This is just my own research and experiences.\u00a0 Do your own research.",

        "selftext": "I like Square as a company and see a lot of people are bullish about it. However, a few things stop me from investing. Be interested to hear thoughts but at the moment I am a Square bear. \n\n**Management**\n\nJack Dorsey is a visionary. I don\u2019t think this is controversial. However, his track record at Twitter is worrying for shareholders. Be it daily active user growth, ambition with acquisitions but ultimately failure to monetise a fantastic platform where you have big corporations, celebrities and even the President reaching out to 200m daily active users for free. With Square, the closed loop business model of businesses and consumers is again a fantastic concept that could break the power of Visa/Mastercard. Execution remains to be seen, of course. \n\n**Competition**\n\nSquare operate in a highly competitive field for consumers and businesses. Let\u2019s take consumers based on Square\u2019s fast-growing Cash App. It offers things a normal bank does like deposits, ATM access, money transfer. If it becomes a fully-fledged bank offering loans, credit; it is competing against the likes of big incumbents (e.g. JP Morgan, Bank of America). Granted they\u2019re dinosaur firms but they already have a huge customer base that are older and, therefore, have more money and deposits. This means it is much easier for them to monetise their customers resulting in high ARPU. Why would these lucrative customers, en-masse, want to uproot their finances to Square when their existing providers will be providing the same service by copying Square, as JP Morgan have done this week? [Link](https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2020/jpmorgan-takes-on-square-and-paypal-at-the-point-of-sale/) \n\nFor businesses, Square\u2019s provides software offering (invoicing, PoS, online store) but face strong competition from the likes of Shopify who are taking a fully integrated service approach to SMEs which allows them to take their business online but also manage all their backend processes, including payments. This is a highly convenient service for entrepreneurs. Shopify already has 6% share of the online retail market. Square also provides hardware products which make it easy for SMEs, in particular, to take payments. However, there is evidence that retail is facing a more permanent shift in the US vs. the rest of the world with 60% less footfall today than a year ago [Link](https://www.spring-board.info/benchmarks/benchmark/daily-footfall). 58% of Square\u2019s GPV is from food/drink, retail and professional services. Square may have good market share but it is a shrinking industry.\n\nAnd as a final piece, competitors in both spaces are generally in very healthy financial shape: Paypal, Shopify, Global Payments, Western Union and big banks are well-capitalised. \n\n**Valuation**\n\nPerhaps you can get over the above with the fact that Square has strong network effects and are able to win customers cheaply. However, in my opinion, Square is priced for perfection. Simply looking at a price/sales metric, it is trading 13x LTM. This is high but maybe relatively reasonable for a fast-growing business. However, 25% of Square\u2019s revenue is accounted by Bitcoin \u201crevenue\u201d. This brings little value to Square (2% gross profit) and even Square themselves discount this revenue in their KPIs because it is \u201cout of their control and not reflective of Square\u2019s performance\u201d. \n\nNow onto profits. It is not fair to be too hard on Square\u2019s profitability. After all, it is in high growth phase and its marketing costs were its highest opex line item at roughly 35% for YTD. However, a cursory look at it is Enterprise Value / EBITDA (forward look to Dec2020), it is 242x. If we give credit for Square\u2019s business plan for a further two years, today\u2019s Enterprise Value over broker consensus forecast EBITDA for 2022, it is still a heady 77x. This is when Square is supposed to have EBITDA of $1bn which is three times more than it is forecast for Dec 2020. Priced to perfection.\n\nIf you compare it to Paypal, it is trading at 39x and 27x EV / EBITDA for Dec 2020 and 2022.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSquare has formidable backers like Ark Invest. I am also not a great believer in \u201cdumb retail\u201d overvaluing a stock for a prolonged period of time. But for reasons above, I am cautious with Square and yet it keeps climbing so please tell me what I am missing\u2026",

        "selftext": "What is your top convictions, where you feel as close to certain as you can about its future. Upside or downside. \n\nMine:\n\n\n1. Square ($SQ) is going to be a $1 trillion dollar company in my lifetime. I am honestly amazed how well this company is positioning themselves. They will move away from small business as they slowly replace the wallet and cash of the US. Similar things have already happened in Sweden, world leader in digital payments. Square is doing the same but in the US, while being the best trusted bitcoin handler and small business backend.\n\n2. Paypal ($PYPL) is slowly moving themselves into e commerce in a way they haven't before. They are light years ahead of anyone in ease of payment, and is rapidly spreading into a global power. If your country has a population, it takes PayPal for online purchases. On top of it, Venmo is the only threat to Squares cash app, so why not own both. \n\n3. Facebook ($FB) is going to be one of the solid heavy weights of the next 10 years, where some people vocally hate on them while they are raking in money hands over fists from the entire world. They have shown an almost disgusting ability of killing completion, and wouldn't be hurt much from a potential breakup (which I personally doubt will happen. Future post). Additionally, they just had a massive blow out success in VR, releasing the quest 2 incredibly successfully. VR will be mainstream and Facebook WILL be the king of it. \n\n:) \n\nAs you may notice from my picks, I am betting on the death of cash. And I really really do. No price targets as I plan holding these forever. My models to suggest overpriced fairly, but I belive their growth will accelerate as new services/monitazationa are released.\n\nWhat do you belive in?",

        "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI recently developed a [bot](https://twitter.com/TradyticsAIbot) that uses AI to analyze options flow and predicts directions for individual option contracts. It also tells you whether you should buy to open or sell to open a contract which is something that's not really available anywhere else. And it's 100% free since it's a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/TradyticsAIbot). Here are some alerts from today that I am keeping an eye on tomorrow and the next few days.\n\nBearish means the price of contract will go down while bullish means the price of contract will go up.\n\n# $PINS\n\nI believe both $PINS and [$SNAP](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-Kw0NE-gbjJn-S7H2b-j6jZ7-1VL7D) are a bit overextended right now and need to dip. One of [SNAP](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-Kw0NE-gbjJn-S7H2b-j6jZ7-1VL7D) alerts today had a gain of 85%. That is further confirmed by this alert. Bearish on CALL mean either Sell to Open the call or Buy to Open a put.\n\n[Track alert at: https:\\/\\/www.tradytics.com\\/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-U6wco-znVFx-RA167-DSU76-cvHSh](https://preview.redd.it/s138kigzbru51.png?width=587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de09683f91d49b720fc53a2db1be3d5e6176a690)\n\n# $SQ\n\nSQ had dipped quite nicely the last few days and it is about to be on a resistance line ([https://i.imgur.com/ow1F4vh.png](https://i.imgur.com/ow1F4vh.png)). This contract seems to have a long expiry and this looks like a good one. Maybe too costly so you can get in on a cheaper one.\n\n[Track alert at: https:\\/\\/www.tradytics.com\\/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-t1xlI-wzasX-Vsip8-sHlJz-eD7fx](https://preview.redd.it/8cb6589ycru51.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1fb92211b9759b788b94db2ced908b0391f07f5)\n\n# $PYPL\n\nPYPL was about to break a good resistance level but failed ([https://i.imgur.com/NG02hoH.png](https://i.imgur.com/NG02hoH.png)). There is another support right below the current price so if we can somehow stay there, this is a good contract. Again, you can go a bit cheaper.\n\n[Track alert at: https:\\/\\/www.tradytics.com\\/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-lmRJF-bA5ZF-h5tE1-1tG13-cWlKf](https://preview.redd.it/v4sf93gddru51.png?width=594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acdca1c06d4f43f92eef21388c1008e41e28e775)\n\nThat's it - I just want to see if there's demand for these daily alerts in the community here.

        "selftext": "With health care systems under intense scrutiny during the pandemic, Vancouver\u2019s Well Health Technologies Corp. has seen massive growth as it invests in digital tools to make care more efficient for clinicians and patients alike.\n\nWell\u2019s share price has risen nearly 350 per cent this year, to $6.98 on the Toronto Stock Exchange at the end of Friday, as the pandemic-dominated period has seen health care practitioners and clinics invest in telehealth and other digital health technologies. What began as a network of yoga studios has turned into a nimble medical-technology company with its sights set on improving how health clinics work.\n\nIn the past five weeks alone, Well has launched an app marketplace for clinic owners to find ways to manage aspects of their business such as online booking and workflow automation; announced a US$14-million controlling investment in the U.S. telehealth company Circle Medical, giving the company access to health care markets in 35 states; closed a $23-million private placement led by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing; and revealed a $70-million bought-deal financing underwritten by Eight Capital and Stifel GMP.\n\nIn an interview, Well\u2019s founder and chief executive Hamed Shahbazi said the company wants to take a long-view approach seeking technology that improves health outcomes. \u201cIt was not too long ago that we didn\u2019t even know we needed to sanitize our operating tools,\" he said. \"Technology is responsibly for our life expectancies increasing. ... We can\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d\n\nTechnology wasn\u2019t really what Mr. Shahbazi had in mind when he first founded the company as a network of yoga studios licensing Deepak Chopra\u2019s eponymous yoga-studio brand in Canada. In 2017, it listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the name Wellness Lifestyles with a reverse takeover. That same year, PayPal Holdings Inc. bought Mr. Shahbazi\u2019s payment-processing company, Tio Networks Corp., for US$304-million \u2013 although PayPal suspended Tio operations several months later after a data breach was found.\n\nMr. Shahbazi first had no intention of running Wellness Lifestyles day to day, but soon became curious about the state of primary care in Canada. Everything he studied about Canadian health care, he said, \u201cseemed to point at all this fragmentation in the system.\u201d\n\nTechnology adoption has been slower here than in other countries. The 2019 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey of Primary Care Physicians, for example, found that a low percentage of Canadian doctors were able to electronically share information with other clinical providers: Just 22 per cent could share patient clinical summaries, for example, versus 93 per cent in Norway.\n\nAlthough Canada\u2019s health care system is public, Mr. Shahbazi realized its many privately owned medical clinics could benefit from technology sold at scale \u2013 saving their already busy physicians from having to deal with issues such as network security on their own. With Tio sold, Mr. Shahbazi became Wellness Lifestyles\u2019 CEO in May, 2018. The company rebranded as Well Health Technologies two months later, refocusing on primary care.\n\nMr. Shahbazi is a consolidator at heart and looked up to Canadian software acquisition powerhouses such as Constellation Software Inc. and Enghouse Systems Ltd. as he built up Tio in the previous decade. He\u2019s building Well the same way.\n\nThe company now has a network of 20 physical clinics in British Columbia; a new subsidiary to expand its \u201callied health\u201d holdings, such as sleep, mental-health and physiotherapy clinics; and a network of digital services that the company says serves more than 2,000 clinics and more than 10,000 physicians, largely in B.C. and Ontario. The company now has 266 employees on top of its health care practitioners, who work as independent contractors.\n\nWell\u2019s growing cache of software and partnerships is largely based off of the McMaster University-founded Open Source Clinical Application and Resource (OSCAR) system for electronic medical records. Mr. Shahbazi said he hopes that centralizing much of this software in Well\u2019s new app marketplace, called apps.health, will encourage more medical clinics to invest in digitization.\n\nLaurentian Bank Securities analyst Nick Agostino said the company\u2019s acquisition-heavy approach was wise. \u201cHaving both physical and virtual clinics makes a lot of sense to grab hold of patients and capture recurring revenue,\" he said.\n\nIn Canada, Well\u2019s strategy most closely competes with blended virtual-physical health care investments by legacy companies such as Loblaw Cos. Ltd. and the growing health wing of Telus Corp., Mr. Agostino said.\n\nWell jumped from the Venture Exchange to the TSX this past January, and its strategy has since pushed its market capitalization to more than $1-billion \u2013 more than triple the value of Tio when it was sold to PayPal.\n\nAnalyst Doug Taylor of Canaccord Genuity raised his price target for Well to $8 from $6 last week as the company announced its app marketplace at a moment when investors are already interested in health care technology. \u201cWell stands to benefit from streamlined cross-selling of its growing stable of proprietary health care technology assets and revenue sharing from third-party software,\u201d he wrote in a research note.\n\nThe pandemic-driven shift to digital pushed Well\u2019s revenue for the quarter ending June 30 to $10.6-million, up 43 per cent from the year prior. Digital services accounted for $2.3-million of that \u2013 a 1,212-per-cent increase from the year earlier, owing to pandemic adoption and Well\u2019s acquisition spree.\n\nhttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-well-health-ceo-sees-canadas-health-clinic-market-as-ripe-for/",

        "selftext": "I think there is a big way to make consistent money similar to trade deals and corona virus hype that people are not exploiting yet.\n\nEverytime stimulus news is brought up, payment providers rally. You can see this inPaypal, Visa, and Square right now.\n\nThis is partially lead to SQ reaching all time highs and Paypal and Visa to be close as well. Even though in contact payments from SQ is down, they have converted successfully via cashapp to online movements.\n\nLooking at some flow, look at $SQ\u2019s run on Friday:\nhttps://gyazo.com/1eb2621dfb91c6e1e72b6380464e48cf\n\nThis is despite the news of a wavering stimulus. In fact, it looks like option flow is heading that way on [these payment providers](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1311683758735597569) with big movements happening earlier this month in anticipation of the stimulus.\n\nPaypal and Visa are looking a little beat up in comparison, but I think the flow will hit them too. I suspect Monday/Tuesday we get a lot of talk about the stimulus after the weekend and Trump\u2019s Friday offers. Plus pressure from the populace to make a deal happen.\n\nFor example, Trump may go bigger than [a 2.2 trillion COVID stimulus](https://twitter.com/samstein/status/1315306191178825735).\n\nAs result, some positions I have: PYPL $202 call 10/30 and SQ $220 call 10/23, and I am bullish on all payment companies as a result.

I work for a university and make good money, and over the acedemic breaks over the summer I joined Etsy to sell some homemade good, and it did extraordinarily well. Now that I have a good positive cash flow, I want to invest and try to grow my money. I don't know much about the stock market, except that March was a good time to buy in lol. I don't know what calls are, I looked at r/wallstreetbets and found too much shit posting, joined in the GME hype and didn't sell out this morning so I ended up losing money on it, but not much at least. I also didn't know that the markets were closed on Saturday. Are they closed Sunday too? Do stocks continue to move during closed times or do they remain stagnant?\n\nTo the point. I'm looking at ETSY, Microsoft, PayPal, shopify, GE. They seem to be doing good, especially etsy which went up like $100 this year. But I don't know what good beginners stocks would be. I already bought into etsy with 1 share and earned a few bucks. But just because they are doing really good at this time, does it seem like a good idea to buy in? Especially during this pandemic with no stimulus anytime soon (I'm in the US), I'm afraid of the stocks falling again, but not too worried, sound like if they fall just buy in maybe?\n\nWhat are good strategies to find out what stocks are best? Do I follow certain companies closely to find out what moves they will make? How do I know if what they will do is going to be beneficial?

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 21, 2020**\n\nStocks traded choppily today as market participants closely monitor development in Washington surrounding stimulus. Though Pelosi\u2019s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is \u201coptimistic\u201d about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.\n\nDespite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell\u2019s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump\u2019s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.\n\nIn other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans\u2019 attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in \u201call-or-nothing obstruction\u201d as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she \u201chas a prospect for an agreement\u201d with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. \u201cThere will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent \u2014 my goal \u2014 or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.\u201d It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Snapchat (SNAP) rocketed up today after posting better than expected quarterly earnings report.

        "selftext": "Just curious on a 2nd or 3rd opinion on a few stocks I've been eye balling. Would graciously appreciate someone with maybe some more knowledge opinion.\n\nWould love any insight you guys have on these tickers. Thanks again any constructive thoughts are GREATLY appreciated.  \n\n$NEE - Amazing Long term growth. Attempting to buyout other companies. Dividend has been rapidly increasing. Is the growth potentially done or near done?\n\n$AVGO - Amazing long term growth. Dividend has been RAPIDLY increasing. Can't imagine Broadcom getting smaller but just like NEE how much more growth is there still?\n\n$NVDA - INSANE long term growth. Big player in the market. Doubtful they are going anywhere in the future\n Trash dividend. And once again they have grown so much idk how much more they are likely to grow.\n\n$PYPL - Amazing long term growth. PayPal rumored to be moving into Ecommerence. Huge player for electronic transactions. I forsee them continuing to grow into the future.. No dividend \n\n$PENN - Amazing long term growth. Analysis put a $100 PT. I dont see gambling EVER going anywhere in the future. \n\n$COST - Decent long term growth. I feel like Costco is going to continue to grow as a super giant into the future. Dividend is slightly lacking. \n\n$U - New IPO. Unity is a huge player in the mobile app industry. If expect growth with them branching out. Not to mention I dont see mobile app using another company to this degree.\n\n$T - Mainly for the dividend. 10yr growth is a mere 2% on average. I feel like HBO MAX and the casual dividend increase will make up for this long term. \n\n$JPM - Decent long term growth. Bad PR recently but I dont see that holding it back. Dividend is pretty prime and the banking sector will grow once interest rates are settled. \n\n$CRSR - New IPO.HUGE player in the ESports community. Doesn't seem to be slowing down at all. Big on Twitch.tv with sponsorships and the streaming industry. Esport is a rapidly growing industry. Sadly no dividend as of now. \n\n$KIRK - There site is a overstock wayfair look alike. In the future I can see them rapidly growing just as those did. Even to some degree the growth potential would be massive.\n\n$JMIA - Essentially the amazon of Europe/Africa. Branching out into the African market. The growth on this seems like it could be exponential.\n\n$AGO - New IPO. Sells camping gear as well as GUNS and AMMO. Comparing it to camping world [$CWH] seems like there's alot of potential growth in the market.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 21, 2020**\n\nStocks traded choppily today as market participants closely monitor development in Washington surrounding stimulus. Though Pelosi\u2019s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is \u201coptimistic\u201d about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.\n\nDespite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose.

Things like retro video games, Pokemon cards, etc seem to have a lot of value for those who want to relive their youth. So as someone in their 30s, looking 10-20 years down the road I can look at my kids and current trends to figure out what might be valuable in the future. \n\nI see a few challenges with this though, first who knows what will be popular just like who knows what stock will be worth 100x more 10-20 years from now. Second I think there is a lot more knowledge and availability than their used to be. Back in the 80s/90s there was no internet, eBay, PayPal, etc. As a result people just sold stuff at garage sales, threw away or didn't keep in good condition. I think the market in the future will have more inventory making for less profitable items.\n\nThat being said, what would you say are items that might be worth money in the future? Sealed PS4, Switch games, current generation Pokemon, trading cards?",

        "selftext": " ***PayPal (Nasdaq: PYPL) Q3 Earnings Play***\n\nPayPal earnings are coming up in october and the company has a lot of potential as they already crushed Q2 earnings.\n\n**General facts**\n\n* 73% YTD growth\n* $225B Market Cap\n* 2019 Revenue: $17.772B\n\nThe stock went down in [september](https://i.imgur.com/FHA4reY.png) and is now on for a earnings [run-up](https://i.imgur.com/uJ0M4QX.png). PayPal is currently sitting around $15 below its ATH. There is probably no need to explain what PayPal is or what it does.\n\nTotal Payment Volume (TPV)\n\n\"Total  Payment Volume or \"TPV\" is the value of payments, net of payment  reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform,  excluding transactions processed through our gateway products.\"\n\n\\--&gt; *Fees on money transactions*\n\nThat means that PayPal makes more money when more transactions are being made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n1iw3tt13dr51.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c5711eda5ad1f0422692e74985c16820a43f0fe\n\n**Free Cashflow (FCF)**\n\n$2.19B in Q2 with an increase 112% y/y\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tr61wt23dr51.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f3f312a637670c54ebbd70fb223f49b60e5d4fc\n\n\\--&gt;  Now you are probably asking yourself what all those fucking images and  words mean. It\u00b4s simple. PayPal has seen a lot of new users due to the  pandemic and everyone ordering their shit from Jeff Bezos. We are still  in a pandemic and the second wave is about to come. This means that more  and more people are going to use services like PayPal and as I stated  above; more users means more transactions which means more money for PayPal. So more tendies for us.

TPV will rise due to more and more people using PayPal due to the Pandemic. This will lead the FCF to rise as well and this makes stonks go up for us to make some tendies.\n\n**New Customers**\n\nPayPal has seen a rise in new accounts of 21.3 million in Q2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6xkjfind3dr51.png?width=414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1c34c732b58eb2c3daa5581dffaa5d0a5ba565b\n\n**So how are we making tendies on the upcoming earnings?**\n\nPayPal is expecting \"strong momentum from Q2 to continue into Q3\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1slqhmre3dr51.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9fa90bc61c64cebfb38f1b4d565bd4ab7172632\n\n*They will be crushing earnings* [*again*](https://i.imgur.com/iBhZqrE.png) *like they did in Q2 (actual Growth: 22% and 25%)*\n\nAnalysts have set a *price target around $220.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img n0vw56pf3dr51...*\n\n**Recent News**\n\n\"PayPal and Mastercard will continue the global expansion of its PayPal Business Debit Mastercard.\" [Source](https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/news/paypal-business-debit-mastercard-expands-european-market-reach/)\n\nThey also announced to support black communities and businesses.

        "selftext": "China might be the best hedge for U.S. stocks.\n\nKey Chinese indexes and stocks are outperforming their U.S. counterparts, and investor sentiment suggests that Asia might even emerge as an economic haven, as America and Europe are still struggling with the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares exchange-traded fund (ticker: ASHR), a proxy for mainland China\u2019s stocks, is up 18% this year, compared with 6% for the S&amp;P 500 index.\n\nShares of Alibaba Group Holding (BABA), one of China\u2019s most important companies, are up 36% this year. Alibaba, given its broad scope, might just help investors insulate their portfolios at a time of unusual duress in U.S. history\u2014acting in the role once occupied by fixed income when it was an effective offset to equity weakness.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump surprisingly ended stimulus negotiations with a Tuesday tweet, U.S. stocks sank. Many Chinese stocks, notably Alibaba, held up.\n\nHedging U.S. portfolios with Chinese stocks, particularly Alibaba, might seem outlandish, but Susquehanna Investment Group, a top options-trading firm that seeks out noncorrelated U.S. equity investments, has significant China exposure. The secretive trading company owns a huge piece of ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, that could be worth more than $15 billion. The investment would probably dwarf anything the firm\u2019s partners have ever realized in a long history of extraordinary success.\n\nAlibaba will never protect a portfolio the way traditional hedges, such as S&amp;P 500 options, do, but Alibaba\u2019s options premiums and stock price aren\u2019t as distorted ahead of the bizarre U.S. presidential election. Trading volumes on the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, are stunningly anemic during the oddest trading year since the 2008-09 financial crisis, suggesting that investors have little faith that VIX derivatives will work as expected.\n\nBut adding China exposure, especially Alibaba, to a portfolio offers hedging through diversification.\n\nAlibaba will hold its annual Singles Day event on Nov. 11. For 24 hours, Alibaba will host an online sale and celebration that makes Amazon.com\u2019s (AMZN) Prime Day seem like a Rotary Club luncheon. The company will probably report quarterly earnings in early November.\n\nIn 2019, Singles Day sales totaled $38 billion, up from $31 billion in the previous year. This year\u2019s event will indicate how much Asian consumers have recovered from the coronavirus. Powerful sales results will intrigue investors who are worried about the sclerotic U.S. and European economies and concerned about political mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith Alibaba\u2019s stock at $296.50, investors can sell Alibaba\u2019s November $295 put for $18.20 and buy Alibaba\u2019s November $300 call for $17.60. The trade generates a credit of 60 cents. If Alibaba\u2019s stock is at $310 at expiration, the call is worth $10. Should the stock price be below the put strike price at expiration, investors are obligated to buy the stock at the strike price, or to cover the put at a higher prices.\n\nDuring the past 52 weeks, Alibaba\u2019s stock has ranged from $161.68 to $299. Shares are up 80% over the past year.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s attraction extends beyond hedging and diversification. The stock monetizes the rise of Asia\u2019s middle class, which is one of the world\u2019s greatest economic trends. Alibaba\u2019s scope is so broad that anyone who buys the stock essentially gets the Asian equivalent of a portfolio of companies similar to eBay (EBAY), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Goldman Sachs Group (GS), FedEx (FDX), United Parcel Service (UPS), and the entertainment studios.\n\nReports indicate that China\u2019s economy is already recovering from the coronavirus. Goldman has even advised clients that Asia is well positioned compared with other areas because it has contained the virus. The irony is unpleasantly rich.",

United Airlines (UAL 34.25, -1.36, -3.8%) reported worse-than-expected results, which kept the airline stocks grounded today. \n* Looking ahead to Friday, investors will receive Retail Sales for September, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for September, the preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for October, Business Inventories for August, and Net Long-term TIC Flows for August.  \n## Index Summary\n &lt;b&gt;S&amp;P 500 :&lt;/b&gt; (-0.12%); &lt;b&gt;NasDaq : &lt;/b&gt;(-0.71%); \\\n&lt;b&gt;Russell 2000 :&lt;/b&gt;(+1.03%); &lt;b&gt;Dow :&lt;/b&gt;(-0.03%); \\\n&lt;b&gt;Vix :&lt;/b&gt;26.4 (+2.16%); [+2.31%]; {-2.39%} \n## Sectors Summary \n_Three highest sectors for today were -_ \n&lt;b&gt;Energy: &lt;/b&gt;(+1.21%); &lt;b&gt;Financials: &lt;/b&gt;(+0.77%); &lt;b&gt;Real Estate: &lt;/b&gt;(+0.47%) \\\n_Three lowest sectors for today were -_\n &lt;b&gt;Communication Services: &lt;/b&gt;(-0.77%); &lt;b&gt;Health Care: &lt;/b&gt;(-0.73%); &lt;b&gt;Information Technology: &lt;/b&gt;(-0.45%) \n## Commodities/Futures \n(1-day %), [5-day %], {10-day %} \\\n_**Currency -**_ \\\n&lt;b&gt;USD Index :&lt;/b&gt;93.366 (+0.51%); [+0.8%]; {+0.11%}\\\n &lt;b&gt;BC :&lt;/b&gt;11410 (+1.84%); [-0.09%]; {+9.31%} \\\n_**Precious Metals -**_\\\n&lt;b&gt;Gold :&lt;/b&gt;1907.3 (+0.29%); [-0.5%]; {+0.62%}  &lt;b&gt;Silver :&lt;/b&gt;24.395 (+0.14%); [-3.17%]; {+2.35%}\\\n _**Farming -**_ \\\n&lt;b&gt;Soybeans :&lt;/b&gt;1056.25 (+0.52%); [+2.71%]; {+1.7%}  \n&lt;b&gt;Corn :&lt;/b&gt;396.5 (+1.83%); [+3.79%]; {+4.87%} \\\n&lt;b&gt;Coffee :&lt;/b&gt;109.6 (+0.05%); [+0.46%]; {+1.86%} \\\n_**Industrials -**_ \\\n&lt;b&gt;Crude :&lt;/b&gt;41.04 (-0.29%); [+3.78%]; {+0.61%} \\\n&lt;b&gt;Nat Gas :&lt;/b&gt;2.636 (+5.5%); [-3.47%]; {+10.36%} \\\n&lt;b&gt;Copper :&lt;/b&gt;3.0505 (+1.13%); [+0.78%]; {+4.03%} \n## Dark Pool Summary - \nHighest Dark Pool buys by rank -\\\n            1.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there\u2019s a will to get something done.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n&gt; But he said even if there\u2019s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cI actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,\u201d said Keon.\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&amp;P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cQ2 reporting season saw S&amp;P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n&gt; The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&amp;P 500  down about 10%. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,\u201d they noted.\n*****\n&gt; The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there\u2019s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think from the market\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are many moving parts here, and they\u2019re all moving in different directions,\u201d said Block. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. \u201cI think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that\u2019s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n&gt; In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n&gt; Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n&gt; Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&amp;P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n&gt; As shown, the average stock in the broad S&amp;P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n&gt; The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n&gt; If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&amp;P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are 46 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n&gt; General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # News High for Net New Highs\n\n&gt; Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&amp;P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n&gt; As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&amp;P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Breadth Booming\n\n&gt; One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&amp;P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n&gt; While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n&gt; With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&amp;P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n&gt; October\u2019s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n&gt; With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 8, 2020**\n\nStocks rose again today, extending yesterday\u2019s frankly unexpected gains, with the major benchmarks opening at their highest levels in about a month. Market participants digested a new round of jobless claims, dimming hopes of stimulus, even for stand-alone bills, and progress in Covid-19 therapeutics following Pres. Trump\u2019s discharge from the hospital.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.54% up. The S&amp;P (SPY) led the day, up 0.85% and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.48% up. \n\nToday, the Labor Department released their weekly jobless claims report. There were 840,000 additional first-time jobless claims this week, slightly above the 820,000 prediction of analysts. While 840,000 is the lowest level since March, jobless claims have stagnated the past month, a sign of slowing economic recovery. Continuing claims, which are the number of people who have already filed an initial claim and who have experienced a week of unemployment and then filed a continued claim to claim benefits for that week of unemployment, fell below 11 million, dropping almost 1 million compared to the week before. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \u201cThe decline in continuing claims is welcome, but initial claims offer a better read on the real-time state of the labor market, and the downward trend has stalled, more or less.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNBC, there are still 25.5 million workers claiming some form of unemployment benefits, according to totals through Sept. 19. More than half that total, or about 13.4 million, comes from those collecting under pandemic-related programs set up for those who normally wouldn\u2019t be eligible, showing the toll the pandemic has put on the labor market. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi further curbed expectations that any form of stimulus will be unleashed before the November election. Today, in response to a bill designed to provide relief to the airline industry, Pelosi said, \u201cThere is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill.\u201d In other words, she opposes passing smaller, stand-alone stimulus bills in the absence of more comprehensive measures. Yesterday, after calling for his representatives to stop negotiations for overarching stimulus, Pres. Trump signaled he would support a smaller, targeted bill. In response to Trump\u2019s recent tweets about stimulus, Ed Mills, policy analyst at Raymond James said, \u201cIt\u2019s been the question of the day, as to why we got the tweets we got over the last 24 hours, the market reaction we got into \\[Tuesday\u2019s\\] close, and then the rally.\u201d Needless to say, the current market is hyper-responsive to the comments of Trump and other top officials.\n\nShares of Regeneron (REGN) jumped after the drugmaker said it had submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization of its Covid-19 antibody treatment, which had been taken by President Donald Trump after his Covid-19 diagnosis. In a video on Twitter today, Pres. Trump openly endorsed the move saying \u201cI took this medicine \\[during his stay at Walter Reed Hospital\\] and it was incredible.\u201d\n\nIn other nice news, the World Trade Organization (WTO) announced that South Korea\u2019s trade minister and the former Nigerian finance minister are the two finalists in the race to become the next director-general. This is the first time a woman will occupy the position of top leader in this organization. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Covid Relief pushes US deficit to a record $3.1T\n* AMD announced new desktop processors today that the company said will deliver significant improvements in gaming performance. The Ryzen 9 5950X chip delivers what the company described as the \u201chighest single-thread performance of any desktop gaming processor.\u201d\n* Gamestop (GME) announced that it has entered into a multi-year strategic partnership agreement with Microsoft (MSFT) to further advance its strategy to expand its physical and digital video game offerings, as well as enhance the Company\u2019s retail technology infrastructure. GME rocketed up 20% on the announcement.\n* Morgan Stanley (MS) said it is buying fund manager Eaton Vance (EV) Corp. for $7 billion, continuing the Wall Street firm's shift toward safer businesses like money management. The deal comes just days after Morgan Stanley completed its $11 billion takeover of E\\*Trade\n* Weed stocks got a big boost today afet Vice Presidential Candidate Kamala Harris said in yesterday\u2019s debate that the Biden administration would federally decriminalize marijuana. TLRY up 17.5%, CGC up 13%, ACB up 11%, APHA up 10%, CRON 9.6%, and CURLF up 10.5% to name a few of the most popular ones.\n* Square (SQ) bought 4,709 bitcoins (around $50M). The company said \"Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment and provides a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system\"\n* ROKU had a target raised by Needham from $190 to $255.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there\u2019s a will to get something done.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n&gt; But he said even if there\u2019s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cI actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,\u201d said Keon.\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&amp;P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cQ2 reporting season saw S&amp;P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n&gt; The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&amp;P 500  down about 10%. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,\u201d they noted.\n*****\n&gt; The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there\u2019s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think from the market\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are many moving parts here, and they\u2019re all moving in different directions,\u201d said Block. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. \u201cI think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that\u2019s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n&gt; In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n&gt; Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n&gt; Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&amp;P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n&gt; As shown, the average stock in the broad S&amp;P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n&gt; The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n&gt; If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&amp;P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are 46 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n&gt; General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # News High for Net New Highs\n\n&gt; Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&amp;P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n&gt; As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&amp;P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Breadth Booming\n\n&gt; One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&amp;P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n&gt; While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n&gt; With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&amp;P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n&gt; October\u2019s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n&gt; With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9deab1b6431375946cf0104830334e3a/1b58acd0d015098f-cf/s500x750/1a07b8cea97519bcce57adae974614a0e426effb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 9th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw7sXu8pcPw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IIowf1B.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2lSi1kT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Wj80iaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZY9TwgO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5LizPLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oIstn4O.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKfmmCC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q3isONG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Swqo1ow.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

I am 20, relatively risk-tolerant, and I am looking to invest a few thousand dollars to start. I plan to hold for at least 5 years. Are there any stocks in this list that seem particularly interesting to you? As a young person, Paypal (and Venmo which it owns) seems to have become a bit of a staple in my generation's life. I am seeing more and more people get Venmo cards as people seem to be putting off credit cards as there is already enough debt to worry about when it comes to the cost of college. Anyway, I would love to know your thoughts on them! \n\n1. PYPL ------&gt;\n2. SPGI ------ &gt;\n3. NVDA -----&gt;\n4. AVGO -----&gt;\n5. ABBV ------&gt;\n6. NKE -------&gt;",

        "selftext": "Initiative Q is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of payment cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot.

You can see this inPaypal, Visa, and Square right now.\n\nThis is partially lead to SQ reaching all time highs and Paypal and Visa to be close as well. Even though in contact payments from SQ is down, they have converted successfully via cashapp to online movements.\n\nLooking at some flow, look at $SQ\u2019s run on Friday:\nhttps://gyazo.com/1eb2621dfb91c6e1e72b6380464e48cf\n\nThis is despite the news of a wavering stimulus. In fact, it looks like option flow is heading that way on [these payment providers](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1311683758735597569) with big movements happening earlier this month in anticipation of the stimulus.\n\nPaypal and Visa are looking a little beat up in comparison, but I think the flow will hit them too. I suspect Monday/Tuesday we get a lot of talk about the stimulus after the weekend and Trump\u2019s Friday offers. Plus pressure from the populace to make a deal happen.\n\nI am bullish on all payment companies as a result. What do you guys think?",

        "selftext": "LONDON \u2014 PayPal says it\u2019s launching a \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d service in the U.K. that lets shoppers finance their purchases over three interest-free monthly instalments.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant is perhaps better known for its online payment tools, but it\u2019s been branching out into credit in the years since it acquired lending platform Bill Me Later.\n\nNow, the company is taking on the likes of Sweden\u2019s Klarna and Australia\u2019s Afterpay, whose point-of-sale loans have increased in popularity recently. It rolled out its \u201cPay in 4\u201d product in the U.S. just last month and is now following up with a separate offering for the U.K. called \u201cPay in 3.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over last 6 months or so is a significant rise in the shift from physical to digital transactions across the whole of the U.K. retail base,\u201d Rob Harper, PayPal\u2019s U.K. director of enterprise accounts, told CNBC in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also seen the rise of buy now, pay later solutions in the market; brands like Klarna, but also smaller brands that are entering into the market that are not as recognizable as PayPal.\u201d\n\nEurope\u2019s Top Fintech Unicorn: Klarna CEO on $10.6 billion valuation, fundraising mega-round\nPayPal is betting that brand recognition will give it an edge over competing services like Klarna, Clearpay and Laybuy. The company has grown customer accounts by 300% year-on-year in the second quarter and now has more than 24 million active users in the U.K., dwarfing Klarna\u2019s almost 10 million customers in the country.\n\nIn the U.K., PayPal\u2019s new product will offer three-month instalment plans for purchases of between \u00a345 and \u00a32,000. It\u2019s signed up a number of British retailers to offer the service, including Crew Clothing, French Connection, Robert Dyas and Ryman.\n\nHarper said the \u201cPay in 3\u201d option was chosen as Brits get paid monthly, as opposed to Americans who usually get their paychecks once a fortnight. He added that PayPal was a \u201cresponsible lender\u201d and would run \u201caffordability checks\u201d on transactions.\n\nThe move comes amid calls to regulate the fast-growing \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d sector, with some critics concerned it could lead younger shoppers into a debt trap. But PayPal, Klarna and other such firms claim they have sufficient safeguards in place to prevent overspending.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/paypal-takes-aim-at-klarna-with-pay-in-3-service-for-uk-shoppers-.html)",

        "selftext": "Intel is the absolute biggest joke of a semiconductor company I have ever seen.  \nI mean it, this company is a complete tar-pit you dumbass fucktards.  \nLets take inventory of what that dip-shit of a CEO, Bob Swan is sitting on.  \nIntel's core business of semiconductor fabrication is effectively dead.  \nTheir competitor TSMC entered in risk production phase for their 5nm   \nprocess in Q3 2019 \\[1\\]. They are entering 3nm risk production in 2021.  \n\\[2\\]. Those sorry shit eating cucks at intel have stated their 7nm process may  \nbe delayed until 2023 \\[3\\]. 2023? Are fucking serious right now Bob Swan? AND you  \nwont bring a 10nm desktop CPU to market until Q2 2021 while it was already 4 years late?  \nYour last earnings call was a fucking joke bobby boy. You tried to play it off like it was  \nall under control. So you went begging to TSMC to let you eat the cum from their sloppy anal  \nseconds. They made fun of you bobby. They even admitted that you're not shit and they are \"rescuing\" you and they  \n\"will not place extra effort to handle the CPU giant's orders\" \\[4\\]. You're fucking nothing.  \nFrom \"CPU giant\" to this?  \nTSM personally has each engineers cock massaged by a Taiwanese fuck-toy every morning before work.  \nTSM has the backing of the american government \\[7\\]. Yeah, a TAIWANESE chip fab is being backed and NOT  \nYOU. What the fuck do you offer bobby? A place so toxic to work that you can;'t even  \nfind a space nice enough keep Jim Keller safe\\[5\\]? Go fuck yourself, AMD is already on 7nm \\[4\\] and Lisa Su  \nis have her raging cock injected with even more erection enhancers AS WE SPEAK YOU FUCKING PISS DRINKER.  \nKeep buying Intel stock bobby \\[8\\]. Buy another 8,000 shares at $50. Your terrible excuse for an earnings call sent the stock  \nall the way down to the $40s immediately loosing you money. And guess what? I bought put options  \nat 11:46 AM today. Right before the dip. I have already broke even. I'm going to make  \nmoney of you losing money because a complete idiot and I know more about this business than you. Its so  \nfucking obvious how fucked you are swanny. You might as well stop fabbing silicone wafers and  \nfab a silicone butt for you to fuck during the next earnings call as that would be infinitely more valuable  \nthan whatever you could possible have prepared. What are you going to do, delay AGAIN? Or maybe  \nyou can get another one of your marketing goons to tell everyone on the call how great AMD is \\[9\\].  \nBuy Intel PUTS now and gather round to watch it burn.  \n\n\nINTL 53.5 PUT  \nReferences:  \n\\[1\\] https://www.extremetech.com/computing/289157-tsmc-completes-5nm-node-design-node-in-risk-production  \n\\[2\\] https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/07/19/tsmc-3nm-risk-production-in-2021-paves-the-way-to-2020-mass-production  \n\\[3\\] https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-says-first-10nm-desktop-cpus-land-in-second-half-of-2021  \n\\[4\\] https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-tsmc-not-long-term/  \n\\[5\\] https://www.anandtech.com/show/15846/jim-keller-resigns-from-intel-effective-immediately  \n\\[6\\] https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2020/07/intels-chief-engineer-out-amid-manufacturing-crisis.html  \n\\[7\\] https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/09/taiwan-semiconductor-secures-government-aid-for-us.aspx  \n\\[8\\] https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hznvk1/intel\\_ceo\\_bob\\_swan\\_just\\_bought\\_8000\\_shares\\_at/  \n\\[9\\] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFHBgb9SY1Y&amp;ab\\_channel=GamersNexus",

        "selftext": "This one analyst on Youtube is consistently exposing financial fiascos of bad companies like Ford, Nikola and Ignite.\n\nHe made a ton of videos about Dan Bilzerian\\`s CBD company Ignite and how they are on the brink of bankruptcy, but his [most recent one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okulbY-S6Ag) explains it the best in my opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Q1 financial results showed that the company was losing multiple times the amount of money that they make in revenue to fund the CEOs personal lifestyle (illegally) and their cash reserves were going to have burned through all their assets earlier this year.\n\n\\- Their Q2 financial results would have exposed all of that, which is why they have stated they would delay its publication \"due to corona\" til september 15th (shocker: it's still not here today).\n\n\\- Revenue and profit margins were so terribly terribly bad to begin with that there is NO WAY they could have turned the tide and avoid bankruptcy.\n\n\\- Just like his convicted felon of a father, Dan Bilzerian (CEO) acquired his armenian citizenship and is fleeing the country after committing financial fraud in order to avoid lawsuits and prison.\n\n\\- On october 2nd their exclusive product distributors in canada cut their business relationship with the company. They terminated the contract which can be due to one of two reasons: 1 - They don't get paid or 2 - The product does not sell which means Ignite doesn't have any money (but we already know that).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo sum it all up:\n\nIgnite is completely out of assets and massively in debt,  business partners recently cut ties with them and they are hiding their Q2 results that would expose all of that have been overdue for months now. To avoid the wave of lawsuits this whole disaster comes with the CEO fled to Armenia and is going to watch the collapse of his country via a twitter hashtag.\n\nThis is the easiest short in a long time.",

        "selftext": "So everyone I got into GME on Thursday with 10/30 12.5c I bought at 1.6 and was up 120% Friday midday but like a degen I held. They are currently 1.63 so im not really in any pain besides unrealized gains guh. \n\nThe arguments against GME :\n\n1. They are just buying Microsoft tablets.\n\nNot true they are entering a multi year strategic partnership which allows them to get some royalties when customers sign up for Xbox live (which will be free for 2 years when customers buy from them.. worth af). Also Microsoft closed all their stores so they are positioned from a customer access and strategic physical standpoint. \n\n2. Hurr durr all games are online no need for physical store. \n\nAutist, have you tried to download cod on your Xbox? Most people buy the cheap consoles with the least amount of space. Cod literally takes up a third of my memory. Same with gta v and other big games like Skyrim. You can only store so many games. \n\nPs5 just said 80-90% of games are going to be backwards compatible meaning discs and pre owned games will still be important and a physical marketplace will continue to exist. \n\n(Hurr durr cloud gaming will take over) \u2014&gt; agreed but google stadia is at early adoption stage and Jedi for Microsoft won\u2019t be viable until a few years. \n\nAlso nerds buy their fanboy shit from stores, and GameStop is the strongest nerd merch store nationally. \n\n\nIf anyone has any other reasons why calls won\u2019t be printing let me know if not shut the fuck up and buy the dip f*******\n\nThank me later or now with platinum I\u2019m trying to give edgy posts some stickers or shit.",

The slide was leaked and confirmed by [videocardz.com](https://videocardz.com) which is a very authentic source for tech news.

Even if the cards are neck in neck AMD will be able to paint the 6000 series cards as better due to minor discrepancies.\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\t5,120\t1,500\t16GB GDDR6\t512\t256-bit\t300  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\t3,840\t1,500\t12GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t200  \n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6700 XT\t2,560\t1,500\t6GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t150  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0zjsju2clq51.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14551f974837dfc21662c24da268d5284287d169\n\n  \n\\#3\n\n**NVIDIA 3rd Party Card Catastrophe**\n\n*(this section is from my previous post)*\n\nSo most GPUs are made by a 3rd party. AMD and NVIDIA make the actual \"brain\" of the GPU but 3rd party partners add onto it for better performance (very basic explanation). Don't ask me why this is, it is just mainly because of logistical reasons.\n\nBut that is not the point, the point is that the great majority of GPUs are third-party cards meaning that they get to change around the design of the PCB. The issue here is that some of these third-party partners cheaped out on little capacitors.\n\nBy cheapening out it is leading to bad power delivery. The only way to fix this rn is to downclock the card which the normal person doesn't know how to do and doesn't expect is necessary when they are buying a 500$+ piece of hardware.\n\nI feel like if there is a mass callback that will be bad PR. NVIDIA could always release drivers that make the cards run below their listed spec but i'm not sure if people will really want that even if the performance loss is marginal.\n\nEVGA already confirmed the suspicions that these cards were crashing because of capacitor issues. It may be different for other companies but at least for EVGA this is what they are saying currently.\n\n**But why does this matter??**\n\nPeople who were looking to pick up a next-gen GPU right away are now hesitant and will wait for AMDS offerings. The people who did return their GPUs will also possibly wait. Faulty cards will most likely get a down clock which will make Big Navi look better. It supposedly already is better and this 3-5% difference could really change people's minds.  \n\n\n\\#4 \n\nLisa Su is an absolute unit. She will for sure talk about their timeline and plans for 5nm/3nm. I am guessing that this will rally investors to invest because they will see shinny 5nm/3nm while Intel is just getting to 10nm.  \n\n\n**POSITIONS:**  \n\\+95 call  (exp 12/18)  \n\\- 100 call (exp 12/18)\n\n(*call me a pussy for using a debit spread but I think its the best for my case)*  \n\n\nif you have something else you want to share comments below and I will add it!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu)\n\n[https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications)\n\n*This is not financial advice just me presenting the facts and the possibility of a callback.*  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2ciqo9vdlq51.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d0fa79a87e74390c112a07e8d93a82c5a8476e",

        "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI have been looking to diversify out of tech. ETFs make up 50% of my portfolio with SPY making up about 40% of it. I also have 10% in QQQ. Of my individual stocks, tech makes up about 60%. I currently have non-tech holdings in Disney, KO, ICLN, BABA, a small portion in NIO and SNE. I know SNE is tech but it does not move with the sector much and I really like this position. Any thoughts on good buys. I was really interested in BA but wanted to wait to see what happened after sept 15th and that wasn't great. Great buy but will take years so I am watching for now. Some others I have been following are V/MA, FDX (although getting pricey), J&amp;J and CVS. Another reasonable option I have been considering is putting more money into SPY and also ICLN to a lesser extent. Appreciate any input or other ideas. Thanks!",

        "selftext": "There are different ways to trade in a choppy environment. Here\u2019s a deep dive on how I attempted to use weekly options to trade a potential bounce in AMZN, and collected $.37 initially, for the possibility of making $50 more, even though the trade ended up being only an .$81 winner. \n\n# The Entry\n\nLast Thursday, 9/24, when $AMZN was trading at about $3000 a share, I was looking for a cheap way to play a bounce in the stock. During that time, my bias in the markets had begun to shift to a more bullish stance after seeing how the market had difficulty grinding lower. With that in mind, I wanted to play a potential bounce in tech. But I knew I didn\u2019t want to pay a debit at all to play for a bounce that might not even happen, given how uncertain and choppy the markets had been, but I still wanted to set myself up to capture some large gains if AMZN did indeed bounce. Therefore, the strategy that made the most sense to me, was a Call broken wing butterfly.\n\nGiven that I\u2019m a very short-term options trader who loves trading weeklies, I was trying to look for a cheap butterfly for the upcoming week that I could put on for a net credit. After exploring the options chain, I came across the +1/-2/+1 3300/3350/3450 call broken wing butterfly for the Oct 2 series. This fly, at the time (on Sept 24), was trading for a total of $.37 credit. Meaning, by putting on that butterfly, I would get paid $.37, and the following scenarios could happen:\n\n1. If AMZN decided to tank or hang out sideways and never get up close enough to the butterfly to expand the spread in my favor, then I\u2019d walk away pocketing the $.37 credit\n2. If AMZN slowly crept up to reach exactly 3350 by expiration, I\u2019d not only get to keep the credit, but also be able to sell the butterfly back out for $50. Of course, it doesn\u2019t need to reach exactly 3350 by expiration. If AMZN slowly worked its way up to near 3300, then the butterfly would expand very nicely as well.\n3. If AMZN blew past 3400 by expiration, I\u2019d see a loss, up to a maximum of $50 / spread (if $AMZN moves past 3450). That\u2019s because the 3300/3350 long call vertical of the fly provides 50 points of coverage before I essentially start losing money from the 3350/3450 short vertical, up until that 3450 kicks in to cap off further upside losses.\n\nSo that is a rough outline of the potential scenarios that would happen with this trade. \n\nGiven the choppy market conditions, I was ok with risking $50/spread (point #3), in order to not lose money if I\u2019m wrong on direction (point #1), while at the same time, keeping myself open to the possibility of the butterfly expanding in my favor (point #2) for some potentially very large gains. \n\nBut satisfying point #3 is tricky. I needed more data points suggesting that $AMZN wouldn\u2019t surge higher early on in the trade. Because if $AMZN did surge higher early on in the trade, then while the 3300 long call would rise in value, those two 3350 short calls would also rise in value, and because there\u2019d still be some time value left, they could be very juiced up and eat away at the profits of that 3300 long call, so much so that the 3450 long call won\u2019t even be able to offset those losses, especially given how far out of the money that 3450 call is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 9\\/24, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/fvqvwaeh6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=844361115e2cba2ef284b41c734751b7162c77fa)\n\nLooking at the chart above on 9/24, we can see that AMZN was trading at around $3000/share. In order to reach $3300 (where the first long call of the broken wing butterfly is), the stock would need to\n\n1. Breach the 38% fib retracement (\\~AMZN=3131) of the move from the 9/2 high to the 9/21 low, \n2. Breach the 20MA and 50MA\n3. Breach the 50% fib retracement (\\~AMZN=3211)\n4. Breach the 61.8% fib retracement (\\~AMZN=3292)\n\nbefore finally reaching the 3300 long call. All of these levels, I felt, should provide some resistance for AMZN to have to chew thru over the following week, before it even gets to the long call. And by that time, if AMZN did reach 3300, then the 3300 long call would still have a lot of extrinsic value left (somewhere around $20 on the last day), while the 3350 short calls would be very cheap (each around $5), so the entire spread could be roughly worth $10. Which would be great, because that means I\u2019d be getting paid $.37 to make another $10. \n\nSo with all of the above considered, I chose to take on that upside risk, for a chance to make potentially $50 (realistically I try to aim for just half of the max profit: $25, and start harvesting profits and peeling off the flies at around $5-$10), and that day on 9/24, entered the Oct2 3300/3350/3450 call broken wing butterfly for a $.37 credit. \n\nAfter entry, on Friday 9/25 and Monday 9/28, AMZN made steady progress upwards, from 3000 to 3175, breaching the 31.8% retracement and tagging the 20MA and 50MA from below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 9\\/28, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/qhbap1di6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dbb881ff54b0738a915407b66acc041292bf4af)\n\nbut this move wasn\u2019t large and fast enough to expand the value of the 3350 short calls. In fact, theta did a great job draining those short calls, while the 3300 long call did a good job retaining its premium, so the butterfly had already expanded a bit in my favor, and I was sitting at about a small $1.00 profit.\n\n# The Adjustment\n\nHowever, on Tuesday and Wednesday, AMZN began to stall out. By the end of Wednesday 9/30, when it looked like AMZN was putting in a topping tail, I decided that AMZN might not be able to make it near 3300 by expiration Friday, so I wanted to take in a bit more credit while I still could, before theta drained more of that 3300 long call. At the time, the spread was trading for almost $2.\n\nThat\u2019s when I made a slight adjustment to the spread and sold the 3300/3310 call vertical. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 9\\/30, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/mvsrotaj6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c2642107f30c304964a59d5dc24ea636622e52a)\n\nThis essentially rolled the 3300 long call up to 3310, and I was able to collect a small $.44 credit for it. However, this adjustment did open me up to an additional $10 of risk to the upside, because now, the long call vertical portion of the butterfly is only $40 wide (instead of $50). Still, with only 2 days left for AMZN to go higher, I felt comfortable taking on a bit more upside risk knowing that theta is going to be working hard to drain those 3350 short calls if AMZN did decide to surge higher. And at that moment, I actually wanted AMZN to move more towards my fly. My deltas were still positive, and the risk graph showed that a move towards the short strikes of the fly would expand it by another $4-5 by Thursday. \n\nSo after this adjustment, the trade stood at a $.81 credit, and the profit potential on the fly was now $40 instead of $50. Which is still pretty good.\n\n# The Tease\n\nOn Thursday, AMZN showed some strength and closed above the 50% fib (3211), which meant that if on Friday, AMZN worked its way up to around 3300, the fly could potentially be worth $5-10. Things were looking good (on any continued bullishness, the next target for AMZN was the 61.8% fib retracement at \\~3300). So I left the trade alone without making any more adjustments. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 10\\/1, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/lrtmt80k6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8134eed2543798ec4ad22d88c8a0742f9ed4a011)\n\n# The Flop\n\nUnfortunately, on Thursday night, news broke out that Trump was diagnosed with Coronavirus, and the market fell lower. By the open, AMZN was already trading at around 3150, roughly 150 points below the fly. The spread had instantly lost all of its value, so I basically let it expire worthless and walked away pocketing the $.81 credit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mpwrkjpk6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dd7f4da7b000b2266ab57a3c23c1863f9423704\n\nWhile the trade did not work out as well as I had liked, the important thing to note is that I was able to get paid even when the trade didn\u2019t go in my favor. With options, there are ways to trade an underlying to a certain target without ponying up a debit, albeit at the cost of introducing tail risk, while offering the possibility of very large upside. This may be a style of trading that one can consider employing when the outlook of the markets is uncertain, as long as the trader is willing to make the necessary adjustments to control risk. \n\nWhich leads me to the following section: \n\n# FAQ \n\n&gt;What if AMZN decided to surge very early on during the trade? What if AMZN had surged to 3300 with 4-5 DTE, hence juicing up the short calls and causing the butterfly to take on large negative deltas?\n\nEven though the position would be very theta positive, I would pony up the debit to cap off the upside risk by buying the 3400/3450 call vertical, hence turning the 3300/3350/3450 broken wing butterfly into the 3300/3350/3400 balanced butterfly. From there on out until expiration, I would look for ways to reduce the debit incurred from that adjustment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;But what if AMZN tanked afterwards? You could end up getting whipsawed.\n\nI\u2019d rather be safe than sorry and make the necessary adjustments to avoid getting run over, because I don\u2019t like playing the hope card. I could always undo the adjustment and look for ways to collect back more credit (at the cost of introducing risk elsewhere), depending on my new directional bias on AMZN at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Your maximum loss is so large, $5000. I\u2019d never make that bet, I would never risk $5000 to make $5000. \n\nThis style of trading is not for everyone. There are different ways to perceive risk. I don't really think of risk as binary as \u201cmax gain vs max loss\u201d. If the trade goes against me, I\u2019m not going to open myself up to the possibility of eating the maximum loss. I\u2019m going to manage that risk and make sure that I don\u2019t lose any money at all on the trade. Basically, I\u2019m not going to just put on the trade, walk away to the prayer room, and come back at expiration and hope that AMZN expired at 3350.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Why not just join thetagang and slap on iron condors / credit spreads in this environment? You could\u2019ve collected more credit by selling a 50 point wide put vertical with your bounce thesis. \n\nDifferent traders have different styles. I personally don\u2019t like pure premium selling strategies. I\u2019d rather have long options in front of the shorts to open myself up for some large upside and convexity in the P/L curve, rather than limit myself to the concavity of pure premium selling strategies. Having long options in front of the shorts also helps me sleep better at night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It\u2019s hard to read this. Is there a more visual explanation? \n\nHere\u2019s a video on it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uq76fZ3EME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uq76fZ3EME)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*TL;DR - I used weekly options to trade a potential bounce in AMZN, and got paid $.37 initially to do so, for the possibility of making $50 more. While the trade did not pan out, I walked away pocketing $.81 for being wrong.*",

Even though in contact payments from SQ is down, they have converted successfully via cashapp to online movements.\n\nLooking at some flow, look at $SQ\u2019s run on Friday:\nhttps://gyazo.com/1eb2621dfb91c6e1e72b6380464e48cf\n\nThis is despite the news of a wavering stimulus. In fact, it looks like option flow is heading that way on [these payment providers](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1311683758735597569) with big movements happening earlier this month in anticipation of the stimulus.\n\nPaypal and Visa are looking a little beat up in comparison, but I think the flow will hit them too. I suspect Monday/Tuesday we get a lot of talk about the stimulus after the weekend and Trump\u2019s Friday offers. Plus pressure from the populace to make a deal happen.\n\nFor example, Trump may go bigger than [a 2.2 trillion COVID stimulus](https://twitter.com/samstein/status/1315306191178825735).\n\nAs result, some positions I have: PYPL $202 call 10/30 and SQ $220 call 10/23, and I am bullish on all payment companies as a result.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 13, 2020**\n\nStocks traded mostly lower today, losing some of yesterday\u2019s gains. Market participants are digesting the first batch of corporate earnings, special events from giants Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), and as usual, developments in Washington regarding fiscal stimulus.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished even on the day. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) 0.64% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.58%.\n\nEconomists and financial analysts expect companies within the S&amp;P 500 to post an aggregate earnings per share decline of 19.4% over this year. This estimate is higher than the 20.5% decline predicted back in the Spring. LPL Research said in a note, \u201cThe increase in analysts\u2019 earnings estimates reflects increased confidence in the outlook, even with the challenges Covid-19 still presents in terms of social distancing, various safety protocols, and shifting consumer behavior. We have been encouraged by recent data pointing to a continued steady reopening of the economy, and we believe the likelihood that additional lockdowns may meaningfully impair business activity remains very low.\n\nToday, in a letter, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the White House\u2019s new proposal for coronavirus aid, saying that \u201cin terms of addressing testing, tracing and treatment, what the Trump Administration has offered is wholly insufficient.\u201d After a day of promising developments yesterday, it appears stimulus negotiations have stalled once again. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel said his party was preparing a new, targeted package of \u201croughly $500 billion\u201d. However, Pelosi has stated in the past, in response to the airline relief bill, that she will not support targeted stimulus, only a comprehensive package. Over the weekend, the Trump administration called on Congress to pass a smaller $1.8 billion coronavirus relief bill as negotiations on a bigger package continue to run into roadblocks.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Today Apple announced a slate of new products, including the next generation of iPhones (the iPhone 12) that supports the burgeoning 5G network. It also announced a new smart home speaker and a new way to charge devices, called MagSafe, which lets charger, cases, and other accessories snap onto the back of the device using a magnet. The stock was down today, after rallying around 6% yesterday. \n* Today is Amazon Prime Day \"one-day only event filled with more deals than Black Friday, exclusively for Prime members around the globe.\" The world\u2019s largest online retailer is slashing the prices on a lot of popular items.\n* Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY) late-stage trial of its leading monoclonal antibody treatment for the coronavirus has been paused by U.S. health regulators over potential safety concerns, the company confirmed. The stock was more than 3.3% down at the time of writing. \n* Delta Airlines (DAL) reported worse than expected earnings in EPS and revenue. Stock was more than 2% down.\n   * EPS of -$3.30 vs -$3.10 estimate\n   * Revenue of $3.06 billion v $3.12 billion. \n* Big banks showed remarkable strength in earnings, despite the effects of the pandemic.\n   * Citigroup (C) reported EPS of $1.40 vs $0.77 estimate and Revenue of $17.3 billion vs $17.18 billion estimate. Stock was more than 4% down at the time of writing\n   * JP Morgan (JPM) reported EPS of $2.92 vs $1.86 estimate and Revenue of $29.90 billion vs $28.20 billion. Stock was around 1.5% down at the time of writing. \n* Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) better than expected earnings. The stock was 2.3% down at the time of writing.\n   * EPS $2.20 vs $1.98 estimate\n   * Revenue of $21.08 billion vs $20.15 billion estimate.\n   * The company late-stage coronavirus vaccine was paused after a participant reported an \u201cadverse event\u201d about 36 hours earlier, the company\u2019s chief financial officer said today\n* Boeing (BA) said Tuesday that it didn't win any new orders in September and delivered only 11 aircrafts this month, due to decreased demand in light of the pandemic.\n* Workhorse (WKHS) shares are around 12.8% after a USPS contract decision was reportedly delayed, prompting a stock downgrade from Roth Capital.\n* BMO Capital markets upgrades in the hotel space:\n   * Hilton Hotels (HLT) $72 to $89 from UNDERPERFORM to MARKET PERFORM\n   * Host Hotel Resorts (HST) from $12 to $14 from MARKET PERFORM to OUTPERFORM\n   * Marriott International (MAR) from $83 to $95 UNDERPERFORM to MARKET PERFORM\n* Foot Locker (FL) upgraded by Bank of America from $20 to $50 at BUY.\n* Jefferies Financial upgraded:\n   * Cubesmart (CUBE) from HOLD to BUY at $42\n   * Extra Space Storage (EXR) from HOLD to BUY and $121 to $135.\n* Disney (DIS) was upgraded by Loop Capital from HOLD to BUY at a price target of $150. Announced they are shifting strategy to streaming as the primary form of \n* entertainment!\n* Activision Blizzard (ATVI) was upgraded by the Royal Bank of Canada from HOLD to BUY and the price target raised to $90 from $75.\n* Zendesk (ZEN) had a target raised by the Royal Bank of Canada from $110 to $130 at OUTPERFORM.\n* Twilio (TWLO) had targets raised by Needham and Northland securities from $320 to $340 at BUY, and from $290 to $340 at OUTPERFORM. This stock is a monster!\n* TakeTwo Interactive (TTWO) had target raised by Deutsche Bank from $175 to $200 at BUY.\n* Peloton (PTON) had target raised by Robert W.

        "selftext": "Listen up, your grand pappy is going to tell you how to double your money (shares) or multiply your money (options) over the next few months. You see, there is this new company HYLN which completed its reverse merger (SPAC born) and ticker change on Friday. It\u2019s set to \u201cIPO\u201d Monday (tomorrow) with the CEO of the company ringing the bell to open the NYSE. Later in the day, he will be live on FOX Business to discuss the company. This scene is being setup at the NYSE as I type for the big day tomorrow...\n\nHYLN truck being setup at the NYSE for tomorrow\u2019s reveal\n\nI will lay it out for you in simplified bullet points below.\n\n* HYLN offers the only functional EV solution for class 8 vehicles (think semi-trucks).\n* This is the rare chance to invest in an EV play that does something that not even Tesla can do at this moment. It is much easier to electrify a small box that drives a few people around but to make something with the range, power and efficiency to carry 80,000 lbs is a different story.\n* They actually have functional products which are receiving great reviews. See this review by an actual truck driver test driving their product.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws2UyviL2Ec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws2UyviL2Ec)\n* Their trucks claim a 0-60 of 20s fully loaded at 80,000 lbs which is just as good as if not better than other ICE options. They also have significant range due to their technology. The cost of ownership is very low as well.\n* HYLN benefits from a unique situation. They provide the specialized power trains and handful of other parts for these vehicles. This means they do not suffer from lacking the resources and massive effort needed to mass produce an entire new vehicle from scratch like most new EV startups do.\n* They also benefit here because most blue collar truck operators/owners are able to keep something they have been mostly familiar with for years and not have to transition to a completely new creature like a Tesla truck, etc. Most of these drivers want something they already feel comfortable in and are resistant to change.\n* They offer multiple options: All electric, Hybrid CNG, and Hybrid Diesel.\n\nThree different power train options.\n\n* There are deals in place and likely more coming.\n* See Wegmans.  [https://www.wegmans.com/news-media/articles/partnership-with-hyliion-american-natural-gas/](https://www.wegmans.com/news-media/articles/partnership-with-hyliion-american-natural-gas/)\n* See 1,000 truck pre-order w/ global logistics leader Agility [https://www.hyliion.com/hyliion-launches-fully-electric-powertrain-announces-1000-truck-pre-order-with-global-logistics-leader-agility/](https://www.hyliion.com/hyliion-launches-fully-electric-powertrain-announces-1000-truck-pre-order-with-global-logistics-leader-agility/)\n* They made some major moves bringing important people in to the business.\n* This includes a former White House Chief of Staff and Secretary or Transportation Andrew Card. [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200730005211/en/Hyliion-Announces-Andrew-H.-Card-Jr.-to-Join-Board](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200730005211/en/Hyliion-Announces-Andrew-H.-Card-Jr.-to-Join-Board)\n* The CFO of Union Pacific Corporation (operates one of the largest railroad systems in US) - Robert Knight.

It has since been the victim of quite a few items that has deeply discounted it for currently $40. These include...\n\n* NKLA fallout. NKLA was an EV SPAC, so its fall hurt HYLN. There are many posts your can find on Reddit that describes the vast differences between the two. HYLN is on the far opposite end of the spectrum compared to NKLA. Without going in to major details...\n* HYLN actually has functional real world trucks!\n* HYLN CEO Thomas Healy is the exact opposite of the NKLA CEO. He even catches hate sometimes for not promoting his business ENOUGH and simply states he wants to focus on building his trucks!\n* HYLN has put together a serious TEAM of individuals to make this thing fly.\n\nOther factors that have allowed for you to buy in at a discount...\n\n* SEC comments on SPACs a few weeks ago caused major SPAC selloff. Good news, this is not a SPAC anymore, its HYLN!\n* A victim of the current market conditions and selloff last few weeks.\n* The SHLL/HYLN merger vote had to be extended because one item vote regarding restructuring of their board did not pass. This caused nervous investors to sell. Again, this is no longer a SPAC and the merger is complete.\n* Many analysts and investors had projected $70-80 PT for SHLL/HYLN before the end of the year with some going as high as $100. I think a good comparison for HYLN is Cummins (CMI) (as opposed to other EV companies) which is currently trading at $210. With all of the crazy IPO mania, sky is the limit.\n\nFriday\u2019s Action\n\n* On Friday, stock screeners picked up massive bullish flow for HYLN. It was #7 in calls placed and had multiple big buyers as well as a ton of sweeps and blocks. Look it up.\n\nBottom line: Good company, formed a great team, doing things right, unique technology, hot sector, regulations help them, going to the moon.\n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m am long HYLN shares and own weekly, monthly and leap options on HYLN.",

        "selftext": "Looks like Hyliion is gearing up for a big push tomorrow. Ringing the bell to open the trading day, multiple interviews/segments scheduled on the news and this.... https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyliion/comments/j59ur9/exciting_day_tomorrow/\n\n\nThe time for Hyliion's \"IPO\" (HYLN) has come.\n\n**About Hyliion**\n\nThe company description below comes from a recent Business Wire article.  I can't provide the link as a certain other company can't be mentioned in the link itself:\n\n&gt; Hyliion\u2019s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion\u2019s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion\u2019s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment\u2014in the case of Hyliion\u2019s Hybrid systems\u2014or fully replace\u2014in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system\u2014traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion\u2019s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers\u2019 pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives.\n\n**Investor Presentation**\n\nAs someone else wrote here, [Hyliion (HYLN) is not the next Nikola.  This is a good thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j03etb/hyliion_hyln_is_not_the_next_nikola_this_is_a/)\n\nThe company's Investor Presentation can be found [here](https://rpn113p35qekzef7411kp2qt-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Hyliion-Tortoise-Overview-Presentation.pdf).\n\nAs can be shown in the presentation:\n\n1) HYLN has its defined niche: Class 8 trucks.  Not even Tesla will be competing in this field, for a decade or more.\n\n2) HYLN has a total addressable market of $800 billion in the US alone.  One customer, Agility, operates in 100 countries.\n\n3) HYLN won't play the capital-intensive game of setting up EV-related infrastructure.  They are not in the business of being a \"gas station.\"\n\n4) HYLN will first use renewable natural gas and natural gas generators for its Hypertruck electrified powertrain systems, yet is already developing them to be compatible with fully electric solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells.  They are being practical here in addressing the needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of trucks (for the trucking industry).\n\n5) HYLN already has operational prototypes.\n\n6) HYLN already has million-mileage logs for the first number of trucks already deployed.\n\n**Renewable Natural Gas**\n\n[An article on FreightWaves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/nikola-hyliion-defend-divergent-paths-to-zero-emission-trucking) provides a brief summary of what renewable natural gas is:\n\n&gt; Renewable natural gas (RNG) starts as a biogas from the decomposition of organic matter, such as wastewater, food, green waste and farming. It is cleaned and processed into biomethane that is injected into the pipeline. When used as a transportation fuel, RNG has a negative carbon intensity, said Deanna Haines, director of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy at SoCalGas.\n\nRNG production is expected to [double in the near future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WnTNJZTqo4&amp;feature=youtu.be).\n\nInfrastructure-wise, there are plenty of natural gas stations in Europe.  For example, Italy has over 1,400, while Germany has over 800.\n\n**Battery Management Supply Chain**\n\nTwo years ago, Hyliion [acquired Gentherm's battery division](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/equipment/hyliion-acquires-battery-producer) to have its battery management supply chain in-house.\n\n**Financials**\n\nFuture-oriented revenue data (projections), per the Investor Presentation, are as follows:\n\n2020: $1 million\n\n2021: $8 million\n\n2022: $344 million\n\n2023: $1.0 billion\n\n2024: $2.1 billion\n\nNot every target company in a reverse merger discloses current or historical financial information.  In this case, however, [such information can be found in an SEC filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-022028/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=c38d42b8c68dad4fd4c816b5799dca4bdbe435aa-1601600373-0-Ae7hxOZAy6LXjWjw6G7Ra_bQuy3Ig2re0xzZ8HVp3NVtRg9gOZ5UW-0RpnGg7RMobRYDNgh92m3CLI6_6k-MCw37XKHDzhqXsb7mFT7iOpdy6MWA5MmZDeLPzdmwjftk-8c17hucybdmgOAOT2jSXkLq8EKx3JW11mzOSq1OdzbNrRlsDNo4PBbPshX1D7_0H_3jIyGFkesJQTFSKlqU5VgiVIsKYwGqGh0xUOpq9apt1EOGGQh4UPw7ZpYFYlJduNqSM48x8ZtJn3L4CTdkTRbBINYlTg0c4elHQXkcxtIQpP1bCLZ1aMTRwKqmtTNDSMhiMj0Tv0EMfU5lBYL_xHNul5htXHIinMHI7D2xxBGW8VfbbFp1gRuuUJoeZylFnw#ta_006).\n\n**Values and Governance**\n\nHyliion has just committed to its reverse merger while having a non-classified board.  It's one thing to assert that the company isn't conducive to fraud like Nikola has been (such as plastic model vehicles with no operating prototypes, or fake orders).  It's quite another to demonstrate this.\n\nOne of the problems Nikola has is having a classified board.  In the long run, a classified board isn't as effective as a non-classified board.  This comparison extends to fraud prevention.\n\n**Stock Price Disadvantages**\n\nBeing an engineer by background, Thomas Healy does not have the marketing skills of Trevor Milton.\n\nWhile Hyliion itself has the potential to break away from the Nikola drama, HYLN's price will likely remain quite dependent upon TSLA's price movements, just like all the other stocks in the EV space.  Any out-of-control tweet by Elon Musk, let alone any performance hiccup over at Tesla, could have adverse effects on HYLN.\n\n**Stock Price Advantages**\n\nEven I expected a second wave of COVID-19 to have a correction effect on tech stocks.  I was mistaken in this regard, as large institutional funds have rotated back into the tech sector, including that part of it which is future-tech oriented (TSLA, SHOP, FSLY, ZM, etc.).\n\n**Evaluation**\n\nHYLN is a solid hold for at least five years, maybe even ten.  It is definitely worth a starter position first thing in the morning, and an additional position or two later in the day, for DCA purposes.\n\n*Disclosure: Long on shares and warrants.*",

        "selftext": "So, every time there's a post here relating to any article or information about the last new European or American fintech coming to bankrupt all the big Canadian banks, I'm the first to say that banking in Canada is a very powerful oligopoly and that they have been shutting down any effort to take over their business. \n\nWell, I think there's a new player that has a lot of potential to ruin them without leaving them a chance to say anything and I'm not talking about holding Bitcoin in Wealthsimple. \n\nThere has been a new development in the crypto space and it's called decentralized apps. Without getting into details, there are now ways to deposit crypto into a vault and earn interest out of it and it's also possible to borrow coins on the same dapp. One such mature dapp and protocol is called Compound. It also gives you token that allows you to vote on decisions about the protocol. The rates are low, but higher than EQBanks' own.\n\nConsidering that there are now some Visa Card working only with Crypto, I'm wondering where will be the need for banks' checking and savings account? \n\nOf course, there are big hurdles right now. For one, the fees are quite high on the Ethereum chain, the blockchain where most of the action like Compound is happening. Some days, you can be charged as much as $100 just to confirm that you can make a transaction. To address that, there's already an Ethereum 2.0 coming and other chains like Binance secure chain and [EOS.IO](https://EOS.IO). Also, the whole Finance Dapp scene is pretty much in beta, which means you can lose everything in a glimpse just because of a coding error. To counteract that, some platforms are already offering insurance. This in only to say that the market is pretty young; the buzz only started 2 months ago.\n\nI only see it becoming more and more customer friendly to a point where banks will lose business. I guess they will try to prompt the government to make new laws, but to the rate that everything is going, I think the technology will already have major adoption, just like Airbnb and Uber. \n\nWhat do y'all think about that? Do you think banks will win again with their Open Banking stuff? Do you know if any bank announced strategies to address the crypto space?\n\nTL;DR: Do you think Defi apps will once and for all take over the big Canadian Banks? And will it affect your investments?",

        "selftext": "The time for Hyliion's \"IPO\" (HYLN) has come.\n\n**About Hyliion**\n\nThe company description below comes from a recent Business Wire article.  I can't provide the link as a certain other company can't be mentioned in the link itself:\n\n&gt; Hyliion\u2019s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion\u2019s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion\u2019s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment\u2014in the case of Hyliion\u2019s Hybrid systems\u2014or fully replace\u2014in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system\u2014traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion\u2019s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers\u2019 pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives.\n\n**Investor Presentation**\n\nAs someone else wrote here, [Hyliion (HYLN) is not the next Nikola.  This is a good thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j03etb/hyliion_hyln_is_not_the_next_nikola_this_is_a/)\n\nThe company's Investor Presentation can be found [here](https://rpn113p35qekzef7411kp2qt-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Hyliion-Tortoise-Overview-Presentation.pdf).\n\nAs can be shown in the presentation:\n\n1) HYLN has its defined niche: Class 8 trucks.  Not even Tesla will be competing in this field, for a decade or more.\n\n2) HYLN has a total addressable market of $800 billion in the US alone.  One customer, Agility, operates in 100 countries.\n\n3) HYLN won't play the capital-intensive game of setting up EV-related infrastructure.  They are not in the business of being a \"gas station.\"\n\n4) HYLN will first use renewable natural gas and natural gas generators for its Hypertruck electrified powertrain systems, yet is already developing them to be compatible with fully electric solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells.  They are being practical here in addressing the needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of trucks (for the trucking industry).\n\n5) HYLN already has operational prototypes.\n\n6) HYLN already has million-mileage logs for the first number of trucks already deployed.\n\n**Renewable Natural Gas**\n\n[An article on FreightWaves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/nikola-hyliion-defend-divergent-paths-to-zero-emission-trucking) provides a brief summary of what renewable natural gas is:\n\n&gt; Renewable natural gas (RNG) starts as a biogas from the decomposition of organic matter, such as wastewater, food, green waste and farming. It is cleaned and processed into biomethane that is injected into the pipeline. When used as a transportation fuel, RNG has a negative carbon intensity, said Deanna Haines, director of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy at SoCalGas.\n\nRNG production is expected to [double in the near future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WnTNJZTqo4&amp;feature=youtu.be).\n\nInfrastructure-wise, there are plenty of natural gas stations in Europe.  For example, Italy has over 1,400, while Germany has over 800.\n\n**Battery Management Supply Chain**\n\nTwo years ago, Hyliion [acquired Gentherm's battery division](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/equipment/hyliion-acquires-battery-producer) to have its battery management supply chain in-house.\n\n**Financials**\n\nFuture-oriented revenue data (projections), per the Investor Presentation, are as follows:\n\n2020: $1 million\n\n2021: $8 million\n\n2022: $344 million\n\n2023: $1.0 billion\n\n2024: $2.1 billion\n\nNot every target company in a reverse merger discloses current or historical financial information.  In this case, however, [such information can be found in an SEC filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-022028/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=c38d42b8c68dad4fd4c816b5799dca4bdbe435aa-1601600373-0-Ae7hxOZAy6LXjWjw6G7Ra_bQuy3Ig2re0xzZ8HVp3NVtRg9gOZ5UW-0RpnGg7RMobRYDNgh92m3CLI6_6k-MCw37XKHDzhqXsb7mFT7iOpdy6MWA5MmZDeLPzdmwjftk-8c17hucybdmgOAOT2jSXkLq8EKx3JW11mzOSq1OdzbNrRlsDNo4PBbPshX1D7_0H_3jIyGFkesJQTFSKlqU5VgiVIsKYwGqGh0xUOpq9apt1EOGGQh4UPw7ZpYFYlJduNqSM48x8ZtJn3L4CTdkTRbBINYlTg0c4elHQXkcxtIQpP1bCLZ1aMTRwKqmtTNDSMhiMj0Tv0EMfU5lBYL_xHNul5htXHIinMHI7D2xxBGW8VfbbFp1gRuuUJoeZylFnw#ta_006).\n\n**Values and Governance**\n\nHyliion has just committed to its reverse merger while having a non-classified board.  It's one thing to assert that the company isn't conducive to fraud like Nikola has been (such as plastic model vehicles with no operating prototypes, or fake orders).  It's quite another to demonstrate this.\n\nOne of the problems Nikola has is having a classified board.  In the long run, a classified board isn't as effective as a non-classified board.  This comparison extends to fraud prevention.\n\n**Stock Price Disadvantages**\n\nBeing an engineer by background, Thomas Healy does not have the marketing skills of Trevor Milton.\n\nWhile Hyliion itself has the potential to break away from the Nikola drama, HYLN's price will likely remain quite dependent upon TSLA's price movements, just like all the other stocks in the EV space.  Any out-of-control tweet by Elon Musk, let alone any performance hiccup over at Tesla, could have adverse effects on HYLN.\n\n**Stock Price Advantages**\n\nEven I expected a second wave of COVID-19 to have a correction effect on tech stocks.  I was mistaken in this regard, as large institutional funds have rotated back into the tech sector, including that part of it which is future-tech oriented (TSLA, SHOP, FSLY, ZM, etc.).\n\n**Evaluation**\n\nHYLN is a solid hold for at least five years, maybe even ten.  It is definitely worth a starter position first thing in the morning, and an additional position or two later in the day, for DCA purposes.\n\n*Disclosure: Long on shares and warrants.*",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 5th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks fall following Trump\u2019s positive virus test, but close off the worst levels on stimulus hopes  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stocks fell in volatile trading on Friday after President Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus diagnosis fueled concerns about the election and a worsening pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; Major averages clawed back some of the steep losses after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled aid for the airline industry could be coming soon, perhaps even as part of a much-anticipated broad relief bill.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 134.09 points, or 0.5%, lower at 27,682.81 after dropping 430 points at its session low. The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.0%, or 32.36 points, to 3,248.44 after falling as much as 1.7% earlier. The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.2%, or 251.49 points, to 11,075.02.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of airlines jumped higher in unison after Pelosi called on the industry to delay furloughs, saying relief for airline workers is \u201cimminent.\u201d American Airlines and United erased earlier losses and popped 3.3% and 2.4%, respectively.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe will either enact Chairman DeFazio\u2019s bipartisan stand-alone legislation or achieve this as part of a comprehensive negotiated relief bill, extending for another six months the Payroll Support Program,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement.\n*****\n&gt; Earlier Friday, Pelosi said Trump\u2019s illness changed the dynamic of stimulus talks, adding lawmakers will find the \u201cmiddle ground\u201d and will \u201cget the job done.\u201d The House passed the $2.2 trillion Democratic coronavirus stimulus bill Thursday night, while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has offered a $1.6 trillion package.\n*****\n&gt; Still, the president\u2019s diagnosis added more uncertainty to the election, an event that was already weighing on the market and keeping traders on edge as they attempted to evaluate the possible outcomes. It also raised concerns about a second wave of the virus and a slower reopening.\n*****\n&gt; White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said in a memo, \u201cThe President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Conley also said he expects Trump to \u201ccontinue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Friday Trump was having \u201cmild\u201d symptoms after testing positive for the virus and that he and Melania are in \u201cgood spirits.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Trump campaign announced that all events involving the president\u2019s participation are going virtual or being temporarily postponed.\n*****\n&gt; Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence have both tested negative for the coronavirus, Pence\u2019s spokesman said Friday. Mnuchin has also tested negative, the Treasury\u2019s assistant secretary for public affairs said Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis October surprise raises the already high level of political uncertainty markets are dealing with as Election Day approaches,\u201d said Jeff Buchbinder, equity strategist at LPL Financial. \u201cMarkets appear to be increasingly pricing Joe Biden in as the favorite, and this news may not change that, but Trump could gain support from a quick recovery.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Trump tweet initially knocked down Dow futures more than 500 points in overnight trading.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt really brings into stark reality that we are potentially going into \u2026 a second wave,\u201d said Jeff Henriksen, co-founder and CEO of Thorpe Abbotts Capital, to CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box Europe.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump getting this really highlights that in a way that I think it will focus attention back on the virus and the effects it will have.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Technology shares led the declines on Friday with Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook all losing more than 2.5%. Tech stocks could come under pressure under a Democratic sweep scenario if it leads to higher tax rates and tighter regulations, many strategists have said. Investors also could rotate out of technology shares and into more cyclical stocks if a stimulus is passed.\n*****\n&gt; Also weighing on the sentiment was a worse-than-expected September jobs report. Nonfarm payroll rose by 661,000 in September, the Labor Department said Friday in the final jobs report before the November election. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected a jobs gain of 800,000. The unemployment rate fell to 7.9% last month.\n*****\n&gt; The sell-off in oil prices intensified as Trump\u2019s coronavirus news added to the industry\u2019s demand concerns. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, slid 4.3% to $37.05 per barrel on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Some on Wall Street said the markets overreacted to Trump\u2019s medical condition.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors should not panic over the news,\u201d Sean Darby, global equity strategist at Jefferies, said in a note. \u201cIt was a tail risk since other global leaders have contracted the virus, but the forthcoming US election should not be delayed in any way... 2020 has seen many 2, 3, and even 4 sigma events, and this political tail risk is by no means as big.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have staged a historic rebound since the economic shutdown sent stocks tumbling in March. But the major averages all finished September lower, snapping a five-month win streak, as doubts emerge about the pace and breadth of the recovery.\n*****\n&gt; Despite Friday\u2019s weakness, major averages all posted modest gains for the week. The 30-stock Dow gained 1.9%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq rose 1.5% each this week.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3J0V6o1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TI8ImmZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/90v084y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne7m07y.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UZt0DJ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HA7KsPc.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NzmRLPp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eqS3Lk4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/k9v1hZX.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UtkozzH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KNI9qkQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/OM44UFj.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Make Up Your !@#$%^&amp;* Mind!\n\n&gt; We've all had versions of this conversation where you or the person you were talking to just couldn't make up their mind. At the end of the day, it only causes trouble and plans are ruined.\n\n&gt; The market is having its own back and forth this year trying to decide between growth and value. Just today, growth stocks are getting slaughtered while value stocks are up marginally. As an example, the Russell 1000 Growth index is down 1.8% on the day while the Russell 1000 Value index has managed to rally 0.25%. The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the Russell 1000 Growth index and the Russell 1000 Value index for each day in 2020. Today's performance spread between the two indices marks the ninth time this year that value has outperformed growth by more than two percentage points. At the other extreme, there have also been eight trading days where growth outperformed value by more than two percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-2020.png))**\n\n&gt; So how does this year's frequency of days where the performance spread between the two indices was more than two percentage points stack up to other years? The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the two indices going all the way back to 1990. Over the last thirty years, the only two periods where we saw a frequency of these large daily dislocations was back in 2008 and the period spanning 2000 and 2001. In fact, with 17 days this year where the performance spread between the two indices was greater than two percentage points, the only other years that saw a higher frequency of large dislocations were 2000 (54) and 2001 (28). If you think the market has been indecisive this year, in 2000 we saw these types of daily dislocations an average of once per week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-All-Years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n&gt; But October has become a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October\u2019s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Have Democratic Sweeps Meant for the S&amp;P 500?\n\n&gt; Headed into the first presidential debate Tuesday night, betting markets (ElectionBettingOdds.com) placed Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the slight favorite to take the White House in November. The debate resulted in Biden gaining another 5 percentage point chance of winning the Presidency. As of this morning, Biden's odds to win are at 59.8% versus Trump's odds of 38.9%. Additionally, Democrats are slight favorites to win control of the Senate (58.4% to 41.5%) and big favorites to maintain the House (82.8% to 17.1%). Given these odds, in the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the three months before Election Day through three months after Election Day for all election years post-WWII that resulted in a sweep of the executive and legislative branch by the Democrats.\n\n&gt; As shown, on average the S&amp;P 500 has been on the decline in the weeks leading up to Election Day, though in the days just before the Election there has been a small rally that sharply reverses once the results come in. After the initial post-Election drop, the market has trended a bit higher, but by three months after the Election, it has only found itself around the same levels as Election Day; on average a 2.6% loss versus where the index stood three months prior.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps3.png))**\n\n&gt; The composite shown above is comprised of six different years: 1948, 1960, 1964, 1976, 1992, and 2008. While on average the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower, it is not necessarily a sure-fire thing. For example, 1948 and 2008 were the only years that saw the S&amp;P 500 trade and stay significantly lower in the wake of the election. In 1976, there was similarly a sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the election, but the index did make its way back up to the highs of that six-month time frame later on albeit no new high was put in place. Meanwhile, 1960, 1964, and 1992 all saw the S&amp;P 500 run higher after the election even despite some periods of consolidation after initial moves higher. In our B.I.G. Tips report from Tuesday, we show these same charts for all Presidential election years post WWII including a look at the average performance given every potential election outcome.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Current Returns Stack Up to History\n\n&gt; Even after September's weakness, the S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month total return stood at an impressive 14.9%. Given the events of the last 12 months, one could even say that performance is remarkable. What's even crazier is that the S&amp;P 500's performance over the last 12 months is more than three times stronger than the 12 month period before that (+4.25%). The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's annualized total returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares that performance to the historical average return of the index over those same time periods.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's historical average 12-month return is 11.7%, so the current 14.9% gain exceeds that average by more than three full percentage points. Over a two-year window, though, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 9.4% is more than a full percentage point below the historical average. Looking further out, the S&amp;P 500's trailing five and ten-year annualized return has been much stronger than average, which makes sense given the long bull market we were in. Over a 20 year window, though, the S&amp;P 500 is only just starting to work off some of the declines from the dot-com bust and as a result, the 6.4% annualized gain is a four and a half percentage points below the long-term average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show how the current performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each of the time frames shown compares to all other periods on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's performance over the last year, ranks just below 56th percentile of all other periods, while the two-year performance ranks just below the 42nd percentile. Even as the five and ten-year periods have seen well above average returns, they still rank in just the mid-60s on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's ranking over a 20-year time period is a completely different story ranking in single-digits on a percentile basis. Even with the equity market right near record highs, the last two decades have been forgettable for US equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns-Ranks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonals Are Back In Style Again\n\n&gt; There is no denying that market seasonality has not worked so well this year. But we have been here before and history is on our side. Over the long term, intermediate term and short term market seasonality has suffered brief periods when seasonality was overridden by more powerful forces. The COVID pandemic and economic shutdown certainly qualifies. But it is only a matter of time until repetitive human behavior patterns and people and institutions return to moving money around in the usual daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and seasonal patterns.\n\n&gt; The return of perennial September weakness is emblematic of a return to normal market behavior and a reflection of the fact that despite the continuing concerns about surges in coronavirus cases life is beginning to return to normal. In our area, about 25-30 miles north of New York City, our kids are beginning hybrid learning, playing rugby, lacrosse and other sports (yes with some COVID protocols, but tackling and facing-off), golf outings are happening and people are going to restaurants and out and about.\n\n&gt; The chart here shows the historical One-Year Pattern of the S&amp;P 500 Since 1950 versus 2020. The black line shows the seasonal pattern since 1950. The blue represents the pattern since 1988. We use 1988 as it is the first year after the 1987 Crash when the market underwent a major systemic change with the implementation of downside protection circuit breakers and collars. It is noteworthy how the seasonal pattern persists during both the 70-year and 31-year timeframes.\n\n&gt; 2020 is plotted on the right axis due to the magnitude of the move this year. The yellow box highlights the rebirth of seasonality this September, especially during this notoriously negative Week After Triple Witching Week as detailed page 108 of the 2020 Almanac, indicated by the two black arrows\n\n&gt; Years like 1980, 1982, 2009 and 2016 with unseasonably early weakness and bear markets like 2020 returned to normal seasonal patterns in short order. And years like 1954, 1958, 1980, 1982, 1995 and 2009 that exhibited double-digit gains in the Worst Six Months still proceeded to deliver further sizable gains in the subsequent Best Six Months (page 52, STA 2020). We believe the return of market seasonality is upon us. So remain cautious through the end of September and be alert to Octoberophobia, but remain ready to pounce on our Best Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal, when it triggers.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0a4a6ba18e7d903b198c8fa7d6cf8bc4/9c2d30c4da9ff340-d7/s500x750/eb0c36b5ff7eec394f463ca8420054c22a88010f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 2nd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiTS26b5YO8))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DuBcN1Z.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zy3ktow.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pt0NiLh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yaviiRp.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Vdaqsaj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ipdesH4.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 13, 2020**\n\nStocks traded mostly lower today, losing some of yesterday\u2019s gains. Market participants are digesting the first batch of corporate earnings, special events from giants Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), and as usual, developments in Washington regarding fiscal stimulus.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished even on the day. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) 0.64% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.58%.\n\nEconomists and financial analysts expect companies within the S&amp;P 500 to post an aggregate earnings per share decline of 19.4% over this year. This estimate is higher than the 20.5% decline predicted back in the Spring. LPL Research said in a note, \u201cThe increase in analysts\u2019 earnings estimates reflects increased confidence in the outlook, even with the challenges Covid-19 still presents in terms of social distancing, various safety protocols, and shifting consumer behavior. We have been encouraged by recent data pointing to a continued steady reopening of the economy, and we believe the likelihood that additional lockdowns may meaningfully impair business activity remains very low.\n\nToday, in a letter, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the White House\u2019s new proposal for coronavirus aid, saying that \u201cin terms of addressing testing, tracing and treatment, what the Trump Administration has offered is wholly insufficient.\u201d After a day of promising developments yesterday, it appears stimulus negotiations have stalled once again. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel said his party was preparing a new, targeted package of \u201croughly $500 billion\u201d. However, Pelosi has stated in the past, in response to the airline relief bill, that she will not support targeted stimulus, only a comprehensive package. Over the weekend, the Trump administration called on Congress to pass a smaller $1.8 billion coronavirus relief bill as negotiations on a bigger package continue to run into roadblocks.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Today Apple announced a slate of new products, including the next generation of iPhones (the iPhone 12) that supports the burgeoning 5G network. It also announced a new smart home speaker and a new way to charge devices, called MagSafe, which lets charger, cases, and other accessories snap onto the back of the device using a magnet. The stock was down today, after rallying around 6% yesterday. \n* Today is Amazon Prime Day \"one-day only event filled with more deals than Black Friday, exclusively for Prime members around the globe.\" The world\u2019s largest online retailer is slashing the prices on a lot of popular items.\n* Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY) late-stage trial of its leading monoclonal antibody treatment for the coronavirus has been paused by U.S. health regulators over potential safety concerns, the company confirmed. The stock was more than 3.3% down at the time of writing. \n* Delta Airlines (DAL) reported worse than expected earnings in EPS and revenue. Stock was more than 2% down.\n   * EPS of -$3.30 vs -$3.10 estimate\n   * Revenue of $3.06 billion v $3.12 billion. \n* Big banks showed remarkable strength in earnings, despite the effects of the pandemic.\n   * Citigroup (C) reported EPS of $1.40 vs $0.77 estimate and Revenue of $17.3 billion vs $17.18 billion estimate. Stock was more than 4% down at the time of writing\n   * JP Morgan (JPM) reported EPS of $2.92 vs $1.86 estimate and Revenue of $29.90 billion vs $28.20 billion. Stock was around 1.5% down at the time of writing. \n* Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) better than expected earnings. The stock was 2.3% down at the time of writing.\n   * EPS $2.20 vs $1.98 estimate\n   * Revenue of $21.08 billion vs $20.15 billion estimate.\n   * The company late-stage coronavirus vaccine was paused after a participant reported an \u201cadverse event\u201d about 36 hours earlier, the company\u2019s chief financial officer said today\n* Boeing (BA) said Tuesday that it didn't win any new orders in September and delivered only 11 aircrafts this month, due to decreased demand in light of the pandemic.\n* Workhorse (WKHS) shares are around 12.8% after a USPS contract decision was reportedly delayed, prompting a stock downgrade from Roth Capital.\n* BMO Capital markets upgrades in the hotel space:\n   * Hilton Hotels (HLT) $72 to $89 from UNDERPERFORM to MARKET PERFORM\n   * Host Hotel Resorts (HST) from $12 to $14 from MARKET PERFORM to OUTPERFORM\n   * Marriott International (MAR) from $83 to $95 UNDERPERFORM to MARKET PERFORM\n* Foot Locker (FL) upgraded by Bank of America from $20 to $50 at BUY.\n* Jefferies Financial upgraded:\n   * Cubesmart (CUBE) from HOLD to BUY at $42\n   * Extra Space Storage (EXR) from HOLD to BUY and $121 to $135.\n* Disney (DIS) was upgraded by Loop Capital from HOLD to BUY at a price target of $150. Announced they are shifting strategy to streaming as the primary form of \n* entertainment!\n* Activision Blizzard (ATVI) was upgraded by the Royal Bank of Canada from HOLD to BUY and the price target raised to $90 from $75.\n* Zendesk (ZEN) had a target raised by the Royal Bank of Canada from $110 to $130 at OUTPERFORM.\n* Twilio (TWLO) had targets raised by Needham and Northland securities from $320 to $340 at BUY, and from $290 to $340 at OUTPERFORM. This stock is a monster!\n* TakeTwo Interactive (TTWO) had target raised by Deutsche Bank from $175 to $200 at BUY.\n* Peloton (PTON) had target raised by Robert W. Baird from $120 to $140 at OUTPERFORM. This stock has been on a tear!\n* Service Now (NOW) had a price target raised by Royal Bank of Canada from $510 to $600 at OUTPERFORM.

        "selftext": " \n\nI posted before about Doubleview Gold (TSXV: DBG.V / OTC: DBLVF) , and I'm believing in it now more than ever. A lot of us think there is a very, very good chance that we are going to be significantly wealthy for no other reason than that we got lucky and have a friend whose roommate's dad is an employee with the company. No Joke. Would've never heard about it otherwise. There is a very very large proven gold/copper porphyry deposit in the Lisle Zone. Read the DD, watch the interviews.\n\n\\-Was given a $0.47 price target (check yahoo finance) without even a preliminary maiden resource estimate (and even the report highlighted that price was at a 90% discount)\n\n\\-Location/Camp allows for 24/7 365 drilling. This is EXTREMEMELY rare. Every other miner has to stop drilling for the winter.\n\n\\-Gold/Copper edging historic high (oh baby)\n\n\\-Cobalt Metallurgist at the drill site, also is a Telsa consultant\n\n\\-Look at KDK (Kodiak) - jumped 0.25-3.50 on much worse g/t at lower intervals than DBG already has\n\n\\-Look at TUD (Tudor Gold/also in Golden Triangle) -  jumped 0.42-3.35 on much worse results than DBG already has\n\n    (tud only owns 60% of their property, dbg owns 100% of theirs) \n\n\\- Test hole H034 had 1.06 g/t over 235m. H-034 was mineralized all the way to 700m (that's all they had planned to drill to), and was in higher quality and quantity at depth... suggesting that a deeper hole would SIGNIFICANTLY expand the already massive confirmed gold/copper site. And as we speak the financing for this drill season is complete, and the drills have been turning on H035 with the goal of getting to 1500m, but with the equipment to go to 2000m if the cores keep looking mineralized. The drill has been turning for over 6 weeks now, they are drilling DEEP. This is a really big deal. Red Chris mine is a textbook example of a runaway gold stock, and the Lisle Zone anomaly is looking to be both larger and deeper than the Red Chris mine. We are expecting drill results mid - late October. \n\nHere are two interviews with the CEO (He owns 22% of the company) where he outlines his result expectations and a timeline. He also compares DBG to other similar mines in the area.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNUCtoF6Ga4&amp;t=6s&amp;ab\\_channel=DoubleviewGoldCorpTSX.V%3ADBG.V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNUCtoF6Ga4&amp;t=6s&amp;ab_channel=DoubleviewGoldCorpTSX.V%3ADBG.V)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pebWC\\_yZ8bU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pebWC_yZ8bU)\n\nHere's an interview with D4, the guy who writes their reports and sold his 911 to buy more shares.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK2oGK2DfXQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK2oGK2DfXQ)\n\nHere are 3 market reports and 39 pages of DD[https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=kK2oGK2DfXQ&amp;event=video\\_description&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.ceo.ca.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1fgbht7-Doubleview%2520Gold%2520Reports%252005%2520July%25202020.pdf&amp;redir\\_token=QUFFLUhqa1VpZ1BIRUZEeHE3cW5WSEtiOWNSdnFBQ3ZyQXxBQ3Jtc0trNHBrbzg4dHB5Z3M0dDJDZmdQby1xY1V2MVY0NWo4VVdXWGZOM2FaeHRudjk5d2wyRXRkNTZ1NkxCUVI0N2xtV2ZzODRzY2lBQjVHbVR4eWZYd0RaeUhTcFRtMmV0S1FHQzFQUVBvcjBiZjU4UGtzaw%3D%3D](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=kK2oGK2DfXQ&amp;event=video_description&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.ceo.ca.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1fgbht7-Doubleview%2520Gold%2520Reports%252005%2520July%25202020.pdf&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa1VpZ1BIRUZEeHE3cW5WSEtiOWNSdnFBQ3ZyQXxBQ3Jtc0trNHBrbzg4dHB5Z3M0dDJDZmdQby1xY1V2MVY0NWo4VVdXWGZOM2FaeHRudjk5d2wyRXRkNTZ1NkxCUVI0N2xtV2ZzODRzY2lBQjVHbVR4eWZYd0RaeUhTcFRtMmV0S1FHQzFQUVBvcjBiZjU4UGtzaw%3D%3D)\n\nThis company (up until the financing that just closed) was 80% owned by the CEO, family, and friends. I'm sharing this because it just seems like a no-brainer. I'm a blue collar guy; I'm not smart, and I'm not stupid. I can't find any holes in this. I wanna get rich just like everyone here, and have (for me) a significant stake in this. This is worth a fraction of what a lot of people think it'll be after a buyout. Look at the DD and market reports. All of us want to be INVESTORS, not just blindly trade a stock. Wait til a buyout, cash out, and hop into our new Lamborghinis laughing like Jeff Bezos. This is the first time I feel included in an investment. The telegram group as a lifeline to other investors is invaluable, and because of it I feel like I now understand a whole sector (Junior mining), and you also seem to find out about news before anyone else.\n\n(If you want to get in the telegram just shoot me a message).\n\nLook into it $$$",

        "selftext": "Hey wallstreet bets- Heres my post from 15 days ago which got me banned for no good reason. Well today HGEN is gapping up and I think the run can continue. You can thank the mods for missing this mornings gap up.\n\n\n*Tucker Carlson interview from Friday https://video.foxnews.com/v/6197198838001#sp=show-clips \n\nHumanigen (HGEN) formerly Kalosbios was officially uplisted to the Nasdaq on September 18th. The company is revamped with a completely new and impressive management team. A lot of  J&amp;J experience on the board. After the Skereli years this company really took a nose dive, getting delisted and trading as low as 0.30. \n\nSo your probably wondering what\u2019s going on here? What\u2019s causing the resurgence in HGEN and the Nasdaq up list? The companies prized drug Lenzilumab is showing very promising results as a potential therapeutic for severe cases of Covid-19. The anti body drug is being used to treat Cytokine storm in Covid-19 patients. The company has flown mostly under the radar for the past few months due to their trading on the OTC markets. They have an ongoing phase III trial which should be complete by the end of the month with results by the end of October. They were also selected by the NIH for their Big Effect trail to see if Lenz could be an effective treatment when being used in collaboration with Remdesivir.\n\nOn their call last month the following analysts were in attendance. Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo, Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald, Madhu Kumar with Robert W. Baird, Anthony Butler with Roth Capital, Joseph Pantginis with H.C. Wainwrigh,t Kevin DeGeeter with Oppenheimer, Benjamin Burnett with Stifel Nicolaus, Olga Smolentseva with Bryan, Garnier &amp; Co. This type of institutional interest for an OTC stock is unheard of and just shows the amount of institutions which were waiting for an opportunity to invest here. Most institutions cannot invest in OTC stocks due to compliance issues, but now that they are up listed we should see buying and analyst coverage pick up in the coming weeks. \n\nPricing of a public offer with JP Morgan was announced on September 17th where they raise d68 million in funding for Lenz. Manufacturing colab with Lonza was announce on Monday as well as a Positive Phase III review by the Data Safety Monitoring Board.\n\nAlso of note some of the biggest biotech investment luminaries invested here in June raising 72 million including Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners, Surveyor Capital, HealthCor, Valiant Capital Partners, First Light Asset Management, and Ghost Tree Capital. \u2013 At the time this sotck trade OTC and this is the biggest pipe funding in OTC history\n\nYou can see a lot of the big players already have interest here, and with the Nasdaq uplist today this should start to get a lot more mainstream attention in the coming weeks. Interviews on CNBC, Bloomberg, etc. Remember, you couldn\u2019t even trade this on Robinhood before today.\n\nSome more updates since my last post:\n\nSeptember 23 \u2013 Humanigen Announces Thermo Fisher partnership to expand manufacturing for Covid-19 Therapeutic candidate Lenzilumab\n\nHumanigen Announces COVID-19 Case Report Demonstrating Rapid Resolution and Discharge after Single IND Emergency Use Authorization of Lenzilumab https://www.humanigen.com/press/Humanigen-Announces-COVID-19-Case-Report-Demonstrating-Rapid-Resolution-and-Discharge-after-Single-IND-Emergency-Use-Authorization-of-Lenzilumab%E2%84%A2  \n\nRoth Capital initiates coverage with a $25 price target.  \n\nPosition: 30K in shares \u2013 Options are available but Nasdaq uplist happened recently so volume is still light. I personally would stick with shares. * Disclaimer this stock has a tendency to be very volatile with a market cap under 1 billion. \n\nhttps://www.humanigen.com/press/Humanigen-Expands-Phase-III-Study-of-Lenzilumab-in-COVID-19-to-Brazil\n\nhttps://www.humanigen.com/press/Lenzilumab-COVID-19-Case-Control-Study-Published-in-Mayo-Clinic-Proceedings-Journal\n\nhttps://www.humanigen.com/press/Humanigen-Announces-Review-of-Lenzilumab-Phase-3-Study-in-COVID-19-by-Data-Safety-Monitoring-Board\n\nhttps://www.humanigen.com/press/Humanigen-Announces-Pricing-of-Public-Offering-of-Common-Stock-and-Commencement-of-Trading-on-Nasdaq-Under-the-Symbol-%E2%80%9CHGEN%E2%80%9D",

That being said, there is a lot of talk from Trump's lil' spout about Covid therapeutics - but the real show is when he does, not says.

I know you're thinking, \"Remdesivir is a Gilead drug\". Well there isn't moving a $60 stock up much further -  but there is a near penny stock chance of possibly a $KODK like return. $BSGM has a drug that is almost into Phase 3 trials: Merimepodib.

        "selftext": "Daily Synopsis - \n\n* The S&amp;P 500 increased +1.61% today while the NASDaq outperformed by (+3.12%). The Russell 2000 advanced (+0.67%). The Dow ended in positive territory at (+0.89%)\n* The best performing sector was Information Technology(+2.73%) while Materials(-0.17%)was the worst performer.\n* Briefly recapping the latest on stimulus, House Democrats and Senate Republicans rejected the $1.8 trillion offer from the White House for different reasons. Based on the relatively broad-based advance in the market, investors presumably remained in agreement that a deal will eventually be reached, either under the current administration or new leadership in 2021. \n* The financials sector (+1.1%), undeterred by the lack of deal, had a solid outing ahead of earnings reports from several big banks tomorrow morning. Elsewhere, PepsiCo (PEP 142.13, +3.69, +2.7%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup, and Twilio (TWLO 329.72, +23.48, +7.7%) agreed to acquire Segment for approximately $3.2 billion in stock. \n* With the U.S. Treasury market closed for Columbus Day, commentary mainly focused on the bullish price action in equities. Consequently, it\u2019s reasonable to believe that a fear of missing out on further gains was another factor that fueled the positive momentum in the market. The S&amp;P 500 closed within 1.5% of its all-time high. \n* Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, the Consumer Price Index for September, the Treasury Budget for September, and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September are scheduled for Tuesday.

        "selftext": "Hi Investors,\n\n**This one is specifically for those who invest in the Stock/Financial markets.**  \n\n\nLately I have noticed a couple of things: \n\nFirst, many traders who have trading accounts under $25,000 have told me that the most frustrating thing about trading an account that size is the PDT rule ([Pattern Day Trading Rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/patterndaytrader.asp)). Or having to trade a cash account because of the PDT rule.\n\nSecondly, almost all of the day traders that I speak to don't know very much about trading Futures. More importantly, they **don't know that the PDT does not exist for Futures**, therefore you can trade an account much smaller than $25,000 without any restrictions regarding number of trades you can place over a given period of time.\n\nThe other thing that many aren't aware of are E-Mini and also Micro E-Mini Futures. These products have a smaller contract size and are therefore much more accessible to the average trader.\n\nFor an introduction to what Micro E-Mini Futures are, [I recommend this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4Ie18MMBU) with guest presenter from the CME Group.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 5th, 2020.\n\n# **Trump\u2019s health and fiscal stimulus fight will steer the markets in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/trumps-health-and-the-fiscal-s.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump\u2019s health and the state of a fiscal stimulus package will be the main focus for markets in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; In the early morning hours Friday, President Donald Trump tweeted that he and the first lady tested positive for Covid. Stocks sold off hard, but the S&amp;P 500 came off its lows in Friday trading and closed down just under 1%. It was up 1.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; The market was helped by signs that a stimulus package is still a possibility, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked airlines not to furlough workers. She promised either a stand alone aid bill, or a bigger negotiated relief legislation that would help the industry.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to watch health updates from the White House medical staff, and it\u2019s going to watch how the president communicates with the public,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives at BTIG. \u201cWill we see him in person in the next week in any form? What\u2019s his volume of tweets? All as a way to first gauge the severity of the case.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Trump and Melania Trump are reported to have mild cases, but as time goes on the market will turn to how the illness could impact the presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; Former Vice President Joe Biden gained slightly in the polls after the first debate Tuesday night, and now the calendar for further debates is in question. The market has seemingly warmed to Biden, and even though he would raise taxes, it is assumed Democrats would quickly pass a major infrastructure package if there is a Democratic sweep of Congress.\n*****\n&gt; Trump, however, is widely seen on Wall Street as stronger on the economy and better for markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done from a campaign perspective, is you\u2019ve taken away the thing that gives him the most energy - his ability to interact with crowds,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe president had wanted to paint the economic recovery of the last three or four months as the cornerstone, and this basically puts the virus back as topic number 1, number 2 and number 3. And it\u2019s all the more so because the data is coming in weaker than expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The market is fixated on the prospect of stimulus to help business, the unemployed and state and local governments. The House passed a $2.2 trillion package this week, but there is still no agreement with Republicans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pushed for a $1.6 trillion package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s an underlying bid under the market because nobody wants to be super short if we get a stimulus approved, but you can\u2019t be too long in case his mild symptoms turn into severe symptoms,\u201d said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com. \u201cWe\u2019re in a tough spot but overall we\u2019re still pretty constructive.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the fact the president is now ill could hurt confidence and slow down some of the improvement in the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe underlying tone is, again, whether its directly or later, there\u2019s going to be stimulus,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201d\u2019Whether it\u2019s this month or November, this reinforces the need for stimulus because the president falling ill signals to, at the margin, the person whose thinking about going out to dinner to think again. It\u2019s a significant economic and psychological hindrance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Also coming up in the week ahead is a speech Tuesday by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to the National Association of Business Economists.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also expected to push for the stimulus package to boost the economy so the recovery does not stall.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think his whole objective is to try to get Congress and the Administration to sign onto a fiscal rescue package,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cHe\u2019ll all but come out and say [the recovery] is not a \u2018V.\u2019 Without additional support from lawmakers, risks are pretty high that we backtrack. I think that\u2019s the kind of outlook he\u2019s going to give. It\u2019s going to be full-throated.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; September\u2019s employment report, released Friday, was seen by some as a warning that the economy is not rebounding as expected. There were 661,000 jobs added in September, well below the 800,000 expected.\n*****\n&gt; Besides Powell, there are a half dozen other Fed speakers. There are also minutes from the Fed\u2019s last minute released Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3J0V6o1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TI8ImmZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/90v084y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne7m07y.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UZt0DJ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HA7KsPc.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NzmRLPp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eqS3Lk4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/k9v1hZX.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UtkozzH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KNI9qkQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/OM44UFj.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Make Up Your !@#$%^&amp;* Mind!\n\n&gt; We've all had versions of this conversation where you or the person you were talking to just couldn't make up their mind. At the end of the day, it only causes trouble and plans are ruined.\n\n&gt; The market is having its own back and forth this year trying to decide between growth and value. Just today, growth stocks are getting slaughtered while value stocks are up marginally. As an example, the Russell 1000 Growth index is down 1.8% on the day while the Russell 1000 Value index has managed to rally 0.25%. The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the Russell 1000 Growth index and the Russell 1000 Value index for each day in 2020. Today's performance spread between the two indices marks the ninth time this year that value has outperformed growth by more than two percentage points. At the other extreme, there have also been eight trading days where growth outperformed value by more than two percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-2020.png))**\n\n&gt; So how does this year's frequency of days where the performance spread between the two indices was more than two percentage points stack up to other years? The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the two indices going all the way back to 1990. Over the last thirty years, the only two periods where we saw a frequency of these large daily dislocations was back in 2008 and the period spanning 2000 and 2001. In fact, with 17 days this year where the performance spread between the two indices was greater than two percentage points, the only other years that saw a higher frequency of large dislocations were 2000 (54) and 2001 (28). If you think the market has been indecisive this year, in 2000 we saw these types of daily dislocations an average of once per week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-All-Years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n&gt; But October has become a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October\u2019s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Have Democratic Sweeps Meant for the S&amp;P 500?\n\n&gt; Headed into the first presidential debate Tuesday night, betting markets (ElectionBettingOdds.com) placed Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the slight favorite to take the White House in November. The debate resulted in Biden gaining another 5 percentage point chance of winning the Presidency. As of this morning, Biden's odds to win are at 59.8% versus Trump's odds of 38.9%. Additionally, Democrats are slight favorites to win control of the Senate (58.4% to 41.5%) and big favorites to maintain the House (82.8% to 17.1%). Given these odds, in the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the three months before Election Day through three months after Election Day for all election years post-WWII that resulted in a sweep of the executive and legislative branch by the Democrats.\n\n&gt; As shown, on average the S&amp;P 500 has been on the decline in the weeks leading up to Election Day, though in the days just before the Election there has been a small rally that sharply reverses once the results come in. After the initial post-Election drop, the market has trended a bit higher, but by three months after the Election, it has only found itself around the same levels as Election Day; on average a 2.6% loss versus where the index stood three months prior.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps3.png))**\n\n&gt; The composite shown above is comprised of six different years: 1948, 1960, 1964, 1976, 1992, and 2008. While on average the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower, it is not necessarily a sure-fire thing. For example, 1948 and 2008 were the only years that saw the S&amp;P 500 trade and stay significantly lower in the wake of the election. In 1976, there was similarly a sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the election, but the index did make its way back up to the highs of that six-month time frame later on albeit no new high was put in place. Meanwhile, 1960, 1964, and 1992 all saw the S&amp;P 500 run higher after the election even despite some periods of consolidation after initial moves higher. In our B.I.G. Tips report from Tuesday, we show these same charts for all Presidential election years post WWII including a look at the average performance given every potential election outcome.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Current Returns Stack Up to History\n\n&gt; Even after September's weakness, the S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month total return stood at an impressive 14.9%. Given the events of the last 12 months, one could even say that performance is remarkable. What's even crazier is that the S&amp;P 500's performance over the last 12 months is more than three times stronger than the 12 month period before that (+4.25%). The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's annualized total returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares that performance to the historical average return of the index over those same time periods.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's historical average 12-month return is 11.7%, so the current 14.9% gain exceeds that average by more than three full percentage points. Over a two-year window, though, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 9.4% is more than a full percentage point below the historical average. Looking further out, the S&amp;P 500's trailing five and ten-year annualized return has been much stronger than average, which makes sense given the long bull market we were in. Over a 20 year window, though, the S&amp;P 500 is only just starting to work off some of the declines from the dot-com bust and as a result, the 6.4% annualized gain is a four and a half percentage points below the long-term average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show how the current performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each of the time frames shown compares to all other periods on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's performance over the last year, ranks just below 56th percentile of all other periods, while the two-year performance ranks just below the 42nd percentile. Even as the five and ten-year periods have seen well above average returns, they still rank in just the mid-60s on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's ranking over a 20-year time period is a completely different story ranking in single-digits on a percentile basis. Even with the equity market right near record highs, the last two decades have been forgettable for US equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns-Ranks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonals Are Back In Style Again\n\n&gt; There is no denying that market seasonality has not worked so well this year. But we have been here before and history is on our side. Over the long term, intermediate term and short term market seasonality has suffered brief periods when seasonality was overridden by more powerful forces. The COVID pandemic and economic shutdown certainly qualifies. But it is only a matter of time until repetitive human behavior patterns and people and institutions return to moving money around in the usual daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and seasonal patterns.\n\n&gt; The return of perennial September weakness is emblematic of a return to normal market behavior and a reflection of the fact that despite the continuing concerns about surges in coronavirus cases life is beginning to return to normal. In our area, about 25-30 miles north of New York City, our kids are beginning hybrid learning, playing rugby, lacrosse and other sports (yes with some COVID protocols, but tackling and facing-off), golf outings are happening and people are going to restaurants and out and about.\n\n&gt; The chart here shows the historical One-Year Pattern of the S&amp;P 500 Since 1950 versus 2020. The black line shows the seasonal pattern since 1950. The blue represents the pattern since 1988. We use 1988 as it is the first year after the 1987 Crash when the market underwent a major systemic change with the implementation of downside protection circuit breakers and collars. It is noteworthy how the seasonal pattern persists during both the 70-year and 31-year timeframes.\n\n&gt; 2020 is plotted on the right axis due to the magnitude of the move this year. The yellow box highlights the rebirth of seasonality this September, especially during this notoriously negative Week After Triple Witching Week as detailed page 108 of the 2020 Almanac, indicated by the two black arrows\n\n&gt; Years like 1980, 1982, 2009 and 2016 with unseasonably early weakness and bear markets like 2020 returned to normal seasonal patterns in short order. And years like 1954, 1958, 1980, 1982, 1995 and 2009 that exhibited double-digit gains in the Worst Six Months still proceeded to deliver further sizable gains in the subsequent Best Six Months (page 52, STA 2020). We believe the return of market seasonality is upon us. So remain cautious through the end of September and be alert to Octoberophobia, but remain ready to pounce on our Best Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal, when it triggers.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0a4a6ba18e7d903b198c8fa7d6cf8bc4/9c2d30c4da9ff340-d7/s500x750/eb0c36b5ff7eec394f463ca8420054c22a88010f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 2nd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiTS26b5YO8))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$RGP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/E7qqUjk.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zy3ktow.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pt0NiLh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yaviiRp.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Vdaqsaj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ipdesH4.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Domino's Pizza, Inc. $433.78\n**Domino's Pizza, Inc.

        "selftext": "A recent video on Chargepoint looks at whether it is a good long term investment: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxhOegywUZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxhOegywUZE)\n\nAlot of the sheen of SPACs has been removed lately which IMO is actually a good thing. We now have to pick and choose which companies have a clear path to profitability whereby fundamentals and risk/reward propositions are a important process to DD.\n\nChargePoint was the unicorn every SPAC investor wanted to invest in, but does it fundamentally hold medium term (1-5 years) and long term (10+ years)? IMO, it all depends on two factors:\n\n1) Will the economy be in a recession in 2021-2022 or will the economy bounce back? If there is a recession, the demand for EV's will be stifled and thereby the need for EV infrastructure will also be dramatically reduced. ChargePoint claims that in order to be profitable in a few years, they need to increase their annual growth by 58% in 2022 versus their modest 35% actual growth rates in 2018 and 2019. As the video suggests, there is still alot of questions as to how they can increase their growth dramatically to reach profitability.\n\n2) Like Bitcoin and its influence on other cryptocurrencies, Tesla is in the driver's seat to drive the EV sector. If the growth of Tesla is not what is advertised, I don't see a clear path for ChargePoint and other EV companies to grow within the next few years (medium term), although in 15-20 years I see EV's as almost a for sure thing like the Internet.\n\nLet me know what you guys think and whether you are invested in ChargePoint. Personally I am optimistic in the future and have a small position in SBE for a cost basis of 12.20/share.",

        "selftext": "Daily Synopsis - \n\n* The S&amp;P 500 increased +1.61% today while the NASDaq outperformed by (+3.12%). The Russell 2000 advanced (+0.67%). The Dow ended in positive territory at (+0.89%)\n* The best performing sector was Information Technology(+2.73%) while Materials(-0.17%)was the worst performer.\n* Briefly recapping the latest on stimulus, House Democrats and Senate Republicans rejected the $1.8 trillion offer from the White House for different reasons. Based on the relatively broad-based advance in the market, investors presumably remained in agreement that a deal will eventually be reached, either under the current administration or new leadership in 2021. \n* The financials sector (+1.1%), undeterred by the lack of deal, had a solid outing ahead of earnings reports from several big banks tomorrow morning. Elsewhere, PepsiCo (PEP 142.13, +3.69, +2.7%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup, and Twilio (TWLO 329.72, +23.48, +7.7%) agreed to acquire Segment for approximately $3.2 billion in stock. \n* With the U.S. Treasury market closed for Columbus Day, commentary mainly focused on the bullish price action in equities. Consequently, it\u2019s reasonable to believe that a fear of missing out on further gains was another factor that fueled the positive momentum in the market. The S&amp;P 500 closed within 1.5% of its all-time high. \n* Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, the Consumer Price Index for September, the Treasury Budget for September, and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September are scheduled for Tuesday.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 5th, 2020.\n\n# **Trump\u2019s health and fiscal stimulus fight will steer the markets in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/trumps-health-and-the-fiscal-s.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump\u2019s health and the state of a fiscal stimulus package will be the main focus for markets in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; In the early morning hours Friday, President Donald Trump tweeted that he and the first lady tested positive for Covid. Stocks sold off hard, but the S&amp;P 500 came off its lows in Friday trading and closed down just under 1%. It was up 1.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; The market was helped by signs that a stimulus package is still a possibility, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked airlines not to furlough workers. She promised either a stand alone aid bill, or a bigger negotiated relief legislation that would help the industry.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to watch health updates from the White House medical staff, and it\u2019s going to watch how the president communicates with the public,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives at BTIG. \u201cWill we see him in person in the next week in any form? What\u2019s his volume of tweets? All as a way to first gauge the severity of the case.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Trump and Melania Trump are reported to have mild cases, but as time goes on the market will turn to how the illness could impact the presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; Former Vice President Joe Biden gained slightly in the polls after the first debate Tuesday night, and now the calendar for further debates is in question. The market has seemingly warmed to Biden, and even though he would raise taxes, it is assumed Democrats would quickly pass a major infrastructure package if there is a Democratic sweep of Congress.\n*****\n&gt; Trump, however, is widely seen on Wall Street as stronger on the economy and better for markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done from a campaign perspective, is you\u2019ve taken away the thing that gives him the most energy - his ability to interact with crowds,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe president had wanted to paint the economic recovery of the last three or four months as the cornerstone, and this basically puts the virus back as topic number 1, number 2 and number 3. And it\u2019s all the more so because the data is coming in weaker than expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The market is fixated on the prospect of stimulus to help business, the unemployed and state and local governments. The House passed a $2.2 trillion package this week, but there is still no agreement with Republicans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pushed for a $1.6 trillion package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s an underlying bid under the market because nobody wants to be super short if we get a stimulus approved, but you can\u2019t be too long in case his mild symptoms turn into severe symptoms,\u201d said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com. \u201cWe\u2019re in a tough spot but overall we\u2019re still pretty constructive.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the fact the president is now ill could hurt confidence and slow down some of the improvement in the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe underlying tone is, again, whether its directly or later, there\u2019s going to be stimulus,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201d\u2019Whether it\u2019s this month or November, this reinforces the need for stimulus because the president falling ill signals to, at the margin, the person whose thinking about going out to dinner to think again. It\u2019s a significant economic and psychological hindrance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Also coming up in the week ahead is a speech Tuesday by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to the National Association of Business Economists.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also expected to push for the stimulus package to boost the economy so the recovery does not stall.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think his whole objective is to try to get Congress and the Administration to sign onto a fiscal rescue package,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cHe\u2019ll all but come out and say [the recovery] is not a \u2018V.\u2019 Without additional support from lawmakers, risks are pretty high that we backtrack. I think that\u2019s the kind of outlook he\u2019s going to give. It\u2019s going to be full-throated.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; September\u2019s employment report, released Friday, was seen by some as a warning that the economy is not rebounding as expected. There were 661,000 jobs added in September, well below the 800,000 expected.\n*****\n&gt; Besides Powell, there are a half dozen other Fed speakers. There are also minutes from the Fed\u2019s last minute released Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3J0V6o1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TI8ImmZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/90v084y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne7m07y.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UZt0DJ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HA7KsPc.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NzmRLPp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eqS3Lk4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/k9v1hZX.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UtkozzH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KNI9qkQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/OM44UFj.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Make Up Your !@#$%^&amp;* Mind!\n\n&gt; We've all had versions of this conversation where you or the person you were talking to just couldn't make up their mind. At the end of the day, it only causes trouble and plans are ruined.\n\n&gt; The market is having its own back and forth this year trying to decide between growth and value. Just today, growth stocks are getting slaughtered while value stocks are up marginally. As an example, the Russell 1000 Growth index is down 1.8% on the day while the Russell 1000 Value index has managed to rally 0.25%. The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the Russell 1000 Growth index and the Russell 1000 Value index for each day in 2020. Today's performance spread between the two indices marks the ninth time this year that value has outperformed growth by more than two percentage points. At the other extreme, there have also been eight trading days where growth outperformed value by more than two percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-2020.png))**\n\n&gt; So how does this year's frequency of days where the performance spread between the two indices was more than two percentage points stack up to other years? The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the two indices going all the way back to 1990. Over the last thirty years, the only two periods where we saw a frequency of these large daily dislocations was back in 2008 and the period spanning 2000 and 2001. In fact, with 17 days this year where the performance spread between the two indices was greater than two percentage points, the only other years that saw a higher frequency of large dislocations were 2000 (54) and 2001 (28). If you think the market has been indecisive this year, in 2000 we saw these types of daily dislocations an average of once per week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-All-Years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n&gt; But October has become a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October\u2019s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Have Democratic Sweeps Meant for the S&amp;P 500?\n\n&gt; Headed into the first presidential debate Tuesday night, betting markets (ElectionBettingOdds.com) placed Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the slight favorite to take the White House in November. The debate resulted in Biden gaining another 5 percentage point chance of winning the Presidency. As of this morning, Biden's odds to win are at 59.8% versus Trump's odds of 38.9%. Additionally, Democrats are slight favorites to win control of the Senate (58.4% to 41.5%) and big favorites to maintain the House (82.8% to 17.1%). Given these odds, in the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the three months before Election Day through three months after Election Day for all election years post-WWII that resulted in a sweep of the executive and legislative branch by the Democrats.\n\n&gt; As shown, on average the S&amp;P 500 has been on the decline in the weeks leading up to Election Day, though in the days just before the Election there has been a small rally that sharply reverses once the results come in. After the initial post-Election drop, the market has trended a bit higher, but by three months after the Election, it has only found itself around the same levels as Election Day; on average a 2.6% loss versus where the index stood three months prior.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps3.png))**\n\n&gt; The composite shown above is comprised of six different years: 1948, 1960, 1964, 1976, 1992, and 2008. While on average the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower, it is not necessarily a sure-fire thing. For example, 1948 and 2008 were the only years that saw the S&amp;P 500 trade and stay significantly lower in the wake of the election. In 1976, there was similarly a sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the election, but the index did make its way back up to the highs of that six-month time frame later on albeit no new high was put in place. Meanwhile, 1960, 1964, and 1992 all saw the S&amp;P 500 run higher after the election even despite some periods of consolidation after initial moves higher. In our B.I.G. Tips report from Tuesday, we show these same charts for all Presidential election years post WWII including a look at the average performance given every potential election outcome.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Current Returns Stack Up to History\n\n&gt; Even after September's weakness, the S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month total return stood at an impressive 14.9%. Given the events of the last 12 months, one could even say that performance is remarkable. What's even crazier is that the S&amp;P 500's performance over the last 12 months is more than three times stronger than the 12 month period before that (+4.25%). The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's annualized total returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares that performance to the historical average return of the index over those same time periods.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's historical average 12-month return is 11.7%, so the current 14.9% gain exceeds that average by more than three full percentage points. Over a two-year window, though, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 9.4% is more than a full percentage point below the historical average. Looking further out, the S&amp;P 500's trailing five and ten-year annualized return has been much stronger than average, which makes sense given the long bull market we were in. Over a 20 year window, though, the S&amp;P 500 is only just starting to work off some of the declines from the dot-com bust and as a result, the 6.4% annualized gain is a four and a half percentage points below the long-term average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show how the current performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each of the time frames shown compares to all other periods on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's performance over the last year, ranks just below 56th percentile of all other periods, while the two-year performance ranks just below the 42nd percentile. Even as the five and ten-year periods have seen well above average returns, they still rank in just the mid-60s on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's ranking over a 20-year time period is a completely different story ranking in single-digits on a percentile basis. Even with the equity market right near record highs, the last two decades have been forgettable for US equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns-Ranks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonals Are Back In Style Again\n\n&gt; There is no denying that market seasonality has not worked so well this year. But we have been here before and history is on our side. Over the long term, intermediate term and short term market seasonality has suffered brief periods when seasonality was overridden by more powerful forces. The COVID pandemic and economic shutdown certainly qualifies. But it is only a matter of time until repetitive human behavior patterns and people and institutions return to moving money around in the usual daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and seasonal patterns.\n\n&gt; The return of perennial September weakness is emblematic of a return to normal market behavior and a reflection of the fact that despite the continuing concerns about surges in coronavirus cases life is beginning to return to normal. In our area, about 25-30 miles north of New York City, our kids are beginning hybrid learning, playing rugby, lacrosse and other sports (yes with some COVID protocols, but tackling and facing-off), golf outings are happening and people are going to restaurants and out and about.\n\n&gt; The chart here shows the historical One-Year Pattern of the S&amp;P 500 Since 1950 versus 2020. The black line shows the seasonal pattern since 1950. The blue represents the pattern since 1988. We use 1988 as it is the first year after the 1987 Crash when the market underwent a major systemic change with the implementation of downside protection circuit breakers and collars. It is noteworthy how the seasonal pattern persists during both the 70-year and 31-year timeframes.\n\n&gt; 2020 is plotted on the right axis due to the magnitude of the move this year. The yellow box highlights the rebirth of seasonality this September, especially during this notoriously negative Week After Triple Witching Week as detailed page 108 of the 2020 Almanac, indicated by the two black arrows\n\n&gt; Years like 1980, 1982, 2009 and 2016 with unseasonably early weakness and bear markets like 2020 returned to normal seasonal patterns in short order. And years like 1954, 1958, 1980, 1982, 1995 and 2009 that exhibited double-digit gains in the Worst Six Months still proceeded to deliver further sizable gains in the subsequent Best Six Months (page 52, STA 2020). We believe the return of market seasonality is upon us. So remain cautious through the end of September and be alert to Octoberophobia, but remain ready to pounce on our Best Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal, when it triggers.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0a4a6ba18e7d903b198c8fa7d6cf8bc4/9c2d30c4da9ff340-d7/s500x750/eb0c36b5ff7eec394f463ca8420054c22a88010f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 2nd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$RGP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/E7qqUjk.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zy3ktow.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pt0NiLh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yaviiRp.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Vdaqsaj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ipdesH4.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Domino's Pizza, Inc. $433.78\n**Domino's Pizza, Inc.

        "selftext": "**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**\n\nFirst off, let's set the scene.\n\nThe stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.\n\nEconomic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.\n\nThe correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&amp;P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, it is the Central\u00a0Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.\n\nIn doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion in US history.\n\nHowever, this is not a particularly\u00a0meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.\n\nFormer Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:\n\n*\u201cThe central issue is we\u2019re developing into a plutocracy. We\u2019ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they\u2019re rich because they\u2019re smart and constructive.\"*\n\nThe reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.\n\nNow, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.\n\n*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.\n\nWe are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.\n\nIn fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nInflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.\n\nDeflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.\n\nThat's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.\n\nWell, no.\n\nIf you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.\n\nAs the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt.\u00a0\n\nThis is why central banks fear deflation so much.\n\nHowever, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...\n\n**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**\n\nThe increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.\n\n[Throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. This is *not* a new phenomenon.\n\nAll technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create \"supply side shocks\", meaning that they allow for more intensive\u00a0use of resources\u00a0and thus higher production. With more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall.\u00a0\n\nIn the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.\n\nIt is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: AI\n\nAccording to Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder and CEO of The Blackstone Group who has a net worth of $17.6BN:\n\n*\"This is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology\"*\n\nMoreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [Zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idUKKBN21K1C7) of exactly this.\n\nOld legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it.\u00a0\n\nAs an example, if you folded a piece of paper 51 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 51 times, it would reach the Sun!\n\n**PART 3/4 - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY:**\n\nThe question is: how does this play out?\n\nIn the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, not\u00a0who is President for 4 to 8 years.\n\nIn reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. We have seen [what happens when a President doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91RZko5Gw)...\n\nOne could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:\n\n1. Divide and Conquer and\n2. [Order from Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx7PnMtCeY)\n\nAs we have seen many times in the past, herd psychology is [worryingly easy to manipulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M26-B44qQIs)...\n\nSpeaking of the censorship, in his book Antifragile, Nassim Taleb discusses the anti fragility of information.\u00a0\n\nInformation feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.\n\nA fantastic example of this process is what has happened with London Real: they were banned on LinkedIn and David Icke's interview was censored. Now, regardless of what you think of this particular channel or your thoughts on David Icke and the theories provided, censoring information in this way *actually spreads it more virally*.\n\nIt's fascinating to observe how many views the videos regarding the bans and censorship have relative to the others. And the [impact this has had on subscribers](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/londonrealtv).\n\nIt is always easier to blame a bigger enemy (or create a new one) rather than to admit it's a structural problem.\n\nTherefore, you avoid short term pain...whatever the cost.\n\nThe real question is [if and when this situation will lead to social unrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4GMUamUjT8)...\n\n**PART 4/4 - INTELLECTUAL CAPITALISM:**\n\nThe depth and width of jobs impacted by AI will continue to increase in the future.\n\nNow this will not necessarily happen straight away.\n\nHowever, our transition from commodity capitalism to intellectual capitalism is inevitable and the people and nations who fight against this trend will be on the wrong side of history.\n\nFrom a practical investment perspective, and disclaimer this is not investment advice, network effects are a crucial aspect to consider moving forwards.\n\nEssentially, this means that the value of the network\u00a0increases with each additional user - all of the tech monopolies have exhibited this property.\n\nAn asset which could in time demonstrate very strong network effects is Bitcoin.\n\n[Looking at the market cap relative to other asset classes](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/), Bitcoin provides an asymmetric investment opportunity.\n\nOnly time will tell...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE)",

I know you're thinking, \"Remdesivir is a Gilead drug\". Well there isn't moving a $60 stock up much further -  but there is a near penny stock chance of possibly a $KODK like return. $BSGM has a drug that is almost into Phase 3 trials: Merimepodib.

Trump is also willing to take a whole bunch of trial drugs - and here's a penny's chance at something big. This is like the $NVAX move, maybe even better.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there\u2019s a will to get something done.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n&gt; But he said even if there\u2019s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cI actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,\u201d said Keon.\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&amp;P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cQ2 reporting season saw S&amp;P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n&gt; The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&amp;P 500  down about 10%. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,\u201d they noted.\n*****\n&gt; The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there\u2019s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think from the market\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are many moving parts here, and they\u2019re all moving in different directions,\u201d said Block. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. \u201cI think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that\u2019s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n&gt; In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n&gt; Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n&gt; Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&amp;P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n&gt; As shown, the average stock in the broad S&amp;P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n&gt; The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n&gt; If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&amp;P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are 46 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n&gt; General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # News High for Net New Highs\n\n&gt; Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&amp;P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n&gt; As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&amp;P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Breadth Booming\n\n&gt; One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&amp;P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n&gt; While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n&gt; With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&amp;P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n&gt; October\u2019s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n&gt; With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9deab1b6431375946cf0104830334e3a/1b58acd0d015098f-cf/s500x750/1a07b8cea97519bcce57adae974614a0e426effb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 9th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw7sXu8pcPw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IIowf1B.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2lSi1kT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Wj80iaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZY9TwgO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5LizPLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oIstn4O.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKfmmCC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q3isONG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Swqo1ow.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

        "selftext": "Lou Pai was a recluse.\n\nExtremely introverted.\n\nVery reserved.\n\nThat is...inside the office.\n\nOutside the office...\n\nPai symbolised the legendary lavishness and excesses of Enron's corporate culture.\n\nEven though he was married, he would spend inordinate amounts of time during and after working hours at the strip club.\n\nHe would use the Enron corporate jet for personal commuting.\n\nAnd he would charge several hundred dollars worth of lunches for himself and friends to the corporate expense account (i.e. he was living the so called American Dream).\n\nThe Enron Scandal surfaced in October 2001 when it was revealed that America's seventh largest company was involved in corporate corruption and accounting fraud. \n\nThe scandal surrounding the Enron energy company had political implications due to Enron's close links with the White House. The Deregulation of Enron allowed the corporation to operate largely free from US government scrutiny. There was also misrepresentation in earnings reports, a fraudulent 'energy crisis' and embezzlement by Enron Executives. \n\n***The Enron scandal eventually led to the bankruptcy of the company, and Enron shareholders lost $74 billion leading up to its bankruptcy, and Enron's employees lost their jobs and billions of dollars in pension benefits.*** \n\n***Enron CEO Jeff Skilling was sentenced to 24 years in prison, former CEO Kenneth Lay died from a massive heart attack before serving time. Another Enron executive, Clifford Baxter, committed suicide in 2002 shortly before he was due to testify before Congress.***\n\n***But what about Lou Pai?***\n\nPai joined Enron in 1987, when it was just a regional energy supplier.\n\nHe became one of future CEO Jeff Skilling's top lieutenants, primarily tasked with detailing and implementing Skilling's vision of transforming Enron into a de facto energy commodities-trading firm.\n\nDuring his Enron career, Skilling put Pai in charge of multiple Enron subsidiaries.\n\nPai was CEO of the EES (Enron Energy Services) subsidiary from March 1997 until May 2001.\n\n***Pai's frequent strip club visits during his time at Enron proved to be a blessing in disguise.***\n\nIt led to an affair with stripper Melanie Fewell (who was also married) and resulted in a pregnancy.\n\nUpon learning of the affair, Pai's then-wife of over 20 years Lanna, with whom he has two children, filed for divorce.\n\nThis is the crazy part:\n\n***To satisfy the financial terms of his divorce settlement, Pai cashed out $250 million of his Enron stock, just months before the company's stock price collapsed.***\n\nPai's early sell-off shielded him from the insider trading charges levelled against other Enron executives who had also secretly sold-off large amounts of stock before the company's financial situation was publicly known.\n\nSomehow, through sheer luck (or was it!), Pai had managed to secure a win for himself, his ex-wife and his new wife, Melanie Pai.\n\n***While his colleagues were in jail or dead, Pai was using his new found wealth to become the second-largest land owner in Colorado after he purchased the 77500-acre Taylor Ranch for $23 million in 1999. He sold the property in June 2004 for $60 million.***\n\nPai did have to cough up some cash though:\n\nIn 2008, he agreed to resolve civil insider trading charges against him with an out-of-court settlement of $31.5 million.\n\nPai was not charged with any *criminal* wrongdoing in the Enron scandal and exercised his 5th Amendment rights in the subsequent Enron class action lawsuits.\n\n***But still, it's fair to say that the tale of Lou Pai offers a lesson for corporate executives looking to use divorce as a hustle to liquidate their stock holdings without upsetting regulators or shareholders.***\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3UOuhRXys8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3UOuhRXys8)",

        "selftext": "I think there is a big way to make consistent money similar to trade deals and corona virus hype that people are not exploiting yet.\n\nEverytime stimulus news is brought up, payment providers rally. You can see this inPaypal, Visa, and Square right now.\n\nThis is partially lead to SQ reaching all time highs and Paypal and Visa to be close as well. Even though in contact payments from SQ is down, they have converted successfully via cashapp to online movements.\n\nLooking at some flow, look at $SQ\u2019s run on Friday:\nhttps://gyazo.com/1eb2621dfb91c6e1e72b6380464e48cf\n\nThis is despite the news of a wavering stimulus. In fact, it looks like option flow is heading that way on [these payment providers](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1311683758735597569) with big movements happening earlier this month in anticipation of the stimulus.\n\nPaypal and Visa are looking a little beat up in comparison, but I think the flow will hit them too. I suspect Monday/Tuesday we get a lot of talk about the stimulus after the weekend and Trump\u2019s Friday offers. Plus pressure from the populace to make a deal happen.\n\nI am bullish on all payment companies as a result. What do you guys think?",

        "selftext": "\n \nFor Trading October 9th\n   \nSolid Day\n \nIBM Soars, DPZ Crushed\n \n \nToday\u2019s market was just a good, old-fashioned day without any major moves in the indexes, no earth-shattering tweets or end of days prognostications.  I didn\u2019t have any power, cable or phone last night so besides not putting out my Daily Note or closing comment, I miss the big debate.  Judging by the reports I heard today, all I missed was the fly on Pence\u2019s head!  The DJIA was = 122.06 (.43%), NASDAQ +56.38 (.50%), S&amp;P 500 +27.38 (.80%), the Russell was the big winner again +17.51 (1.09%) and the Transports +72.54 (.62%) and a new all-time high!  The internals were good with NYSE 3:1 and NASDAQ 2:1 positive and all I can say is that it was very a very \u201cGoldilocks\u201d kind of day.\n\nLooking at adding NEM and GLD calls, and a reentry into CVS and UNG calls probably...\n                                                                                                                           \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video: https://youtu.be/lXD_OB9CrYU\n \nSECTORS:  There was good news for holders of Eaton Vance (EV) being taken over by Morgan Stanley (MS) for about $7 billion in cash and stock.  MS was -2.20 premarket but right after the open it started back up and finished $49.35 +.64, and since it included stock, the rise sent EV higher to close $60.78 +19.84 (48.4%).  \nIBM also had news that sent it higher.  They gave guidance and then announced that they are going to split the company up and make the pieces \u201cpure plays\u201d in an effort to get a better valuation for the parts.  It looked great pre-market but by the open it had given up about 1/3 of the gains and finished the day up $7.42 (6%) after the early market up 12%.  Same situation with REGN, trading up to $618 or so +$26, but the stock never made it there when the real market opened\u2026and then traded back to $598 and closed $599.70 +8.00, near the lows, but still ahead 1.24%.\nOn the downside, the DISASTER DU JOUR, was a name that I wrote about last week, WWR, Westwater Resources, which went from $1.52 to $14.50 on news that Mr. Trump had signed an executive order relating to securing \u201crare earth\u201d and critical minerals last week.

We had 750 shares of GBTC and sold off 250 last week at $13.93 and still have 500 with a cost of $8.45. GBTC closed $11.86 +.89 today.\n \n Tomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

Several banks reported this morning and even though they easily beat and started on the upside, by midday they faltered and finished lower.  The DJIA was -157.71 (.55%), NASDAQ -12.36 (.10%), S&amp;P 500 -22.29 &gt;53%), the Russell -12.21 (.74%) and the Transports the biggest loser -97.22 (.82%).  Internals were about what you\u2019d expect at 2:1 down NYSE and 1.7:1 on NAZ.  The DJIA was exactly the opposite of yesterday with 23 down and 7 higher.  BA was the biggest loser paring $34 DP\u2019s and DIS and HD were the biggest gainers adding $27 and 23 respectively.\n\nTonight\u2019s closing comment video: https://youtu.be/CO-kgUMupeo\n\nSECTORS:  There was good news for the banks but by midday it just didn\u2019t matter.  Both JPM and C had good reports and were higher early, but both closed near the lows of the day, in negative territory.  DIS announced a reorganization of the company to stress the streaming business and although it was higher last night and this morning, it still managed a net gain on the day.  NFLX is discontinuing their \u201ctry us for a month for free\u201d and the market loved it sending the stock back to a triple top that breaks out with a close over $556.55  My bet is that it will go thru shortly.

While I recognize that CNK is not quite a penny stock, it represents a great opportunity and I don't want you guys to potentially miss out, after doing your due diligence of course :) Several Redditors were mad when I posted my DD of my 170% gain on AIMT only after the fact. So here I am. \n\nCinema Stocks took a big hit following Regal Cinema\u2019s closure of their theaters. HOWEVER, despite the extreme pessimism facing movie theater stocks, I see huge upside potential for Cinemark Holdings. Some of the highlights: strong insider buying, unwarranted pessimism indicating a high likelihood of \"short squeeze\", cash runway into q4 2021 assuming theaters are closed (which is already not the case with 80% of CNK's theaters opened). Short-term catalysts include the reopening of California and New York theaters and a potential vaccine after the election which would instantly lead to at least a 30% bump.\n\nAs the quote goes: \u201c\u00a0*If you own a stock where negatives are largely known, then* ***good news that comes as a surprise can have outsized effects***\\*.\\*\u201d - John Ness\n\nHere's my Due Diligence, and feel free to leave constructive criticism :)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhT5cgOr4Ek&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab\\_channel=FinancialGAINZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhT5cgOr4Ek&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=FinancialGAINZ)",

        "selftext": "So I have been having pretty decent success recently with sympathy plays and I see a lot of posts about stocks which are running and no one knows why.  I just wanted to write this short post about what are sympathy plays and how you can use them to identify potential runners  \n\n\n**What is a sympathy play** : As the name suggested, its a a stock  or stocks which run in sympathy to an event or something that is happen. For example, When Tesla was having the battery day, there was a lot of interest around battery stocks, BLM events result in a spurt of buying of stocks like BYFC or UNOEK , Hurricanes result in the purchase of generator stocks such as POLA and PPSI or RCTM and so on. Also if one sympathy stock is running, for example lets say a battery stock is running, there is potential that other battery stocks might start running.  \n\n\n**How do you use these sympathy plays** : Now the key thing is these runs can usually happen for  a day or multiple days but are often restricted to one or two days. Hence you would need perhaps a cash account or a Margin account over 25K if you prefer margin to get over the PDT headache.However if you are not playing many stocks, it might work well if  you plan your exits carefully. The way i do is I have watchlists for each of these sympathy plays ( I use thinkorswim which has unlimited watchlists).  I then check the resistance and support levels and set alerts to see when a stock breaks out over  a resistance level and there is sufficient scope for a gap up. If the stock breaks out and good volume (you could also setup a scanner), I then buy it and keep an eye on it and hopefully it keeps going up and gets sufficient volume. If you want to learn more about breakouts and resistance and support levels, I strongly recommend looking at these videos  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuboYnBc0t8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuboYnBc0t8)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTd6nlbcIZc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTd6nlbcIZc)  \n\n\n**Note**: I have no affiliation with this guy but he has taught me a lot and I am happy to direct more people to his channel   \n\n\nNow coming to how to build these watchlists, I created this mindmap of potential sympathy plays which I hope will be useful  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcyyxe695es51.png?width=1394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=521ca8ed22ce47060c83b4940471dd2ff8b07d46\n\nHappy to answer any questions you might have.",

        "selftext": "Intel is the absolute biggest joke of a semiconductor company I have ever seen.  \nI mean it, this company is a complete tar-pit you dumbass fucktards.  \nLets take inventory of what that dip-shit of a CEO, Bob Swan is sitting on.  \nIntel's core business of semiconductor fabrication is effectively dead.  \nTheir competitor TSMC entered in risk production phase for their 5nm   \nprocess in Q3 2019 \\[1\\]. They are entering 3nm risk production in 2021.  \n\\[2\\]. Those sorry shit eating cucks at intel have stated their 7nm process may  \nbe delayed until 2023 \\[3\\]. 2023? Are fucking serious right now Bob Swan? AND you  \nwont bring a 10nm desktop CPU to market until Q2 2021 while it was already 4 years late?  \nYour last earnings call was a fucking joke bobby boy. You tried to play it off like it was  \nall under control. So you went begging to TSMC to let you eat the cum from their sloppy anal  \nseconds. They made fun of you bobby. They even admitted that you're not shit and they are \"rescuing\" you and they  \n\"will not place extra effort to handle the CPU giant's orders\" \\[4\\]. You're fucking nothing.  \nFrom \"CPU giant\" to this?  \nTSM personally has each engineers cock massaged by a Taiwanese fuck-toy every morning before work.  \nTSM has the backing of the american government \\[7\\]. Yeah, a TAIWANESE chip fab is being backed and NOT  \nYOU. What the fuck do you offer bobby? A place so toxic to work that you can;'t even  \nfind a space nice enough keep Jim Keller safe\\[5\\]? Go fuck yourself, AMD is already on 7nm \\[4\\] and Lisa Su  \nis have her raging cock injected with even more erection enhancers AS WE SPEAK YOU FUCKING PISS DRINKER.  \nKeep buying Intel stock bobby \\[8\\]. Buy another 8,000 shares at $50. Your terrible excuse for an earnings call sent the stock  \nall the way down to the $40s immediately loosing you money. And guess what? I bought put options  \nat 11:46 AM today. Right before the dip. I have already broke even. I'm going to make  \nmoney of you losing money because a complete idiot and I know more about this business than you. Its so  \nfucking obvious how fucked you are swanny. You might as well stop fabbing silicone wafers and  \nfab a silicone butt for you to fuck during the next earnings call as that would be infinitely more valuable  \nthan whatever you could possible have prepared. What are you going to do, delay AGAIN? Or maybe  \nyou can get another one of your marketing goons to tell everyone on the call how great AMD is \\[9\\].  \nBuy Intel PUTS now and gather round to watch it burn.  \n\n\nINTL 53.5 PUT  \nReferences:  \n\\[1\\] https://www.extremetech.com/computing/289157-tsmc-completes-5nm-node-design-node-in-risk-production  \n\\[2\\] https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/07/19/tsmc-3nm-risk-production-in-2021-paves-the-way-to-2020-mass-production  \n\\[3\\] https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-says-first-10nm-desktop-cpus-land-in-second-half-of-2021  \n\\[4\\] https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-tsmc-not-long-term/  \n\\[5\\] https://www.anandtech.com/show/15846/jim-keller-resigns-from-intel-effective-immediately  \n\\[6\\] https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2020/07/intels-chief-engineer-out-amid-manufacturing-crisis.html  \n\\[7\\] https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/09/taiwan-semiconductor-secures-government-aid-for-us.aspx  \n\\[8\\] https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hznvk1/intel\\_ceo\\_bob\\_swan\\_just\\_bought\\_8000\\_shares\\_at/  \n\\[9\\] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFHBgb9SY1Y&amp;ab\\_channel=GamersNexus",

        "selftext": "This one analyst on Youtube is consistently exposing financial fiascos of bad companies like Ford, Nikola and Ignite.\n\nHe made a ton of videos about Dan Bilzerian\\`s CBD company Ignite and how they are on the brink of bankruptcy, but his [most recent one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okulbY-S6Ag) explains it the best in my opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Q1 financial results showed that the company was losing multiple times the amount of money that they make in revenue to fund the CEOs personal lifestyle (illegally) and their cash reserves were going to have burned through all their assets earlier this year.\n\n\\- Their Q2 financial results would have exposed all of that, which is why they have stated they would delay its publication \"due to corona\" til september 15th (shocker: it's still not here today).\n\n\\- Revenue and profit margins were so terribly terribly bad to begin with that there is NO WAY they could have turned the tide and avoid bankruptcy.\n\n\\- Just like his convicted felon of a father, Dan Bilzerian (CEO) acquired his armenian citizenship and is fleeing the country after committing financial fraud in order to avoid lawsuits and prison.\n\n\\- On october 2nd their exclusive product distributors in canada cut their business relationship with the company. They terminated the contract which can be due to one of two reasons: 1 - They don't get paid or 2 - The product does not sell which means Ignite doesn't have any money (but we already know that).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo sum it all up:\n\nIgnite is completely out of assets and massively in debt,  business partners recently cut ties with them and they are hiding their Q2 results that would expose all of that have been overdue for months now. To avoid the wave of lawsuits this whole disaster comes with the CEO fled to Armenia and is going to watch the collapse of his country via a twitter hashtag.\n\nThis is the easiest short in a long time.",

        "selftext": "So everyone I got into GME on Thursday with 10/30 12.5c I bought at 1.6 and was up 120% Friday midday but like a degen I held. They are currently 1.63 so im not really in any pain besides unrealized gains guh. \n\nThe arguments against GME :\n\n1. They are just buying Microsoft tablets.\n\nNot true they are entering a multi year strategic partnership which allows them to get some royalties when customers sign up for Xbox live (which will be free for 2 years when customers buy from them.. worth af). Also Microsoft closed all their stores so they are positioned from a customer access and strategic physical standpoint. \n\n2. Hurr durr all games are online no need for physical store. \n\nAutist, have you tried to download cod on your Xbox? Most people buy the cheap consoles with the least amount of space. Cod literally takes up a third of my memory. Same with gta v and other big games like Skyrim. You can only store so many games. \n\nPs5 just said 80-90% of games are going to be backwards compatible meaning discs and pre owned games will still be important and a physical marketplace will continue to exist. \n\n(Hurr durr cloud gaming will take over) \u2014&gt; agreed but google stadia is at early adoption stage and Jedi for Microsoft won\u2019t be viable until a few years. \n\nAlso nerds buy their fanboy shit from stores, and GameStop is the strongest nerd merch store nationally. \n\n\nIf anyone has any other reasons why calls won\u2019t be printing let me know if not shut the fuck up and buy the dip f*******\n\nThank me later or now with platinum I\u2019m trying to give edgy posts some stickers or shit.",

The slide was leaked and confirmed by [videocardz.com](https://videocardz.com) which is a very authentic source for tech news. A 16 core CPU that pulls 105w at a reasonable price will be GAME-CHANGING, and everyone will want to get their hands on it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4y8kvv3blq51.png?width=1569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0e772c7f4963cb569eb0024dcee84fb63b4697e\n\nAlong with this game-changing chip, 3 additional CPUs are rumored to be released.   \n\n\n\\#2\n\n**Big Navi having possibly better performance**  \nThere have been leaks off Newegg of Big Navi being better than the 3080. Even if the cards are neck in neck AMD will be able to paint the 6000 series cards as better due to minor discrepancies.\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\t5,120\t1,500\t16GB GDDR6\t512\t256-bit\t300  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\t3,840\t1,500\t12GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t200  \n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6700 XT\t2,560\t1,500\t6GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t150  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0zjsju2clq51.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14551f974837dfc21662c24da268d5284287d169\n\n  \n\\#3\n\n**NVIDIA 3rd Party Card Catastrophe**\n\n*(this section is from my previous post)*\n\nSo most GPUs are made by a 3rd party. AMD and NVIDIA make the actual \"brain\" of the GPU but 3rd party partners add onto it for better performance (very basic explanation). Don't ask me why this is, it is just mainly because of logistical reasons.\n\nBut that is not the point, the point is that the great majority of GPUs are third-party cards meaning that they get to change around the design of the PCB. The issue here is that some of these third-party partners cheaped out on little capacitors.\n\nBy cheapening out it is leading to bad power delivery. The only way to fix this rn is to downclock the card which the normal person doesn't know how to do and doesn't expect is necessary when they are buying a 500$+ piece of hardware.\n\nI feel like if there is a mass callback that will be bad PR. NVIDIA could always release drivers that make the cards run below their listed spec but i'm not sure if people will really want that even if the performance loss is marginal.\n\nEVGA already confirmed the suspicions that these cards were crashing because of capacitor issues. It may be different for other companies but at least for EVGA this is what they are saying currently.\n\n**But why does this matter??**\n\nPeople who were looking to pick up a next-gen GPU right away are now hesitant and will wait for AMDS offerings. The people who did return their GPUs will also possibly wait. Faulty cards will most likely get a down clock which will make Big Navi look better. It supposedly already is better and this 3-5% difference could really change people's minds.  \n\n\n\\#4 \n\nLisa Su is an absolute unit. She will for sure talk about their timeline and plans for 5nm/3nm. I am guessing that this will rally investors to invest because they will see shinny 5nm/3nm while Intel is just getting to 10nm.  \n\n\n**POSITIONS:**  \n\\+95 call  (exp 12/18)  \n\\- 100 call (exp 12/18)\n\n(*call me a pussy for using a debit spread but I think its the best for my case)*  \n\n\nif you have something else you want to share comments below and I will add it!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu)\n\n[https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications)\n\n*This is not financial advice just me presenting the facts and the possibility of a callback.*  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2ciqo9vdlq51.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d0fa79a87e74390c112a07e8d93a82c5a8476e",

        "selftext": "  \n\nPositions: BABA, TCHEY, BIDU, NIO, TSM, AVGO \n\nThesis: These companies still have a big growth potential and will have success in pretty much every situation I can think of. If the US continues to rip and has a real V-shaped recovery, Asia will rip with it. If the US crashes due to a financial crisis or reemergence of a public health crisis, Asia has pretty much completely reopened, has almost no community spread, and will be a safe haven while the US tries to recover. I don't know if the US is in a  bubble or not, but I think the multi-trillion market cap of the US tech giants limits upside regardless of how well they perform. I'm also convinced the US is about get fucked by a convergence of a second wave and a bad influenza season. Even if they don't the risk of a US economic crisis over the next year is objectively high.  \n\nBABA and TCHEY: Chinese megacaps that are still valued at under $1T and will definitely eventually get there. I wish I could buy options in Tencent. They are basically Facebook, PayPal, Activision Blizzard, and Softbank combined. Alibaba still has potential to expand into the rest of Asia including India if India-China relations improve. Both companies have virtual monopolies in their main areas of business in China and are not subject to anti-trust legislation going forward like their US counterparts. \n\nNIO and BIDU: Have tiny market caps compared to their US counterparts. Google\u2019s market cap is almost 30x higher than Baidu\u2019s and they trade at about the same P/E ratio. I\u2019ve already made a killing on Nio, which is valued at 30B compared to Tesla\u2019s nearly 500B. Chinese EV appetite is also way bigger than that of the US and the recent upgrade of Nio predicts the Chinese EV market to quadruple by 2025. I expect Nio to eventually break into US and European markets. They\u2019ve also successfully implemented battery swapping and won\u2019t need to invest in vertical integration the same way Tesla is in trying to overcome battery charge life obstacles. Both Baidu and Nio are investing heavily in fully autonomous vehicles. \n\nTSM and AVGO: Semiconductors will continue to see growth in the coming years and it\u2019s the only sector that I have confidence in right now. Another bonus if you choose to buy stock, both of these companies have generous dividends and can represent a decent hedge over the growth companies I listed. If the trade war heats up, they are located in Taiwan and Singapore respectively and will be beneficiaries of changes to US/EU supply chain. TSM is producing high quality chips cheaply and will be a big player in data center, autonomous driving, and AI. Broadcom just inked a deal with Apple for wireless components and will be a big 5G beneficiary. \n\nHow I\u2019m playing it: Long-dated calls that are way out of the money in each of these positions. I\u2019m counting on them to all at least double in the next two years. All of my calls are either Jan 2022 or Jan 2023. I also have sold out of all US stocks in my IRA and bought long positions in only in these names. The only one I\u2019m not holding calls in is TCHEY because I use Robinhood and am not aware of any way to buy options in it.",

        "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI have been looking to diversify out of tech. ETFs make up 50% of my portfolio with SPY making up about 40% of it. I also have 10% in QQQ. Of my individual stocks, tech makes up about 60%. I currently have non-tech holdings in Disney, KO, ICLN, BABA, a small portion in NIO and SNE. I know SNE is tech but it does not move with the sector much and I really like this position. Any thoughts on good buys. I was really interested in BA but wanted to wait to see what happened after sept 15th and that wasn't great. Great buy but will take years so I am watching for now. Some others I have been following are V/MA, FDX (although getting pricey), J&amp;J and CVS. Another reasonable option I have been considering is putting more money into SPY and also ICLN to a lesser extent. Appreciate any input or other ideas. Thanks!",

        "selftext": "I made a post touching on this yesterday but nobody took it seriously. After letting my thoughts digest overnight, I did a little more research. My theory is that retail sales will be a lot better than anticipated especially for any store that has an online presence. There are a bunch of stocks you can play to get the most out of this, but the one I suggested yesterday was Party City. After doing some further research, I am now even more bullish on this stock.  [Look here](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Party+City/page/B26E1A61-40CC-4708-83DA-187E7FD38BA8?ref_=ast_bln). Party City is basically a store within Amazons online mall. Apparently a bunch of items are sold out. Not only that but there are analysts predicting holiday in store sales will be up this year across retail, which is contrary to the discounted prices many retail stocks are trading at. That's right, higher than last year even. Don't take it from me though, here's what the former [Toys R Us Ceo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGKYY2Dp6QA) thinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are two plays to be made here. The 2-3 week out play is PRTY. They have an earnings report on 11/4. Apparently this earnings will not include Halloween sales so this is expected to be a boring earnings report. The summer is their worst season for sales already. I think they will report better than expected sales though since people haven't been able to go to bars and have probably been throwing their own parties and what not. Also, while it won't be included in the report, by that point analysts should have a better idea of how well PRTY halloween sales will be. If I am right and the Halloween demand is higher than what is currently priced in, this could send this stock to the moon. This is why I think this thing could be the next Gamestop. One really good quarter for PRTY will probably send it to $5 easily. $3 or $3.50 calls would fn print. 10000% return potential on this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that said, if there are any of you out there who only want a meager 100% return like pussies, my other retail play is Kohl's (KSS). Very undervalued, has managed to be profitable during pandemic unlike Macy's and others, great online sales blah blah blah. I'm actually going to just leave this part of my dd out, but if you're still interested here's an [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/10/16/kohls-stock-offers-strong-upside-at-20/#5e60fe6225cf). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTldr; The retail bears are wrong. Party City could easily show revenue growth in their next report and if that's the case it's going to the moon.",

        "selftext": "There are different ways to trade in a choppy environment. Here\u2019s a deep dive on how I attempted to use weekly options to trade a potential bounce in AMZN, and collected $.37 initially, for the possibility of making $50 more, even though the trade ended up being only an .$81 winner. \n\n# The Entry\n\nLast Thursday, 9/24, when $AMZN was trading at about $3000 a share, I was looking for a cheap way to play a bounce in the stock. During that time, my bias in the markets had begun to shift to a more bullish stance after seeing how the market had difficulty grinding lower. With that in mind, I wanted to play a potential bounce in tech. But I knew I didn\u2019t want to pay a debit at all to play for a bounce that might not even happen, given how uncertain and choppy the markets had been, but I still wanted to set myself up to capture some large gains if AMZN did indeed bounce. Therefore, the strategy that made the most sense to me, was a Call broken wing butterfly.\n\nGiven that I\u2019m a very short-term options trader who loves trading weeklies, I was trying to look for a cheap butterfly for the upcoming week that I could put on for a net credit. After exploring the options chain, I came across the +1/-2/+1 3300/3350/3450 call broken wing butterfly for the Oct 2 series. This fly, at the time (on Sept 24), was trading for a total of $.37 credit. Meaning, by putting on that butterfly, I would get paid $.37, and the following scenarios could happen:\n\n1. If AMZN decided to tank or hang out sideways and never get up close enough to the butterfly to expand the spread in my favor, then I\u2019d walk away pocketing the $.37 credit\n2. If AMZN slowly crept up to reach exactly 3350 by expiration, I\u2019d not only get to keep the credit, but also be able to sell the butterfly back out for $50. Of course, it doesn\u2019t need to reach exactly 3350 by expiration. If AMZN slowly worked its way up to near 3300, then the butterfly would expand very nicely as well.\n3. If AMZN blew past 3400 by expiration, I\u2019d see a loss, up to a maximum of $50 / spread (if $AMZN moves past 3450). That\u2019s because the 3300/3350 long call vertical of the fly provides 50 points of coverage before I essentially start losing money from the 3350/3450 short vertical, up until that 3450 kicks in to cap off further upside losses.\n\nSo that is a rough outline of the potential scenarios that would happen with this trade. \n\nGiven the choppy market conditions, I was ok with risking $50/spread (point #3), in order to not lose money if I\u2019m wrong on direction (point #1), while at the same time, keeping myself open to the possibility of the butterfly expanding in my favor (point #2) for some potentially very large gains. \n\nBut satisfying point #3 is tricky. I needed more data points suggesting that $AMZN wouldn\u2019t surge higher early on in the trade. Because if $AMZN did surge higher early on in the trade, then while the 3300 long call would rise in value, those two 3350 short calls would also rise in value, and because there\u2019d still be some time value left, they could be very juiced up and eat away at the profits of that 3300 long call, so much so that the 3450 long call won\u2019t even be able to offset those losses, especially given how far out of the money that 3450 call is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 9\\/24, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/fvqvwaeh6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=844361115e2cba2ef284b41c734751b7162c77fa)\n\nLooking at the chart above on 9/24, we can see that AMZN was trading at around $3000/share. In order to reach $3300 (where the first long call of the broken wing butterfly is), the stock would need to\n\n1. Breach the 38% fib retracement (\\~AMZN=3131) of the move from the 9/2 high to the 9/21 low, \n2. Breach the 20MA and 50MA\n3. Breach the 50% fib retracement (\\~AMZN=3211)\n4. Breach the 61.8% fib retracement (\\~AMZN=3292)\n\nbefore finally reaching the 3300 long call. All of these levels, I felt, should provide some resistance for AMZN to have to chew thru over the following week, before it even gets to the long call. And by that time, if AMZN did reach 3300, then the 3300 long call would still have a lot of extrinsic value left (somewhere around $20 on the last day), while the 3350 short calls would be very cheap (each around $5), so the entire spread could be roughly worth $10. Which would be great, because that means I\u2019d be getting paid $.37 to make another $10. \n\nSo with all of the above considered, I chose to take on that upside risk, for a chance to make potentially $50 (realistically I try to aim for just half of the max profit: $25, and start harvesting profits and peeling off the flies at around $5-$10), and that day on 9/24, entered the Oct2 3300/3350/3450 call broken wing butterfly for a $.37 credit. \n\nAfter entry, on Friday 9/25 and Monday 9/28, AMZN made steady progress upwards, from 3000 to 3175, breaching the 31.8% retracement and tagging the 20MA and 50MA from below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 9\\/28, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/qhbap1di6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dbb881ff54b0738a915407b66acc041292bf4af)\n\nbut this move wasn\u2019t large and fast enough to expand the value of the 3350 short calls. In fact, theta did a great job draining those short calls, while the 3300 long call did a good job retaining its premium, so the butterfly had already expanded a bit in my favor, and I was sitting at about a small $1.00 profit.\n\n# The Adjustment\n\nHowever, on Tuesday and Wednesday, AMZN began to stall out. By the end of Wednesday 9/30, when it looked like AMZN was putting in a topping tail, I decided that AMZN might not be able to make it near 3300 by expiration Friday, so I wanted to take in a bit more credit while I still could, before theta drained more of that 3300 long call. At the time, the spread was trading for almost $2.\n\nThat\u2019s when I made a slight adjustment to the spread and sold the 3300/3310 call vertical. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 9\\/30, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/mvsrotaj6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c2642107f30c304964a59d5dc24ea636622e52a)\n\nThis essentially rolled the 3300 long call up to 3310, and I was able to collect a small $.44 credit for it. However, this adjustment did open me up to an additional $10 of risk to the upside, because now, the long call vertical portion of the butterfly is only $40 wide (instead of $50). Still, with only 2 days left for AMZN to go higher, I felt comfortable taking on a bit more upside risk knowing that theta is going to be working hard to drain those 3350 short calls if AMZN did decide to surge higher. And at that moment, I actually wanted AMZN to move more towards my fly. My deltas were still positive, and the risk graph showed that a move towards the short strikes of the fly would expand it by another $4-5 by Thursday. \n\nSo after this adjustment, the trade stood at a $.81 credit, and the profit potential on the fly was now $40 instead of $50. Which is still pretty good.\n\n# The Tease\n\nOn Thursday, AMZN showed some strength and closed above the 50% fib (3211), which meant that if on Friday, AMZN worked its way up to around 3300, the fly could potentially be worth $5-10. Things were looking good (on any continued bullishness, the next target for AMZN was the 61.8% fib retracement at \\~3300). So I left the trade alone without making any more adjustments. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 10\\/1, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/lrtmt80k6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8134eed2543798ec4ad22d88c8a0742f9ed4a011)\n\n# The Flop\n\nUnfortunately, on Thursday night, news broke out that Trump was diagnosed with Coronavirus, and the market fell lower. By the open, AMZN was already trading at around 3150, roughly 150 points below the fly. The spread had instantly lost all of its value, so I basically let it expire worthless and walked away pocketing the $.81 credit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mpwrkjpk6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dd7f4da7b000b2266ab57a3c23c1863f9423704\n\nWhile the trade did not work out as well as I had liked, the important thing to note is that I was able to get paid even when the trade didn\u2019t go in my favor. With options, there are ways to trade an underlying to a certain target without ponying up a debit, albeit at the cost of introducing tail risk, while offering the possibility of very large upside. This may be a style of trading that one can consider employing when the outlook of the markets is uncertain, as long as the trader is willing to make the necessary adjustments to control risk. \n\nWhich leads me to the following section: \n\n# FAQ \n\n&gt;What if AMZN decided to surge very early on during the trade? What if AMZN had surged to 3300 with 4-5 DTE, hence juicing up the short calls and causing the butterfly to take on large negative deltas?\n\nEven though the position would be very theta positive, I would pony up the debit to cap off the upside risk by buying the 3400/3450 call vertical, hence turning the 3300/3350/3450 broken wing butterfly into the 3300/3350/3400 balanced butterfly. From there on out until expiration, I would look for ways to reduce the debit incurred from that adjustment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;But what if AMZN tanked afterwards? You could end up getting whipsawed.\n\nI\u2019d rather be safe than sorry and make the necessary adjustments to avoid getting run over, because I don\u2019t like playing the hope card. I could always undo the adjustment and look for ways to collect back more credit (at the cost of introducing risk elsewhere), depending on my new directional bias on AMZN at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Your maximum loss is so large, $5000. I\u2019d never make that bet, I would never risk $5000 to make $5000. \n\nThis style of trading is not for everyone. There are different ways to perceive risk. I don't really think of risk as binary as \u201cmax gain vs max loss\u201d. If the trade goes against me, I\u2019m not going to open myself up to the possibility of eating the maximum loss. I\u2019m going to manage that risk and make sure that I don\u2019t lose any money at all on the trade. Basically, I\u2019m not going to just put on the trade, walk away to the prayer room, and come back at expiration and hope that AMZN expired at 3350.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Why not just join thetagang and slap on iron condors / credit spreads in this environment? You could\u2019ve collected more credit by selling a 50 point wide put vertical with your bounce thesis. \n\nDifferent traders have different styles. I personally don\u2019t like pure premium selling strategies. I\u2019d rather have long options in front of the shorts to open myself up for some large upside and convexity in the P/L curve, rather than limit myself to the concavity of pure premium selling strategies. Having long options in front of the shorts also helps me sleep better at night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It\u2019s hard to read this. Is there a more visual explanation? \n\nHere\u2019s a video on it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uq76fZ3EME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uq76fZ3EME)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*TL;DR - I used weekly options to trade a potential bounce in AMZN, and got paid $.37 initially to do so, for the possibility of making $50 more. While the trade did not pan out, I walked away pocketing $.81 for being wrong.*",

        "selftext": "I've been a lurker on this subreddit for a long time and dabble in penny stocks, but 99% of my portfolio is bluechips. My background is an interesting mashup of the automotive industry and financial systems so I've been keeping an eye on SOLO over the past year that it's been trending on this sub. While fascinated by SOLO's rise and some of the takes on here, I feel that their product was doomed from day one. FYI, I flared this as \"General Discussion\" since I think post this lacks the quantitative substance to qualify it as DD. Anyways, my reasons below:  \n\n\n* First and foremost, this is not a car. This is a motorcycle (fine...\"autocycle\"), and is legally classified as such. SOLO went this route because they don't have to follow the same safety regulations and design restrictions that are required for an actual car. Why is this an instant turnoff for most buyers? Safety. SOLO isn't going to run a side impact collision test on this thing, and why would they?? This \"car\" is small, and as the automotive industry trends away from smaller, more compact cars,^(1) SOLO will be at the mercy of other vehicles on the road. Combine the small footprint and incredibly low seating position with its NCA batteries, which are generally not as safe as other Li-ion batteries,^(2) I see a lot of lawsuits and negative press regarding safety ahead. Yes, Tesla uses NCA batteries but they have some of the best software in the game when it comes to regulating and monitoring said batteries. \n* Let's talk about Smart. Touching on the point above that American cars are getting larger, Smart removed itself in entirety from the American market in 2019.^(3) Post 2016, Smart went after the same customer base Solo is currently courting with their electric-only model, the Smart EQ Fourtwo. Suddenly, poof, they are gone from dealers across the US. Smart's sales were dismal and arguably, they were too expensive to justify coming in at $20K+ (keep this in mind for later). Smart had **actual** safety ratings though, and as a subsidiary of Mercedes, *you could actually get your car serviced at a dealer*. Which brings me to my secondary point here - **where do you service your Solo?** Solo markets itself as an online/mall car dealer, so are you going to take your car to your local mechanic? Probably not since it's electric, and in my experience, they don't have the know how or the willingness to service 100% electric vehicles. The basics, yes, but the drivetrain and software is a different story. I guess your best bet would be a scooter/motorcycle mechanic, since that's what this things actually is?\n* Next, let's talk price. **$18,500.** Holy shit. This thing is a glorified electric motorcycle that goes 0-60 in *10 seconds*. I could rent a vehicle every time I need to go to the grocery store for a year through Get Around for $1,500 total. Yeah, the Solo is great for single people that need to commute but in the two major markets Solo advertises on their website (LA and SF), single people with enough spending power to purchase this \"car\" work in tech. Tech companies work from home right now and will be, maybe forever. Google, FB, Twilio, etc have all poured millions into their WFH infrastructure, realizing that they don't need a $80K/month office space or a $60M building. That being said, car ownership is great and it's the second largest investment for most Americans. The Solo is downright expensive - almost as expensive as the Smart car. BUT it's **a)** not a car **b)** lacks the same safety standards and rigorous testing as a normal car and **c)** doesn't have a maintenance network. Just go get an electric scooter for $5K. Or get a hybrid CR-V for only $10K more that will last for 10 years. That's an actual investment into your mobility unlike the Solo.\n* Lastly, okay, maybe they have a solid product and I'm wildly wrong. A lot of what I'm spewing is opinion after all with a couple of links to back me up... However, every major city has electric moped and scooter app-based rental services these days (Revel, Scoot). No motorcycle license needed, just hop on and ride for a fairly cheap rate. Would somebody fork over $15K+ for a vehicle when they can essentially rent a similar vehicle for a low hourly rate? That's a HUGE initial cost when you are in a transitional stage in your life (single, no need for cargo room) - why $18,500 for the Solo when you can just rent? That being said - **I think Solo has a play here...** If their management team is competent, maybe they can utilize this and sell thousands of units to these app-based short term moped rental companies. Of course, then public policy is involved and suddenly Solo is at the whim of the courts and whether or not they can use public streets for private business use (i.e. any app based Scooter/Moped short term rental company and the uproar it caused in various cities across the USA).   \n\n\nTLDR: The Solo is not an actual car, doesn't have the same safety standards as a car since it's legally a motorcycle, doesn't have a maintenance network, and costs an absurd $18,500, which is just too high of an entry point for the people this is being marketed to. This thing will flop hard, just like [Elio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elio_Motors) and [Aptera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptera_Motors). Of course, I could be totally wrong about all of this since there is so much speculation and hype flying around the EV world right now that I don't know what's true and what isn't anymore lol.\n\n^(1)[https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7qnz3/us-automakers-phasing-out-affordable-subcompact-cars](https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7qnz3/us-automakers-phasing-out-affordable-subcompact-cars)\n\n^(2)[https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/safety\\_of\\_lithium\\_ion\\_batteries](https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/safety_of_lithium_ion_batteries)\n\n^(3)[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a27310639/smart-fortwo-discontinued-usa/#:\\~:text=Smart%20is%20officially%20exiting%20the,sales%2C%20led%20to%20the%20decision](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a27310639/smart-fortwo-discontinued-usa/#:~:text=Smart%20is%20officially%20exiting%20the,sales%2C%20led%20to%20the%20decision).  \n\n\nA few notes - I don't have a position in SOLO. I watched it spike a couple of days ago, figuring that this is because the EV industry had some legs for a few days. Not sure why else this stock would spike so figured I would write out my opinions since I see people saying that this will go to $6, to $20, to $X00 amount of $$$. [It could, but I have my doubts.](https://venturebeat.com/2011/12/12/how-why-aptera-collapsed/) [The SOLO was released in 2016](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1106023_electra-meccanica-solo-three-wheeled-electric-car-unveiled) too - something I find interesting is that instead of becoming more technologically advanced/efficient over time, the \"car\" now has a slower 0-60 time, longer charge time, and slightly lower top speed. I could be looking into it too much, but the dumbing down of the car over the last 4 years gives me some strong Elio vibes.  \n\n\nLAST POINT I SWEAR. I don't think the Tofino (SOLO's actual EV car)  will ever be built. I think that they are floating this concept to receive an [ATVM](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/title-xvii/products-services/advanced-technology-vehicles-manufacturing-loan-program) loan. ATVM loans are not extended manufacturers of 3 wheel cars and SOLO's old school roadster car is not mass production, so they would never get a loan for that even though it is real. This is shear speculation. Please correct me if you've seen the Tofino in the wild.",

        "selftext": " The news I am about to tell you hasn't hit the mainstream media yet. When it does, we are going to see the biggest crash of our entire lives. I bet not just my left nut, but my right one too!\n\nMy fellow patriots, the war is being fought here and now. The battlefield is not full of craters, corpses, and smoke. The battle is going on right now in our hearts and minds. And the casualties if we lose this war, will be horrific.\n\nI know what I am about to tell you will sound crazy. Read it and laugh if you want, but if you censor this, you are actively fighting against the first amendment. So give it a read, laugh your ass off, but if your truly unbiased and fair atleast hear this out. I know you might think people like me are tinfoil hat wearing bastards, and I admit sometimes we are wrong. If the election proceeds smoothly I was wrong, and I will stop watching Alex forever. But please give this a chance. I am not republican or democrat, just tryna find the truth as much as I can.\n\nI am going to prove most of the claims made in this video. [https://postnewsera.com/watch?id=5f8b7cca9d7ca5144824dc5e](https://postnewsera.com/watch?id=5f8b7cca9d7ca5144824dc5e) I know Alex Jones can be a nut sometimes. But that doesn't mean he gets everything wrong. This shit is real, and this time he is right!\n\nMy fellow human's. Buckle your metaphorical seatbelts, because I am about to tell you a crazy story full of murder, drugs, sex, tax evasion, a bioweapon being released, billions of dollars of corrupt dealings, and much more sinister things. Unfortunately, I can factually prove most of it is true, and I will prove it here and now. Please note, I am not the original leaker. I simply put together a series of leaks together, and they fit together perfectly. I'm just a normal guy who likes to go behind the scenes of the News a little too much.\n\nNo matter what political side your on, please note what I am saying is mostly fact. I'll try as hard as possible not to be biased. These leaks involve both Republican and Democrat government officials, many well known Celebrities, Businessmen that lead Mega Corporations in the tech, energy, and medical sectors, Government Officials from other Countries such as Russia and China and many others, and the heads of many Major News Networks, and Social Media Outlets. The people I just mentioned will be referred to as \"Controlling Elites\" for the rest of this document.\n\nBy the end of this post I will prove to you the following:\n\nA. Hunter Biden has made billions of dollars by corruptly using his families political power as leverage.\n\nB. Hunter Biden has sexually assaulted minors and their are videos of it (He was honey potted by the CCP) and does Crack and Meth, so do many other \"Controlling Elites\".\n\nC. Joe Biden is also involved in these corrupt deals, and so is Obama, Hillary and many other \"Controlling Elites\", yes including some Republicans!\n\nD. The information used in (Hunter Gate) was originally intended to be used as blackmail. Blackmail, from Chinese officials to democrat leaders, due to the anti Chinese sentiment in the USA. Sentiment the people of America have for China's corrupt handling of many things, China blackmailed many \"Controlling Elites\" to stay loyal to the CCP, and to quell the Anti-Chinese Sentiment.\n\nE. The FBI, is actively trying to undermine Trump, and has had access to Hunter Gate and evidence of many other crimes committed by \"Controlling Elites\" (Example Epstein).\n\nF. Their is political infighting in China, party officials are in a power struggle (You will see how this ties into Hunter Gate later). Party officials are planning to assassinate each other, freeze the oppositions financial assets, and much worse.\n\nBy the end I will make a good case for the following. (these are not yet facts, however, they are most likely true according to evidence.)\n\nG. Corona Virus, is not a spontaneous natural disease. It was made in a lab. While it may not have been intentionally released, China decided to let it spread in order to distract people from Hong Kong so they could take it, cause chaos so they can invade Taiwan without opposition, have an excuse for the draconian measures currently taking place in China, and in the end gain allot of economic power since they had time to prepare a plan.\n\nH. Qanon, is right to a certain extent. Their is a group of \"Controlling Elites\" that do abuse children (refer to Epstein). These \"Controlling Elites\" do perform weird rituals and do a ton of drugs. They are also right that the \"Controlling Elites\" actively monitor and censor much of the news and internet and do silence people that step out of line. They are partially false that Trump is not partially involved in some of these corrupt schemes (Probably committed some tax evasion), albeit, he is way less guilty compared to a majority of \"Controlling Elites\". However, they are right that Trump battling to try to expose some of these evil people (Maybe he had a change of heart and truly is a fighter for good now, or maybe he just wants to win his re-election and enlarge his ego, either way he is actively trying to \"drain the swamp\".) .\n\nI. The US election will result in some sort of \"day of reckoning\" and possibly a guerilla style civil war. and eventually World War 3. This will be the result of 3 things. 1. Neither party will accept defeat, they will both claim the other party committed criminal acts and is rigging the votes, unfortunately both sides of that argument are right, Albeit the Republican is considerably more clean. 2. We will see groups like Antifa and Proud Boys clashing by voter stations, Mail in voting also will not work in states doing it for the first time, and we WILL have enormous amounts fraud. Most likely, we will never know who won the election of 2020. 3. The world is at a tipping point, no matter who wins the instability in America will create a ton of instability both financially, and politically for most of Planet Earth. The instability will most likely result in the following wars. {India vs Pakistan} {Europe vs Muslims} {American Conservatives vs American Liberals} {China vs most of the world} {Russia vs former soviet nations} {Greece/Armenia vs Turkey/Azerbaijan} and a huge list of other smaller wars and guerilla conflicts.\n\nBefore we begin, I will tell you the order in which I will state the evidence, so you can see how it fits together.\n\nFIRST, I will show the bombshell reports dropped by Mainstream media on 10/15/2020+. We will talk about the claims being made.\n\nSECOND, I will show you footage of whistleblowers talking about the information released by the mainstream media months and weeks prior to Hunter Gate, and Covid-19. Meaning they are credible sources. Their claims are being proven today, so the claims they made that haven't been proven yet are probably true too. We will talk about the specific claims and the damning evidence. Trust me, the evidence is damming, and the claims are horrific. I will also talk about how the Whistleblowers got this information, why they got it, and who has it now.\n\nTHIRD, we will evaluate the claims made by the \"OG Leakers\" that is what I will refer to this specific batch of leakers as for the rest of the document. We will tie in these leaks to many other pieces of the puzzle. We will prove that Epstein didn't kill himself, and much much much more.\n\nFourth, We will talk about the implications of this, and what the future holds.\n\nCHAPTER ONE: HUNTER'S OCTOBER SUPRISE\n\nOn October 16th of the year 2020, just weeks away from the election, a political Nuke was dropped by the New York Post. They claimed to have access to a hard drive that including thousands of emails, photos, video's, and text messages belonging to Hunter Biden. We will talk about the way they received this information and why they received this information later.\n\n[https://nypost.com/2020/10/16/hunter-biden-emails-pics-reveal-wild-life-pained-soul/](https://nypost.com/2020/10/16/hunter-biden-emails-pics-reveal-wild-life-pained-soul/)\n\n[http://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2020/10/16/new-york-post-hunter-biden-photos-claim-to-show-](http://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2020/10/16/new-york-post-hunter-biden-photos-claim-to-show-before-and-after-dental-work-to-fix-meth-mouth/)\n\n[before-and-after-dental-work-to-fix-meth-mouth/](http://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2020/10/16/new-york-post-hunter-biden-photos-claim-to-show-before-and-after-dental-work-to-fix-meth-mouth/)\n\n[https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2020/10/15/photo-of-hunter-biden-smoking-crack-released-from-abandoned-laptop/](https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2020/10/15/photo-of-hunter-biden-smoking-crack-released-from-abandoned-laptop/)\n\nIt started off, as some mildly corrupt dealings (Totaling in the millions) and some pictures of Hunter doing drugs. But later turned, into violent p0rn0s of Hunter sexually assaulting people, a list of secret deals between Russia, China, and the Biden's totaling the the BILLIONS, and many other corrupt schemes!\n\n[https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-chins-firm-emails-deal](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-chins-firm-emails-deal)\n\n[https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/emails-reveal-how-hunter-biden-tried-to-cash-in-big-with-chinese-firm/](https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/emails-reveal-how-hunter-biden-tried-to-cash-in-big-with-chinese-firm/)\n\nThe \"Controlling Elites\" worked to quickly silence this. On Twitter and Facebook posts mentioning the leaks where shadow banned, deleted, and censored. Their panic, partly contributes to the credibility of the leaks (Since they are trying really hard to censor them), and shows the media being a corrupt pawn in this sick game of power and sex. The Biden campaign is smarty choosing to completely ignore these claims, as if they outright deny them, they would have to prove their point. Which is impossible since you really cant deny these thousands of emails and photos that have valid timestamps and involve hundreds of people and lots of money. In fact, some media outlets are literally claiming this whole this is a crazy Qanon conspiracy lead by \"right-wing-facist-whitesupremacist\". They are deflecting, again they cannot logistically deny, they can only deflect/ignore/and discredit.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hybkzCWb\\_w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hybkzCWb_w)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enyep7yAKxY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enyep7yAKxY)\n\n[https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-lashes-out-at-cbs-reporter-when-asked-about-ny-post-report-i-have-no-response-another-smear-campaign](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-lashes-out-at-cbs-reporter-when-asked-about-ny-post-report-i-have-no-response-another-smear-campaign)\n\n[https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rnc-fec-twitter-complaint-claims-company-made-illegal-in-kind-contribution-biden-campaign](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rnc-fec-twitter-complaint-claims-company-made-illegal-in-kind-contribution-biden-campaign)\n\nLook at what the first results are if you try to search this story on google chrome\n\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=rudy+giuliani&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD\\_enUS830US830&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01-vZN8aQ198o5hJ3P9IQVMKI2Sig:1603217453195&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj7gq624sPsAhUHqp4KHb7\\_AMgQ\\_AUoAXoECC0QAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969](https://www.google.com/search?q=rudy+giuliani&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS830US830&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01-vZN8aQ198o5hJ3P9IQVMKI2Sig:1603217453195&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj7gq624sPsAhUHqp4KHb7_AMgQ_AUoAXoECC0QAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969)\n\nOkay so that's the whole story right? Honestly its already pretty terrible if you think about it. But if you dig deeper it gets much worse! Get ready for some P3d0philic activity, some murder, and power grabs.\n\nCHAPTER TWO: INTERCEPTION\n\nFrom now on I will try to include 2 links to each video, one to a mainstream source, and another to a different source. This is because I think the following YouTube Videos are going to be deleted or censored any minute now, hopefully we can use wayback software to see the deleted videos. The point is, the timestamps on these YouTube videos show information leaked by the \"OG leakers\" was made weeks and sometimes months in advance to the headlines of Mainstream media today, and they have access to other claims and evidence that have not been released yet.\n\nThe first video is a English translated version of a summary of claims made by Lude Media on September 24th. Lude is an independent Chinese journalist who usually focuses on exposing corrupt Chinese officials, not Planet Wide Evil Schemes. Lude is credible because he works with and has direct contact with a man named Guo Wengui, Guo was formerly the 73rd richest many in China (That's pretty damn rich). Guo defected from the CCP and fled to America, where he now exposes his former Chinese Comrades corrupt schemes from his apartment in New York. Here is a link to information about Guo and another to Ludes Twitter.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guo\\_Wengui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guo_Wengui)\n\n[https://twitter.com/ding\\_gang](https://twitter.com/ding_gang)\n\nMainstream media is slowly catching on to the fact that Guo Wengui and his associates knew about Hunter Gate and much more and where trying to ring the bells and blow the whistle on this months ago.\n\n[https://www.thedailybeast.com/chinese-billionaires-network-hyped-hunter-biden-dirt-weeks-before-rudy](https://www.thedailybeast.com/chinese-billionaires-network-hyped-hunter-biden-dirt-weeks-before-rudy)\n\nNow what exactly where the claims Guo and Lude made? I will let you see for yourself. The following video is a summary of their claims, it was originally in Chinese but thankfully translated to English. It was posted on YouTube September 24th, and includes a string of clips made by Lude over the past few months. These claims include detailed evidence. Remember the date of this video, now read the headlines. The crazy statements he made are true, we will discuss the evidence later.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bXgULtz6cI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bXgULtz6cI)\n\n[https://www.bitchute.com/video/HfcWb0AfsuOm/](https://www.bitchute.com/video/HfcWb0AfsuOm/)\n\nNow that we have seen this sources credibility, and the claims he is making. Let's talk about how this information came to be. After all you would try really hard if you where part of a Pedophilic, Global, Crack eating, Cabal to keep that a secret right? So why was all this on a hard drive, and how did people find this hard drive. By the way, before we continue I need to clarify something important, the Cabal and the \"Controlling Elites\" Work together, but they are not a formal group (Not illuminati but all behave like it). Basically they all want similar things so they informally work together to get those things, unrestricted sex, ton's of Drugs, Loads of money, Egotistical Power, and a life of luxury. It's the extent they go, the fact they (As leaders of Humanity) do it, and the idea they informally work together to achieve this is important. Okay, so back to the point. This hard drive was originally indented to be used to blackmail mostly democrat government officials, and it was made by a prestigious group of people in the CCP. This is where the story gets complex. The prestigious group (which you will learn about in the following video) has 3 main motives. 1. They want American politicians to remain loyal to them, China rip's of America all the time, and they get away with it because they bought out politicians. Normal Americans are waking up to this, and their is allot of Anti-Chinese hatred not just in America but around the globe due to CoVid-19, Invasion of Hong Kong, Human rights violations, and Breaking many trade rules. They are afraid that democrats will try to appeal to voters by appealing to this sentiment, so they sent the blackmail to tell them, if you try to fight us, we will make you personally suffer. 2. This is also a power grab for this group of Prestigious Chinese people (Its complex so I will be simple.) This group wants Xi Jinping OUT, the hard drive contains many corrupt deals involving Xi and his gang and the Biden's. They are hoping they can squeeze out Xi and take the power for themselves. 3. They are trying to create unrest in America, unlike Russia, China is actually a real threat. They benefit off Americas Chaos, because it allows them to invade, and steal without repercussion sense America's attention is focused elsewhere. Here is a video detailing why the hard drive(s) where created and how they where located.\n\n[https://twitter.com/HimalayaGlobal/status/1316456905343074304](https://twitter.com/HimalayaGlobal/status/1316456905343074304)\n\n[https://www.bitchute.com/video/OcaVxFJOTxzx/](https://www.bitchute.com/video/OcaVxFJOTxzx/)\n\nPersonally, I think the narrative that the hard drive was found by a computer fixer in Iowa months ago who stumbled upon a broken laptop is to good to be true (This is the narrative pushed by Mainstream Media.) However, it is true the FBI and many other big players had this information in their hands a long long long time ago. Their is evidence the FBI had a warrant to get this hard drive months ago from Hunter, for guess what (Child p0rn). We will talk about how the FBI is partially involved in fighting trump and some of these corrupt dealings later. Dear FBI if your reading this, seriously I'm just a normal dude that sits on my ass and mostly play's video games (But I write books about philosophy too). Also I support law enforcement and know all of you are not bad. Also I'm stating public information so yeah. Not tyrna get in trouble or anything, like just comment if you have a concern bro. Or like censor my posts Lmao. Also I am a kid believe it or not.\n\n[https://postnewsera.com/watch?id=5f8b7cca9d7ca5144824dc5e](https://postnewsera.com/watch?id=5f8b7cca9d7ca5144824dc5e)\n\n[https://wearethene.ws/notable/152860](https://wearethene.ws/notable/152860)\n\nHere is evidence the FBI is working against Trump.\n\n[https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-race-and-ethnicity-archive-bdd3b6078e9efadcfcd0be4b65f2362e](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-race-and-ethnicity-archive-bdd3b6078e9efadcfcd0be4b65f2362e)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/14/fbi-agents-text-reportedly-disclosed-by-justice-watchdog-well-stop-trump-from-becoming-president.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/14/fbi-agents-text-reportedly-disclosed-by-justice-watchdog-well-stop-trump-from-becoming-president.html)\n\nAnyways, the official story goes that the Iowa Computer guy made 4 copies of the hard drive (Damn thats allot of work) 1 Went to the FBI, and he sent another copy to Rudy Giuliani because he didn't trust the FBI (Who would have thought!?). Rudy, a former New York Politician who is responsible for Crushing crime in New York, (And has ties to 9/11, lol thats not important just funny Rudy is a key part in two of the biggest conspiracies' known to the human race.) Anyways Rudy is the guy who apparently got that hard drive, than gave it to the New York Post. This is partially true, he is the guy who got it into the hands of conservative mainstream media, but his story about how he got it is probably false. Guess what, Their is a picture of Rudy and Lude (The OG leaker I mentioned earlier) holding hands and its a fairly recent picture, but you need to follow my instructions to see it. Watch this video again, BUT MAKE SURE YOU PAUSE THE VIDEO ON THE VERY FIRST FRAME.\n\n[https://www.bitchute.com/video/OcaVxFJOTxzx/](https://www.bitchute.com/video/OcaVxFJOTxzx/)\n\nTheir is the iconic photo, I had another source of the photo, but I cannot find it anymore, I think it was taken down.\n\nThis is allot to take in I know, so lets take a laughing break together shall we? Here is a article I hope will make you smile.\n\n[https://pagesix.com/2020/10/17/matthew-mcconaughey-reveals-his-dad-died-while-makin-love-to-his-mother/](https://pagesix.com/2020/10/17/matthew-mcconaughey-reveals-his-dad-died-while-makin-love-to-his-mother/)\n\nDamn, his dad is a legend, Anyways. back to the story.\n\nCHAPTER 3: ANALYZING THE DATA\n\nFirst and foremost, I have just given you access to a neat list of tons of evidence and sources. Please do your own additional research. So far we know Lude made the claim a hard drive was going to be released on Western media including a p0rn0 of hunter and a minor, Hunter doing illegal drugs, and a list of super corrupt business dealings, and information regarding the true essence of the Corona Virus. Lude also predicted Covid-19's impact on January 19th, months before the mainstream media of the world. If you want more info on that one, go look for yourself. In fact this is a short chapter. I challenge you to look at the list of Claims and evidence Lude, Guo, and now the mainstream media have on these corrupt dealings. Especially pay attention to the claims made by Lude that haven't come true yet!\n\nChapter 4: THE FUTURE?\n\nSince the begging of the human race, people have fought other people to have a better life. As a philosopher and a biologist, I can tell you this is a natural concept. Most lifeforms do this. However, humanity is much more complex. Many humans in power have used their power in immoral ways to commit atrocious acts throughout most of history. But don't start saying yeah screw the rich and powerful. Remember people at the bottom \"Normal/Poor/Peasants\" do this too, but not to the extent of the Cabal. People at the bottom hurt each other and steal just for a loaf of bread, or a hit of dopamine, or a couple bucks. I believe in capitalism and am a Nationalist Libertarian. My point is this, the elite are corrupt! But that doesn't mean its communist time. Communism/Socialism is the worst form of government for the people and the best for the elite. CHINA is communist! This is because ironically Communism is just Capitalism, except the elite have a monopoly on everything, not just the economy, but also you. We must not allow America to fall for this trap. Our system can work, and it has worked. But democracy is only as good as the people who make it work. Its supposed to be We the people, yet for the past 40 years barely anybody shows up to the ballot box.\n\n(Bias incoming)\n\nI'm going to vote Trump, not because I support him personally, but because he is at least trying to really drain the Swamp. Life is special, we only get like 80 years on this planet. Like why we got to have all this evil stuff. We don't and it starts with changing our idea of success. We are taught to be successful you need to be surrounded by attractive sexual partners, have loads of cash, and be a cool party kinda guy. If you don't believe me go listen to some of the top music tracks in America over the past 5 years, mostly rap about (Hoes, Drugs, Power, and Chasin the Green). I ask you to stop sharing this idea. We are conscious animals on a rock floating through space, and their is science that can help us figure out why. I am an atheist and all this conflict (Which usually stems from Religion) makes me really depressed. With our technology, we could live forever. But my guess is that will be a honor only the elites will get.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SbF6rdpq24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SbF6rdpq24)\n\nMy fellow humans, right now we are being divided by race, religion, and sexual orientation in order to control us. And Ill be honest, the solution is not necessarily to unite. I don't believe in judging people by race or sexual orientation as long as they keep it to themselves. But I do believe that religion is the root of all this chaos. Muslims/Jews/and Christians/Athiest cannot live in harmony. And before you say I am discriminating, remember that race is something you cannot control, but religion is a choice. Religion is the root of all of this. I don't think religion is bad for the common man, but its simply not true. And it empowers the big guys. However, I think your average Muslim/Jew/Christain/Athiest Black/White/Hispanic/Asian Democrat/Republican can agree this shit is wrong and needs to stop!\n\nAnyways that's my 2 cents. I'm gonna sulk alone now. Btw for anybody struggling with depression due to similar causes please watch this video, its what keeps me going.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14)\n\nIf you made it this far, please save my post and share.

        "selftext": "It's your boy here that brought you news of the Array IPO yesterday that's now up 65% over the day, telling about the Eargo IPO today.\n\nEargo ($EAR) is the first and only virtually invisible, rechargeable, in-canal, FDA regulated hearing aid. They just up-sized the IPO to $18 a  few hours ago and there's great support for this to grow. J.P. Morgan and BofA Securities acted as lead book-running managers and as  representatives of the underwriters for the offering, Wells Fargo Securities and William Blair acted as co-managers for the offering. The San Jose, CA-based company was founded in 2010 and booked $47 million in sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020\n\nBasically, it's time to make some money off this boomer tech and if you're still not convinced, watch their commercial on YouTube (https://www.youtube(X)com/watch?v=xwSqSITCLCk).\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/15/2109609/0/en/Eargo-Inc-Announces-Upsized-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/15/2109609/0/en/Eargo-Inc-Announces-Upsized-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering.html)\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/10/12/eargo-aligos-therapeutics-set-ipo-targets.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/10/12/eargo-aligos-therapeutics-set-ipo-targets.html)",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 15, 2020**\n\nStocks fell once again today for the third straight day of losses, as market participants consider a disappointing unemployment report, new virus-related restrictions in Europe, and dimming prospects for additional stimulus before the november election\n\nThe Nasdaq finished 0.67% down. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell a modest 0.11% and the Dow finished the day 0.04% down. Stocks were able to mostly recover from the deeply red open. \n\nThe Labor Department released their weekly unemployment, which showed that an additional 898,000 new claims were submitted last week, way above the consensus estimate of 830,000.  This is the highest number since Aug. 22 and another clear sign that the labor market continues to struggle to recover in this pandemic-riddled economy as cases rise and worries increase over a renewed wave in the fall and winter. The number represented a gain of 53,000 from the previous week\u2019s. The economy has recaptured some 11.4 million positions, or about half those who were sidelined. The unemployment rate has come down to 7.9% but is still more than double its pre-pandemic level.\n\nAfter Europe seemed to somewhat tame the virus that ravaged the countryside early in the year, the number of newly confirmed infections are skyrocketing, prompting fears of a second-wave and host of new restrictions. Socialising indoors will be banned in London, and a curfew will be imposed in nine French cities. Poland designated red zones where schools and gyms will close, including in the capital Warsaw, and the Czech Republic said it was building its first field hospital for coronavirus patients. Schools in Italy's southern Campania region, including the city of Naples, are to close for two weeks, as the country recorded its highest daily rise of cases since mass testing began. Coronavirus is the fifth-leading cause of death in Europe, where a threshold of 1,000 deaths daily has been passed, the WHO's European director, Dr Hans Kluge, told a news conference today. In the United States, new cases per day are on the rise in 44 states, with the biggest surges in the Midwest and Great Plains, where resistance to wearing masks and observing other social distancing practices has been running high. Deaths per day are climbing in 30 states, according to data collected from John Hopkins University.\n\nMarket participants continue to be fixated on whether more stimulus, which lawmakers and economists say is necessary, will be passed before the November election. Messaging from top officials regarding stimulus has been inconsistent, with Pres. Trump first said he was directing his representatives to halt negotiations before doing a 180[\u00b0](https://www.degreesymbol.net/#:~:text=Degree%20Symbol%20on%20Microsoft%20Windows,0176%20numbers%20of%20degree%20symbol.) turn. Yesterday, Mnuchin conceded that \u201cgetting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult, just given where we are in the level of details\u201d. Today, in response to being asked if he supported stimulus, Pres. Trump told Fox Business, \u201cI would. Absolutely I would. I would say more. I would go higher. Go big or go home, I said it yesterday.\u201d Needless to say the inconsistent messaging heightened volatility in the market as investors have a heightened sense of risk. Additional relief is viewed by many (including Jerome Powell) as a necessary propellant to maintain and speed up economic recovery. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* US regulators (FDA) approved yesterday afternoon the first treatment for Ebola Virus from Regeneron (REGN). This is the same company that made the treatment that President Trump received while being treated for COVID-19 about two weeks ago.\n* US jobless claims reached 898,000 which was higher than the estimates of 830,000.\n* Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PCG) has cut power to around 33,000 customers to mitigate risk of starting a wildfire citing dry and windy conditions renew threat of fires.\n* Boyd Gaming (BYD) had a price increase by Deutsche Bank from $27 to $38 at BUY. Big increase in analyst sentiment, the stock trended upward today.\n* Datadog (DDOG) had a price target raise from Mizuho from $116 to $125 at BUY. It opened low, but recovered throughout the day. Stock has been a monster lately. \n* Dell (DELL) had a price target raised by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) from $70 to $80 at OVERWEIGHT.\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) had price targets raised by Citigroup (C), and Barclays from $285 to $300 at BUY, and $253 to $270 at EQUAL WEIGHT, respectively. Stock faded towards the end of the day, nevertheless bullish analyst actions.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) had a price target raised by Mizuho from $240 to $255 at BUY. (looking at this one for a possible bounce tomorrow)\n* Netflix (NFLX) had a price target raise by KeyCorp from $590 to $634 at OVERWEIGHT\n* Service Now (NOW) had a price target raised by Mizuho from $500 to $560 at BUY. This is the third price boost this week, this stock is a monster!\n* Peloton (PTON) had a price target raised by BofA Securities (BAC) from $116 to $150 at BUY. stock is at All Time Highs today... insane, an absolute monster!\n* Replimune Group (REPL) had price target increase by BMO Capital, SVB Leerink, and Barclays from $40 to $51 at OUTPERFORM, $27 to $44 at OUTPERFORM, and $29 to $50 OVERWEIGHT, respectively. This thing is squeezing, up 60% in the last two days!\n* Take-Two (TTWO) had a price Target raise by Morgan Stanley from $176 to $185 at OVERWEIGHT\n* United Health (UNH) had a price target raise from Piper Sandler, Raymond James, SVB Leerink, Oppenheimer and Royal Bank of Canada. On average its a $380 price target at OUTPERFORM, this has been a monster stock!\n* Zoom Video Communications (ZM) had myriad of price target increases, including from Wells Fargo (WFC), Royal Bank of Canada, Piper Sandler, $375 to $465 EQUAL WEIGHT, $450 to $600 OUTPERFORM, and $411 to $501 NEUTRAL. Very bullish analyst action.\n* Morgan Stanley (MS) reported better-than-expected results in Q3 earnings. Stock was 1.26% up at the time of writing\n   * EPS of $1.59 vs $1.28 estimate \n   * Revenue of $11.6 billion vs $10.61 estimate\n* Charles Schwab (SCHW) reported slightly better-than-expected earnings. Stock outperformed the market, up 3.96% at the time of writing.\n   * EPS of $0.51 vs $0.47 estimate\n   * Revenue of $2.45 billion v $2.43 billion estimate\n* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) reported much better-than-expected earnings, especially in EPS. Stock was 0.9% down at the time of writing.\n   * EPS of $5.30 vs $0.92 estimate (wow!!!)\n   * Revenue of $356.43 billion vs $315.20 billion\n\n\u201cLife is not about finding yourself.

        "selftext": "The news I am about to tell you hasn't hit the mainstream media yet. When it does, we are going to see the biggest crash of our entire lives. I bet not just my left nut, but my right one too!\n\nTL;DR photos of Hunter Biden \\*Censored\\* underage Chinese girls are in Fox New's hands. When they drop market will tank  BIGLY! PUTS ON BIG TECH like Google, Facebook, Twitter etc. Calls on Weapons companies, Gold, outdoor gear.\n\nMy fellow patriots, the war is being fought here and now. The battlefield is not full of craters, corpses, and smoke. The battle is going on right now in our hearts and minds. And the casualties if we lose this war, will be horrific.\n\nI know what I am about to tell you will sound crazy. Read it and laugh if you want, but if you censor this, you are actively fighting against the first amendment. So give it a read, laugh your ass off, but if your truly unbiased and fair atleast hear this out. I know you might think people like me are tinfoil hat wearing bastards, and I admit sometimes we are wrong. If the election proceeds smoothly I was wrong, and I will stop watching Alex forever. But please give this a chance. I am not republican or democrat, just tryna find the truth as much as I can.\n\nI am going to prove most of the claims made in this video. [https://postnewsera.com/watch?id=5f8b7cca9d7ca5144824dc5e](https://postnewsera.com/watch?id=5f8b7cca9d7ca5144824dc5e) I know Alex Jones can be a nut sometimes. But that doesn't mean he gets everything wrong. This shit is real, and this time he is right!\n\nMy fellow human's. Buckle your metaphorical seatbelts, because I am about to tell you a crazy story full of murder, drugs, sex, tax evasion, a bioweapon being released, billions of dollars of corrupt dealings, and much more sinister things. Unfortunately, I can factually prove most of it is true, and I will prove it here and now. Please note, I am not the original leaker. I simply put together a series of leaks together, and they fit together perfectly. I'm just a normal guy who likes to go behind the scenes of the News a little too much.\n\nNo matter what political side your on, please note what I am saying is mostly fact. I'll try as hard as possible not to be biased. These leaks involve both Republican and Democrat government officials, many well known Celebrities, Businessmen that lead Mega Corporations in the tech, energy, and medical sectors, Government Officials from other Countries such as Russia and China and many others, and the heads of many Major News Networks, and Social Media Outlets. The people I just mentioned will be referred to as \"Controlling Elites\" for the rest of this document.\n\nBy the end of this post I will prove to you the following:\n\nA. Hunter Biden has made billions of dollars by corruptly using his families political power as leverage.\n\nB. Hunter Biden has sexually assaulted minors and their are videos of it (He was honey potted by the CCP) and does Crack and Meth, so do many other \"Controlling Elites\".\n\nC. Joe Biden is also involved in these corrupt deals, and so is Obama, Hillary and many other \"Controlling Elites\", yes including some Republicans!\n\nD. The information used in (Hunter Gate) was originally intended to be used as blackmail. Blackmail, from Chinese officials to democrat leaders, due to the anti Chinese sentiment in the USA. Sentiment the people of America have for China's corrupt handling of many things, China blackmailed many \"Controlling Elites\" to stay loyal to the CCP, and to quell the Anti-Chinese Sentiment.\n\nE. The FBI, is actively trying to undermine Trump, and has had access to Hunter Gate and evidence of many other crimes committed by \"Controlling Elites\" (Example Epstein).\n\nF. Their is political infighting in China, party officials are in a power struggle (You will see how this ties into Hunter Gate later). Party officials are planning to assassinate each other, freeze the oppositions financial assets, and much worse.\n\nBy the end I will make a good case for the following. (these are not yet facts, however, they are most likely true according to evidence.)\n\nG. Corona Virus, is not a spontaneous natural disease. It was made in a lab. While it may not have been intentionally released, China decided to let it spread in order to distract people from Hong Kong so they could take it, cause chaos so they can invade Taiwan without opposition, have an excuse for the draconian measures currently taking place in China, and in the end gain allot of economic power since they had time to prepare a plan.\n\nH. Qanon, is right to a certain extent. Their is a group of \"Controlling Elites\" that do abuse children (refer to Epstein). These \"Controlling Elites\" do perform weird rituals and do a ton of drugs. They are also right that the \"Controlling Elites\" actively monitor and censor much of the news and internet and do silence people that step out of line. They are partially false that Trump is not partially involved in some of these corrupt schemes (Probably committed some tax evasion), albeit, he is way less guilty compared to a majority of \"Controlling Elites\". However, they are right that Trump battling to try to expose some of these evil people (Maybe he had a change of heart and truly is a fighter for good now, or maybe he just wants to win his re-election and enlarge his ego, either way he is actively trying to \"drain the swamp\".) .\n\nI. The US election will result in some sort of \"day of reckoning\" and possibly a guerilla style civil war. and eventually World War 3. This will be the result of 3 things. 1. Neither party will accept defeat, they will both claim the other party committed criminal acts and is rigging the votes, unfortunately both sides of that argument are right, Albeit the Republican is considerably more clean. 2. We will see groups like Antifa and Proud Boys clashing by voter stations, Mail in voting also will not work in states doing it for the first time, and we WILL have enormous amounts fraud. Most likely, we will never know who won the election of 2020. 3. The world is at a tipping point, no matter who wins the instability in America will create a ton of instability both financially, and politically for most of Planet Earth. The instability will most likely result in the following wars. {India vs Pakistan} {Europe vs Muslims} {American Conservatives vs American Liberals} {China vs most of the world} {Russia vs former soviet nations} {Greece/Armenia vs Turkey/Azerbaijan} and a huge list of other smaller wars and guerilla conflicts.\n\nBefore we begin, I will tell you the order in which I will state the evidence, so you can see how it fits together.\n\nFIRST, I will show the bombshell reports dropped by Mainstream media on 10/15/2020+. We will talk about the claims being made.\n\nSECOND, I will show you footage of whistleblowers talking about the information released by the mainstream media months and weeks prior to Hunter Gate, and Covid-19. Meaning they are credible sources. Their claims are being proven today, so the claims they made that haven't been proven yet are probably true too. We will talk about the specific claims and the damning evidence. Trust me, the evidence is damming, and the claims are horrific. I will also talk about how the Whistleblowers got this information, why they got it, and who has it now.\n\nTHIRD, we will evaluate the claims made by the \"OG Leakers\" that is what I will refer to this specific batch of leakers as for the rest of the document. We will tie in these leaks to many other pieces of the puzzle. We will prove that Epstein didn't kill himself, and much much much more.\n\nFourth, We will talk about the implications of this, and what the future holds.\n\nCHAPTER ONE: HUNTER'S OCTOBER SUPRISE\n\nOn October 16th of the year 2020, just weeks away from the election, a political Nuke was dropped by the New York Post. They claimed to have access to a hard drive that including thousands of emails, photos, video's, and text messages belonging to Hunter Biden. We will talk about the way they received this information and why they received this information later.\n\n[https://nypost.com/2020/10/16/hunter-biden-emails-pics-reveal-wild-life-pained-soul/](https://nypost.com/2020/10/16/hunter-biden-emails-pics-reveal-wild-life-pained-soul/)\n\n[http://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2020/10/16/new-york-post-hunter-biden-photos-claim-to-show-](http://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2020/10/16/new-york-post-hunter-biden-photos-claim-to-show-before-and-after-dental-work-to-fix-meth-mouth/)\n\n[before-and-after-dental-work-to-fix-meth-mouth/](http://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2020/10/16/new-york-post-hunter-biden-photos-claim-to-show-before-and-after-dental-work-to-fix-meth-mouth/)\n\n[https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2020/10/15/photo-of-hunter-biden-smoking-crack-released-from-abandoned-laptop/](https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2020/10/15/photo-of-hunter-biden-smoking-crack-released-from-abandoned-laptop/)\n\nIt started off, as some mildly corrupt dealings (Totaling in the millions) and some pictures of Hunter doing drugs. But later turned, into violent p0rn0s of Hunter sexually assaulting people, a list of secret deals between Russia, China, and the Biden's totaling the the BILLIONS, and many other corrupt schemes!\n\n[https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-chins-firm-emails-deal](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-chins-firm-emails-deal)\n\n[https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/emails-reveal-how-hunter-biden-tried-to-cash-in-big-with-chinese-firm/](https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/emails-reveal-how-hunter-biden-tried-to-cash-in-big-with-chinese-firm/)\n\nThe \"Controlling Elites\" worked to quickly silence this. On Twitter and Facebook posts mentioning the leaks where shadow banned, deleted, and censored. Their panic, partly contributes to the credibility of the leaks (Since they are trying really hard to censor them), and shows the media being a corrupt pawn in this sick game of power and sex. The Biden campaign is smarty choosing to completely ignore these claims, as if they outright deny them, they would have to prove their point. Which is impossible since you really cant deny these thousands of emails and photos that have valid timestamps and involve hundreds of people and lots of money. In fact, some media outlets are literally claiming this whole this is a crazy Qanon conspiracy lead by \"right-wing-facist-whitesupremacist\". They are deflecting, again they cannot logistically deny, they can only deflect/ignore/and discredit.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hybkzCWb\\_w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hybkzCWb_w)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enyep7yAKxY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enyep7yAKxY)\n\n[https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-lashes-out-at-cbs-reporter-when-asked-about-ny-post-report-i-have-no-response-another-smear-campaign](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-lashes-out-at-cbs-reporter-when-asked-about-ny-post-report-i-have-no-response-another-smear-campaign)\n\n[https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rnc-fec-twitter-complaint-claims-company-made-illegal-in-kind-contribution-biden-campaign](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rnc-fec-twitter-complaint-claims-company-made-illegal-in-kind-contribution-biden-campaign)\n\nLook at what the first results are if you try to search this story on google chrome\n\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=rudy+giuliani&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD\\_enUS830US830&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01-vZN8aQ198o5hJ3P9IQVMKI2Sig:1603217453195&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj7gq624sPsAhUHqp4KHb7\\_AMgQ\\_AUoAXoECC0QAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969](https://www.google.com/search?q=rudy+giuliani&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS830US830&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01-vZN8aQ198o5hJ3P9IQVMKI2Sig:1603217453195&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj7gq624sPsAhUHqp4KHb7_AMgQ_AUoAXoECC0QAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969)\n\nOkay so that's the whole story right? Honestly its already pretty terrible if you think about it. But if you dig deeper it gets much worse! Get ready for some P3d0philic activity, some murder, and power grabs.\n\nCHAPTER TWO: INTERCEPTION\n\nFrom now on I will try to include 2 links to each video, one to a mainstream source, and another to a different source. This is because I think the following YouTube Videos are going to be deleted or censored any minute now, hopefully we can use wayback software to see the deleted videos. The point is, the timestamps on these YouTube videos show information leaked by the \"OG leakers\" was made weeks and sometimes months in advance to the headlines of Mainstream media today, and they have access to other claims and evidence that have not been released yet.\n\nThe first video is a English translated version of a summary of claims made by Lude Media on September 24th. Lude is an independent Chinese journalist who usually focuses on exposing corrupt Chinese officials, not Planet Wide Evil Schemes. Lude is credible because he works with and has direct contact with a man named Guo Wengui, Guo was formerly the 73rd richest many in China (That's pretty damn rich). Guo defected from the CCP and fled to America, where he now exposes his former Chinese Comrades corrupt schemes from his apartment in New York. Here is a link to information about Guo and another to Ludes Twitter.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guo\\_Wengui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guo_Wengui)\n\n[https://twitter.com/ding\\_gang](https://twitter.com/ding_gang)\n\nMainstream media is slowly catching on to the fact that Guo Wengui and his associates knew about Hunter Gate and much more and where trying to ring the bells and blow the whistle on this months ago.\n\n[https://www.thedailybeast.com/chinese-billionaires-network-hyped-hunter-biden-dirt-weeks-before-rudy](https://www.thedailybeast.com/chinese-billionaires-network-hyped-hunter-biden-dirt-weeks-before-rudy)\n\nNow what exactly where the claims Guo and Lude made? I will let you see for yourself. The following video is a summary of their claims, it was originally in Chinese but thankfully translated to English. It was posted on YouTube September 24th, and includes a string of clips made by Lude over the past few months. These claims include detailed evidence. Remember the date of this video, now read the headlines. The crazy statements he made are true, we will discuss the evidence later.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bXgULtz6cI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bXgULtz6cI)\n\n[https://www.bitchute.com/video/HfcWb0AfsuOm/](https://www.bitchute.com/video/HfcWb0AfsuOm/)\n\nNow that we have seen this sources credibility, and the claims he is making. Let's talk about how this information came to be. After all you would try really hard if you where part of a Pedophilic, Global, Crack eating, Cabal to keep that a secret right? So why was all this on a hard drive, and how did people find this hard drive. By the way, before we continue I need to clarify something important, the Cabal and the \"Controlling Elites\" Work together, but they are not a formal group (Not illuminati but all behave like it). Basically they all want similar things so they informally work together to get those things, unrestricted sex, ton's of Drugs, Loads of money, Egotistical Power, and a life of luxury. It's the extent they go, the fact they (As leaders of Humanity) do it, and the idea they informally work together to achieve this is important. Okay, so back to the point. This hard drive was originally indented to be used to blackmail mostly democrat government officials, and it was made by a prestigious group of people in the CCP. This is where the story gets complex. The prestigious group (which you will learn about in the following video) has 3 main motives. 1. They want American politicians to remain loyal to them, China rip's of America all the time, and they get away with it because they bought out politicians. Normal Americans are waking up to this, and their is allot of Anti-Chinese hatred not just in America but around the globe due to CoVid-19, Invasion of Hong Kong, Human rights violations, and Breaking many trade rules. They are afraid that democrats will try to appeal to voters by appealing to this sentiment, so they sent the blackmail to tell them, if you try to fight us, we will make you personally suffer. 2. This is also a power grab for this group of Prestigious Chinese people (Its complex so I will be simple.) This group wants Xi Jinping OUT, the hard drive contains many corrupt deals involving Xi and his gang and the Biden's. They are hoping they can squeeze out Xi and take the power for themselves. 3. They are trying to create unrest in America, unlike Russia, China is actually a real threat. They benefit off Americas Chaos, because it allows them to invade, and steal without repercussion sense America's attention is focused elsewhere. Here is a video detailing why the hard drive(s) where created and how they where located.\n\n[https://twitter.com/HimalayaGlobal/status/1316456905343074304](https://twitter.com/HimalayaGlobal/status/1316456905343074304)\n\n[https://www.bitchute.com/video/OcaVxFJOTxzx/](https://www.bitchute.com/video/OcaVxFJOTxzx/)\n\nPersonally, I think the narrative that the hard drive was found by a computer fixer in Iowa months ago who stumbled upon a broken laptop is to good to be true (This is the narrative pushed by Mainstream Media.) However, it is true the FBI and many other big players had this information in their hands a long long long time ago. Their is evidence the FBI had a warrant to get this hard drive months ago from Hunter, for guess what (Child p0rn). We will talk about how the FBI is partially involved in fighting trump and some of these corrupt dealings later. Dear FBI if your reading this, seriously I'm just a normal dude that sits on my ass and mostly play's video games (But I write books about philosophy too). Also I support law enforcement and know all of you are not bad. Also I'm stating public information so yeah. Not tyrna get in trouble or anything, like just comment if you have a concern bro. Or like censor my posts Lmao. Also I am a kid believe it or not.\n\n[https://postnewsera.com/watch?id=5f8b7cca9d7ca5144824dc5e](https://postnewsera.com/watch?id=5f8b7cca9d7ca5144824dc5e)\n\n[https://wearethene.ws/notable/152860](https://wearethene.ws/notable/152860)\n\nHere is evidence the FBI is working against Trump.\n\n[https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-race-and-ethnicity-archive-bdd3b6078e9efadcfcd0be4b65f2362e](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-race-and-ethnicity-archive-bdd3b6078e9efadcfcd0be4b65f2362e)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/14/fbi-agents-text-reportedly-disclosed-by-justice-watchdog-well-stop-trump-from-becoming-president.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/14/fbi-agents-text-reportedly-disclosed-by-justice-watchdog-well-stop-trump-from-becoming-president.html)\n\nAnyways, the official story goes that the Iowa Computer guy made 4 copies of the hard drive (Damn thats allot of work) 1 Went to the FBI, and he sent another copy to Rudy Giuliani because he didn't trust the FBI (Who would have thought!?). Rudy, a former New York Politician who is responsible for Crushing crime in New York, (And has ties to 9/11, lol thats not important just funny Rudy is a key part in two of the biggest conspiracies' known to the human race.) Anyways Rudy is the guy who apparently got that hard drive, than gave it to the New York Post. This is partially true, he is the guy who got it into the hands of conservative mainstream media, but his story about how he got it is probably false. Guess what, Their is a picture of Rudy and Lude (The OG leaker I mentioned earlier) holding hands and its a fairly recent picture, but you need to follow my instructions to see it. Watch this video again, BUT MAKE SURE YOU PAUSE THE VIDEO ON THE VERY FIRST FRAME.\n\n[https://www.bitchute.com/video/OcaVxFJOTxzx/](https://www.bitchute.com/video/OcaVxFJOTxzx/)\n\nTheir is the iconic photo, I had another source of the photo, but I cannot find it anymore, I think it was taken down.\n\nThis is allot to take in I know, so lets take a laughing break together shall we? Here is a article I hope will make you smile.\n\n[https://pagesix.com/2020/10/17/matthew-mcconaughey-reveals-his-dad-died-while-makin-love-to-his-mother/](https://pagesix.com/2020/10/17/matthew-mcconaughey-reveals-his-dad-died-while-makin-love-to-his-mother/)\n\nDamn, his dad is a legend, Anyways. back to the story.\n\nCHAPTER 3: ANALYZING THE DATA\n\nFirst and foremost, I have just given you access to a neat list of tons of evidence and sources. Please do your own additional research. So far we know Lude made the claim a hard drive was going to be released on Western media including a p0rn0 of hunter and a minor, Hunter doing illegal drugs, and a list of super corrupt business dealings, and information regarding the true essence of the Corona Virus. Lude also predicted Covid-19's impact on January 19th, months before the mainstream media of the world. If you want more info on that one, go look for yourself. In fact this is a short chapter. I challenge you to look at the list of Claims and evidence Lude, Guo, and now the mainstream media have on these corrupt dealings. Especially pay attention to the claims made by Lude that haven't come true yet!\n\nChapter 4: THE FUTURE?\n\nSince the begging of the human race, people have fought other people to have a better life. As a philosopher and a biologist, I can tell you this is a natural concept. Most lifeforms do this. However, humanity is much more complex. Many humans in power have used their power in immoral ways to commit atrocious acts throughout most of history. But don't start saying yeah screw the rich and powerful. Remember people at the bottom \"Normal/Poor/Peasants\" do this too, but not to the extent of the Cabal. People at the bottom hurt each other and steal just for a loaf of bread, or a hit of dopamine, or a couple bucks. I believe in capitalism and am a Nationalist Libertarian. My point is this, the elite are corrupt! But that doesn't mean its communist time. Communism/Socialism is the worst form of government for the people and the best for the elite. CHINA is communist! This is because ironically Communism is just Capitalism, except the elite have a monopoly on everything, not just the economy, but also you. We must not allow America to fall for this trap. Our system can work, and it has worked. But democracy is only as good as the people who make it work. Its supposed to be We the people, yet for the past 40 years barely anybody shows up to the ballot box.\n\n(Bias incoming)\n\nI'm going to vote Trump, not because I support him personally, but because he is at least trying to really drain the Swamp. Life is special, we only get like 80 years on this planet. Like why we got to have all this evil stuff. We don't and it starts with changing our idea of success. We are taught to be successful you need to be surrounded by attractive sexual partners, have loads of cash, and be a cool party kinda guy. If you don't believe me go listen to some of the top music tracks in America over the past 5 years, mostly rap about (Hoes, Drugs, Power, and Chasin the Green). I ask you to stop sharing this idea. We are conscious animals on a rock floating through space, and their is science that can help us figure out why. I am an atheist and all this conflict (Which usually stems from Religion) makes me really depressed. With our technology, we could live forever. But my guess is that will be a honor only the elites will get.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SbF6rdpq24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SbF6rdpq24)\n\nMy fellow humans, right now we are being divided by race, religion, and sexual orientation in order to control us. And Ill be honest, the solution is not necessarily to unite. I don't believe in judging people by race or sexual orientation as long as they keep it to themselves. But I do believe that religion is the root of all this chaos. Muslims/Jews/and Christians/Athiest cannot live in harmony. And before you say I am discriminating, remember that race is something you cannot control, but religion is a choice. Religion is the root of all of this. I don't think religion is bad for the common man, but its simply not true. And it empowers the big guys. However, I think your average Muslim/Jew/Christain/Athiest Black/White/Hispanic/Asian Democrat/Republican can agree this shit is wrong and needs to stop!\n\nAnyways that's my 2 cents. I'm gonna sulk alone now. Btw for anybody struggling with depression due to similar causes please watch this video, its what keeps me going.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14)\n\nIf you made it this far, please save my post and share.

I suspect Monday/Tuesday we get a lot of talk about the stimulus after the weekend and Trump\u2019s Friday offers.

        "selftext": "I bought some NNDM in June as a long term investment. Actually, I suspected that 3D printed circuit boards were a solution looking for a problem, and I just bought a few just in case that this problem would show up. The fact that ARK Invest held some NNDM added to my hope. In fact, I found NNDM first in ARK holdings listing.  The recent jump did seriously surprise me though. \n\nThi video gives some company background and how ARK caused the recent jump - it was really just the beginning of that jump when this video came out: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TewGHLpIpvM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TewGHLpIpvM)\n\nNano Dimension seems to market its products and services as an alternative to ordering prototype PCBs from conventional PCB providers. As an electrical engineer, I don't see much use for circuit boards shaped as solid 3D objects in typical consumer or industrial electronics - folded rigid flex PCBs will probably remain the more economic alternative.   \n\nBut I think there is an elephant in the room which Ark Invest noticed before they started their Nano Dimension share buying spree. Do you remember the last point in the Tesla Battery Day Presentation - where they talked about making the battery pack a load bearing part of the car?  \n\nIn a communication satellite, you could turn the circuit boards into load bearing structures. In a conventional satellite, the satellite structure must hold the circuit boards and other parts of the satellite together and protect them from G-forces and vibration during the rocket launch. In a 3D printed design, the circuit boards themselves could become the structure of the satellite. You could print large parts of the satellite as solid chunks of material, containing circuits and antennas and possibly other parts of the satellite. This will reduce size and weight. Less weight of the satellite structure reduces the need for propellant for orbital station-keeping, which reduces the total mass of the satellite even further.   \n\nAlso note that SpaceX has yet to build and launch about 11000 satellites for their Starlink network.",

Market participants are digesting the first batch of corporate earnings, special events from giants Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), and as usual, developments in Washington regarding fiscal stimulus.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished even on the day. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) 0.64% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.58%.\n\nEconomists and financial analysts expect companies within the S&amp;P 500 to post an aggregate earnings per share decline of 19.4% over this year. This estimate is higher than the 20.5% decline predicted back in the Spring. LPL Research said in a note, \u201cThe increase in analysts\u2019 earnings estimates reflects increased confidence in the outlook, even with the challenges Covid-19 still presents in terms of social distancing, various safety protocols, and shifting consumer behavior. We have been encouraged by recent data pointing to a continued steady reopening of the economy, and we believe the likelihood that additional lockdowns may meaningfully impair business activity remains very low.\n\nToday, in a letter, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the White House\u2019s new proposal for coronavirus aid, saying that \u201cin terms of addressing testing, tracing and treatment, what the Trump Administration has offered is wholly insufficient.\u201d After a day of promising developments yesterday, it appears stimulus negotiations have stalled once again. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel said his party was preparing a new, targeted package of \u201croughly $500 billion\u201d. However, Pelosi has stated in the past, in response to the airline relief bill, that she will not support targeted stimulus, only a comprehensive package. Over the weekend, the Trump administration called on Congress to pass a smaller $1.8 billion coronavirus relief bill as negotiations on a bigger package continue to run into roadblocks.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Today Apple announced a slate of new products, including the next generation of iPhones (the iPhone 12) that supports the burgeoning 5G network.

        "selftext": "[THE PARTYS OVER FOLKS] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2esNgO_wrDQ)\n\n\n***Its the year of our lord 2020.*** The film Idiocracy was meant to be a comedy, but has since turned to a documentary. Idiots on every scale imaginable breeding and turning out more retarded people on a scale that is off the charts. Financial markets have never been calibrated with this much stupidity and greed baked into the world. We have overspent and overbudgeted everything since WW2 where we turned out to be a surprise #1 contender in the world. \n\n \n\nSince the 50s credit, the deficit, and the explosion of technology has created an avalanche of debt that has been growing and growing in CHYNA. and eventually the hybrid communist/capitalist monster that is the CCP will come for their $. They believe their time to have an empire that the sun never sets on is coming. Through asian parenting and sheer numbers they have acquired and groomed the smartest people in the world. You think Huawei and Alibaba are just sitting around and are going to be content to stay in Asia? No. Those bateaters are coming for their slice of pie that is the failed American Experiment. You can pinpoint where our greed spiraled out of control when Lewis Ranieri in the 70s came and unknowingly invented the mortgage backed security, which created a cascading effect of debt that has become our #1 industry. \n\n\nTo make matters worse religious fundamentalists and retards like the president just simply dont care, and havent for years. We got off the gold standard, invented synthetic transactions, and just print more and more money. Go to NYC and look at the huge sign and just listen to the electronic hum. You stare at the numbers and its so big it almost doesnt make sense. 27 TRILLION dollars is an idea you think about rarely but hardly ever contemplate the enormity of. Its like the size of the ocean. Sure you go to the beach and you think wow isnt that big? But its an entirely different thing to sail through an ocean and actually experience it. So when you look at the number that is $27,000,000,000,000.00 its almost a cartoon like obscure fabrication that our retarded chimp brains cant quite grasp. And one more thing- If you walk behind the sign that shows our debt in real time you know what you will see on the back of it? Made In China. \n\n \n\n\nAnd to you dumb fucks that think because America has the #1 culture in the world and that will save us let me ask you this. Do you think Athens was worried when they had the best culture in the world? Nah we're good weve got sandals, gay philosophers, olive oil, and wine! We're fine. What about Rome? Oh we're all good we've got this huge empire, we killed Jesus (very cool, thanks), and we make Italian food. They thought they would be able to beat back the invading horde with their superior army and based on cultural merit. When infact all they ever really did was kill that hippie carpenter, build some roads, and create indoor plumbing? Remember when England had the biggest Empire of all time and dominated the world in every category? Where are they now? They elected the smarter version of Trump, shot their dick off with Brexit, and are the laughingstock of Europe. Now everytime you drink tea youre reminded of how much of a bitch country England is and how shitty the food there is.  \n\nExcept this time its going to be the Chinese army coming over the hills and invading, but they wont have weapons, theyll have financial papers. Chinese repo men are coming soon to a town near you and we're all gonna have to be Chaturbaturs begging for money because our country has failed us, and our #1 cultural export is stepdad porn. Except in a little while its going to be all Chinese people groping Americans and we'll have to act like we like it just like your favorite pornstar does. \n\n\n\n\n\nAnyways this obese gay comedian is mostly funny but sometimes insightful. He has lived quite a life from an alcoholic diehard Bush administration supporter/ mortgage banker /comedian. Check out his shit its good.\n \n\n**TLDR My Portfolio is a Bull but deep down I know I'm a \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b like Tim Dillon**",

I can do a follow up on everyone's average, that should give us a the \"wisdom of the crowd effect\", and give a good estimate on where it will stop. Come back to the post for the QQQ number.

        "selftext": "Listen up, your grand pappy is going to tell you how to double your money (shares) or multiply your money (options) over the next few months. You see, there is this new company HYLN which completed its reverse merger (SPAC born) and ticker change on Friday. It\u2019s set to \u201cIPO\u201d Monday (tomorrow) with the CEO of the company ringing the bell to open the NYSE. Later in the day, he will be live on FOX Business to discuss the company. This scene is being setup at the NYSE as I type for the big day tomorrow...\n\nHYLN truck being setup at the NYSE for tomorrow\u2019s reveal\n\nI will lay it out for you in simplified bullet points below.\n\n* HYLN offers the only functional EV solution for class 8 vehicles (think semi-trucks).\n* This is the rare chance to invest in an EV play that does something that not even Tesla can do at this moment. It is much easier to electrify a small box that drives a few people around but to make something with the range, power and efficiency to carry 80,000 lbs is a different story.\n* They actually have functional products which are receiving great reviews. See this review by an actual truck driver test driving their product.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws2UyviL2Ec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws2UyviL2Ec)\n* Their trucks claim a 0-60 of 20s fully loaded at 80,000 lbs which is just as good as if not better than other ICE options. They also have significant range due to their technology. The cost of ownership is very low as well.\n* HYLN benefits from a unique situation. They provide the specialized power trains and handful of other parts for these vehicles. This means they do not suffer from lacking the resources and massive effort needed to mass produce an entire new vehicle from scratch like most new EV startups do.\n* They also benefit here because most blue collar truck operators/owners are able to keep something they have been mostly familiar with for years and not have to transition to a completely new creature like a Tesla truck, etc. Most of these drivers want something they already feel comfortable in and are resistant to change.\n* They offer multiple options: All electric, Hybrid CNG, and Hybrid Diesel.\n\nThree different power train options.\n\n* There are deals in place and likely more coming.\n* See Wegmans.  [https://www.wegmans.com/news-media/articles/partnership-with-hyliion-american-natural-gas/](https://www.wegmans.com/news-media/articles/partnership-with-hyliion-american-natural-gas/)\n* See 1,000 truck pre-order w/ global logistics leader Agility [https://www.hyliion.com/hyliion-launches-fully-electric-powertrain-announces-1000-truck-pre-order-with-global-logistics-leader-agility/](https://www.hyliion.com/hyliion-launches-fully-electric-powertrain-announces-1000-truck-pre-order-with-global-logistics-leader-agility/)\n* They made some major moves bringing important people in to the business.\n* This includes a former White House Chief of Staff and Secretary or Transportation Andrew Card. [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200730005211/en/Hyliion-Announces-Andrew-H.-Card-Jr.-to-Join-Board](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200730005211/en/Hyliion-Announces-Andrew-H.-Card-Jr.-to-Join-Board)\n* The CFO of Union Pacific Corporation (operates one of the largest railroad systems in US) - Robert Knight.  [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200917005235/en/Hyliion-Announces-Robert-M.-Knight-Jr.-to-Join-Board-of-Directors](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200917005235/en/Hyliion-Announces-Robert-M.-Knight-Jr.-to-Join-Board-of-Directors)\n* Has Dana Inc as lead investor and partner [https://www.fleetowner.com/running-green/article/21703564/dana-takes-stake-in-hyliion-in-another-boost-for-electrification](https://www.fleetowner.com/running-green/article/21703564/dana-takes-stake-in-hyliion-in-another-boost-for-electrification)\n* Hired a lobbyist - The Vogel Group to lobby for issues regarding EV sector [https://projects.propublica.org/represent/lobbying/r/301022355](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/lobbying/r/301022355)\n* The timing is great because they benefit from multiple new important mandates by many states and the US to move away from the traditional ICE\n* California banning ICE vehicles [https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035)\n* Coalition of states formed to ban ICE industrial vehicles [https://www.denverpost.com/2020/07/19/colorado-transition-to-electric-trucks/](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/07/19/colorado-transition-to-electric-trucks/)\n\nWhy now is the time to invest.\n\nHYLN was born from a SPAC (SHLL) and quickly became the king of SPACs due to many of the items listed above as it ran to \\~$60. It has since been the victim of quite a few items that has deeply discounted it for currently $40. These include...\n\n* NKLA fallout. NKLA was an EV SPAC, so its fall hurt HYLN. There are many posts your can find on Reddit that describes the vast differences between the two. HYLN is on the far opposite end of the spectrum compared to NKLA. Without going in to major details...\n* HYLN actually has functional real world trucks!\n* HYLN CEO Thomas Healy is the exact opposite of the NKLA CEO. He even catches hate sometimes for not promoting his business ENOUGH and simply states he wants to focus on building his trucks!\n* HYLN has put together a serious TEAM of individuals to make this thing fly.\n\nOther factors that have allowed for you to buy in at a discount...\n\n* SEC comments on SPACs a few weeks ago caused major SPAC selloff. Good news, this is not a SPAC anymore, its HYLN!\n* A victim of the current market conditions and selloff last few weeks.\n* The SHLL/HYLN merger vote had to be extended because one item vote regarding restructuring of their board did not pass. This caused nervous investors to sell. Again, this is no longer a SPAC and the merger is complete.\n* Many analysts and investors had projected $70-80 PT for SHLL/HYLN before the end of the year with some going as high as $100. I think a good comparison for HYLN is Cummins (CMI) (as opposed to other EV companies) which is currently trading at $210. With all of the crazy IPO mania, sky is the limit.\n\nFriday\u2019s Action\n\n* On Friday, stock screeners picked up massive bullish flow for HYLN. It was #7 in calls placed and had multiple big buyers as well as a ton of sweeps and blocks. Look it up.\n\nBottom line: Good company, formed a great team, doing things right, unique technology, hot sector, regulations help them, going to the moon.\n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m am long HYLN shares and own weekly, monthly and leap options on HYLN.",

This had led to drastic cost reductions in the cost to launch satellites.\n\nBig players have announced the intention to launch as many as 46,100 satellites in the next few years. That\u2019s more than five times the amount of objects sent to space in the past 60 years,\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany of these these satellites will be launched into orbit by being attached to a large rocket (ride sharing) which itself has its own payload to deliver and agenda to fulfill. Momentus comes in by attaching a custom launch vehicle to the large payload carrier (such as the Falcon-9 SpaceX rocket) and delivering specific payloads into specific orbits along the route of the large rocket (which CAN NOT be accomplished solely by the rocket itself)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(See below in risks why I do not believe SpaceX will become a competitor)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[SpaceX revamps smallsat rideshare program - SpaceNews\\]([https://spacenews.com/spacex-revamps-smallsat-rideshare-program/](https://spacenews.com/spacex-revamps-smallsat-rideshare-program/))\n\n\u201cIn addition to its expanded rideshare launch program, SpaceX also announced an agreement with in-space transportation company Momentus Aug. 22. Momentus will fly its Vigoride tug on a SpaceX dedicated rideshare mission, allowing satellites with a total mass of up to 250 kilograms to fly to custom orbits after deployment from the Falcon 9. SpaceX identified Momentus as its first customer for a dedicated rideshare mission.\n\n\u201cWe are showing that ridesharing from the Falcon 9 will be a game-changer. By ferrying payloads to multiple orbits from a single launch, we multiply the capability of an already very impressive system,\u201d said Mikhail Kokorich, chief executive of Momentus, in the statement announcing the agreement.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\*\u201cSpaceX partnership\"\\*\\_ (in quotes for a reason)\n\nMomentus has bought out space of several future SpaceX rocket launches. Depending on how their platform works out, and assuming success, we can expect a productive partnership with SpaceX. The company has made it clear they do not intend to enter Momentus\u2019s market space and has said that Starlink is their main intent with sat launches. \n\nBummed you cant invest in SpaceX? Well as SpaceX continues to grow and drive so does Momentus. Larger rockets launching at cheaper prices mean better prices for a company who is buying out space on each launch.

This inspired Kessler, an astrophysicist, to show that there is a point when the amount of debris in an orbit gets to critical mass. At that point, the collision cascading would start even if no more things are launched into space. And once the chain of explosions begins, it can keep going until the orbital space can no longer be used.  According to NASA estimates, the Earth\u2019s orbit currently has  \\[500,000 pieces of space debris\\]([http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/faqs.html#3](http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/faqs.html#3))  up to 10cm long, over \\*21,000\\* pieces of debris longer than 10cm, and more than \\*100 million pieces\\* of space debris smaller than 1cm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuote from u/ \\[Boring-End-6178\\]([https://www.reddit.com/user/Boring-End-6178/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Boring-End-6178/))  regarding the risk of SpaceX becoming potential competition \n\n\"If your angle is if SpaceX focused their engineering capacity on integrating with their small-sat providers in order to launch satellite busses to get them into their proper orbits, then my answer would obviously be yes (though Momentus has great technology and patents around their water plasma tech, but I\u2019m sure SpaceX could figure out something).\n\nBut for the reasons stated above, they won\u2019t. This is a niche market compared to SpaceX\u2019s aspirations. SpaceX is focused (and will achieve) inter-solar travel and colonizing a whole new planet. That is a gigantic task that even SpaceX is nowhere near capable of doing now. Their sole focus is achieving that goal (with Starlink being a cash flow means to an end which is a colossal project in itself). So yes, while SpaceX\u2019s engineering talent dwarfs Momentus, their aspirations and goals dwarf Momentus\u2019 just as much.

SpaceX is NOT in the business of sending satellites to their mission, they are in the business of LAUNCHING them.\n\nSpaceX doesn\u2019t make pieces that other people can pick up and stick to their own devices, they make entire systems. That\u2019s just their vision. It is a completely different scope of engineering and a completely different market.

        "selftext": "Looks like Hyliion is gearing up for a big push tomorrow. Ringing the bell to open the trading day, multiple interviews/segments scheduled on the news and this.... https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyliion/comments/j59ur9/exciting_day_tomorrow/\n\n\nThe time for Hyliion's \"IPO\" (HYLN) has come.\n\n**About Hyliion**\n\nThe company description below comes from a recent Business Wire article.  I can't provide the link as a certain other company can't be mentioned in the link itself:\n\n&gt; Hyliion\u2019s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion\u2019s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion\u2019s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment\u2014in the case of Hyliion\u2019s Hybrid systems\u2014or fully replace\u2014in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system\u2014traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion\u2019s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers\u2019 pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives.\n\n**Investor Presentation**\n\nAs someone else wrote here, [Hyliion (HYLN) is not the next Nikola.  This is a good thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j03etb/hyliion_hyln_is_not_the_next_nikola_this_is_a/)\n\nThe company's Investor Presentation can be found [here](https://rpn113p35qekzef7411kp2qt-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Hyliion-Tortoise-Overview-Presentation.pdf).\n\nAs can be shown in the presentation:\n\n1) HYLN has its defined niche: Class 8 trucks.  Not even Tesla will be competing in this field, for a decade or more.\n\n2) HYLN has a total addressable market of $800 billion in the US alone.  One customer, Agility, operates in 100 countries.\n\n3) HYLN won't play the capital-intensive game of setting up EV-related infrastructure.  They are not in the business of being a \"gas station.\"\n\n4) HYLN will first use renewable natural gas and natural gas generators for its Hypertruck electrified powertrain systems, yet is already developing them to be compatible with fully electric solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells.  They are being practical here in addressing the needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of trucks (for the trucking industry).\n\n5) HYLN already has operational prototypes.\n\n6) HYLN already has million-mileage logs for the first number of trucks already deployed.\n\n**Renewable Natural Gas**\n\n[An article on FreightWaves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/nikola-hyliion-defend-divergent-paths-to-zero-emission-trucking) provides a brief summary of what renewable natural gas is:\n\n&gt; Renewable natural gas (RNG) starts as a biogas from the decomposition of organic matter, such as wastewater, food, green waste and farming. It is cleaned and processed into biomethane that is injected into the pipeline. When used as a transportation fuel, RNG has a negative carbon intensity, said Deanna Haines, director of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy at SoCalGas.\n\nRNG production is expected to [double in the near future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WnTNJZTqo4&amp;feature=youtu.be).\n\nInfrastructure-wise, there are plenty of natural gas stations in Europe.  For example, Italy has over 1,400, while Germany has over 800.\n\n**Battery Management Supply Chain**\n\nTwo years ago, Hyliion [acquired Gentherm's battery division](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/equipment/hyliion-acquires-battery-producer) to have its battery management supply chain in-house.\n\n**Financials**\n\nFuture-oriented revenue data (projections), per the Investor Presentation, are as follows:\n\n2020: $1 million\n\n2021: $8 million\n\n2022: $344 million\n\n2023: $1.0 billion\n\n2024: $2.1 billion\n\nNot every target company in a reverse merger discloses current or historical financial information.  In this case, however, [such information can be found in an SEC filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-022028/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=c38d42b8c68dad4fd4c816b5799dca4bdbe435aa-1601600373-0-Ae7hxOZAy6LXjWjw6G7Ra_bQuy3Ig2re0xzZ8HVp3NVtRg9gOZ5UW-0RpnGg7RMobRYDNgh92m3CLI6_6k-MCw37XKHDzhqXsb7mFT7iOpdy6MWA5MmZDeLPzdmwjftk-8c17hucybdmgOAOT2jSXkLq8EKx3JW11mzOSq1OdzbNrRlsDNo4PBbPshX1D7_0H_3jIyGFkesJQTFSKlqU5VgiVIsKYwGqGh0xUOpq9apt1EOGGQh4UPw7ZpYFYlJduNqSM48x8ZtJn3L4CTdkTRbBINYlTg0c4elHQXkcxtIQpP1bCLZ1aMTRwKqmtTNDSMhiMj0Tv0EMfU5lBYL_xHNul5htXHIinMHI7D2xxBGW8VfbbFp1gRuuUJoeZylFnw#ta_006).\n\n**Values and Governance**\n\nHyliion has just committed to its reverse merger while having a non-classified board.  It's one thing to assert that the company isn't conducive to fraud like Nikola has been (such as plastic model vehicles with no operating prototypes, or fake orders).  It's quite another to demonstrate this.\n\nOne of the problems Nikola has is having a classified board.  In the long run, a classified board isn't as effective as a non-classified board.  This comparison extends to fraud prevention.\n\n**Stock Price Disadvantages**\n\nBeing an engineer by background, Thomas Healy does not have the marketing skills of Trevor Milton.\n\nWhile Hyliion itself has the potential to break away from the Nikola drama, HYLN's price will likely remain quite dependent upon TSLA's price movements, just like all the other stocks in the EV space.  Any out-of-control tweet by Elon Musk, let alone any performance hiccup over at Tesla, could have adverse effects on HYLN.\n\n**Stock Price Advantages**\n\nEven I expected a second wave of COVID-19 to have a correction effect on tech stocks.  I was mistaken in this regard, as large institutional funds have rotated back into the tech sector, including that part of it which is future-tech oriented (TSLA, SHOP, FSLY, ZM, etc.).\n\n**Evaluation**\n\nHYLN is a solid hold for at least five years, maybe even ten.  It is definitely worth a starter position first thing in the morning, and an additional position or two later in the day, for DCA purposes.\n\n*Disclosure: Long on shares and warrants.*",

        "selftext": "So, every time there's a post here relating to any article or information about the last new European or American fintech coming to bankrupt all the big Canadian banks, I'm the first to say that banking in Canada is a very powerful oligopoly and that they have been shutting down any effort to take over their business. \n\nWell, I think there's a new player that has a lot of potential to ruin them without leaving them a chance to say anything and I'm not talking about holding Bitcoin in Wealthsimple. \n\nThere has been a new development in the crypto space and it's called decentralized apps. Without getting into details, there are now ways to deposit crypto into a vault and earn interest out of it and it's also possible to borrow coins on the same dapp. One such mature dapp and protocol is called Compound. It also gives you token that allows you to vote on decisions about the protocol. The rates are low, but higher than EQBanks' own.\n\nConsidering that there are now some Visa Card working only with Crypto, I'm wondering where will be the need for banks' checking and savings account? \n\nOf course, there are big hurdles right now. For one, the fees are quite high on the Ethereum chain, the blockchain where most of the action like Compound is happening. Some days, you can be charged as much as $100 just to confirm that you can make a transaction. To address that, there's already an Ethereum 2.0 coming and other chains like Binance secure chain and [EOS.IO](https://EOS.IO). Also, the whole Finance Dapp scene is pretty much in beta, which means you can lose everything in a glimpse just because of a coding error. To counteract that, some platforms are already offering insurance. This in only to say that the market is pretty young; the buzz only started 2 months ago.\n\nI only see it becoming more and more customer friendly to a point where banks will lose business. I guess they will try to prompt the government to make new laws, but to the rate that everything is going, I think the technology will already have major adoption, just like Airbnb and Uber. \n\nWhat do y'all think about that? Do you think banks will win again with their Open Banking stuff? Do you know if any bank announced strategies to address the crypto space?\n\nTL;DR: Do you think Defi apps will once and for all take over the big Canadian Banks?

        "selftext": "The time for Hyliion's \"IPO\" (HYLN) has come.\n\n**About Hyliion**\n\nThe company description below comes from a recent Business Wire article.  I can't provide the link as a certain other company can't be mentioned in the link itself:\n\n&gt; Hyliion\u2019s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion\u2019s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion\u2019s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment\u2014in the case of Hyliion\u2019s Hybrid systems\u2014or fully replace\u2014in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system\u2014traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion\u2019s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers\u2019 pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives.\n\n**Investor Presentation**\n\nAs someone else wrote here, [Hyliion (HYLN) is not the next Nikola.  This is a good thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j03etb/hyliion_hyln_is_not_the_next_nikola_this_is_a/)\n\nThe company's Investor Presentation can be found [here](https://rpn113p35qekzef7411kp2qt-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Hyliion-Tortoise-Overview-Presentation.pdf).\n\nAs can be shown in the presentation:\n\n1) HYLN has its defined niche: Class 8 trucks.  Not even Tesla will be competing in this field, for a decade or more.\n\n2) HYLN has a total addressable market of $800 billion in the US alone.  One customer, Agility, operates in 100 countries.\n\n3) HYLN won't play the capital-intensive game of setting up EV-related infrastructure.  They are not in the business of being a \"gas station.\"\n\n4) HYLN will first use renewable natural gas and natural gas generators for its Hypertruck electrified powertrain systems, yet is already developing them to be compatible with fully electric solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells.  They are being practical here in addressing the needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of trucks (for the trucking industry).\n\n5) HYLN already has operational prototypes.\n\n6) HYLN already has million-mileage logs for the first number of trucks already deployed.\n\n**Renewable Natural Gas**\n\n[An article on FreightWaves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/nikola-hyliion-defend-divergent-paths-to-zero-emission-trucking) provides a brief summary of what renewable natural gas is:\n\n&gt; Renewable natural gas (RNG) starts as a biogas from the decomposition of organic matter, such as wastewater, food, green waste and farming. It is cleaned and processed into biomethane that is injected into the pipeline. When used as a transportation fuel, RNG has a negative carbon intensity, said Deanna Haines, director of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy at SoCalGas.\n\nRNG production is expected to [double in the near future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WnTNJZTqo4&amp;feature=youtu.be).\n\nInfrastructure-wise, there are plenty of natural gas stations in Europe.  For example, Italy has over 1,400, while Germany has over 800.\n\n**Battery Management Supply Chain**\n\nTwo years ago, Hyliion [acquired Gentherm's battery division](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/equipment/hyliion-acquires-battery-producer) to have its battery management supply chain in-house.\n\n**Financials**\n\nFuture-oriented revenue data (projections), per the Investor Presentation, are as follows:\n\n2020: $1 million\n\n2021: $8 million\n\n2022: $344 million\n\n2023: $1.0 billion\n\n2024: $2.1 billion\n\nNot every target company in a reverse merger discloses current or historical financial information.  In this case, however, [such information can be found in an SEC filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-022028/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=c38d42b8c68dad4fd4c816b5799dca4bdbe435aa-1601600373-0-Ae7hxOZAy6LXjWjw6G7Ra_bQuy3Ig2re0xzZ8HVp3NVtRg9gOZ5UW-0RpnGg7RMobRYDNgh92m3CLI6_6k-MCw37XKHDzhqXsb7mFT7iOpdy6MWA5MmZDeLPzdmwjftk-8c17hucybdmgOAOT2jSXkLq8EKx3JW11mzOSq1OdzbNrRlsDNo4PBbPshX1D7_0H_3jIyGFkesJQTFSKlqU5VgiVIsKYwGqGh0xUOpq9apt1EOGGQh4UPw7ZpYFYlJduNqSM48x8ZtJn3L4CTdkTRbBINYlTg0c4elHQXkcxtIQpP1bCLZ1aMTRwKqmtTNDSMhiMj0Tv0EMfU5lBYL_xHNul5htXHIinMHI7D2xxBGW8VfbbFp1gRuuUJoeZylFnw#ta_006).\n\n**Values and Governance**\n\nHyliion has just committed to its reverse merger while having a non-classified board.  It's one thing to assert that the company isn't conducive to fraud like Nikola has been (such as plastic model vehicles with no operating prototypes, or fake orders).  It's quite another to demonstrate this.\n\nOne of the problems Nikola has is having a classified board.  In the long run, a classified board isn't as effective as a non-classified board.  This comparison extends to fraud prevention.\n\n**Stock Price Disadvantages**\n\nBeing an engineer by background, Thomas Healy does not have the marketing skills of Trevor Milton.\n\nWhile Hyliion itself has the potential to break away from the Nikola drama, HYLN's price will likely remain quite dependent upon TSLA's price movements, just like all the other stocks in the EV space.  Any out-of-control tweet by Elon Musk, let alone any performance hiccup over at Tesla, could have adverse effects on HYLN.\n\n**Stock Price Advantages**\n\nEven I expected a second wave of COVID-19 to have a correction effect on tech stocks.  I was mistaken in this regard, as large institutional funds have rotated back into the tech sector, including that part of it which is future-tech oriented (TSLA, SHOP, FSLY, ZM, etc.).\n\n**Evaluation**\n\nHYLN is a solid hold for at least five years, maybe even ten.  It is definitely worth a starter position first thing in the morning, and an additional position or two later in the day, for DCA purposes.\n\n*Disclosure: Long on shares and warrants.*",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 5th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks fall following Trump\u2019s positive virus test, but close off the worst levels on stimulus hopes  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stocks fell in volatile trading on Friday after President Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus diagnosis fueled concerns about the election and a worsening pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; Major averages clawed back some of the steep losses after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled aid for the airline industry could be coming soon, perhaps even as part of a much-anticipated broad relief bill.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 134.09 points, or 0.5%, lower at 27,682.81 after dropping 430 points at its session low. The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.0%, or 32.36 points, to 3,248.44 after falling as much as 1.7% earlier. The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.2%, or 251.49 points, to 11,075.02.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of airlines jumped higher in unison after Pelosi called on the industry to delay furloughs, saying relief for airline workers is \u201cimminent.\u201d American Airlines and United erased earlier losses and popped 3.3% and 2.4%, respectively.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe will either enact Chairman DeFazio\u2019s bipartisan stand-alone legislation or achieve this as part of a comprehensive negotiated relief bill, extending for another six months the Payroll Support Program,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement.\n*****\n&gt; Earlier Friday, Pelosi said Trump\u2019s illness changed the dynamic of stimulus talks, adding lawmakers will find the \u201cmiddle ground\u201d and will \u201cget the job done.\u201d The House passed the $2.2 trillion Democratic coronavirus stimulus bill Thursday night, while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has offered a $1.6 trillion package.\n*****\n&gt; Still, the president\u2019s diagnosis added more uncertainty to the election, an event that was already weighing on the market and keeping traders on edge as they attempted to evaluate the possible outcomes. It also raised concerns about a second wave of the virus and a slower reopening.\n*****\n&gt; White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said in a memo, \u201cThe President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Conley also said he expects Trump to \u201ccontinue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Friday Trump was having \u201cmild\u201d symptoms after testing positive for the virus and that he and Melania are in \u201cgood spirits.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Trump campaign announced that all events involving the president\u2019s participation are going virtual or being temporarily postponed.\n*****\n&gt; Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence have both tested negative for the coronavirus, Pence\u2019s spokesman said Friday. Mnuchin has also tested negative, the Treasury\u2019s assistant secretary for public affairs said Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis October surprise raises the already high level of political uncertainty markets are dealing with as Election Day approaches,\u201d said Jeff Buchbinder, equity strategist at LPL Financial. \u201cMarkets appear to be increasingly pricing Joe Biden in as the favorite, and this news may not change that, but Trump could gain support from a quick recovery.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Trump tweet initially knocked down Dow futures more than 500 points in overnight trading.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt really brings into stark reality that we are potentially going into \u2026 a second wave,\u201d said Jeff Henriksen, co-founder and CEO of Thorpe Abbotts Capital, to CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box Europe.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump getting this really highlights that in a way that I think it will focus attention back on the virus and the effects it will have.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Technology shares led the declines on Friday with Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook all losing more than 2.5%. Tech stocks could come under pressure under a Democratic sweep scenario if it leads to higher tax rates and tighter regulations, many strategists have said. Investors also could rotate out of technology shares and into more cyclical stocks if a stimulus is passed.\n*****\n&gt; Also weighing on the sentiment was a worse-than-expected September jobs report. Nonfarm payroll rose by 661,000 in September, the Labor Department said Friday in the final jobs report before the November election. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected a jobs gain of 800,000. The unemployment rate fell to 7.9% last month.\n*****\n&gt; The sell-off in oil prices intensified as Trump\u2019s coronavirus news added to the industry\u2019s demand concerns. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, slid 4.3% to $37.05 per barrel on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Some on Wall Street said the markets overreacted to Trump\u2019s medical condition.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors should not panic over the news,\u201d Sean Darby, global equity strategist at Jefferies, said in a note. \u201cIt was a tail risk since other global leaders have contracted the virus, but the forthcoming US election should not be delayed in any way... 2020 has seen many 2, 3, and even 4 sigma events, and this political tail risk is by no means as big.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have staged a historic rebound since the economic shutdown sent stocks tumbling in March. But the major averages all finished September lower, snapping a five-month win streak, as doubts emerge about the pace and breadth of the recovery.\n*****\n&gt; Despite Friday\u2019s weakness, major averages all posted modest gains for the week. The 30-stock Dow gained 1.9%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq rose 1.5% each this week.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3J0V6o1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TI8ImmZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/90v084y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne7m07y.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UZt0DJ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HA7KsPc.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NzmRLPp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eqS3Lk4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/k9v1hZX.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UtkozzH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KNI9qkQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/OM44UFj.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Make Up Your !@#$%^&amp;* Mind!\n\n&gt; We've all had versions of this conversation where you or the person you were talking to just couldn't make up their mind. At the end of the day, it only causes trouble and plans are ruined.\n\n&gt; The market is having its own back and forth this year trying to decide between growth and value. Just today, growth stocks are getting slaughtered while value stocks are up marginally. As an example, the Russell 1000 Growth index is down 1.8% on the day while the Russell 1000 Value index has managed to rally 0.25%. The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the Russell 1000 Growth index and the Russell 1000 Value index for each day in 2020. Today's performance spread between the two indices marks the ninth time this year that value has outperformed growth by more than two percentage points. At the other extreme, there have also been eight trading days where growth outperformed value by more than two percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-2020.png))**\n\n&gt; So how does this year's frequency of days where the performance spread between the two indices was more than two percentage points stack up to other years? The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the two indices going all the way back to 1990. Over the last thirty years, the only two periods where we saw a frequency of these large daily dislocations was back in 2008 and the period spanning 2000 and 2001. In fact, with 17 days this year where the performance spread between the two indices was greater than two percentage points, the only other years that saw a higher frequency of large dislocations were 2000 (54) and 2001 (28). If you think the market has been indecisive this year, in 2000 we saw these types of daily dislocations an average of once per week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-All-Years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n&gt; But October has become a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October\u2019s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Have Democratic Sweeps Meant for the S&amp;P 500?\n\n&gt; Headed into the first presidential debate Tuesday night, betting markets (ElectionBettingOdds.com) placed Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the slight favorite to take the White House in November. The debate resulted in Biden gaining another 5 percentage point chance of winning the Presidency. As of this morning, Biden's odds to win are at 59.8% versus Trump's odds of 38.9%. Additionally, Democrats are slight favorites to win control of the Senate (58.4% to 41.5%) and big favorites to maintain the House (82.8% to 17.1%). Given these odds, in the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the three months before Election Day through three months after Election Day for all election years post-WWII that resulted in a sweep of the executive and legislative branch by the Democrats.\n\n&gt; As shown, on average the S&amp;P 500 has been on the decline in the weeks leading up to Election Day, though in the days just before the Election there has been a small rally that sharply reverses once the results come in. After the initial post-Election drop, the market has trended a bit higher, but by three months after the Election, it has only found itself around the same levels as Election Day; on average a 2.6% loss versus where the index stood three months prior.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps3.png))**\n\n&gt; The composite shown above is comprised of six different years: 1948, 1960, 1964, 1976, 1992, and 2008. While on average the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower, it is not necessarily a sure-fire thing. For example, 1948 and 2008 were the only years that saw the S&amp;P 500 trade and stay significantly lower in the wake of the election. In 1976, there was similarly a sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the election, but the index did make its way back up to the highs of that six-month time frame later on albeit no new high was put in place. Meanwhile, 1960, 1964, and 1992 all saw the S&amp;P 500 run higher after the election even despite some periods of consolidation after initial moves higher. In our B.I.G. Tips report from Tuesday, we show these same charts for all Presidential election years post WWII including a look at the average performance given every potential election outcome.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Current Returns Stack Up to History\n\n&gt; Even after September's weakness, the S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month total return stood at an impressive 14.9%. Given the events of the last 12 months, one could even say that performance is remarkable. What's even crazier is that the S&amp;P 500's performance over the last 12 months is more than three times stronger than the 12 month period before that (+4.25%). The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's annualized total returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares that performance to the historical average return of the index over those same time periods.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's historical average 12-month return is 11.7%, so the current 14.9% gain exceeds that average by more than three full percentage points. Over a two-year window, though, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 9.4% is more than a full percentage point below the historical average. Looking further out, the S&amp;P 500's trailing five and ten-year annualized return has been much stronger than average, which makes sense given the long bull market we were in. Over a 20 year window, though, the S&amp;P 500 is only just starting to work off some of the declines from the dot-com bust and as a result, the 6.4% annualized gain is a four and a half percentage points below the long-term average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show how the current performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each of the time frames shown compares to all other periods on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's performance over the last year, ranks just below 56th percentile of all other periods, while the two-year performance ranks just below the 42nd percentile. Even as the five and ten-year periods have seen well above average returns, they still rank in just the mid-60s on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's ranking over a 20-year time period is a completely different story ranking in single-digits on a percentile basis. Even with the equity market right near record highs, the last two decades have been forgettable for US equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns-Ranks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonals Are Back In Style Again\n\n&gt; There is no denying that market seasonality has not worked so well this year. But we have been here before and history is on our side. Over the long term, intermediate term and short term market seasonality has suffered brief periods when seasonality was overridden by more powerful forces. The COVID pandemic and economic shutdown certainly qualifies. But it is only a matter of time until repetitive human behavior patterns and people and institutions return to moving money around in the usual daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and seasonal patterns.\n\n&gt; The return of perennial September weakness is emblematic of a return to normal market behavior and a reflection of the fact that despite the continuing concerns about surges in coronavirus cases life is beginning to return to normal. In our area, about 25-30 miles north of New York City, our kids are beginning hybrid learning, playing rugby, lacrosse and other sports (yes with some COVID protocols, but tackling and facing-off), golf outings are happening and people are going to restaurants and out and about.\n\n&gt; The chart here shows the historical One-Year Pattern of the S&amp;P 500 Since 1950 versus 2020. The black line shows the seasonal pattern since 1950. The blue represents the pattern since 1988. We use 1988 as it is the first year after the 1987 Crash when the market underwent a major systemic change with the implementation of downside protection circuit breakers and collars. It is noteworthy how the seasonal pattern persists during both the 70-year and 31-year timeframes.\n\n&gt; 2020 is plotted on the right axis due to the magnitude of the move this year. The yellow box highlights the rebirth of seasonality this September, especially during this notoriously negative Week After Triple Witching Week as detailed page 108 of the 2020 Almanac, indicated by the two black arrows\n\n&gt; Years like 1980, 1982, 2009 and 2016 with unseasonably early weakness and bear markets like 2020 returned to normal seasonal patterns in short order. And years like 1954, 1958, 1980, 1982, 1995 and 2009 that exhibited double-digit gains in the Worst Six Months still proceeded to deliver further sizable gains in the subsequent Best Six Months (page 52, STA 2020). We believe the return of market seasonality is upon us. So remain cautious through the end of September and be alert to Octoberophobia, but remain ready to pounce on our Best Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal, when it triggers.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0a4a6ba18e7d903b198c8fa7d6cf8bc4/9c2d30c4da9ff340-d7/s500x750/eb0c36b5ff7eec394f463ca8420054c22a88010f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 2nd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiTS26b5YO8))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DuBcN1Z.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zy3ktow.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pt0NiLh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yaviiRp.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Vdaqsaj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ipdesH4.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 13, 2020**\n\nStocks traded mostly lower today, losing some of yesterday\u2019s gains. Market participants are digesting the first batch of corporate earnings, special events from giants Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), and as usual, developments in Washington regarding fiscal stimulus.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished even on the day. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) 0.64% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.58%.\n\nEconomists and financial analysts expect companies within the S&amp;P 500 to post an aggregate earnings per share decline of 19.4% over this year. This estimate is higher than the 20.5% decline predicted back in the Spring. LPL Research said in a note, \u201cThe increase in analysts\u2019 earnings estimates reflects increased confidence in the outlook, even with the challenges Covid-19 still presents in terms of social distancing, various safety protocols, and shifting consumer behavior. We have been encouraged by recent data pointing to a continued steady reopening of the economy, and we believe the likelihood that additional lockdowns may meaningfully impair business activity remains very low.\n\nToday, in a letter, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the White House\u2019s new proposal for coronavirus aid, saying that \u201cin terms of addressing testing, tracing and treatment, what the Trump Administration has offered is wholly insufficient.\u201d After a day of promising developments yesterday, it appears stimulus negotiations have stalled once again. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel said his party was preparing a new, targeted package of \u201croughly $500 billion\u201d. However, Pelosi has stated in the past, in response to the airline relief bill, that she will not support targeted stimulus, only a comprehensive package. Over the weekend, the Trump administration called on Congress to pass a smaller $1.8 billion coronavirus relief bill as negotiations on a bigger package continue to run into roadblocks.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Today Apple announced a slate of new products, including the next generation of iPhones (the iPhone 12) that supports the burgeoning 5G network. It also announced a new smart home speaker and a new way to charge devices, called MagSafe, which lets charger, cases, and other accessories snap onto the back of the device using a magnet. The stock was down today, after rallying around 6% yesterday. \n* Today is Amazon Prime Day \"one-day only event filled with more deals than Black Friday, exclusively for Prime members around the globe.\" The world\u2019s largest online retailer is slashing the prices on a lot of popular items.\n* Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY) late-stage trial of its leading monoclonal antibody treatment for the coronavirus has been paused by U.S. health regulators over potential safety concerns, the company confirmed. The stock was more than 3.3% down at the time of writing. \n* Delta Airlines (DAL) reported worse than expected earnings in EPS and revenue. Stock was more than 2% down.\n   * EPS of -$3.30 vs -$3.10 estimate\n   * Revenue of $3.06 billion v $3.12 billion. \n* Big banks showed remarkable strength in earnings, despite the effects of the pandemic.\n   * Citigroup (C) reported EPS of $1.40 vs $0.77 estimate and Revenue of $17.3 billion vs $17.18 billion estimate. Stock was more than 4% down at the time of writing\n   * JP Morgan (JPM) reported EPS of $2.92 vs $1.86 estimate and Revenue of $29.90 billion vs $28.20 billion. Stock was around 1.5% down at the time of writing. \n* Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) better than expected earnings. The stock was 2.3% down at the time of writing.\n   * EPS $2.20 vs $1.98 estimate\n   * Revenue of $21.08 billion vs $20.15 billion estimate.\n   * The company late-stage coronavirus vaccine was paused after a participant reported an \u201cadverse event\u201d about 36 hours earlier, the company\u2019s chief financial officer said today\n* Boeing (BA) said Tuesday that it didn't win any new orders in September and delivered only 11 aircrafts this month, due to decreased demand in light of the pandemic.\n* Workhorse (WKHS) shares are around 12.8% after a USPS contract decision was reportedly delayed, prompting a stock downgrade from Roth Capital.\n* BMO Capital markets upgrades in the hotel space:\n   * Hilton Hotels (HLT) $72 to $89 from UNDERPERFORM to MARKET PERFORM\n   * Host Hotel Resorts (HST) from $12 to $14 from MARKET PERFORM to OUTPERFORM\n   * Marriott International (MAR) from $83 to $95 UNDERPERFORM to MARKET PERFORM\n* Foot Locker (FL) upgraded by Bank of America from $20 to $50 at BUY.\n* Jefferies Financial upgraded:\n   * Cubesmart (CUBE) from HOLD to BUY at $42\n   * Extra Space Storage (EXR) from HOLD to BUY and $121 to $135.\n* Disney (DIS) was upgraded by Loop Capital from HOLD to BUY at a price target of $150. Announced they are shifting strategy to streaming as the primary form of \n* entertainment!\n* Activision Blizzard (ATVI) was upgraded by the Royal Bank of Canada from HOLD to BUY and the price target raised to $90 from $75.\n* Zendesk (ZEN) had a target raised by the Royal Bank of Canada from $110 to $130 at OUTPERFORM.\n* Twilio (TWLO) had targets raised by Needham and Northland securities from $320 to $340 at BUY, and from $290 to $340 at OUTPERFORM. This stock is a monster!\n* TakeTwo Interactive (TTWO) had target raised by Deutsche Bank from $175 to $200 at BUY.\n* Peloton (PTON) had target raised by Robert W. Baird from $120 to $140 at OUTPERFORM. This stock has been on a tear!\n* Service Now (NOW) had a price target raised by Royal Bank of Canada from $510 to $600 at OUTPERFORM. This has been a monster stock, no end in sight... keep an eye out!\n\n\"Faith without action is dead. It is the art of believing by doing, coming as a result of persistent action.\" Napoleon Hill",

        "selftext": "You will think I am shilling a company.\n\nIn reality I am looking why I could be wrong and why this is a terrible investment.\n\nIs David Sinclair full of it? And if yes, why?\n\nHe is doing research on anti-aging.\n\nHere is a summary video interviewing him:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRt7LjqJ45k\n\nHe has also been on Joe Rogan show and is pretty popular in anti-aging, longevity community.\n\nTheoretically one should be able to invest in his company: \n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/lifebiosciences\n\nhttps://sharespost.com/life-biosciences_stock/ \n\nthey are on SharePost.\n\nIf one buys pre-ipo of a company that will solve aging, that would be insane.\nNo guarantee he will do that, but... Won't this be the next big thing aside Space/AI?\n\nWe already had the electric car boom. Pretty much reached its peak.\nWe had the FAANG stock boom, AI, tech.\n\nThis is something people haven't been paying much attention to.\n\nLongevity and anti-aging.\n\nAnd its even bigger than all else. Not everyone needs a car, but literally everyone wants to be not age and not suffer from age related diseases.\n\nNo guarantee Sinclair will be guy to find cure, but someone eventually will, right? Ok, maybe in 20-30 years, but some company will.\n\nAnd you just need to get in on early in Pre-IPO via SharePost, EquityZen or ForgeGlobal and sit tight, right?\n\nOr do you think this is quite stupid and naive even?\n\nMaybe he has built up all this reputation and hype only to cash out on his company by doing experiments on rats\n\n I've noticed that so many things in medicine work on rats, but not on humans.\n\nMaybe some huge pharma company will solve this sooner, someone like Jonhson&amp;Jonhson or GSC? What are the biggests risks here?\n\nI guess smart person would look at all the competitors also. Its not like Sinclair found this one cure and other major pharma companies or cosmetics companies are straight up ignoring it.\n\nIt's not like Johnson and Johnson don't have teams researching this stuff as well, also checking out stuff that Sinclair has done and doing their own research on it.\n\nSorry for wall of text. Just an interesting area to think about that many I don't think are paying attention to.\n\nIf anyone here has experience investing in anti-aging, longevity companies, would be happy to discuss.",

        "selftext": " \n\nI posted before about Doubleview Gold (TSXV: DBG.V / OTC: DBLVF) , and I'm believing in it now more than ever. A lot of us think there is a very, very good chance that we are going to be significantly wealthy for no other reason than that we got lucky and have a friend whose roommate's dad is an employee with the company. No Joke. Would've never heard about it otherwise. There is a very very large proven gold/copper porphyry deposit in the Lisle Zone. Read the DD, watch the interviews.\n\n\\-Was given a $0.47 price target (check yahoo finance) without even a preliminary maiden resource estimate (and even the report highlighted that price was at a 90% discount)\n\n\\-Location/Camp allows for 24/7 365 drilling. This is EXTREMEMELY rare. Every other miner has to stop drilling for the winter.\n\n\\-Gold/Copper edging historic high (oh baby)\n\n\\-Cobalt Metallurgist at the drill site, also is a Telsa consultant\n\n\\-Look at KDK (Kodiak) - jumped 0.25-3.50 on much worse g/t at lower intervals than DBG already has\n\n\\-Look at TUD (Tudor Gold/also in Golden Triangle) -  jumped 0.42-3.35 on much worse results than DBG already has\n\n    (tud only owns 60% of their property, dbg owns 100% of theirs) \n\n\\- Test hole H034 had 1.06 g/t over 235m. H-034 was mineralized all the way to 700m (that's all they had planned to drill to), and was in higher quality and quantity at depth... suggesting that a deeper hole would SIGNIFICANTLY expand the already massive confirmed gold/copper site. And as we speak the financing for this drill season is complete, and the drills have been turning on H035 with the goal of getting to 1500m, but with the equipment to go to 2000m if the cores keep looking mineralized. The drill has been turning for over 6 weeks now, they are drilling DEEP. This is a really big deal. Red Chris mine is a textbook example of a runaway gold stock, and the Lisle Zone anomaly is looking to be both larger and deeper than the Red Chris mine. We are expecting drill results mid - late October. \n\nHere are two interviews with the CEO (He owns 22% of the company) where he outlines his result expectations and a timeline. He also compares DBG to other similar mines in the area.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNUCtoF6Ga4&amp;t=6s&amp;ab\\_channel=DoubleviewGoldCorpTSX.V%3ADBG.V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNUCtoF6Ga4&amp;t=6s&amp;ab_channel=DoubleviewGoldCorpTSX.V%3ADBG.V)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pebWC\\_yZ8bU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pebWC_yZ8bU)\n\nHere's an interview with D4, the guy who writes their reports and sold his 911 to buy more shares.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK2oGK2DfXQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK2oGK2DfXQ)\n\nHere are 3 market reports and 39 pages of DD[https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=kK2oGK2DfXQ&amp;event=video\\_description&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.ceo.ca.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1fgbht7-Doubleview%2520Gold%2520Reports%252005%2520July%25202020.pdf&amp;redir\\_token=QUFFLUhqa1VpZ1BIRUZEeHE3cW5WSEtiOWNSdnFBQ3ZyQXxBQ3Jtc0trNHBrbzg4dHB5Z3M0dDJDZmdQby1xY1V2MVY0NWo4VVdXWGZOM2FaeHRudjk5d2wyRXRkNTZ1NkxCUVI0N2xtV2ZzODRzY2lBQjVHbVR4eWZYd0RaeUhTcFRtMmV0S1FHQzFQUVBvcjBiZjU4UGtzaw%3D%3D](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=kK2oGK2DfXQ&amp;event=video_description&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.ceo.ca.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1fgbht7-Doubleview%2520Gold%2520Reports%252005%2520July%25202020.pdf&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa1VpZ1BIRUZEeHE3cW5WSEtiOWNSdnFBQ3ZyQXxBQ3Jtc0trNHBrbzg4dHB5Z3M0dDJDZmdQby1xY1V2MVY0NWo4VVdXWGZOM2FaeHRudjk5d2wyRXRkNTZ1NkxCUVI0N2xtV2ZzODRzY2lBQjVHbVR4eWZYd0RaeUhTcFRtMmV0S1FHQzFQUVBvcjBiZjU4UGtzaw%3D%3D)\n\nThis company (up until the financing that just closed) was 80% owned by the CEO, family, and friends. I'm sharing this because it just seems like a no-brainer. I'm a blue collar guy; I'm not smart, and I'm not stupid. I can't find any holes in this. I wanna get rich just like everyone here, and have (for me) a significant stake in this. This is worth a fraction of what a lot of people think it'll be after a buyout. Look at the DD and market reports. All of us want to be INVESTORS, not just blindly trade a stock. Wait til a buyout, cash out, and hop into our new Lamborghinis laughing like Jeff Bezos. This is the first time I feel included in an investment. The telegram group as a lifeline to other investors is invaluable, and because of it I feel like I now understand a whole sector (Junior mining), and you also seem to find out about news before anyone else.\n\n(If you want to get in the telegram just shoot me a message).\n\nLook into it $$$",

        "selftext": "Hey wallstreet bets- Heres my post from 15 days ago which got me banned for no good reason. Well today HGEN is gapping up and I think the run can continue. You can thank the mods for missing this mornings gap up.\n\n\n*Tucker Carlson interview from Friday https://video.foxnews.com/v/6197198838001#sp=show-clips \n\nHumanigen (HGEN) formerly Kalosbios was officially uplisted to the Nasdaq on September 18th. The company is revamped with a completely new and impressive management team. A lot of  J&amp;J experience on the board. After the Skereli years this company really took a nose dive, getting delisted and trading as low as 0.30. \n\nSo your probably wondering what\u2019s going on here? What\u2019s causing the resurgence in HGEN and the Nasdaq up list? The companies prized drug Lenzilumab is showing very promising results as a potential therapeutic for severe cases of Covid-19. The anti body drug is being used to treat Cytokine storm in Covid-19 patients. The company has flown mostly under the radar for the past few months due to their trading on the OTC markets. They have an ongoing phase III trial which should be complete by the end of the month with results by the end of October. They were also selected by the NIH for their Big Effect trail to see if Lenz could be an effective treatment when being used in collaboration with Remdesivir.\n\nOn their call last month the following analysts were in attendance. Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo, Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald, Madhu Kumar with Robert W. Baird, Anthony Butler with Roth Capital, Joseph Pantginis with H.C. Wainwrigh,t Kevin DeGeeter with Oppenheimer, Benjamin Burnett with Stifel Nicolaus, Olga Smolentseva with Bryan, Garnier &amp; Co. This type of institutional interest for an OTC stock is unheard of and just shows the amount of institutions which were waiting for an opportunity to invest here. Most institutions cannot invest in OTC stocks due to compliance issues, but now that they are up listed we should see buying and analyst coverage pick up in the coming weeks. \n\nPricing of a public offer with JP Morgan was announced on September 17th where they raise d68 million in funding for Lenz. Manufacturing colab with Lonza was announce on Monday as well as a Positive Phase III review by the Data Safety Monitoring Board.\n\nAlso of note some of the biggest biotech investment luminaries invested here in June raising 72 million including Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners, Surveyor Capital, HealthCor, Valiant Capital Partners, First Light Asset Management, and Ghost Tree Capital. \u2013 At the time this sotck trade OTC and this is the biggest pipe funding in OTC history\n\nYou can see a lot of the big players already have interest here, and with the Nasdaq uplist today this should start to get a lot more mainstream attention in the coming weeks. Interviews on CNBC, Bloomberg, etc. Remember, you couldn\u2019t even trade this on Robinhood before today.\n\nSome more updates since my last post:\n\nSeptember 23 \u2013 Humanigen Announces Thermo Fisher partnership to expand manufacturing for Covid-19 Therapeutic candidate Lenzilumab\n\nHumanigen Announces COVID-19 Case Report Demonstrating Rapid Resolution and Discharge after Single IND Emergency Use Authorization of Lenzilumab https://www.humanigen.com/press/Humanigen-Announces-COVID-19-Case-Report-Demonstrating-Rapid-Resolution-and-Discharge-after-Single-IND-Emergency-Use-Authorization-of-Lenzilumab%E2%84%A2  \n\nRoth Capital initiates coverage with a $25 price target.  \n\nPosition: 30K in shares \u2013 Options are available but Nasdaq uplist happened recently so volume is still light. I personally would stick with shares. * Disclaimer this stock has a tendency to be very volatile with a market cap under 1 billion. \n\nhttps://www.humanigen.com/press/Humanigen-Expands-Phase-III-Study-of-Lenzilumab-in-COVID-19-to-Brazil\n\nhttps://www.humanigen.com/press/Lenzilumab-COVID-19-Case-Control-Study-Published-in-Mayo-Clinic-Proceedings-Journal\n\nhttps://www.humanigen.com/press/Humanigen-Announces-Review-of-Lenzilumab-Phase-3-Study-in-COVID-19-by-Data-Safety-Monitoring-Board\n\nhttps://www.humanigen.com/press/Humanigen-Announces-Pricing-of-Public-Offering-of-Common-Stock-and-Commencement-of-Trading-on-Nasdaq-Under-the-Symbol-%E2%80%9CHGEN%E2%80%9D",

That being said, there is a lot of talk from Trump's lil' spout about Covid therapeutics - but the real show is when he does, not says.

I know you're thinking, \"Remdesivir is a Gilead drug\". Well there isn't moving a $60 stock up much further -  but there is a near penny stock chance of possibly a $KODK like return. $BSGM has a drug that is almost into Phase 3 trials: Merimepodib.

Trump is also willing to take a whole bunch of trial drugs - and here's a penny's chance at something big. This is like the $NVAX move, maybe even better.

        "selftext": "Daily Synopsis - \n\n* The S&amp;P 500 increased +1.61% today while the NASDaq outperformed by (+3.12%). The Russell 2000 advanced (+0.67%). The Dow ended in positive territory at (+0.89%)\n* The best performing sector was Information Technology(+2.73%) while Materials(-0.17%)was the worst performer.\n* Briefly recapping the latest on stimulus, House Democrats and Senate Republicans rejected the $1.8 trillion offer from the White House for different reasons. Based on the relatively broad-based advance in the market, investors presumably remained in agreement that a deal will eventually be reached, either under the current administration or new leadership in 2021. \n* The financials sector (+1.1%), undeterred by the lack of deal, had a solid outing ahead of earnings reports from several big banks tomorrow morning. Elsewhere, PepsiCo (PEP 142.13, +3.69, +2.7%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup, and Twilio (TWLO 329.72, +23.48, +7.7%) agreed to acquire Segment for approximately $3.2 billion in stock. \n* With the U.S. Treasury market closed for Columbus Day, commentary mainly focused on the bullish price action in equities. Consequently, it\u2019s reasonable to believe that a fear of missing out on further gains was another factor that fueled the positive momentum in the market. The S&amp;P 500 closed within 1.5% of its all-time high. \n* Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, the Consumer Price Index for September, the Treasury Budget for September, and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September are scheduled for Tuesday.

        "selftext": "Hi Investors,\n\n**This one is specifically for those who invest in the Stock/Financial markets.**  \n\n\nLately I have noticed a couple of things: \n\nFirst, many traders who have trading accounts under $25,000 have told me that the most frustrating thing about trading an account that size is the PDT rule ([Pattern Day Trading Rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/patterndaytrader.asp)). Or having to trade a cash account because of the PDT rule.\n\nSecondly, almost all of the day traders that I speak to don't know very much about trading Futures. More importantly, they **don't know that the PDT does not exist for Futures**, therefore you can trade an account much smaller than $25,000 without any restrictions regarding number of trades you can place over a given period of time.\n\nThe other thing that many aren't aware of are E-Mini and also Micro E-Mini Futures. These products have a smaller contract size and are therefore much more accessible to the average trader.\n\nFor an introduction to what Micro E-Mini Futures are, [I recommend this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4Ie18MMBU) with guest presenter from the CME Group.",

Florida has the highest net domestic rate in the US and will be a major benefactor of the exoduses from NY and other metropolitan cities - the data reflects this in terms of mobility, differentials in moving costs, and an 88% growth in $1mil plus sales in Miami-Dade. JOE is priced like it isn't going to sell at least 1000 lots this Q3 ALONE... they've got 100% lease rates on there new properties, their lots are selling like hotcakes with a 100% margin, and every segment of their business has increased revenue significantly through COVID while keeping costs roughly the same.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 5th, 2020.\n\n# **Trump\u2019s health and fiscal stimulus fight will steer the markets in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/trumps-health-and-the-fiscal-s.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump\u2019s health and the state of a fiscal stimulus package will be the main focus for markets in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; In the early morning hours Friday, President Donald Trump tweeted that he and the first lady tested positive for Covid. Stocks sold off hard, but the S&amp;P 500 came off its lows in Friday trading and closed down just under 1%. It was up 1.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; The market was helped by signs that a stimulus package is still a possibility, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked airlines not to furlough workers. She promised either a stand alone aid bill, or a bigger negotiated relief legislation that would help the industry.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to watch health updates from the White House medical staff, and it\u2019s going to watch how the president communicates with the public,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives at BTIG. \u201cWill we see him in person in the next week in any form? What\u2019s his volume of tweets? All as a way to first gauge the severity of the case.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Trump and Melania Trump are reported to have mild cases, but as time goes on the market will turn to how the illness could impact the presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; Former Vice President Joe Biden gained slightly in the polls after the first debate Tuesday night, and now the calendar for further debates is in question. The market has seemingly warmed to Biden, and even though he would raise taxes, it is assumed Democrats would quickly pass a major infrastructure package if there is a Democratic sweep of Congress.\n*****\n&gt; Trump, however, is widely seen on Wall Street as stronger on the economy and better for markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done from a campaign perspective, is you\u2019ve taken away the thing that gives him the most energy - his ability to interact with crowds,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe president had wanted to paint the economic recovery of the last three or four months as the cornerstone, and this basically puts the virus back as topic number 1, number 2 and number 3. And it\u2019s all the more so because the data is coming in weaker than expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The market is fixated on the prospect of stimulus to help business, the unemployed and state and local governments. The House passed a $2.2 trillion package this week, but there is still no agreement with Republicans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pushed for a $1.6 trillion package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s an underlying bid under the market because nobody wants to be super short if we get a stimulus approved, but you can\u2019t be too long in case his mild symptoms turn into severe symptoms,\u201d said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com. \u201cWe\u2019re in a tough spot but overall we\u2019re still pretty constructive.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the fact the president is now ill could hurt confidence and slow down some of the improvement in the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe underlying tone is, again, whether its directly or later, there\u2019s going to be stimulus,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201d\u2019Whether it\u2019s this month or November, this reinforces the need for stimulus because the president falling ill signals to, at the margin, the person whose thinking about going out to dinner to think again. It\u2019s a significant economic and psychological hindrance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Also coming up in the week ahead is a speech Tuesday by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to the National Association of Business Economists.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also expected to push for the stimulus package to boost the economy so the recovery does not stall.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think his whole objective is to try to get Congress and the Administration to sign onto a fiscal rescue package,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cHe\u2019ll all but come out and say [the recovery] is not a \u2018V.\u2019 Without additional support from lawmakers, risks are pretty high that we backtrack. I think that\u2019s the kind of outlook he\u2019s going to give. It\u2019s going to be full-throated.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; September\u2019s employment report, released Friday, was seen by some as a warning that the economy is not rebounding as expected. There were 661,000 jobs added in September, well below the 800,000 expected.\n*****\n&gt; Besides Powell, there are a half dozen other Fed speakers. There are also minutes from the Fed\u2019s last minute released Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3J0V6o1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TI8ImmZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/90v084y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne7m07y.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UZt0DJ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HA7KsPc.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NzmRLPp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eqS3Lk4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/k9v1hZX.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UtkozzH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KNI9qkQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/OM44UFj.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Make Up Your !@#$%^&amp;* Mind!\n\n&gt; We've all had versions of this conversation where you or the person you were talking to just couldn't make up their mind. At the end of the day, it only causes trouble and plans are ruined.\n\n&gt; The market is having its own back and forth this year trying to decide between growth and value. Just today, growth stocks are getting slaughtered while value stocks are up marginally. As an example, the Russell 1000 Growth index is down 1.8% on the day while the Russell 1000 Value index has managed to rally 0.25%. The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the Russell 1000 Growth index and the Russell 1000 Value index for each day in 2020. Today's performance spread between the two indices marks the ninth time this year that value has outperformed growth by more than two percentage points. At the other extreme, there have also been eight trading days where growth outperformed value by more than two percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-2020.png))**\n\n&gt; So how does this year's frequency of days where the performance spread between the two indices was more than two percentage points stack up to other years? The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the two indices going all the way back to 1990. Over the last thirty years, the only two periods where we saw a frequency of these large daily dislocations was back in 2008 and the period spanning 2000 and 2001. In fact, with 17 days this year where the performance spread between the two indices was greater than two percentage points, the only other years that saw a higher frequency of large dislocations were 2000 (54) and 2001 (28). If you think the market has been indecisive this year, in 2000 we saw these types of daily dislocations an average of once per week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-All-Years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n&gt; But October has become a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October\u2019s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Have Democratic Sweeps Meant for the S&amp;P 500?\n\n&gt; Headed into the first presidential debate Tuesday night, betting markets (ElectionBettingOdds.com) placed Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the slight favorite to take the White House in November. The debate resulted in Biden gaining another 5 percentage point chance of winning the Presidency. As of this morning, Biden's odds to win are at 59.8% versus Trump's odds of 38.9%. Additionally, Democrats are slight favorites to win control of the Senate (58.4% to 41.5%) and big favorites to maintain the House (82.8% to 17.1%). Given these odds, in the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the three months before Election Day through three months after Election Day for all election years post-WWII that resulted in a sweep of the executive and legislative branch by the Democrats.\n\n&gt; As shown, on average the S&amp;P 500 has been on the decline in the weeks leading up to Election Day, though in the days just before the Election there has been a small rally that sharply reverses once the results come in. After the initial post-Election drop, the market has trended a bit higher, but by three months after the Election, it has only found itself around the same levels as Election Day; on average a 2.6% loss versus where the index stood three months prior.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps3.png))**\n\n&gt; The composite shown above is comprised of six different years: 1948, 1960, 1964, 1976, 1992, and 2008. While on average the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower, it is not necessarily a sure-fire thing. For example, 1948 and 2008 were the only years that saw the S&amp;P 500 trade and stay significantly lower in the wake of the election. In 1976, there was similarly a sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the election, but the index did make its way back up to the highs of that six-month time frame later on albeit no new high was put in place. Meanwhile, 1960, 1964, and 1992 all saw the S&amp;P 500 run higher after the election even despite some periods of consolidation after initial moves higher. In our B.I.G. Tips report from Tuesday, we show these same charts for all Presidential election years post WWII including a look at the average performance given every potential election outcome.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Current Returns Stack Up to History\n\n&gt; Even after September's weakness, the S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month total return stood at an impressive 14.9%. Given the events of the last 12 months, one could even say that performance is remarkable. What's even crazier is that the S&amp;P 500's performance over the last 12 months is more than three times stronger than the 12 month period before that (+4.25%). The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's annualized total returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares that performance to the historical average return of the index over those same time periods.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's historical average 12-month return is 11.7%, so the current 14.9% gain exceeds that average by more than three full percentage points. Over a two-year window, though, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 9.4% is more than a full percentage point below the historical average. Looking further out, the S&amp;P 500's trailing five and ten-year annualized return has been much stronger than average, which makes sense given the long bull market we were in. Over a 20 year window, though, the S&amp;P 500 is only just starting to work off some of the declines from the dot-com bust and as a result, the 6.4% annualized gain is a four and a half percentage points below the long-term average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show how the current performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each of the time frames shown compares to all other periods on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's performance over the last year, ranks just below 56th percentile of all other periods, while the two-year performance ranks just below the 42nd percentile. Even as the five and ten-year periods have seen well above average returns, they still rank in just the mid-60s on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's ranking over a 20-year time period is a completely different story ranking in single-digits on a percentile basis. Even with the equity market right near record highs, the last two decades have been forgettable for US equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns-Ranks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonals Are Back In Style Again\n\n&gt; There is no denying that market seasonality has not worked so well this year. But we have been here before and history is on our side. Over the long term, intermediate term and short term market seasonality has suffered brief periods when seasonality was overridden by more powerful forces. The COVID pandemic and economic shutdown certainly qualifies. But it is only a matter of time until repetitive human behavior patterns and people and institutions return to moving money around in the usual daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and seasonal patterns.\n\n&gt; The return of perennial September weakness is emblematic of a return to normal market behavior and a reflection of the fact that despite the continuing concerns about surges in coronavirus cases life is beginning to return to normal. In our area, about 25-30 miles north of New York City, our kids are beginning hybrid learning, playing rugby, lacrosse and other sports (yes with some COVID protocols, but tackling and facing-off), golf outings are happening and people are going to restaurants and out and about.\n\n&gt; The chart here shows the historical One-Year Pattern of the S&amp;P 500 Since 1950 versus 2020. The black line shows the seasonal pattern since 1950. The blue represents the pattern since 1988. We use 1988 as it is the first year after the 1987 Crash when the market underwent a major systemic change with the implementation of downside protection circuit breakers and collars. It is noteworthy how the seasonal pattern persists during both the 70-year and 31-year timeframes.\n\n&gt; 2020 is plotted on the right axis due to the magnitude of the move this year. The yellow box highlights the rebirth of seasonality this September, especially during this notoriously negative Week After Triple Witching Week as detailed page 108 of the 2020 Almanac, indicated by the two black arrows\n\n&gt; Years like 1980, 1982, 2009 and 2016 with unseasonably early weakness and bear markets like 2020 returned to normal seasonal patterns in short order. And years like 1954, 1958, 1980, 1982, 1995 and 2009 that exhibited double-digit gains in the Worst Six Months still proceeded to deliver further sizable gains in the subsequent Best Six Months (page 52, STA 2020). We believe the return of market seasonality is upon us.

        "selftext": "A recent video on Chargepoint looks at whether it is a good long term investment: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxhOegywUZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxhOegywUZE)\n\nAlot of the sheen of SPACs has been removed lately which IMO is actually a good thing. We now have to pick and choose which companies have a clear path to profitability whereby fundamentals and risk/reward propositions are a important process to DD.\n\nChargePoint was the unicorn every SPAC investor wanted to invest in, but does it fundamentally hold medium term (1-5 years) and long term (10+ years)? IMO, it all depends on two factors:\n\n1) Will the economy be in a recession in 2021-2022 or will the economy bounce back? If there is a recession, the demand for EV's will be stifled and thereby the need for EV infrastructure will also be dramatically reduced. ChargePoint claims that in order to be profitable in a few years, they need to increase their annual growth by 58% in 2022 versus their modest 35% actual growth rates in 2018 and 2019. As the video suggests, there is still alot of questions as to how they can increase their growth dramatically to reach profitability.\n\n2) Like Bitcoin and its influence on other cryptocurrencies, Tesla is in the driver's seat to drive the EV sector. If the growth of Tesla is not what is advertised, I don't see a clear path for ChargePoint and other EV companies to grow within the next few years (medium term), although in 15-20 years I see EV's as almost a for sure thing like the Internet.\n\nLet me know what you guys think and whether you are invested in ChargePoint. Personally I am optimistic in the future and have a small position in SBE for a cost basis of 12.20/share.",

        "selftext": "Alright, I'm sure you have all heard of Trump contracting Covid, if not you've been living under a rock. That being said, there is a lot of talk from Trump's lil' spout about Covid therapeutics - but the real show is when he does, not says. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPKrbzxwj50&amp;ab\\_channel=GlobalNews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPKrbzxwj50&amp;ab_channel=GlobalNews) In this video from GlobalNews, its talks about how Trump is using Remdesivir. I know you're thinking, \"Remdesivir is a Gilead drug\". Well there isn't moving a $60 stock up much further -  but there is a near penny stock chance of possibly a $KODK like return. $BSGM has a drug that is almost into Phase 3 trials: Merimepodib. [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04410354](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04410354) (I know that it says ViralClear but that's a part of BioSig). The dots comin' together? Trump is also willing to take a whole bunch of trial drugs - and here's a penny's chance at something big. This is like the $NVAX move, maybe even better. So hop on the train bois and get ready for one hell of a ride.",

        "selftext": "Daily Synopsis - \n\n* The S&amp;P 500 increased +1.61% today while the NASDaq outperformed by (+3.12%). The Russell 2000 advanced (+0.67%). The Dow ended in positive territory at (+0.89%)\n* The best performing sector was Information Technology(+2.73%) while Materials(-0.17%)was the worst performer.\n* Briefly recapping the latest on stimulus, House Democrats and Senate Republicans rejected the $1.8 trillion offer from the White House for different reasons. Based on the relatively broad-based advance in the market, investors presumably remained in agreement that a deal will eventually be reached, either under the current administration or new leadership in 2021. \n* The financials sector (+1.1%), undeterred by the lack of deal, had a solid outing ahead of earnings reports from several big banks tomorrow morning. Elsewhere, PepsiCo (PEP 142.13, +3.69, +2.7%) was upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup, and Twilio (TWLO 329.72, +23.48, +7.7%) agreed to acquire Segment for approximately $3.2 billion in stock. \n* With the U.S. Treasury market closed for Columbus Day, commentary mainly focused on the bullish price action in equities. Consequently, it\u2019s reasonable to believe that a fear of missing out on further gains was another factor that fueled the positive momentum in the market. The S&amp;P 500 closed within 1.5% of its all-time high. \n* Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. Looking ahead, the Consumer Price Index for September, the Treasury Budget for September, and the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September are scheduled for Tuesday. Note, the September Treasury Budget is often delayed to allow more time for fiscal year end reconciliation.\n\nIndex Summary - \n\n**S&amp;P 500 :** (+1.61%);  **NasDaq :** (+3.12%);  \n**Russell 2000 :**(+0.67%);  **Dow :**(+0.89%);  \n**Vix :**25 (+0.28%); \\[-10.34%\\]; {-4.57%}\n\nSector Summary - \n\n*Three highest sectors for today were \u2013*  \n**Information Technology:** (+2.73%); **Communication Services:** (+2.64%); **Consumer Discretionary:** (+1.33%)  \n*Three lowest sectors for today were \u2013*  \n**Materials:** (-0.17%); **Energy:** (+0.26%); **Real Estate:** (+0.51%)\n\nCommodities/Futures - \n\n(1-day %), \\[5-day %\\], {10-day %}\n\n***Currency \u2013***  \n**USD Index :**93.065 (+0.01%); \\[-0.64%\\]; {-0.73%}  \n**BC :**11110 (+4.91%); \\[+8.72%\\]; {+9.49%}\n\n***Precious Metals \u2013***  \n**Gold :**1926.2 (+0.07%); \\[+2.34%\\]; {+1.01%}  \n**Silver :**25.108 (+0.49%); \\[+5.79%\\]; {+4.3%}\n\n***Farming \u2013***  \n**Soybeans :**1065.5 (-2.96%); \\[-1.62%\\]; {+1.03%}  \n**Corn :**395 (-1.58%); \\[0.0%\\]; {+1.57%}  \n**Coffee :**111.55 (-1.88%); \\[-0.14%\\]; {+2.24%}\n\n***Industrials \u2013***  \n**Crude :**40.6 (-2.73%); \\[-1.15%\\]; {+1.99%}  \n**Nat Gas :**2.741 (+3.21%); \\[+8.56%\\]; {+11.95%}  \n**Copper :**3.0825 (-0.6%); \\[+0.97%\\]; {+7.0%}\n\nDark Pool Summary - \n\n1.

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading October 15th\n   \nBANKS BEAT BUT FALTER\n \n\n Added some QQQ putskis today.\n\n \nToday\u2019s market was interesting\u2026not good or bad, just interesting.  It always concerns me when the earnings news is good and the market falls.  UNH, BAC, and GS all reported, and the numbers were good, and all fell well off the highs, with UNH the only one to close up, and only pennies at that.  After the hotter than expected PPI numbers came out, the open was slightly higher, but it didn\u2019t last long.  After the DJIA hit the high for the day +120, it turned down and by 11:00 it was down for the day.  The DJIA finished -165.81 (.58%), NASDAQ -95.17 (.80%), S&amp;P 500 -23.26 (.66%), the Russell -15.20 (.93%) and the DJ Transports the big winner at +105.67 (.90%).  Internals were soft at 1.5:1 on NYSE and 1.9:1 on the NAZ.  The DJIA was 10 up, 20 down, with UNH the biggest decliner paring 64 DP\u2019s off the average.  Tomorrow we have UAL, WBA, MS, and TSM reporting as well as the continuing and initial claims, Phili Fed, Empire State and Export / Import numbers for Sept.  Lots of stuff to digest.\n\n\nTonight\u2019s closing comment video: https://youtu.be/Z-R_NRe9TLM\n \nSee our Honest  Abe trade records for the year in our video/ discord etc...\n\nSECTORS:  There was good news for the banks, again, but by midday it just didn\u2019t matter.  Today\u2019s losers were BAC, GS, and the biggest loser, UNH which was trading +2.50 premarket and never even made it to unchanged, finishing -9.57, which cost the DJIA 64DP\u2019s.  There was some good news for holders of Concho Resources.  The talk is that they are a takeover candidate and after hitting $51.00 it closed on the lows, but still +4.79 (10.8%) on the day.  FSLY holders weren\u2019t quite so lucky.  The stock which traded $10.63 in March has been a juggernaut, hitting $136.50 yesterday, reported after the close that their prior expectations of revenue \u201cshould not be relied upon.\u201d  It seems that geopolitical concerns had hampered their operation.  The customer is the parent company of TIK TOK!  While the numbers given (they report on 10/28) aren\u2019t terrible, when your stock has risen the way this one has, it\u2019s a problem. The last on it in late trading was $91.28 -37.55 (30%) after a low of $86.40.   Even at this lower price, the stock is still up from the start of the year by 400%.\nAnother favorite, DraftKings (DKNG) has not acted well since doing their offering last week priced about $4.00 under the market @ $52.00 and has not been able to climb back over that level.  The stock closed $48.04 -3.14 today (6.14%).  The continuing Covid-19 issues for major sports teams and cancelled and postponed may be weighing on the stock in the short term.  \nAfter the close VRTX reported the end of their trial on a protein-deficiency treatment.  The stock fell from its close of $371.46 -4.63 to trade $235.01 and closed $239 -37.09 (13.43%).\n \nNew Group:\nAIR &amp; CRUISE LINES were HIGHER with +.64, HA +.03, ALK +.53, and XTN $61.57 +.52 (.85%).\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN +.26, BGS -.24, FLO -.11, CPB -.15, CAG -.38, MDLZ -.38, CALM -.15, JJSF -.43, SAFM +.03, HRL -.41, SJM -1.12, PPC +.89, KR -1.10, and PBJ $34.56 -.28 (.78%).\n \nBIOPHARMA was LOWER with BIIB -3.46, ABBV -.40, REGN -3.02, ISRG -4.27, GILD +.01, MYL -.28, TEVA -.08, VRTX -37.10, BHC -.04, INCY -3.36, ICPT -.80, LABU -4.26, and IBB $141.60 -2.74 (1.9%).\nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.03, CGC -.42, CRON -.10, GWPH +.68, ACB -.23, CURLF -.18, KERN -.17, and MJ $11.49 -.13 (1.12%).\n\nDEFENSE was HIGHER with LMT +3.52, GD -.35, TXT unchanged, NOC +2.29, BWXT +.88, TDY +2.94, RTX +.47, and ITA $163.58 +.90 (.55%).\n\nRETAIL: was MIXED with M -.02, JWN -.13, KSS +.04, DDS +.32, WMT -2.23, TGT -2.04, TJX +.03, RL +.72, UAA -.29, LULU -4.34, TPR +.08, CPRI +.01, and a new addition GPS +.27, and XRT $54.07 -.45 (.83%).\n \nMEGA-CAPS &amp; FAANG were HIGHER with GOOGL -4.56, AMZN -91.63, AAPL -.29, FB -4.74, NFLX -15.09, NVDA -7.93, TSLA +13.70, BABA +9.33, BIDU +8.65, CMG -3.84, CRM -6.85, BA +1.36, CAT +1.49, DIS -2.36, and XLK $122.02 -.65 (.53%).\nPLEASE BE AWARE THAT THESE PRICES ARE LATE MARKET QUOTES AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE 4:00 CLOSES.\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS +.42, JPM -.44, BAC -1.20, MS +.64, C -.64, PNC -2.61, AIG -.07, TRV -.86, V -1.82, and XLF $24.78 -.24 (.96%).\n \n \nOIL, $41.04 +.84, Oil was near recent highs and sold off hard Friday touching $37.61 (down about 6%) before mounting a rally back to close today just over $41, near recent highs. The stocks were MIXED with XLE $30.52 +.13 (.43%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,907.30 +12.70, opened HIGHER and made a slightly higher high and a higher low, closing near the highs of the day.  There were several \u201cunusual options action\u201d looking for another 10-12% on the upside before year end.  \n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $11410 -30. After breaking out over $10,000 we have had a \u201crunning correction\u201d pushing prices toward $12,000, reaching a recovery high of $12220 Thursday, and after a day of rest in between, we resumed the rally touching $12,635, but have sold off back to support. We had 750 shares of GBTC and sold off 250 last week at $13.93 and still have 500 with a cost of $8.45. GBTC closed $12.20 -.18 today.\n \n Tomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 5th, 2020.\n\n# **Trump\u2019s health and fiscal stimulus fight will steer the markets in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/trumps-health-and-the-fiscal-s.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump\u2019s health and the state of a fiscal stimulus package will be the main focus for markets in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; In the early morning hours Friday, President Donald Trump tweeted that he and the first lady tested positive for Covid. Stocks sold off hard, but the S&amp;P 500 came off its lows in Friday trading and closed down just under 1%. It was up 1.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; The market was helped by signs that a stimulus package is still a possibility, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked airlines not to furlough workers. She promised either a stand alone aid bill, or a bigger negotiated relief legislation that would help the industry.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to watch health updates from the White House medical staff, and it\u2019s going to watch how the president communicates with the public,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives at BTIG. \u201cWill we see him in person in the next week in any form? What\u2019s his volume of tweets? All as a way to first gauge the severity of the case.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Trump and Melania Trump are reported to have mild cases, but as time goes on the market will turn to how the illness could impact the presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; Former Vice President Joe Biden gained slightly in the polls after the first debate Tuesday night, and now the calendar for further debates is in question. The market has seemingly warmed to Biden, and even though he would raise taxes, it is assumed Democrats would quickly pass a major infrastructure package if there is a Democratic sweep of Congress.\n*****\n&gt; Trump, however, is widely seen on Wall Street as stronger on the economy and better for markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done from a campaign perspective, is you\u2019ve taken away the thing that gives him the most energy - his ability to interact with crowds,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe president had wanted to paint the economic recovery of the last three or four months as the cornerstone, and this basically puts the virus back as topic number 1, number 2 and number 3. And it\u2019s all the more so because the data is coming in weaker than expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The market is fixated on the prospect of stimulus to help business, the unemployed and state and local governments. The House passed a $2.2 trillion package this week, but there is still no agreement with Republicans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pushed for a $1.6 trillion package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s an underlying bid under the market because nobody wants to be super short if we get a stimulus approved, but you can\u2019t be too long in case his mild symptoms turn into severe symptoms,\u201d said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com. \u201cWe\u2019re in a tough spot but overall we\u2019re still pretty constructive.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the fact the president is now ill could hurt confidence and slow down some of the improvement in the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe underlying tone is, again, whether its directly or later, there\u2019s going to be stimulus,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201d\u2019Whether it\u2019s this month or November, this reinforces the need for stimulus because the president falling ill signals to, at the margin, the person whose thinking about going out to dinner to think again. It\u2019s a significant economic and psychological hindrance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Also coming up in the week ahead is a speech Tuesday by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to the National Association of Business Economists.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also expected to push for the stimulus package to boost the economy so the recovery does not stall.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think his whole objective is to try to get Congress and the Administration to sign onto a fiscal rescue package,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cHe\u2019ll all but come out and say [the recovery] is not a \u2018V.\u2019 Without additional support from lawmakers, risks are pretty high that we backtrack. I think that\u2019s the kind of outlook he\u2019s going to give. It\u2019s going to be full-throated.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; September\u2019s employment report, released Friday, was seen by some as a warning that the economy is not rebounding as expected. There were 661,000 jobs added in September, well below the 800,000 expected.\n*****\n&gt; Besides Powell, there are a half dozen other Fed speakers. There are also minutes from the Fed\u2019s last minute released Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3J0V6o1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TI8ImmZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/90v084y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne7m07y.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UZt0DJ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HA7KsPc.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NzmRLPp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eqS3Lk4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/k9v1hZX.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UtkozzH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KNI9qkQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/OM44UFj.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Make Up Your !@#$%^&amp;* Mind!\n\n&gt; We've all had versions of this conversation where you or the person you were talking to just couldn't make up their mind. At the end of the day, it only causes trouble and plans are ruined.\n\n&gt; The market is having its own back and forth this year trying to decide between growth and value. Just today, growth stocks are getting slaughtered while value stocks are up marginally. As an example, the Russell 1000 Growth index is down 1.8% on the day while the Russell 1000 Value index has managed to rally 0.25%. The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the Russell 1000 Growth index and the Russell 1000 Value index for each day in 2020. Today's performance spread between the two indices marks the ninth time this year that value has outperformed growth by more than two percentage points. At the other extreme, there have also been eight trading days where growth outperformed value by more than two percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-2020.png))**\n\n&gt; So how does this year's frequency of days where the performance spread between the two indices was more than two percentage points stack up to other years? The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the two indices going all the way back to 1990. Over the last thirty years, the only two periods where we saw a frequency of these large daily dislocations was back in 2008 and the period spanning 2000 and 2001. In fact, with 17 days this year where the performance spread between the two indices was greater than two percentage points, the only other years that saw a higher frequency of large dislocations were 2000 (54) and 2001 (28). If you think the market has been indecisive this year, in 2000 we saw these types of daily dislocations an average of once per week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-All-Years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n&gt; But October has become a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October\u2019s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Have Democratic Sweeps Meant for the S&amp;P 500?\n\n&gt; Headed into the first presidential debate Tuesday night, betting markets (ElectionBettingOdds.com) placed Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the slight favorite to take the White House in November. The debate resulted in Biden gaining another 5 percentage point chance of winning the Presidency. As of this morning, Biden's odds to win are at 59.8% versus Trump's odds of 38.9%. Additionally, Democrats are slight favorites to win control of the Senate (58.4% to 41.5%) and big favorites to maintain the House (82.8% to 17.1%). Given these odds, in the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the three months before Election Day through three months after Election Day for all election years post-WWII that resulted in a sweep of the executive and legislative branch by the Democrats.\n\n&gt; As shown, on average the S&amp;P 500 has been on the decline in the weeks leading up to Election Day, though in the days just before the Election there has been a small rally that sharply reverses once the results come in. After the initial post-Election drop, the market has trended a bit higher, but by three months after the Election, it has only found itself around the same levels as Election Day; on average a 2.6% loss versus where the index stood three months prior.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps3.png))**\n\n&gt; The composite shown above is comprised of six different years: 1948, 1960, 1964, 1976, 1992, and 2008. While on average the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower, it is not necessarily a sure-fire thing. For example, 1948 and 2008 were the only years that saw the S&amp;P 500 trade and stay significantly lower in the wake of the election. In 1976, there was similarly a sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the election, but the index did make its way back up to the highs of that six-month time frame later on albeit no new high was put in place. Meanwhile, 1960, 1964, and 1992 all saw the S&amp;P 500 run higher after the election even despite some periods of consolidation after initial moves higher. In our B.I.G. Tips report from Tuesday, we show these same charts for all Presidential election years post WWII including a look at the average performance given every potential election outcome.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Current Returns Stack Up to History\n\n&gt; Even after September's weakness, the S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month total return stood at an impressive 14.9%. Given the events of the last 12 months, one could even say that performance is remarkable. What's even crazier is that the S&amp;P 500's performance over the last 12 months is more than three times stronger than the 12 month period before that (+4.25%). The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's annualized total returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares that performance to the historical average return of the index over those same time periods.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's historical average 12-month return is 11.7%, so the current 14.9% gain exceeds that average by more than three full percentage points. Over a two-year window, though, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 9.4% is more than a full percentage point below the historical average. Looking further out, the S&amp;P 500's trailing five and ten-year annualized return has been much stronger than average, which makes sense given the long bull market we were in. Over a 20 year window, though, the S&amp;P 500 is only just starting to work off some of the declines from the dot-com bust and as a result, the 6.4% annualized gain is a four and a half percentage points below the long-term average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show how the current performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each of the time frames shown compares to all other periods on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's performance over the last year, ranks just below 56th percentile of all other periods, while the two-year performance ranks just below the 42nd percentile. Even as the five and ten-year periods have seen well above average returns, they still rank in just the mid-60s on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's ranking over a 20-year time period is a completely different story ranking in single-digits on a percentile basis. Even with the equity market right near record highs, the last two decades have been forgettable for US equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns-Ranks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonals Are Back In Style Again\n\n&gt; There is no denying that market seasonality has not worked so well this year. But we have been here before and history is on our side. Over the long term, intermediate term and short term market seasonality has suffered brief periods when seasonality was overridden by more powerful forces. The COVID pandemic and economic shutdown certainly qualifies. But it is only a matter of time until repetitive human behavior patterns and people and institutions return to moving money around in the usual daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and seasonal patterns.\n\n&gt; The return of perennial September weakness is emblematic of a return to normal market behavior and a reflection of the fact that despite the continuing concerns about surges in coronavirus cases life is beginning to return to normal. In our area, about 25-30 miles north of New York City, our kids are beginning hybrid learning, playing rugby, lacrosse and other sports (yes with some COVID protocols, but tackling and facing-off), golf outings are happening and people are going to restaurants and out and about.\n\n&gt; The chart here shows the historical One-Year Pattern of the S&amp;P 500 Since 1950 versus 2020. The black line shows the seasonal pattern since 1950. The blue represents the pattern since 1988. We use 1988 as it is the first year after the 1987 Crash when the market underwent a major systemic change with the implementation of downside protection circuit breakers and collars. It is noteworthy how the seasonal pattern persists during both the 70-year and 31-year timeframes.\n\n&gt; 2020 is plotted on the right axis due to the magnitude of the move this year. The yellow box highlights the rebirth of seasonality this September, especially during this notoriously negative Week After Triple Witching Week as detailed page 108 of the 2020 Almanac, indicated by the two black arrows\n\n&gt; Years like 1980, 1982, 2009 and 2016 with unseasonably early weakness and bear markets like 2020 returned to normal seasonal patterns in short order. And years like 1954, 1958, 1980, 1982, 1995 and 2009 that exhibited double-digit gains in the Worst Six Months still proceeded to deliver further sizable gains in the subsequent Best Six Months (page 52, STA 2020). We believe the return of market seasonality is upon us. So remain cautious through the end of September and be alert to Octoberophobia, but remain ready to pounce on our Best Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal, when it triggers.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0a4a6ba18e7d903b198c8fa7d6cf8bc4/9c2d30c4da9ff340-d7/s500x750/eb0c36b5ff7eec394f463ca8420054c22a88010f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 2nd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$RGP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/E7qqUjk.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zy3ktow.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pt0NiLh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yaviiRp.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Vdaqsaj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ipdesH4.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Domino's Pizza, Inc. $433.78\n**Domino's Pizza, Inc.

        "selftext": "**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**\n\nFirst off, let's set the scene.\n\nThe stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.\n\nEconomic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.\n\nThe correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&amp;P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, it is the Central\u00a0Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.\n\nIn doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion in US history.\n\nHowever, this is not a particularly\u00a0meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.\n\nFormer Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:\n\n*\u201cThe central issue is we\u2019re developing into a plutocracy. We\u2019ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they\u2019re rich because they\u2019re smart and constructive.\"*\n\nThe reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.\n\nNow, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.\n\n*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.\n\nWe are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.\n\nIn fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nInflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.\n\nDeflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.\n\nThat's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.\n\nWell, no.\n\nIf you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.\n\nAs the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt.\u00a0\n\nThis is why central banks fear deflation so much.\n\nHowever, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...\n\n**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**\n\nThe increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.\n\n[Throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. This is *not* a new phenomenon.\n\nAll technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create \"supply side shocks\", meaning that they allow for more intensive\u00a0use of resources\u00a0and thus higher production. With more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall.\u00a0\n\nIn the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.\n\nIt is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: AI\n\nAccording to Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder and CEO of The Blackstone Group who has a net worth of $17.6BN:\n\n*\"This is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology\"*\n\nMoreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [Zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idUKKBN21K1C7) of exactly this.\n\nOld legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it.\u00a0\n\nAs an example, if you folded a piece of paper 51 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 51 times, it would reach the Sun!\n\n**PART 3/4 - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY:**\n\nThe question is: how does this play out?\n\nIn the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, not\u00a0who is President for 4 to 8 years.\n\nIn reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. We have seen [what happens when a President doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91RZko5Gw)...\n\nOne could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:\n\n1. Divide and Conquer and\n2. [Order from Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx7PnMtCeY)\n\nAs we have seen many times in the past, herd psychology is [worryingly easy to manipulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M26-B44qQIs)...\n\nSpeaking of the censorship, in his book Antifragile, Nassim Taleb discusses the anti fragility of information.\u00a0\n\nInformation feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.\n\nA fantastic example of this process is what has happened with London Real: they were banned on LinkedIn and David Icke's interview was censored. Now, regardless of what you think of this particular channel or your thoughts on David Icke and the theories provided, censoring information in this way *actually spreads it more virally*.\n\nIt's fascinating to observe how many views the videos regarding the bans and censorship have relative to the others. And the [impact this has had on subscribers](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/londonrealtv).\n\nIt is always easier to blame a bigger enemy (or create a new one) rather than to admit it's a structural problem.\n\nTherefore, you avoid short term pain...whatever the cost.\n\nThe real question is [if and when this situation will lead to social unrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4GMUamUjT8)...\n\n**PART 4/4 - INTELLECTUAL CAPITALISM:**\n\nThe depth and width of jobs impacted by AI will continue to increase in the future.\n\nNow this will not necessarily happen straight away.\n\nHowever, our transition from commodity capitalism to intellectual capitalism is inevitable and the people and nations who fight against this trend will be on the wrong side of history.\n\nFrom a practical investment perspective, and disclaimer this is not investment advice, network effects are a crucial aspect to consider moving forwards.\n\nEssentially, this means that the value of the network\u00a0increases with each additional user - all of the tech monopolies have exhibited this property.\n\nAn asset which could in time demonstrate very strong network effects is Bitcoin.\n\n[Looking at the market cap relative to other asset classes](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/), Bitcoin provides an asymmetric investment opportunity.\n\nOnly time will tell...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE)",

That being said, there is a lot of talk from Trump's lil' spout about Covid therapeutics - but the real show is when he does, not says.

I know you're thinking, \"Remdesivir is a Gilead drug\". Well there isn't moving a $60 stock up much further -  but there is a near penny stock chance of possibly a $KODK like return. $BSGM has a drug that is almost into Phase 3 trials: Merimepodib.

Trump is also willing to take a whole bunch of trial drugs - and here's a penny's chance at something big. This is like the $NVAX move, maybe even better.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 19th, 2020.\n\n# **More volatility is likely ahead as rising cases, lack of stimulus overshadow strong earnings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/more-volatility-is-likely-ahead-as-rising-cases-lack-of-stimulus-overshadow-strong-earnings.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Another volatile week may be in store for traders as coronavirus cases rise in the U.S. and Europe while Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over new fiscal aid.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 fell for three straight days this week. That slide was the longest losing streak for the averages since mid-September. The two market benchmarks eked out slight gains on Friday to snap their losing streak.\n*****\n&gt; Investors and traders expect this choppy trading action to continue, especially as the worsening coronavirus data and a lack of U.S. coronavirus stimulus draw attention away from a strong earnings season thus far.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe combination of no stimulus, fading economic momentum, and the threat of rising coronavirus cases, creates a rather negative dynamic for risk assets right now,\u201d said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; The seven-day average of new daily coronavirus infections has risen in 39 states, including New York, New Jersey and Wisconsin, according to a CNBC analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University and the U.S. Census Bureau. At the nationwide level, the rate of new daily cases is at its highest level since August.\n*****\n&gt; In Europe, the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases has surpassed that of the U.S., leading several countries in the region to reinstate tougher social distancing rules and roll back previous reopening measures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat this means is economic activity may slow down a bit, and we\u2019ve already started to see some of that in the data,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, noting the weekly jobless claims numbers released Thursday show they\u2019ve reached a point where \u201cthey\u2019re not going to get better; they\u2019re going to get worse.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Labor Department said initial U.S. jobless claims hit their highest level since August, reaching 898,000 in the week ending Oct. 10.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also keep their eyes on Washington during the week ahead as lawmakers continue to struggle over new U.S. fiscal stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; # Political posturing on stimulus \u2018hurting\u2019 those in need\n&gt; This week, President Donald Trump said he would raise his offer for a coronavirus aid above the current level of $1.8 trillion. The White House\u2019s current offer is smaller than a $2.2 trillion package passed by the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said the administration\u2019s proposal \u201cfalls significantly short\u201d of what is needed.\n*****\n&gt; This back and forth between the two parties has dwindled expectations among market participants of a compromise being reached before the Nov. 3 election. It has also added to the concerns surrounding the U.S. economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis political posturing is hurting that cohort of the economy that needs help the most,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cTo the small and mid-size business owner, the airlines, this is not just about politics; this is every day life. There going to be an impact in the real economy if we don\u2019t see something now.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings season ignored?\n&gt; Those talks over further stimulus are also expected to divert attention away from the corporate earnings season, which began this week but had next to no impact on the broader market.\n*****\n&gt; Procter &amp; Gamble, Netflix, Travelers, American Airlines and American Express are among the companies slated to report next week.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and VF Corp. are among the 49 S&amp;P 500 companies that posted their latest quarterly results this week. Of those 49 companies, 86% reported better-than-expected earnings, according to data from The Earnings Scout.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI wish I could say that next week we\u2019re going to put aside the politics and the Covid concerns behind us, but we won\u2019t trade this earnings season,\u201d said Hogan of National Securities. \u201cWhile it will likely be a record-breaking season for companies beating estimates, it\u2019s also going to be one that is largely ignored because there\u2019re so many other macro factors that are more important.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There is also some important housing data in the week ahead, including home builders\u2019 sentiment Monday, housing starts Tuesday, and existing home sales Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe housing market is still off to the races,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe mortgage applications were strong, suggesting very strong activity in the month of September.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said the market will eventually cool when interest rates begin to rise. But for now, \u201ccertainly the economy could use the juice.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6i8E0Lr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zGJke6U.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/jkd6p4Z.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/sQiEyVc.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zksl2rH.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eBTMjg7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xUN9dhd.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Tu2aS7U.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ffP3FJL.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nGdIfrv.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/TrguDpO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4CSvumn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GN3ZIki.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts We Are Watching\n\n&gt; There are many charts that caught our attention this week, and today we share the top 5 charts we\u2019re watching.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index recently had a four-week losing streak and fell nearly 10% along the way, while the Nasdaq and many large cap tech stocks fell even more. Then in a big move higher over the past two weeks, many stocks moved from oversold to overbought in a very quick timeframe.\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, more than 90% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 were beneath their 10-day moving average on September 24 and within two weeks saw more than 90% above this short-term trend line. This type of buying thrust is consistent with future strong returns, suggests quick reversals from oversold to overbought are a good thing, and could bode well for stocks to outperform bonds well into 2021.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Parts of the economy are opening back up, while employment continues to disappoint. One specific area that continues to improve is how many people are flying, as the seven-day average number of travelers going through Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints hit a new recovery high. We discuss other high-frequency data points in our COVID Surge Stalling Europe\u2019s Recovery blog.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve noted before that stock market gains ahead of the election historically support the incumbent party, while if stocks are lower it tends to support new leadership in the White House. Taking this further, the US dollar also tends to send signals for who might win. In fact, when stocks are up and the US dollar is lower ahead of the election, or if stocks are lower and the US dollar is higher before an election, the results have accurately predicted the last seven times those scenarios took place. Given stocks are up and the US dollar is slightly lower, this could be one clue the upcoming election will be much closer than many are expecting.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Sticking with the election, many investors are worried about higher taxes and more deregulation if former Vice President Joe Biden wins. \u201cHigher taxes may be one part of it, but Biden is also looking at huge spending initiatives,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cStock markets like spending, and this could more than help offset potentially higher taxes.\u201d Lower tariffs could potentially provide another offset as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, Friday\u2019s retail sales report came in better than expected, marking five consecutive months of year-over-year gains. It is worth noting the economy has never been in a recession after 4 or more consecutive monthly gains. Still, in the face of one of the most severe recessions ever, it took only a few months for sales to get back to new highs, as shown below. Historically, new highs in retail sales happen in expansions\u2014and this is yet another clue the recession is likely over.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Record Surge In Business Formations As Economy Recovers From COVID\n\n&gt; Yesterday the Census updated business formation stats for Q3, and as indicated by high-frequency data from the Atlanta Fed, business formation exploded in Q3. As shown in the first chart below, total business applications rocketed upwards by 1.57 million, a record increase. Stripping out businesses that are unlikely to result in hiring, the numbers are much smaller in absolute terms but still rose 79% to a record pace. Finally, applications for businesses with planned wages surged 70% from a record low in Q2, to the highest levels since 2008.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101520-Biz-Apps.png))**\n\n&gt; In all three instances, the recent behavior is a complete reversal of the post-Financial Crisis period, when the prolonged recession led to a huge decline in business starts. That\u2019s a good sign for the breadth of the economic rebound, as business formation tends to lead to higher productivity thanks to more innovation and investment. Below we show changes in total business applications by state; Michigan, Illinois, and Georgia are the biggest winners, with applications more than doubling. This analysis was originally published in our evening report -- The Closer -- on 10/14/20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101520-Biz-Apps-State.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Rebound\n\n&gt; After a disappointment last month, Retail Sales saw a nice rebound in September as consumers seem undeterred from spending despite the expiration of extended UI benefits and the lack of an additional stimulus bill. For the month of September, headline Retail Sales rose 1.9% m/m versus expectations for a more modest increase of 0.8%. Ex Autos and Gas, growth was even better relative to expectations, although August\u2019s already slower than expected growth was revised modestly lower.\n\n&gt; Breadth in this month\u2019s report was strong. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but one of them (Electronics and Appliances) showed growth. Normally, when a sector shows m/m growth of a percent or two, it\u2019s impressive. This month, though, the volatility of the pandemic remains in place as two sectors showed growth of over 5%, including Clothing which saw double-digit growth relative to August!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/sectors1016.png))**\n\n&gt; While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # University of Michigan Mixed Again\n\n&gt; The University of Michigan reported preliminary consumer sentiment numbers for October. University of Michigan data has shown a much smaller bounce than other sentiment surveys, but the preliminary numbers for October did increase versus September. The strongest part of the survey was expectations, which has risen three months in a row to the highest levels since March. Consumers' current assessment of the economy fell sequentially and is sitting at about the same place it was back in early 2012.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101620-Michigan.png))**\n\n&gt; One feature of the University of Michigan poll with incomplete data prior to 2016 but more complete data since is a breakout of economic sentiment by political party affiliation. As shown below, their data shows Republicans getting a massive sentiment boost in the wake of the 2016 election. The key here though, is that the boost to the sentiment of Republicans and the decline for Democrats came after the election as this data is definitely lagging to political outcomes rather than leading.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101620-Michigan-Part.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Smiles\n\n&gt; Sentiment among small businesses continued to improve in the month of September according to the NFIB's monthly Small Business Optimism Index. As shown below, the index rose 3.8 points to 104 which is now just half of a point below the levels prior to the pandemic in February. That was also better than expectations of a smaller improvement to 101.2. Small business sentiment has now risen in four of the past five months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; In the table below, we break down this month's report by each of the ten components of the headline number as well as the many other indices included in the report such as those not used as inputs to the headline number and what small businesses are reporting to be their biggest problems.\n\n&gt; Across all indices of the September report, breadth was solid with only a couple of indices falling month over month\u2014Expected Credit Conditions and Credit Conditions Availability. Some of those that were higher saw record or near-record month-over-month increases.\n\n&gt; Some of the most notable indices this month included those regarding inventories. The Current Inventories index which gauges the net percent of owners viewing current inventory levels as too low rose 2 points to a record high reading of 5. Given this, the index for Plans to Increase Inventories is tied with the reading from November of 2004 for a record high of 11. Indicating low inventory levels, the report is consistent with some other recent data like the regional Fed manufacturing surveys. Those low inventories are resulting in higher prices as that index's 12-point increase in September marked the biggest one month gain on record. While the Higher Prices index is not at any sort of an extreme, September's move indicates that a rising number of businesses are raising prices.\n\n&gt; Additionally, those higher prices and lower inventory numbers appear to be a result of demand that continues to rapidly improve. The indices for Actual Sales and Actual Earnings Changes remain negative for a sixth and tenth month in a row, respectively, meaning a net number of businesses continue to see lower rather than higher top and bottom-line numbers. But these indices are seeing big moves higher. For the index of Actual Earnings Changes, the 13-point climb in September was the largest on record and the 9-point increase for Actual Sales Changes followed a 13-point increase in August; both being some of the largest one-month moves on record. In order to meet the needs of this demand, a higher number of businesses plan to increase employment with that index rising to 28; the highest level since December of 2018. Even though businesses seek to hire more, they also report it is hard to fill positions as the index of Job Openings Hard to Fill rose to the top 5% of all readings. Cost and quality of labor also were reported as two of the most pressing problems for businesses.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Table2.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Businesses Cautiously Optimistic\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we highlighted the details of the September NFIB Small Business Optimism report. The report showed overall sentiment among small businesses has continued to improve as demand has bounced back (though it has not yet fully recovered as still more businesses report lower sales and earnings on a net basis) leading to low inventory levels, higher prices, and a need for more employment. While generally improved conditions have lifted optimism, that is not to say small businesses have given an all-clear. The Uncertainty Index from NFIB has risen each of the past three months with September's 2-point increase bringing it back to the same level as March of this year. In other words, it is perhaps best to say that small businesses are cautiously optimistic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Uncertainty.png))**\n\n&gt; From the pandemic to the Election, there are plenty of reasons for businesses to be uncertain. As for what they are reporting to be the biggest problems, labor remains at the top. 30% of businesses have reported that either cost (9%) or more predominately quality (21%) of labor are their biggest issues. While off the highs from the past few years, the current readings are still historically elevated.\n\n&gt; Behind labor, government related problems also are largely on the minds of business owners. Government red tape and taxes combine to account for 29% of businesses' biggest problems. While that is a large share, neither of those indices are at any sort of extreme.\n\n&gt; Poor sales, on the other hand, remains as the third major concern for businesses. 12% of businesses reported poor sales as the single most important issue in September, down from 15% in August and 7-percentage points lower than the April peak. While improved, the number of businesses seeing demand as a major issue is still at some of the highest levels of the past several years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Most-Import-Problems.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment By State\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the year-to-date reading for the high-frequency Morning Consult daily consumer sentiment indicator. While still well off highs seen prior to the COVID Crash in late February and early March, sentiment has generally been ticking higher off the lows. You'll notice in the chart below, however, that while the \"Future Expectations\" reading is still bouncing back nicely, the \"Current Conditions\" reading has been going more sideways over the last couple of months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101420-MC.png))**\n\n&gt; We can also look closer into state level readings from the daily Morning Consult sentiment numbers. In the heat map below, we show the changes in the levels of consumer sentiment for each state since mid-February. As shown, the lower 48 have seen much larger improvements than Alaska or Hawaii with the largest improvements coming in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. On the other hand, in addition to Hawaii and Alaska, some of the key swing states like Maine, New Hampshire, and Nevada have improved the least. Of all 50 states, Vermont's current reading on sentiment is the closest to its February levels, but even Vermont is still down 17.9 points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101420-MC-By-State.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 16th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.18.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOJ8b0hke_s))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$PM** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$LOGI** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$TMO** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$LGND** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$CDNS** \n&gt; * **$TSCO** \n&gt; * **$DGX** \n&gt; * **$LII** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$PHG** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$ACI** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$TXN** \n&gt; * **$SYF** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$GPK** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$SFNC** \n&gt; * **$FCX** \n&gt; * **$MAN** \n&gt; * **$IRBT** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$LLNW**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ffP3FJL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/nGdIfrv.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.19.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9fUPN3h.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xQoRNmb.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sWeYEHF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne3gwPi.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.21.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bNGBGWs.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uPFnifS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lk20RGG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I007KF1.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I0WSfDw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.23.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Tesla, Inc. $439.67\n**Tesla, Inc.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there\u2019s a will to get something done.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n&gt; But he said even if there\u2019s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cI actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,\u201d said Keon.\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&amp;P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cQ2 reporting season saw S&amp;P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n&gt; The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&amp;P 500  down about 10%. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,\u201d they noted.\n*****\n&gt; The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there\u2019s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think from the market\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are many moving parts here, and they\u2019re all moving in different directions,\u201d said Block. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. \u201cI think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that\u2019s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n&gt; In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n&gt; Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n&gt; Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&amp;P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n&gt; As shown, the average stock in the broad S&amp;P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n&gt; The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n&gt; If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&amp;P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are 46 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n&gt; General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # News High for Net New Highs\n\n&gt; Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&amp;P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n&gt; As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&amp;P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Breadth Booming\n\n&gt; One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&amp;P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n&gt; While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n&gt; With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&amp;P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n&gt; October\u2019s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n&gt; With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9deab1b6431375946cf0104830334e3a/1b58acd0d015098f-cf/s500x750/1a07b8cea97519bcce57adae974614a0e426effb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 9th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw7sXu8pcPw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IIowf1B.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2lSi1kT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Wj80iaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZY9TwgO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5LizPLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oIstn4O.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKfmmCC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q3isONG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Swqo1ow.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",
