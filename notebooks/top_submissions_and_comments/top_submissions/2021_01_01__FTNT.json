        "selftext": "#1) Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ)\n\nThe Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.\n\nThe top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds.

        "selftext": "Ticker; NGAC $10.32\n\nWarrants: NGACW $1.76 (Warrants opened at $4, ranged for a month between $1.72-$1.30 )\n\n**NextGen Acquisition Corporation** (NGACU) is a special purpose acquisition company or SPAC created for the purpose of effecting a merger, asset acquisition, or similar business combination with one or more operating businesses. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry, we are focused on growth companies in the industrial and healthcare sector that are benefiting from secular trends, strong competitive positions, and talented management teams.\n\nNextGen Acquisition Corporation successfully completed its Initial Public Offering on October 7th, 2020, and Over-Allotment on November 17th, 2020, raising a total of $375 million.\n\nPrivate placement warrants at $1.50\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some DD:**\n\nFounder 1/2: Director of DAL ($40) SPCE ($30) AF ($6) \n\n* FORMER PARTNER &amp; CO-HEAD OF GOLDMAN SACHS ($301)  \n\nFounder 2/2: Director of NXPI ($172) ADP ($161) STT ($77) AVTR ($29    \n\n* Former Senior Advisor, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners\n\nDirector 1/3: Director of LSE: RB ($82) STT ($77) CPB ($46)  \n\nDirector 2/3: Former partner of Goldman sachs ($301)  \n\nDirector 3/3: Co-founder &amp; CEO of Paraxel - transformed from no name to top 3 global pharma. He led PAREXEL through its IPO, multiple public offerings, and over 40 mergers and acquisitions during his 36 years at the helm of the company  \n\nSenior advisor 1/3: Former partner of Goldman sachs ($301) \n\nSenior advisor 2/3: General Partner of Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management GS ($301) \n\nSenior advisor 3/3: Director of RNG ($372) NXPI ($172) FTNT ($146) GPRO ($8) ZUO ($13) PREVIOUS CFO OF YAHOO, FORTINET \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Important DD**\n\n**From the 5th of January onwards, volume spiked by 10x and has been consistently high. This paired with the fact that large prints came in on the 7th and 11th of January would make one assume that some news is coming out soon.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Potential target in health insurtech**\n\nThis could go for Oscar health given the $400m spac size\n\n**Connection:**\n\nMario Schlosser is the CEO and co-founder of Oscar, **worked as a consultant for McKinsey &amp; company.**  Gregory Summe Co-Founder &amp; Co-Chairman of NGAC was a **former partner of McKinsey &amp; Company.** \n\nOscar\u2019s peers include Lemonade, MediaAlpha, Duck Creek Technologies, and Root, all of which went public in 2020.  Oscar IPO stock may appeal to investors seeking exposure to the fast-growing insurtech industry. \n\nThe global insurtech market is on track to reach $18 billion in 2025 from $1.5 billion in 2018.  \n\nOscar Health has raised $1.6 billion in funding from investors including Tiger Global Management, Google parent Alphabet, and Coatue  \n\nCurrently, Oscar Health generates about $2 billion in annual revenue  \n\n\"The company hasn\u2019t revealed the IPO date, shareholding structure, financials, size of the listing, pricing range, or the exchange where it will list the stock. This should usually be public before an IPO \n\nNGAC: \" we are focused on growth companies in the industrial and healthcare sector that are benefiting from secular trends, strong competitive positions, and talented management teams.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Good price to enter?**\n\n**3% downside risk on commons &amp; the warrants corrected 29%**. I made a post about BWAC when it was trading at $1.07. I don't ever suggest anyone FOMO at the highs, hence why I make posts regarding any spacs with high potential when they're trading on a dip or a very reasonable price. Imo, a goldman heavy team like this is highly undervalued, especially since it has no hype or fomo premium. Also news could be out really soon as volume is unusually high. \n\nGSAH is another goldman heavy team with warrants at $3.16, that has the fomo and recognition, but NGAC doesn't. That's the beauty of it.\n\nI personally own 17,000 warrants. I will hold out for the news.",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: this is my first published DD post, I do not claim to know all there is to writing a good DD post and any feedback/comments are greatly appreciated.\n\nDisclosure: It is important to always do your own DD before investing. Everything in this post is based on my personal opinion and open-source information. Please don't see this as any financial or investing advice. I have no positions in Okta at the moment.\n\n**OKTA - General Description**\n\nThe company can be seen as providing Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) and is one of the leading companies in the IDaaS market. Okta primarily focusses on 6 main industries: Healthcare, Public Sector, Education, Energy, Financial Services and Technology providing their services to more than 9400 small, medium and large enterprises worldwide.\n\nOkta's main product is the Okta Identity Cloud which is comprised of 6 platform services:\n\n    Directories: stores users and attributes\n    \n    Integrations: ensures that apps (currently 6500+) can connect to Okta\n    \n    Insights: aggregates, analyses and disseminates data from Okta and its partners\n    \n    Identity Engine: customizable access experiences like authorization, authentication and registration\n    \n    Workflows: automates identity-centric processes\n    \n    Devices: collects device identity and context\n\nThese platform services can be leveraged using Okta's products, API's and SDK's like:\n\n    Single Sign On\n    Universal Directory\n    Advanced Server Access\n    Adaptive Multi-actor Authentication\n    Lifecycle Management\n    Access Gateway\n    API Access Management\n    Developer\n    One App\n    Enterprise\n\n**Okta Integration Platform**\n\nThe biggest part that makes Okta a key player is the fact that they integrated 6500+ applications into their cloud and on-premises systems which ensure that on all aspects, an organization can secure their processes. They integrated:\n\n* Human Resources Information Systems like bambooHR and Workday\n* Network Security like Cisco, PaloAlto and Fortinet\n* Application Delivery Controllers like F5, Akamai and Citrix Netsclar\n* Security Analytics like Splunk, Rapid1, IBM QRadar\n* Cloud Access Security Brokers like Bitglass and McAfee\n* API Gateways like AWS, Google Cloud, Apigee\n* Identity Governance and Administration like SailPoint\n* ID Proofing like Acuant, Evident and Experian\n* Privileged Access Management like BeyondTrust and CyberArk\n* Endpoint Security and Management like IBM, MobileIron and VMware\n* Healthcare Technologies like Cerner and AthenaHealth\n* Protocol Based Custom Integrations like Radius, LDAP and SAML\n* Bot Detection like Arkose Labs, Shape and Perimeter\n* Customer Data Integrators like Segment\n* Email Security like ProofPoint\n* SaaS Management Platforms like BetterCloud and Intello\n\nI've made this list, to show how versatile and broad their product is. They ensure that their single product can be used for a multitude of cases within the Workforce Identity, Customer Identity and Access Management market segments.\n\n**How they make money**\n\nOkta's business model follows a SaaS-based delivery model in which business subscribe to Okta's services and pay a fee per user per month. Okta's subscription revenues in the 9 months ending 10/31/2020 jumped 50% YoY to $571.2M.\n\n**Financials &amp; Valuations (as of** [10/31/2020](https://investor.okta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/okta-announces-strong-third-quarter-results)**):**\n\n* Current Market Capitalization (as of 1/15/2021) - $32.75B\n* Total Revenue (3 months): $217,379,000\n* Total Revenue (9 months): $600,684,000\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 3 months: ($72,764,000) \u2013 Up from ($63,495,000)\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 9 months: ($190,526,00) \u2013 Up from ($158,441,000)\n* Cash on Hand: $2.945B\n\n**Growth &amp; Opportunities**\n\nOkta is one of the companies that greatly benefited from the lockdowns all over the world, and the subsequent rise in the need for identity and access management services triggered by the  work-from-home wave. The company's momentum will highly likely continue through fiscal 2021 and beyond, with more and more companies looking to ensure safe and secure work-from-home environments that protects companies, their employees and their customers. CFO Bill Losch said on the company's third-quarter [earnings call](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/earnings),  \"We remain confident that the factors that are driving our business today will continue to drive our business well into the future.\"\n\nJust recently, [Okta's products were made available in the AWS Marketplace](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201202005943/en/Okta-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Bring-the-Okta-Identity-Cloud-to-AWS-Marketplace). It is expected that this move will drive top-line growth.\n\nOkta estimates that it will end fiscal 2021 with revenue of about $822.5 million, an increase of 40% from the previous year, and that it will surpass $1 billion in sales in fiscal 2022. Although Okta isn't profitable yet, one of its pro's is that the free cash flow consistently stays on the plus side and makes up 19% of Okta's revenue. One of the most important contracts in this business are annual contracts. Okta gained 100 customers in Q3 with $100,000+ annual contracts, totaling over 1700 customers. The number of large enterprise contracts ($500,000+) grew 50% YoY to 320. These now represent 80% of Okta's annual contract values.\n\nAs president-elect Joe Biden will take office later this week, one of the most anticipated moves is an [increase in cyber security](https://buildbackbetter.gov/press-releases/statement-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-cybersecurity/) spending by the new administration. Putting Okta, among other big cyber security players, into an excellent playing field the coming years.\n\n**Price Target**\n\nMarch 3 is the expected Q4 earnings. Okta is in a good position to beat their ER once again.\n\n[18 Analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OKTA/analysis?p=OKTA) combined have an average price target of $262.44.17 (upside of \\~4%) with tops being at $313.\n\n**TL;DR Okta is in a great position within the Identity and Access Management market which makes the company one of the ideal high-growth stocks moving forward. Personally, I think it is worth taking a look at and most likely a stock that will pay off not only when Q4 Earnings are reported, but easily for the next 2 years at least.**",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. Happy New Year! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don\u2019t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-RTY-Decile.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQIRBYI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZAbC0jw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wKzyMxp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BUFtffd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cDQHHqx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NhUT413.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7p03h4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Micron Technology, Inc. $75.18\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. Happy New Year! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don\u2019t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. Happy New Year! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen.

It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-RTY-Decile.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQIRBYI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZAbC0jw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wKzyMxp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BUFtffd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cDQHHqx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NhUT413.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7p03h4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Micron Technology, Inc. $75.18\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

        "selftext": "**TL:DR is at the bottom**\n\nHello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.\n\nMy name\u2019s Mark and I\u2019m an accountant with a passion for investing. About two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market today.\n\nI\u2019m a long-term investor. I am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time. I\u2019m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. If you want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the book \u201c100 Baggers\u201d by Chris Mayer.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI\u2019m excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month, Smartsheet. I\u2019m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock screeners with different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth), scan Twitter, talk to professionals in different industries, and try to observe what products or services are getting popular with my friends and family. One of the best investment decisions I\u2019ve made to date came after I talked to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf course. Shout out to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said, you never know where your next good investment idea is going to come from.\n\nIn the case of Smartsheet, I became aware of the company through a stock screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B), strong revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it\u2019s a subscription business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts, it cued me to take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet, the more I liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and that really struck a chord with me. In different roles I\u2019ve had as a teacher, tutor, and supervisor, I\u2019ve always found empowering people to be one of the most important keys to success. I will touch on this more later in the write up.\n\nAnother positive signal I got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I was sitting in the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was watching an interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of Smartsheet. My girlfriend overheard the word \u201cSmartsheet\u201d mentioned in the video and said \u201cAre they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue check mark?\u201d. I had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were thinking about the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it. She said \u201cMy company just transitioned all of our work onto Smartsheet. I really love it. Our marketing department is really excited about it because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d Hearing this just motivated me to learn more about Smartsheet.\n\n**The Thesis Statement**\n\nFor every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement that can serve as a reminder for why I\u2019m buying and holding that stock for the long term. I\u2019ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during times when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why you\u2019re holding this position.\n\nThe thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:\n\n*\u201cSmartsheet: A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the global workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work, managers and executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally consolidate their teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that tool and is innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the most out of their teams.\u201d*\n\nI think this thesis statement really captures the essence of what Smartsheet does. If you go to Smartsheet\u2019s website and look at the \u201cAbout\u201d page, you will find their \u201cAbout\u201d statement which says \u201cSmartsheet is the enterprise platform for dynamic work that aligns people and technology so your entire business can move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.\u201d Notice how their statement emphasizes helping businesses move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.\n\nIn my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the companies that were identified from the study in the order of their ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader in the space at 2nd place. Let\u2019s use our common sense for a second. At the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies on the list. Let\u2019s break them down 1 by 1:\n\n* Workfront was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront, you\u2019d have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn\u2019t be a pure play investment into the CWM space.\n* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)\n* Wrike is private\n* ServiceNow \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also, the company is already quite large ($106B market cap)\n* Asana is public but just IPO\u2019d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don\u2019t have much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company. Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment into the CWM space, they\u2019re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in several of Forrester\u2019s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you can invest in the best?\n* Monday.com is private\n* Microsoft \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.\n* Atlassian \u2013 This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple problems with them as an investment. 1) They\u2019re ranked way beneath Smartsheet. 2) They\u2019re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x (market cap already $58B).\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space and that they\u2019re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment in this space let\u2019s understand why this is important. Other than the obvious reason that we\u2019re in the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, why is this important?\n\nWell, let\u2019s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO, during the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th, 2020:\n\n\u201cLeaders are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work, work that is documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where priorities are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle times will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive the benefits from doing so.\u201d\n\nKey word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:\n\nAsynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc. \n\nSynchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc. \n\nAny communication that doesn\u2019t require a real-time response can be considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above. Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in 2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is called \u201cThe Power of Done\u201d. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent noticed through their own experience, and through different research studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This is a quote from their E-Book:\n\n\u201cAccording to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy, interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis, this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S. workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.\u201d\n\nThey mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets, there hadn\u2019t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork collaboration or task management. The fact that technology advances helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred to as the productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it and thus they founded Smartsheet.\n\n**How Smartsheet makes money**\n\nAt the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand how they make money. In Chris Mayers\u2019 excellent book, 100 Baggers, that I mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This isn\u2019t to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just because it has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a growth stock to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things I look at.\n\nBefore I talk about the revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little bit about the actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. Co-Founder/CEO Mark Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However, he realized that these spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full potential. He wanted to help people get more out of their use of spreadsheets. As a result, we now have Smartsheets which is a cloud based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no matter where they are with live information about project statuses, meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a few uses. Users can choose their way of viewing this information with different views such as calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt view. \n\nThe idea is that by enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information available to all members of a team about the status of a project, the tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous communication will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what they\u2019re hired to do \u2013 get work done. Think about how wasteful it is to hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down to see where they\u2019re at with their assignments. What if all this information was available for him, his managers, and his staff to see within Smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious work hours that could be used for coding, designing, and producing? That\u2019s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.\n\nFor Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I mentioned earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company. Whenever you see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that\u2019s a very good thing. With a subscription business model, the revenue is going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.\n\nSmartsheet\u2019s primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their cloud-based Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and potential customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform by either signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.\n\nSmartsheet offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided. Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration and automation to third-party applications.\n\nThe Connectors part of the business is something I find really interesting. Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet user interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true \u201ccommand center\u201d platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary pieces. You\u2019ll see this on the link above but some products that Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype just to name a few.\n\nI think that being able to sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the Smartsheet user experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot of these companies that people may perceive as \u201cSmartsheet competitors\u201d actually become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can be sold by Smartsheet as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral angle that Smartsheet is able to come from by selling Connectors to their perceived \u201ccompetitors\u201d reminds me a little bit of how Roku (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off of selling a Netflix subscription on their platform. I think just the fact that all these big companies like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc. allow their products to be integrated into Smartsheet shows that there is a high value proposition in the Smartsheet platform and that they would risk alienating their customers if they didn\u2019t allow for their products to be integrated with Smartsheet.\n\nOn top of the Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to sell, Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired 10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource allocation and planning. The name \u201c10,000ft\u201d is meant to be analogous to having a high level view of your company and all resources available within your company and how to deploy them. \n\nAlso, in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which provides a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and measure all forms of digital content. Combining Brandfolder capabilities with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage workflows around content and collaboration. This goes back to what I said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that her company\u2019s marketing team was \u201creally excited about Smartsheet because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d She told me that before Smartsheet, her company\u2019s marketing team had to constantly hunt down members of the creative team (photographers, graphic designers) to receive the latest photos, videos, and digital designs they were working on. She said it was a big pain for them trying to share this content over email and SharePoint. Now, all of the content is inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time. They can leave comments on the content, route to appropriate individuals for approvals, and have better insight into the status of all digital content that is being worked on. The acquisition of Brandfolder is really what allows Smartsheet to stand out in this department. \n\nNobody really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet\u2019s FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that effects the company\u2019s brand. Sales is running social media campaigns, product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts, and R&amp;D is teasing new product experiences in app. It can get really difficult for the company\u2019s Marketing/Branding team to stay on top of all this without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I think Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.\n\nAs you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal upgrades available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that, Smartsheet also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that empowers users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline business and simplify collaboration. There are so many instances within companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow. Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT departments and the coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. This places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes away time they can be spending on more complex/mission critical projects. Mark Mader is aware of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies now and in the future. He believes that everyday non-coder employees know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more relevant apps to help get work done than an IT department employee who doesn\u2019t even do the job that the app is being built for. Also, he believes this will reduce strain on IT departments and allow them to focus on more complex and mission critical projects.\n\nHere is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): \u201cI have been waiting for a solution like WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need, when and where we need it,\u201d said Hina Patel, Director of Sales Operations at Cisco. \u201cThe ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone involved in the process, no matter their role.\u201d As you can see, the value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform appears to be high.\n\nLastly, Smartsheet also generates revenue from Professional Services which is essentially providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet customers that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the most recent quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2% of revenue. Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:\n\nSubscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue\n\nProfessional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue\n\nThis is the end of my first article about Smartsheet. My goal is to drop Part 2 within the next week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth answer of the question \u2013 \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d\n\n  **TL:DR**\n\n* This is Part 1 of my two part deep dive on Smartsheet (Ticker: SMAR). \n* This first part introduces you to (1) me, (2) the company, (3) my thesis on the company, and (4) digs into how they make money.\n* Part 2 (to be released later this week) will go in depth to explore the question \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d If you enjoyed this article and want to make sure you catch Part 2, [subscribe here.](https://onthemarkpicks.com/subscribe-today/) \n* Smartsheet is an exciting SaaS company that\u2019s helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people\n* I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These are just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.\n\n**Disclosure:** I have no position in Smartsheet. I do plan to initiate a long position when the markets open again in 2021.  I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.",

Well, a highly reputable  independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM  space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise  capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of  customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the  companies that were identified from the study in the order of their  ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader  in the space at 2nd place. Let\u2019s use our common sense for a second. At  the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest  in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with  resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage  work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the  answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies  on the list. Let\u2019s break them down 1 by 1:\n\n* Workfront  was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront, you\u2019d  have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn\u2019t be a  pure play investment into the CWM space.\n* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)\n* Wrike is private\n* ServiceNow  \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing  here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also, the company is  already quite large ($106B market cap)\n* Asana  is public but just IPO\u2019d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don\u2019t have  much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company.  Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment into  the CWM space, they\u2019re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in  several of Forrester\u2019s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you  can invest in the best?\n* Monday.com is private\n* Microsoft \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.\n* Atlassian  \u2013 This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple problems  with them as an investment. 1) They\u2019re ranked way beneath Smartsheet.  2) They\u2019re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x  (market cap already $58B).\n\nNow  that we\u2019ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space and  that they\u2019re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment  in this space let\u2019s understand why this is important. Other than the  obvious reason that we\u2019re in the beginning stages of a remote work  revolution, why is this important?\n\nWell,  let\u2019s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO, during  the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th, 2020:\n\n\u201cLeaders  are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work,  work that is documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where  priorities are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their  teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle  times will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and  prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is  ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive  the benefits from doing so.\u201d\n\nKey word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:\n\nAsynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.\n\nSynchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.\n\nAny  communication that doesn\u2019t require a real-time response can be  considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above.  Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real  time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As  part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by  the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and  Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in  2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is  called \u201cThe Power of Done\u201d. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent  noticed through their own experience, and through different research  studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the  early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This  is a quote from their E-Book:\n\n\u201cAccording  to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy,  interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging  and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis,  this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S.  workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.\u201d\n\nThey  mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in  work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets, there  hadn\u2019t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork  collaboration or task management. The fact that technology advances  helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred  productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred to as the  productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it and thus they  founded Smartsheet.\n\n**How Smartsheet makes money**\n\nAt  the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand  how they make money. In Chris Mayers\u2019 excellent book, 100 Baggers, that I  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This isn\u2019t  to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things I  look at.\n\nBefore I talk about the  revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little bit about the  actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. Co-Founder/CEO Mark  Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done  on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However, he realized that these  spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full  potential. He wanted to help people get more out of their use of  spreadsheets. As a result, we now have Smartsheets which is a cloud  based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no  matter where they are with live information about project statuses,  meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a  few uses. Users can choose their way of viewing this information with  different views such as calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt  view.\n\nThe idea is that by  enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information  available to all members of a team about the status of a project, the  tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous communication  will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what  they\u2019re hired to do \u2013 get work done. Think about how wasteful it is to  hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day  preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down  to see where they\u2019re at with their assignments. What if all this  information was available for him, his managers, and his staff to see  within Smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious  work hours that could be used for coding, designing, and producing?  That\u2019s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.\n\nFor  Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I mentioned  earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company. Whenever you  see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that\u2019s a  very good thing. With a subscription business model, the revenue is  going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined  with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.\n\nSmartsheet\u2019s  primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their  cloud-based Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and  potential customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform  by either signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the  Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to  Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses  Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets  their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.\n\nSmartsheet  offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and  Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided.  Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration  and automation to third-party applications.\n\nThe  Connectors part of the business is something I find really interesting.  Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work  productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow  their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet user  interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true \u201ccommand center\u201d  platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary  pieces. You\u2019ll see this on the link above but some products that  Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft  Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype just to name a  few.\n\nI think that being able to  sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the Smartsheet user  experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot of these  companies that people may perceive as \u201cSmartsheet competitors\u201d actually  become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can be sold by Smartsheet  as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral angle that Smartsheet is  able to come from by selling Connectors to their perceived \u201ccompetitors\u201d  reminds me a little bit of how Roku (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off  of selling a Netflix subscription on their platform. I think just the  fact that all these big companies like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc.  allow their products to be integrated into Smartsheet shows that there  is a high value proposition in the Smartsheet platform and that they  would risk alienating their customers if they didn\u2019t allow for their  products to be integrated with Smartsheet.\n\nOn  top of the Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to  sell, Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal  plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can  sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired  10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource  allocation and planning. The name \u201c10,000ft\u201d is meant to be analogous to  having a high level view of your company and all resources available  within your company and how to deploy them.\n\nAlso,  in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which provides  a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and  measure all forms of digital content. Combining Brandfolder capabilities  with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration. This goes back to what I  said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that  her company\u2019s marketing team was \u201creally excited about Smartsheet  because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d She told me  that before Smartsheet, her company\u2019s marketing team had to constantly  hunt down members of the creative team (photographers, graphic  designers) to receive the latest photos, videos, and digital designs  they were working on. She said it was a big pain for them trying to  share this content over email and SharePoint. Now, all of the content is  inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time.  They can leave comments on the content, route to appropriate individuals  for approvals, and have better insight into the status of all digital  content that is being worked on. The acquisition of Brandfolder is  really what allows Smartsheet to stand out in this department.\n\nNobody  really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days  for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out  quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a  light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary  plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet\u2019s  FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief  Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B  for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing  department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All  kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that  effects the company\u2019s brand. Sales is running social media campaigns,  product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts, and R&amp;D is  teasing new product experiences in app. It can get really difficult for  the company\u2019s Marketing/Branding team to stay on top of all this  without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like  Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I think  Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.\n\nAs  you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core  CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal upgrades  available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that, Smartsheet  also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that empowers  users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline  business and simplify collaboration. There are so many instances within  companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow.  Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT departments and the  coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. This  places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes away time they can be  spending on more complex/mission critical projects. Mark Mader is aware  of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies  now and in the future. He believes that everyday non-coder employees  know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build  their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more  relevant apps to help get work done than an IT department employee who  doesn\u2019t even do the job that the app is being built for. Also, he  believes this will reduce strain on IT departments and allow them to  focus on more complex and mission critical projects.\n\nHere  is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet  customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): \u201cI have been waiting for a solution like  WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need,  when and where we need it,\u201d said Hina Patel, Director of Sales  Operations at Cisco. \u201cThe ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along  with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive  app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone  involved in the process, no matter their role.\u201d As you can see, the  value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform appears to be  high.\n\nLastly, Smartsheet also  generates revenue from Professional Services which is essentially  providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet customers  that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the most recent  quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2% of revenue.  Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:\n\nSubscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue\n\nProfessional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue\n\nThis  is the end of my first article about Smartsheet.

However, you don\u2019t quite have to worry about your wife going off and getting a robot boyfriend anytime soon. While this may come to a surprise to Jeffery Epstein\u2019s pal Steve Hawking[who believed robots will soon take over the world](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/stephen-hawking-named-epstein-unsealed-files-virginia-giuffre-ghislaine-maxwell-1521920%3famp=1)  smart people in the field have been dealing with solving the problems of making artificial intelligence work for decades. This is good news for all those that have diamond hands \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 on their Palantir shares in the coming years, because one of the founders solved one of the major problems over a decade ago and I\u2019ll tell you how.\n\n\n**The problem with Artificial Intelligence and the Palantir Solution**\n\n\nIf you aren\u2019t yet familiar with [Stephen Cohen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cohen_(entrepreneur)) you should be. This is the ultimate autist chad that coded the first prototype of Palantir in 8 weeks. At his time at Stanford, he studied machine learning and artifical intelligence (this was way back in 2005, these beasts of nature are always 20~ years ahead of the normie media and their trends). However, as Cohen himself mentions in his talk at Stanford [\u201cThe Path to Palantir\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g_6_kGDdjwI) he became dissapointed studying AI due to the many limitations of the field he quickly realized. Firstly, the AI is only ever as smart as the algorithms that the humans were able to develop, thus more \u201cartificial\u201d than \u201cintelligent.\u201d Secondly, while computers are able to store and calculate numbers even faster than an autist doing his math homework before his mom will let him have his tendies, and their superior skill at storing this information, computers cannot grasp numerous concepts that human\u2019s are skilled at. Most fundamentally, this is creativity and anything that is subjective. The example Cohen uses in his speech is hunger. Try explaining the feeling of hunger to someone and while you may be able to quantify it as a number between 1-10, this quantification leaves a lot out that someone that has never experienced hunger would understand. To put it simply, there are numerous factors in life that are impossible for a computer to qualify. Computers are good at factors they can quantify (numbers) but are as retarded as your average WSB bottom feeder when it comes to the qualitative (subjective). This is where Palantir comes in. Effectively, Palantir solves the quantitative issues for the human and lays it out for humans to interact with and add in qualitative analysis. Palantir is a marriage between a computer\u2019s impeccable ability to process and store numbers and data and humans impeccable ability to use creativity and view context as well as the subjective. \n\n\n**Software &amp; Business: The Dinosaur Superstructure**\n\n\nHeres where our other founder bellwether [Peter Thiel ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) comes in. If you haven\u2019t heard of him yet, your girlfriend probably doesn\u2019t you stay out past 8 PM, even when she\u2019s not home. Member of the paypal mafia, when hes not busy making billions with his buddies musk and bezos, he\u2019s [taking down Gawker with Hulk Hogan ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/21/peter-thiels-war-on-gawker-a-timeline/?sh=78387f3251c5)for outing his private sex life. Like how Cohenknows how computer\u2019s work, Thiel knows how businesses work. How many people here have been in an actual office building? Probably not the right crowd, I know, most of you still live in your parent\u2019s basement, but that won\u2019t matter when PLTR moons. Anyway, one of the first things youll notice is that the majority of technology used by businesses and governments are older than the average /r/teenagers poster. [According to research conducted by Kaspersky, \u201cfour in ten of very small businesses (VSB), and roughly half of small and medium-sized businesses (SMB), still rely on operating systems such as Windows XP or Windows 7 which are nearing their end of life.\u201d](https://www.itproportal.com/amp/news/businesses-still-dependent-on-outdated-software/) For some reason, I cannot find similar statistics for even larger companies that would be more likely for Palantir to be working with, but i\u2019d wager from experience and knowing the scaleability issues that come with updating to technology, especially when dealing with a bunch of boomers, that it would be even higher for large companies. However, this is great news, because our good friend Thiel has the perfect formula to grab the biggest 6000 businesses by the balls.\n\n\nEssentially, Palantir fronts the costs of installing and getting the software embedded into an operation in it\u2019s \u201cacquisition contract\u201d stage. Im not a finance frog, but from what I understand they don\u2019t actually make money from these contracts. Hence why they haven\u2019t been profitable. However, the model is like a snowball. After the acquisition contract has expired, the boomers running the operation Palantir is contracting to have finally figured out how to use the software without training wheels and it is entrenched in their companies business. A larger contract with higher margins is signed. Further, companies of that companies competition look at what Palantir has done for that company, such as when in Q3 Palantir found 315m in unnecessary spending for an oil and gas company, slotting to save the company 1b in the coming 12 months https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx and they are forced to sign an acquisition contract, further pushing the snowball along and acting as a case study of success for Palantir. \n\n\nRemember to diamond hands and buy that dip. The markets are an unmedicated bipolar teenaged girl on her period and currently Palantir is in a downswing, but that is only a buying opportunity for the wise of us. Short term, I could see Palantir dipping as low as $20. This negative feedback loop will be broken either by a new contract, Karp interview day, another media announcement, or demo day. Eventually. I\u2019ll lose a lot of you here, if I already havent, but hold strong and don\u2019t stress the short term as long as you agree with my thesis and have done/seen enough due diligence of your own to understand the fundamentals of this company are as solid as Karp\u2019s skiing legs. Longer term, I can see this company being at 100b+ market cap being conservative. \n\n\nBest of luck and fuck \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b andrew \u201cnever right\u201d left of Citron research, morgan stanley, and credit suisse. \n\nPLTR TO THE MOON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\nDisclamers: 100 shares @ 25 (my portfolio is around 22k.

Investment**  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the era of growing small businesses and increasing brand presence, the internet appears to be a vast and difficult space to make a lasting impression on from a small business perspective. Small businesses may have insufficient entries in Google, Yahoo, and other search engines, where clients are likely to discover them. This is significant for these businesses, because if their information is inaccurate or missing, it will turn away potential customers. Yext, a growing New York based company under the ticker YEXT, provides a solution for modifying these entries and increasing the internet presence of small businesses.  YEXT shows promise as a growing long term stock due to its unique product line and hopeful financials.\n\nIn a sense, Yext is like Google but for enterprises that require more depth than Google can provide for them, and they actually use Google to help companies advertise and gain traction with consumer base using their APIs that are integrated with consumer platforms. The advertising industry is huge, as we\u2019ve seen Google, Facebook, and Snapchat dominate simply off reaching consumers, and collecting their data. Yext bridges the gap between businesses and unstructured data of potential consumers and existing consumers, setting them up in a multi-billion dollar industry expected to continually increase for the future. \n\nTheir main product line includes Answers: a search engine, Listings: an advertising tool to get your company\u2019s products onto multiple platforms, Pages: a tool that helps get your business at the top of every location search, Reviews: which helps you engage with customer feedback, and Knowledge Graph/Analytics which helps business owners see their customer interactions with their webpages and other online presence. Websites used to be everything for a business but now a business requires presence across multiple platforms and integration with every search engine, map, or social media. The more a business\u2019 online presence is spread the more analytics you need too, and Yext is the amalgamation of the entire business\u2019 internet presence. This cloud-based software is easy to use, and it\u2019s used by several reputable companies; including huge fast food chains, travel companies, car manufacturers and even banks. \n\nYext solves the problem of particular consumer questions and connects the respective business with precisely what the consumer was looking for. Specific questions such as \u201cwealth advisor near me who specializes in healthcare\u201d (an example they used in their past annual report) will become increasingly easier to answer with the newest developments in Artificial Intelligence. The control of the ever-changing facts of a business are what enable it to spread its sales. Up-to-date and relevant information on every nook and cranny of the web has become a necessity, as convenience has become the most necessary commodity. Poor site experience is a huge detractor for the large majority of shoppers, and if businesses are able to retain this potential loss in customers they\u2019d be willing to pay anything. Managing an online presence using one dashboard is going to be a very desirable service for all businesses, regardless of size. Yext links all the chains together in the cloud, for Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, and even the Chinese WeChat, all services which are improving more and more in terms of their search capabilities and they\u2019re growing in popularity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe product or service a company provides is the most crucial aspect of a company\u2019s success, and YEXT seems to deliver on its product. The solution requires a subscription that can be priced according to a business\u2019 specific needs. YEXT does not seem to have as many recognizable competitors. Its main competitors, Birdeye and Chatmeter, are both private companies with no real news about an IPO anytime soon, while YEXT has been public on the NYSE for three years. From this perspective, YEXT maintains an advantage over its competitors due to it being more recognizable and financially stronger due to its valuation reaching over a billion after going public. However, a reported issue with the product is that listings may go back to normal after a contract with a small business terminates. This is justifiable, because a small business could use the service for a month and reap all benefits. To improve this aspect of the solution that is controversial, maybe a potential solution could be negotiating a minimum period the contract has to be active in order for listings not to revert when it is terminated. Despite this drawback, Yext Inc. has innovated in this niche field and is emerging as a frontrunner in back-end listing modification.\n\nNow that we have established that YEXT will likely be a frontrunner in structuring advertising data, we need to establish WHY this is a growing industry, as YEXT is heavily dependent on the growth of eCommerce and other forms of online and in person business. Without businesses, Yext will have no source of revenue so the expansion of commerce is critical to Yext\u2019s revenue. Fortunately, eCommerce and small businesses are trending upwards, indicating a healthy future for YEXT. One way to examine if this industry is growing is to analyze advertisement spending, as more online businesses directly correlates to more money spent on advertising. The graph below regarding digital advertising spending clearly illustrates that online business is growing, with advertisement spending nearly doubling over the six years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plzhvnh7w1961.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7bc511f13b8c4b13206acfc3015bfe9d5303176\n\nAnother way to gauge the health of the industry YEXT is heavily dependent on is to take a look at the growing amount of transactions online. Transactions correlate to greater revenue generated via the internet and thus a greater need for YEXT to introduce smaller businesses to this growing market. The chart below from Statista portrays the growth of Mobile POS payments and Digital commerce over seven years, almost tripling in total volume. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img jydysim9w1961...*\n\nOnce again this looks promising for YEXT, as their clients are primarily located in this sect of online business due to accurate data going hand in hand with more online sales. Furthermore, YEXT will be a solid pick for investors in the long term due to its growth along with a growing industry and its solid product. If you are interested in delving deeper into why eCommerce and online payments are growing, be sure to check out the Paypal/Square DD as well.\n\nOn their last 10k, Yext reported the following for their most recent compiled income statement:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8renwobw1961.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d66290b3c437c25c5798b9130d55f3fdbbd25470\n\nAs you can see for the top line, there are plenty of positive signs. Revenue has grown by over $50M yearly from 2016 to 2019, and from 2019 to 2020 revenues grew by about $70M. So the indicator when it comes to sales is overwhelmingly signaling that this company is well-positioned to grow, especially in the near future. Gross profit margins are also great as the cost of the product itself isn\u2019t much. The potential issues in the income statement show up as you go toward the bottom line. Operating expenses far outweigh gross profits so net profits are -30% despite gross profit margins being 75%. Breaking down Opex, you can see that about \u2154 of them go towards sales and marketing, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing as distributing your product can be a huge future investment, but it can be concerning for investors who want a product that \u201csells itself\u201d. Despite this rather arbitrary requirement, the sales growth justifies the spending as it\u2019s obviously working and eventually revenue should far outpace selling expenses. \n\nIn their 10k, they state that their sales expenses primarily had to do with more wages and a higher headcount of employees. As the company\u2019s operations grow, they\u2019ll need more employees to run it in an aggressive growth stage. Despite the constant revenue growth, the stock price has been diluted due to more underwriting in 2019. It may take a while to recover from all the extra supply that was brought into the market, but even if we see more financing in early stages, I personally wouldn\u2019t be concerned as that\u2019s a normal course of action for younger companies.\n\nA quick look at the financials indicates that YEXT is improving as a company over each year. Due to their relatively high amounts of investment, the EPS for the company has remained negative. The EPS was also a lot worse in previous years. However, don\u2019t let this negative metric fool you, as the EPS has been trending positive since the first quarter of 2020. This indicates significant improvement, especially since the EPS hasn\u2019t been improving much prior to 2020. The increase of the EPS is also supported by the increase of change in working capital from $2M to $4M. As for the rest of the cash flow statement, the negative values are primarily caused by the expansion of operations. This expansion of operations is indicated by the increasing total assets, which means that YEXT grew their assets via larger operations. Although the numbers may be negative temporarily, the expansion of operations allows YEXT to generate more revenue from operations and hopefully turn the direction of cash flows around. Constant reinvestment back into the company is a good sign as it indicates owner and shareholder confidence in the future prospect.\n\nFinally, delving into the 10Q provides reassuring prospects for the future health and growth of YEXT as a company. Looking at the breakdown of individual risks, YEXT looks to be relatively secure in the future. The main risks of the company are internal, and are not influenced by factors such as inflation and foreign currency fluctuations. To some, YEXT may appear risky due to its limited financial history and potential unprofitability due to it being relatively new. However, these risks will ultimately be insignificant, as the expansion of operations will soon be recovered by profits if YEXT maintains its current scale of growth that it has achieved in 2020.\n\nIn conclusion, YEXT will be a good pickup for many investors because the enterprise solutions industry overall has done very well, and Yext\u2019s solutions are definitely a foray into the future of artificial intelligence combined with traditional SaaS. If you compare Yext to another company that has a similar premise, Twilio, you can see that Yext\u2019s price/sales ratio is only 1/7th of Twilio\u2019s. Of course, Twilio is far more overvalued and has had better sales growth than Yext this past year, but Yext isn\u2019t a slouch in sales growth either as we\u2019ve seen. Plus, they have far more potential than Twilio does as we\u2019ve seen with their relatively small market cap of $2B. Both companies offer AI-based enterprise solutions, but Yext is just as good if not a better solution for the future as it has more applicability through a variety of businesses. If you want to see similar growth to what we\u2019ve seen in company\u2019s such as Twilio but feel as if you\u2019ve missed the bus, don\u2019t worry: we\u2019ve got the pick for you. Yext is still 25% off its 52-wk high, and they are sure to surpass it with just one or two blowout positive ERs which will be in the books soon.",

        "selftext": "Here's my portfolio and a little reasoning on why I bought each stock and why I'm holding what I hold. I always find it interesting to look at other people's portfolios so here you go. Hope you find it interesting and let me know your thoughts!\n\n**GHIV - 46.35% portfolio diversity.**\n\nThis is a SPAC with a merger set to go forth with United Wholesale Mortgage. I'm normally not a big fan of value plays but this one seems too enticing for me to not go with. I'm sure you all have read a decent bit about this so I'll keep it short. They have fantastic revenue, the circumstances are great for them, they pay a 40 cent dividend, institutional people like them, we like them, comparing them to RKT I feel good about this.\n\n**NPA - 13.45% portfolio diversity.**\n\nAnother one you've probably heard a lot about but I like this because it's probably the future of cell service and their competition with SpaceX isn't too direct.\n\n**NOVS - 5.14% portfolio diversity.**\n\nThis company deals with greenhouse farming. It's really interesting actually and I believe it's part of the future of farming. The people in the industry know this is the way for the future and the Netherland does it and does it well. It's smart, it's fresh to get to a huge chunk of the country, solid stuff.\n\n**STIC - 4.93% portfolio diversity.**\n\nThis is one where I bought in a little high but I still like the company. They have a merger with BarkBox. BarkBox is a subscription company with about 10 years behind them and reaching some solid growth and revenue. The market is growing domestically and worldwide and I assume it will continue this trend. They're a popular company and people like them. I think they can get people to continue their subscriptions and have some big growth.\n\n**INVT -  4.58% portfolio diversity.**\n\nThis is one of the few non-SPAC stocks on the list, but it's genetics stuff, which I like.\n\n**JWS - 4.42% portfolio diversity.**\n\nThis is a SPAC with a merger with Cano Health. It's the largest growing health care provider for the second year now, with 7000% annual growth. I believe it was chapter 8 of the Psychology of Money where it said that you should invest in companies you love and this is exactly that. It's all about serving the underserved communities. I like the ethical views of the person running the SPAC and the Cano's CEO. More on the leadership team, the person running the merger and the CEO of Cano are looking to be more business partners than investor-CEO. The merger is great for extra funding to Cano but a big thing they're looking for is leadership from the guy in charge of the SPAC. The CEO seems good, but the SPAC guy has the experience that will work together well with him.\n\n**GIK - 4.33% portfolio diversity.**\n\nMerger with Lightning eMotors. This one is more speculative that it will just go up and maybe there's some chance at long term success but this is more short term since I really don't think they can compete with Tesla.\n\n**CFII - 2.41% portfolio diversity.**\n\nAcquisition with View, a window company with high-level stuff. I like this company a good bit but the only problem I have with it is that their valuation is just so high so I'll probably see what happens and most likely will sell right before the merger.\n\n**PSTH - 3.03% portfolio diversity.** \n\nBill Ackman SPAC with no merger. My thinking is to just use it as a place to park some money and I used to have more shares, but I took a good chunk out since right now it's looking more and more like an overpriced pile of cash but still holding to this share. I think Ackman has solid stuff going on and there's more reasoning for this one, but the main idea here is a place to park money where it seems like it should grow short term. And if not and it goes down, I'm relatively confident about this for the longer term.\n\n**BOWX - 2.25% portfolio diversity.**  \nNo merger announced. This is really just a place to store my cash and spice things up a little since it's fairly close to the net asset value and I like the people running it, a solid background in data (founder of TIBCO). Hoping for a target in data analytics but we will see.   \n**LGVW - 2.16% portfolio diversity.**  \nThis is one where I honestly should've bought more on the dip because it's such a solid and well-trusted company by everyone in the industry, but it was more than $4 above the SPAC's net asset value at the time and I didn't have the hindsight, which is fine. Target is Butterfly Network. They do ultrasounds and such and what I love about this company is that the people who work in the sector love their product and swear by them. I also like the purpose of the company. Their goal is to make high-quality ultrasound imaging affordable and widely available to those who would have been worse off. It does good stuff and makes the world a better place. They are the leader in what they do and have and they're the ones transforming the business of ultrasounds, not the other way around. The final note on this is that they have institutional backing from the right people who are very long term on the stock. I plan to hold this after the merger and for a good amount of time.\n\n**BFT - 1.65% portfolio diversity.**\n\nHas a merger with Paysafe. I'm sure you've all heard enough DD's and enough articles and research to show this has a lot of promise. I like this company but I don't have more of it because there's so much competition from Square and PayPal and I think those two are great companies. However, I think Paysafe has its own thing to offer but we will see.\n\n**CLA - 1.48% portfolio diversity.**\n\nThis does stuff that's very similar to what $LAZR does and we all saw how well that went.\n\n**FUSE+ (2 warrants) - 0.56% portfolio diversity.**\n\nThis one, I admit, is a speculative buy. I'm just a fan of the team behind it and see some potential. It's a spac with no merger announced yet, but they aim to have a SPAC target in fintech. Their valuation target for the company also went to $10 billion which gives a lot more options for better targets. The final note is that there has been a very high volume. Could just be the market doing its own weird thing but could also be some insider knowledge. I'm just taking my chances on this one because I think the balance of probability is on my side and this is one I can afford to lose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't need to be right on all of these at all. My hope is just that the balance of probability ends up in my favor. A lot of these are interesting companies that I think will do some good for the world so I don't mind putting money into a company that moves the world towards a good cause.",

        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\n# Low IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays!\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit.

        "selftext": "With 2020 over, I decided to look at the regional geographic distribution of North America's \"mega\" cap corporations ($50b+ market capitalization) by headquarters.\n\nHere's the graphic I made laying that out: [https://i.imgur.com/t37BQWc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/t37BQWc.jpg)\n\nNorth America has 152 mega cap companies, 145 in the United States and 7 in Canada. Mexico has 2 companies right on the cusp (Walmex at $49b and America Movil at $49b), but misses the cusp. Maybe next year.\n\nThese 152 companies have a market cap of $27.06 trillion. 97.7% is in the USA. 2.3% is in Canada.\n\nTo be clear, these companies are grouped based on the location of their headquarters, aka where high-level executive decisions are made (where CEO/President/Chairman/Board/executive management generally resides). Of course, these companies have multinational operations and their workforce is spread throughout.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n* The U.S. gained $5.586 trillion in mega cap market value in the past year. Canada gained $97 billion. North America gained $5.683 trillion total.\n* The West Coast had a banner year due to COVID pandemic and general inertia. With 56.6 million people (of North America's 580 million, or 9.8%) it is now home to 46 companies who combined have 52.4% of North America's mega cap market value. Last year, these 145 companies had a market cap of $21.4 trillion, and the West Coast had 42.4% of the share. So the West Coast captured 10% of the mega cap \"market share\" in one year.\n* Mega cap market value increased by 26.79% in the United States and 18.34% in Canada. In both cases, the increase was due to tech growth. In Canada, Shopify's growth alone makes up nearly the entirety of Canada's growth. Shopify went from not being mega cap ($46b) on January 1, 2020, to having a market cap of $137 billion a year later, or 198% growth. If you exclude Shopify from Canada's listing, Canada's mega cap only grew by 1.24%, showing how countries without competitive tech industries will fall behind in the coming decade. If Shopify can continue to grow in the coming years, it will do wonders to shift Canada's mega cap value away from dying (energy) and stagnant (finance) industries.\n* The same tech shift was noticeable throughout the U.S. The West Coast's mega cap market value increased by a whopping 52.9% from $9.067 trillion to $13.863 trillion. Tesla alone added $593 billion of market capitalization, or nearly the entire mega cap value of Canada. The rest of the U.S. had mixed growth. The Great Lakes and Southeast had 12.75% market cap growth and 12.80% market cap growth, respectively. The Northeast, heavy on traditional industries and finance, only grew by 4.56%. The Southwest declined by 5.32% due to the oil shock and Exxon's market cap collapse.\n* Of the 7 North American companies among the Top 10 globally, we have the following growth:  \n\n   * Alphabet: +$264 billion market cap growth\n   * Amazon: +$714 billion market cap growth\n   * Apple: +$968 billion market cap growth\n   * Berkshire Hathaway (the only non-tech): -$8 billion market cap growth\n   * Facebook: +$193 billion market cap growth\n   * Microsoft: +$482 billion market cap growth\n   * Tesla: +$593 billion market cap growth\n   * **TOTAL: +$3.206 trillion**\n* As the numbers above show, the 7 companies above grew by $3.206 trillion. So these 7 alone account for 57.4% of the U.S. gain, and 56.4% of North America's. They also account for 67% of the West Coast increase just due to sheer size, even if smaller tech companies had much better percentage growth rates than all but Tesla.\n* Two companies IPOd straight into mega cap territory: Airbnb and Snowflake. Both are seriously overvalued and I can't imagine them sustaining those levels.\n* If 2021 is a year of recovery, I could also see a correction, with money being pulled from the safety of big tech back into traditional industries. So next year's snapshot might be far less imbalanced than the +53% West Coast, +5% Northeast dynamic we had this year.\n* HQ relocations are a big question mark. This year alone, Charles Schwab and Oracle moved their HQs to Texas (though the former's isn't final final until January 21). If Paypal or Tesla move to Texas in 2021, the West Coast dominance could be reduced even further.\n\nAny other thoughts?",

I started to invest recently (I know it\u2019s an easy market climate to make money in atm) but it\u2019s definitely a long term commitment I\u2019m looking to make and very willing to weather the ups and downs. Before I make a longer term commitment I know I need to diversify a little bit more than I currently am, as I have quite a bit invested in growth stocks (clean energy). Here are some of my positions: \n\nICLN, RIDE, PLUG, STOR, PBD, OPTT, Tan, JPM, BLDP, AQN, JMIA ,PYPL &amp; LITE. \n\nI guess before I commit more I\u2019ll take any diversifying advice I can get!

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI am based in Burnaby, BC. I have been actively investing in individual stocks since 2018 with success.\n\nThe majority of my money has been put to work with US &amp; Canadian-based publicly traded companies.\n\nWhen I heard the news that PayPal and Square were making sizeable investments in Bitcoin a few months, I took this as a sign that it was time to look at Bitcoin more seriously. I spent hours watching YouTube videos and reading articles on Bitcoin, and became fascinated by it's finite characteristics.\n\nAbout a month ago, I opened a Coinbase account and started buying small amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). My mind has been blown ever since. It seems like the value of my investments in both assets has been going up by the hour. Everyday I wake up to more money in my account. \n\nAs a Canadian I feel like I have been misled and oppressed by the dinosaur Canadian Banks and their 18% credit card products and .05% savings accounts for so long. To have access to a saving / investment vehicle like Bitcoin and/or Ethereum brings feelings of liberation and hope to my life right now. I understand the party could end at any time, but it feels like something special is happening right now at the same time.\n\nI wanted to put this opportunity on everyones radar. \n\nIf you are actively investing in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other crypto currencies. Are you noticing the same opportunity as me? What are your thoughts?\n\nP.S. typically I have been skeptical of Bitcoin and the crypto currency world, but that changed for me a few months ago. I can't believe what unfolding before my eyes while invested in this space day by day.",
