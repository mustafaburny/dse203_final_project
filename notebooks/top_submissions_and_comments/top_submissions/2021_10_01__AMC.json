        "selftext": "I haven\u2019t always been down but pretty much right of the jump I was and quit trading. I lost 30k on $GME calls after buying at ath pretty much. I was in at $80ish with calls then sold at $118 made a little but not a lot. Then after I lost the 30k I quit trading and kept just my index funds which are up 35% now lol. After some time off I went and yolod into $amc at $12 rode it to $72 with options and was up over 170k. Well I watched it go all the way down and basically got my account to break even including the $gme options. Now I\u2019m down over $100k of my own money going big on positions then doubling down on losing positions. Just lost 20k this week on bad option calls and not cutting losses. This doesn\u2019t really put me in financial ruin or anything since I got a good paying jobs but still sucks. I believe I just have a gambling personality. I was profitable day trading then went all in this week and lost all the work I had put in. Any advice? Should I just delete my accounts? I\u2019m just in shock rn",

        "selftext": "I'll get straight to the point. **Everyone,** and I mean **EVERYONE**, is hunting down that next 'GME/AMC' style squeeze.\n\nThey want to be in it 'early'. They want to be on the cusp of the 'next big squeeze', and join the ranks of those who 'HODL'd GME and AMC over the past year.\n\nThis is easy to see. Flocks of people move from stock to stock as soon as it gets mentioned. They want to match the 'ape monicker' and get creative marketing names 'Spartans, Progs, etc.. to match the 'ape community' that was formed.\n\nWhen in reality, these squeezes are far and few between.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I have made money off these constant rotations. That aside, this is my FAVORITE play and the one I have put the most effort into... $SDC.\n\n**Here are my thoughts on why I believe $SDC has what it takes to take on the Meme title and join GME and AMC as a true meme-style rally/squeeze.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1.** **SDC has been well known:**\n\n**$SDC** already has a huge amount of exposure. When it comes to short squeezes, exposure is EVERYTHING. You NEED people to **actually know** about the company. On top of that, you need volume and price action to work in your favor to apply pressure (via increased share price, margin requirements, and cost to borrow) against the opposing short positions. $SDC **has** this exposure. It's highly talked about, and you have tons of eyes on the sidelines. A simple 5+% move like today can suddenly cause a MASSIVE shot in upwards sentiment. It gets everyone to FOMO in and turns what was a 5% day into a 15% day almost immediately.\n\n**2. Management Favors Retail:**\n\nManagement is in RETAILS FAVOR. I will say this OVER and OVER again. BECAUSE GME's management favored retail and because AMC's management favored retail, that is the TRUE reason these stocks had the momentum they did. These companies put RETAIL FIRST. Yes, AMC had to raise capital, but they did that WITH transparency to retail. AND, they did that AFTER MOST RETAIL made a KILLING riding the stock to almost $40. If you haven't been paying attention $SDC is on retails side. Just like Adam Aron, SDC's CFO is making constant retail appearances and inviting retail to ask questions to get them involved. Retail only wins, if, AND ONLY IF, the company works WITH retail; not against.\n\nOn top of that we, DON'T want dilution when we have the momentum of a squeeze. SDC has made it clear they don't plan to dilute on retail. Even when they had to do a dilution round in the past they made sure there was a clause that the stock had to go up 100% from that current price before the dilution could be realized. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED. We need a stock/management team that puts retail first, and I believe SDC has that checked as well.\n\n**3. Fundamentals Matter on Psychology**\n\nFUNDAMENTALS. Now, don't tell me fundamentals don't matter in a squeeze. They do. At the very least, the COMPANY/STOCK behind the squeeze does. There is a psychological play in every squeeze. As the price goes up, more and more people are making profits. On the flip side, as the price goes down, more and more people are losing money. Why did AMC and GME squeeze? **THEY DIDN'T SELL**.\n\nYou can't tell me the fact that there was nostalgia for your childhood GameStop, or the fact that people were excited to get out of these pandemic lockdowns, and go back to the movies, didn't have a HUGE effect on the psychological sentiment behind these stocks? You **knew** the companies you were buying and trying to squeeze, and they gave you/them confidence.\n\nWhen stock is down, your **CONVICTION** is what keeps you from selling. You have to know **WHAT YOU OWN**. If you're playing a squeeze on some penny stock you have never heard of before now, **YOU CAN'T TELL ME** you will have a high conviction when things go south. **NO-ONE** wants to be the one holding a bag of a no-name company if a squeeze doesn't turn out and the stock drops.\n\nThis is another reason I love $SDC. **PEOPLE KNOW WHO THEY ARE.** Unless you are living under a rock or didn't watch any tv AT ALL during the pandemic these past 2 years, you have seen a Smile Direct Club ad. I'm not saying Smile Direct has the nostalgia, GME or AMC have/had. But they for sure have more retail confidence and or more well know (as as company) than any of the most recent 'brand new' squeeze plays of late.\n\nYou cant tell me you had ANY idea what/who some of these random squeeze companies were prior to the squeeze play being called out. And this is VERY important. Have you noticed SDC has had a cult-like following DESPITE dropping 20% over the past few weeks? People are dropping hundreds of thousands if not MILLIONS into this company with the conviction that it's going up because **THEY KNOW** what/who the company actually is.\n\nLong story short, the better a company is known, the more confident the average trader will feel when it dips. The more confident = less selling. less selling on a short squeeze = \ud83c\udf19.\n\n4. **Fundamentals are debatable (fundamentals continued)...**\n\nThe fundamentals are debatable. This is a follow up to number 3.\n\nAMC and GME had 'debatable fundamental value. They didn't have 100% of people thinking AMC and GME were going to turn the boat around and make a profitable company (hence why they were so shorted). It took VISION, vision that they COULD have a future. And that 'potential' allowed people to speculate, and in turn, allowed them to confidently buy the stock.\n\nSDC has that same 'speculative' future. 50% of people see its potential... how it has SO MUCH growth potential for SO MUCH more, especially when compared to ALGN. On the flip side, you have 'every dentist and their dog' bashing the company and saying why it's going to fail. The similarities to that of GME and AMC (when they were trading in the $5's) isn't lost on me. People also said they were going **NOWHERE** and that people on this sub were throwing money in the garbage. Look at them now.\n\n**5. Stats**\n\n**The float, short interest etc...:**\n\nOne thing I have seen said over and over \"the float is too big to move\". That is a **BUNCH OF SH$\\*.**\n\nThe float is around **100M**. AMC's was **NEAR 500M**. You give $SDC 1/5 of the volume and attention that $AMC had and your golden. That aside, you **DONT WANT A LOW FLOAT STOCK**. If a company has a float of say 20M and has 50% short interest. That means there are only 10 million shares on loan/shorted.\n\nIf a stock has having 100M+ in volume a day, shorts could cover in literally an hour if they wanted (not days) and no one would even know from the buying pressure. On top of that, you cant tell me shorts are '**really sweating**' when there are only 10 million shares of stock (lets say its trading at say $2), and the CTB is going up. That's only 20 million dollars to be short 50% of this hypothetical penny stocks float.\n\nThey have less capital at risk, '*less skin in the game*', on these low float stocks. Yes, they can pop fast, but they can be shorted down JUST AS FAST. The risk just isn't there, and the momentum DIES FAST AS WELL.\n\nWhy do you think it has been SO HARD to bring down AMC and GME once they FINALLY started to have MAJOR momentum. **THE BIG FLOAT!** A big float will make it **HARDER** to bring a squeeze down once the squeeze is in motion. On top of that, they have **WAYYYY** more money at risk. In the case of $SDC 45.86 MILLION Shares. At $6 a share, that's **229 million dollars** on the line. **OVER** **1/4 BILLION dollars** they are having to pay over 250% CTB on. Now that, **THAT**, can make shorts think twice. That can actually make a dent in their hedge funds bankroll. **That is what we NEED.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ghndfe38cqr71.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7719dbe2c935c68213bff6d1d0eb1cbfe10040f\n\nAnyway, all in all, these are just a FEW the reasons I think $SDC can join the ranks of $GME and $AMC. I have made other posts going over the companies fundamentals, future outlook as a 'long play' etc.. But this is about its *MEME-ability*. It has all the potential, now it just needs the retail movement. Are you going to be on the right side of this play? Are you going to 'get in early',? just like you wished you did with AMC and GME? If we play our cards right we have the control here. Just BTFD and hold on tight! \ud83d\udc8e \ud83e\udd1a\n\n**tl;dr: $SDC has management that is on the side of retail. The company is well known and has all the components of becoming the next big meme rally next to AMC and GME. So BTFD (but this isn't financial advice) \ud83d\ude09**\n\n.....\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n**IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ JUST, BUY AND HODL TO THE MOON \ud83c\udf19!!! WE DESERVE OUR TENDIES!** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n.... (again not financial advice) \ud83d\ude09!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI did put a lot of research into the current situation for quite some time and finally build a portfolio I am 100% behind long-term. However, the more I learned, the more sure I am that we will experience a market crash rather soon, than late.\n\nI am not here to debate whether or not you think this is true, but the situation for this thought game is that we might see a crash similar in numbers, not principle like 2008' all over again.In general, during times of high inflation, most businesses will not come out well. The earnings will go up, but they need to put more money into their own business to even stay in the same place. A hedge for this are companies that can easily scale their business without needed money flow. I am looking at you Facebook, who can place 10% more ads, Adobe who can increase their product price without fear of losing customers, Apple, Microsoft...\n\nThe theory behind this discussion would assume that GameStop is a good hedge and to some degree AMC as well, I even heard that from the high ups in a very big, german bank, which is incredibly weird since they were against it months ago and did not even want to talk about it in the first place. This assumes that the crash is happening because of said theory I explained below in short in an edit. It does not mean that a high percentage of the entire portfolio should persist of them, but a chunk just in case might be a very good idea. The market is more complex than many think.\n\nAnother hedge and long term hold can not be mentioned in this sub, but you might guess what it is. Sadly, we cant debate this here. Has to do with weird blocks and tokens, latter of which might change the whole gaming industry and I am thankfully in the position where I can take constant profits from it in percentages that sound absolutely insane.\n\nSo, in case of this **theoretical** scenario, I would like to get everyone's opinion on this. I want to be clear, I value every single opinion and would love the most input possible. In case of no crash, my investments should grow steadily, but in case of a crash due to named circumstance, they would skyrocket. Again, this is purely theoretical, I do not want to discuss whether or not it is happening, but what you would do in case it will happen in the near future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: How would you hedge against a potential market crash ala 2008 due to Evergrande + GameStop and the overall situation?**\n\n*Since I got downvoted to hell on a different subreddit for even mentioning GME and spreading the word, I will add the theory behind GameStop again, even though most of you might know this already.*\n\n*The theory: The most part of the stock is traded in Dark Pools and all the shorting Hedge Funds are telling us that they closed their position, which is mathematically impossible. Do the research yourself. So, what I think is happening, is that all the shorts are actually synthetic and not real shares. There is tons and tons of proof of it, too much to even deny at this point. They exercise and sell deep ITM calls in order to get the FTDs. So basically, they are passing them from one to another, to another.*\n\n*Think of it like this, a good analogy I found: You get a credit card with 10.000$ on it, max it out and have to repay next month. However, you have endless credit cards, so you can get another credit card and \"pay\" the 10.000$ with that. The debt is still there, its just getting passed. You can do that forever. Now you need more money, so you do this all over again and keep digging the grave deeper and deeper. In this theory, multiple times the float and continuing. In order to stop that, you have to lock the float entirely, which is why everyone is currently directly registering their shares. IF this is true, I do not have to explain the potential outcome. There is simply too much proof as that I can deny that at all.*\n\n*Computershare confirmed this:Quote from their Twitter: \"Shares held directly on the books of US companies through a transfer agent are not held at DTCC. As such, shares are not available to be loaned for any means within the security markets. Computershare is a registered transfer agent &amp; therefore does not lend shares in any capacity\"*\n\n*I need to admit I am a bit disappointed by the negative response from a lot of people, but I would like to keep this open and come back one year later, I will simply take all the downvotes from here. I will still read everything and appreciate any opinion on the topic.*\n\n*Cheers, have a nice week everyone!*",

I have cashed out all my earnings to all in on PSFE because the exact same scenario is happening. I all in in GME at 30 and it rose to 300. I've put my capital in AMC at 3 and it rose to 70. PSFE is the next GME, igaming revenue up 70%, transactional volume up 41%, no pipe is selling but stocks tank to 7 from 19.\n\nRecently I bought in affirm at 60, when it got shorted down from 100, good news happened and it rose 100%. We all want the next AMC and I am quite certain PSFE is the next. It monopolize Canada's igaming market by having a 100% share and 75% share in the US. All of the big betting players are a client of PSFE.\n\nNone of the pipe has sold here, bill foley with 30m shares, dan loeb with 41m shares. Blackrock just bought in at 8.3m shares at $12. This will explode soon.

        "selftext": "I want to highlight one of Citadel's and Susquehanna's recent short plays as new 13F filings indicates they are making a large short play on Tilray (TLRY).\n\nThere's been a few discussions on WSB along with several other Subs on questionable price actions on a number of stocks including TLRY. A good amount of these questionable price actions can be spotted just by looking at the 1-minute to 5-minute price charts with volume. You can see that volume is generally consistent throughout the day but as the price gets closer to a major support price level, sudden extremely large sell orders tend to appear out of nowhere just to push the price through support and then suddenly disappear. I started to notice this issue for TLRY about 2 months ago as it wasn't the case earlier. \n\nI sense that this has to do with short sellers so I started to do a little digging and this is what I have found: \n\n[Yes, Citadel is involved](https://preview.redd.it/5ndscitmpvq71.png?width=1681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1585a48c981e8a67d2651a38e98c85c8fba624bc)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pb2a11dopvq71.png?width=1624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5c88604ec72975d95b17b6aba7534ebd85627b3\n\nAs indicated above, both Citadel and Susquehanna have started taking large short positions in TLRY. Keep in mind that these companies are required to file 13Fs within 45 days of their transactions and as these numbers were only the disclosures in August (Which was when these mini sell volume spikes started), the total short interest amounts could currently be considerably higher. It is also publicly known that institutional short sellers have been reducing their short positions before short interest filing dates and increasing back their short positions after the filing date in order to stay under the radar. Who wants to bet that these guys are actually doing that? \n\nKeep in mind this is also a double edged sword, as they will be more vulnerable to a short squeeze. \n\nI also want to highlight that Bank of America this morning just randomly downgraded CGC (One of Tilray's Top Peers) pushing the entire sector down. This is at the same time when other analysts actually upgraded CGC which makes BOA's rating stand out quite a bit. As you can see BOA above just started to increase its short positions in Tilray in August as well. \n\nIt seems that TLRY is the biggest target in the public cannabis space since it is the most liquid and actually traded on a real American exchange with the largest volume in the space. This is why even though nothing but good news is coming out of Tilray and the cannabis sector overall, the stock goes down on times when it shouldn't. \n\nThese are the people are you are playing against and as we know from stocks like GME or AMC, companies like Citadel just don't play fair.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m sure all of you are aware of the infamous \u201cflamboyance\u201d of the weed industry of the past years\u2026. Most of y\u2019all assumed it was way out bc of US legalizations taking forever\u2026 Y\u2019all went to pursue vanity in other run ups while I built my my kingdom. I have passionately followed the incessant fall in TLRY price since January of 2019\u2026 Since then I have yet to lose any money because I quite simply do not realize losses. In fact all I have done is increase my ever cheaper stock in increasing amounts \ud83d\ude33. Would you look at that. \n\n(Plz skip this) \nWhat have y\u2019all been doing?  AMC can go burn in hell where it belongs for charging 15.00 for popcorn\u2026movie theatres are fun and all but all the big media giants have learned to profit without theatres\u2026. In fact they profit much more\u2026 there will always be demand for theatres\u2026 but now new releases are available on native streaming platforms. \n\nSo yeah idek why I mentioned that\u2026 tbh I may be what you call \u201chigh af\u201d. \ud83d\ude18 But you don\u2019t have to be high to want TLRY stock.. They are the best positioned of any major weed company to profit in the coming years\u2026go check out the TLRY subreddit for the company news and developments since earlier this year\u2026 it has all the info you need. \n\nBasically it boils down to German, then European Legalization. With German election results showing that the SPD (the opposition to merkel) has won, legalization is nearly certain as the vast majority of that part and its supporters are pro legalization\u2026.as is their Green Party who  is most likely to merge with the SPD. (Awesome) this is big bc Germany only has two liscenced operating distributors and the largest one is TLRY\u2026\n\nUS legalizations are just now around the corner and it\u2019s best to be in it earlier.. the price has most likely bottomed out and after earning October 7th that will most likely show strong results we will be set for 20+\n\nThe time is now \u2026\n\n(This post was created with the help of Tornado Of Souls - Megadeth)",

        "selftext": "Do you know about AAPL, the original cult stock?\n\nWell, it\u2019s now the largest company in the world.\n\nThe AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. \n\nDIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant.\n\nLet's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to r/pcmasterrace or other similar places, the cult vibe is relentless and unending. Their only position being: INTC and Epic(private company) bad. AMD, NVDA, Valve daddies good.\n\nAnd look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult!\n\nOf course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE.\n\nCult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical.\n\nI am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC.\n\nAMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.\ud83d\ude02\nINTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction.\n\nBut does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals.\n\nIt\u2019s supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think).\n\nAlso, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevator valuation is highly likely.\n\n\nNow, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything?\nIf the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. \n(I am not saying you shouldn\u2019t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult)\n\nAs long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely.\n\nWith all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter.\n\nTL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults.",

        "selftext": "This probably happens often, but I rarely see any posts about it. You rarely hear from the losers. Since those people probably just stop posting on forums when it happens. So I'm swallowing the pride and posting about my losses. \n\nI started invested January 5 this year as a New Year's resolution. I got Rich Dad Poor dad youtube video recommended to me and didnt realize I had been spending my money on liabilities all this time. I went heavy into SPACs, Cathie Wood stocks, biotech, and I got into AMC due to the \"recovery\" stock trade that was all over CNBC. I somehow didnt have a red day with those stocks for 15 straight days and the turning point was WSB looking at short interest and pumping several stocks late January. And Robinhood shutting off the buy option. I had just started investing and didn't realize at the time that turning off buying pressure meant the stocks would tank. And that was my first blow up. My portfolio dropped 35% in a day. That day was January 28th.\n\nI started following WSB since while my account blew up it seemed their stocks were getting massive gains. So I went all in on weed stocks. And I recovered my losses. But I didnt take profits and I had another blow up on February 10th. My account had another 35% drop. As I was in options and the entire weed sector crashed in premarket. So by the time I could sell it was too late.\n\nWith what I now know I should have had trailing stop losses if I was in momentum stocks but I decided after the weed stock crash to go all in on tech stocks to name some of them CRWD, AAPL, MSFT, CRWD, NET, and SE. It worked for 2 months I had somehow recovered my losses for the third time. Then around the week of 4/20 there started to be inflation panic and those stocks tanked. Stock subs and CNBC were calling tech stocks terrible at the time and after three weeks of constant losses and my account blew up for the third time I sold all my stocks around May 10-13. Which in retrospect was a bottom.\n\n\n\nSo I got back into stocks the following week May 17th. And I stopped following WSB stock picks, did my own DD, and have a diversified portfolio and a Roth IRA with index funds. But Im sick to my stomach since im down still down 40% overall 5 months later. When I gave up on WSB stocks that meant I sold AMC in February which if I had I held that would have recovered all my losses from the May panic sell at the bottom. Now once a month there is FUD that the market is overvalued and there is gonna be a crash on stock subs and CNBC. And im like wtf I already dealt with three crashes that just gets swept under the rug with SPACs, weed stocks, and several small cap stocks losing like 70% of their value since Febuary. It just feels like it is a different market from my first two months and I messed up not taking profits on three occasions. My portfolio would have been up 500% instead im down 60%.",

        "selftext": " So far, I have only covered the possibility of short squeeze of $SDC (see link below in previous post)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pymseb/sdc\\_cost\\_to\\_borrow\\_just\\_picked\\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pymseb/sdc_cost_to_borrow_just_picked_up/)\n\nBut there is something more important than that.\n\nThere are many stocks that show the possibility of a short squeeze,\n\nbut among them, there are reasons why we should focus on $SDC and invest a lot.\n\nAs discussed in the previous post, the data on the short squeeze was the most perfect with $PROG, but the most important reason is the value and potential of the company.\n\nMany institutions hold stocks at an average unit price of $10 or more.\n\nI would like to write an opinion and analysis on why SDC became the target of short selling and why the judgment of short selling is wrong.\n\n==================================\n\n**contents**\n\n1. The Future Value of SmileDirectClub\n2. Issues with SmileDirectClub\n3. Danger\n4. Conclusion and Consideration\n\n==================================\n\n**1. The Future Value of SmileDirectClub**\n\n..**1). Trends for orthodontics (increasing demand)**\n\nBased on the growth of orthodontic-related companies, the demand for orthodontics is growing explosively around the world, and $SDC also has explosive growth potential in this trend.\u200b\n\nLet's take a look at some of the very important companies involved.\n\n....**(1). ALGN (Align Technology)**\n\n$ALGN is in the business of developing, manufacturing and selling orthodontic 3D printers.\n\nIt is amazing to see the growth of this company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cgme1ae094t71.png?width=1234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38e1a65da40402d87932df5be28bead49c928bb6\n\nThe stock price has risen 58527 % from its lowest point ($1.26) to the maximum ($737.45), and is currently at $643.56, up 51076 %.\n\nNumber of shares: 79.01 M\n\nMarket cap: 50803 M $\n\n....**(2). XRAY (Dentsplay Sinora)**\n\n$XRAY is also in the business of developing and selling dental equipment in addition to orthodontic 3D printers.\n\nThe growth rate of this company is also surprising.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xob4n5194t71.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d30b10c2d58957d678859f436b83ce5b798d70c\n\nIt reached the high of $69.54, which is 13120 % higher than the low of $0.53, and is now 10949% higher at $58.03.\n\nNumber of shares: 218.55 M\n\nMarket cap: 12682.46 M $\n\nIn addition to this, the main tickers are\n\n\\* Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC)\n\n\\* 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD)\n\netc., but I'll skip these.\n\nEven dental care/treatment around the world is expensive, so unless you are upper-middle class or higher, you have not been able to straighten your teeth well. In particular, there **were** many negative views on corrections for beauty.\n\nHowever, the explosive growth of orthodontic equipment companies,\n\nSeeing that orthodontic for beauty are now increasingly popular with the young generation in many countries,\n\nDemand for orthodontics has exploded in recent years and is expected to increase in the future.\n\n..**2). the importance of price**\n\nOrthodontic at SDC is generally much cheaper than actual visits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sy97rxb294t71.png?width=631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ee9eecc22555d2309e75ca6a39122f3252f29a4\n\nIn addition, due to the pandemic, masks have become commonplace and the frequency of going out has greatly decreased.\n\nAt this time when people are not showing their teeth, more and more people want to have orthodontic treatment, and SDC has a very strong advantage in this regard.\n\nFor this expensive orthodontic treatment to **become common**, it must not be too burdensome for the middle class to afford.\n\nAnd SDC is one of the most affordable solutions,\n\n**I think SmileDirectClub will lead the way among companies that make orthodontics universal for beauty in the future.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxia739394t71.png?width=1301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=199d252b1f65280620b3bf2f37e6eb325ceb4776\n\nGet a smile with just 3$ per day!\n\n..**3). Sales and operating profit**\n\nLet's look at the change in sales of $SDC.\n\nAnnual Sales Trend\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0f7mte3494t71.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ba5e57a124b05cc5714e50f822fe8bef84d6e15\n\nMonthly Sales Trend\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l1q6orp494t71.png?width=1245&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f956a9c60c70052624836f7a434ea3d1bf391d6\n\nSDC's quarterly sales are doing pretty well. I think this has a big impact on showing good results in marketing as well.\n\nSince this orthodontic treatment is highly likely to become a trend from the young generation, reviews and promotions through SNS will spread very quickly during the transition period when orthodontic treatment becomes common. In fact, SDC can easily find promotional materials on SNS, Youtube, and TV.\n\nPoor operating profit is one of the biggest causes of recent short selling attacks, and in fact, ignorant 'self-proclaimed analysts' cite operating profit as the reason for 'the reason you should not buy SDC'.\n\nBut the reason why the operating profit is currently poor is largely due to the cost of plant expansion, new patent development, and business expansion into new countries.\n\n\\--------------------ref----------------------------\n\nItem 2. Properties\n\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Nashville, Tennessee. We also lease our manufacturing facilities in Antioch, Tennessee and Columbia, Tennessee, where we expect to open a second manufacturing facility. We have 114 SmileShops across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Hong Kong, U.K., Germany, and Singapore all of which are either leased or licensed from our retail partners. Lastly, we lease our facility in San Jose, Costa Rica and our facility in Cartago, Costa Rica. Management believes the terms of the leases are consistent with market standards and were arrived at through arm\u2019s-length negotiation.\n\n( Reference : File number 21907839 , 10-Q, page : 52 )\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the 10-Q filing, the number of manufacturing plants and retail shops are increasing.\n\nIt is an accurate approach to the business core elements of the current SDC.\n\n\\---------------------ref------------------------------\n\nKey Business Metrics\n\nWe review the following key business metrics to evaluate our business performance:\n\nUnique aligner order shipments\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we shipped 374,982 and 453,053 unique aligner orders, respectively. Each unique aligner order shipment represents a single contracted member. We believe that our ability to increase the number of aligner orders shipped is an indicator of our market penetration, growth of our business, consumer interest, and our member conversion.\n\nAverage aligner gross sales price\n\nWe define average gross sales price (\u201cASP\u201d) as gross revenue, before implicit price concession and other variable considerations and exclusive of sales tax, from aligner orders shipped divided by the number of unique aligner orders shipped. We believe ASP is an indicator of the value we provide to our members and our ability to maintain our pricing. Our ASP for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1,797 and $1,771, respectively. Our ASP is less than our standard $1,950 price as a result of discounts offered to select members.\n\n( Reference : File number 21907839 , 10-Q, page : 57 )\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe core business element of SDC presented in 10-Q is to secure a large number of orders, and recently sales are good and capacity is increasing, so operating profit is negative.\n\n..**4). Alabama State Dental Association is so territorial but Fair Trade Commission recognized SDC business.**\n\nSDC was planning to expand into Alabama, but the Alabama Dental Association requested SDC to stop remote/visual orthodontic diagnosis and treatment, and SDC abandoned its expansion plan to Alabama.\n\nHowever, the Fair Trade Commission said that this was an unreasonable request and violated the antitrust law and that SmileDirectClub's business was justified as a result of a 5-0 vote.\n\n[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/alabama-board-dental-examiners-agrees-settle-ftc-charges-it](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/alabama-board-dental-examiners-agrees-settle-ftc-charges-it)\n\nAlabama Board of Dental Examiners Agrees to Settle FTC Charges that It Unreasonably Excluded Lower Cost Online and Teledentistry Providers from Competition\n\nTo settle FTC charges that its actions violated the antitrust laws, the Board of Dental Examiners of Alabama has agreed to stop requiring on-site supervision by licensed dentists of alignment scans of prospective patients\u2019 mouths seeking to address misaligned teeth or gaps between teeth.\n\nSDC is fighting these existing dental associations' territory and regulations,\n\nI sent an inquiry email to SDC regarding these.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q01nub1694t71.png?width=1581&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f132df1bdbf9f2a8d94bee213aa8cf7faa81178a\n\nIn this regard, SDC received a reply that it would deal with it in more detail when it released 3Q earnings.\n\n..**5). $SDC is the only Tele-Dentistry company listed on Nasdaq**\n\nThe link below is a list of US Tele-Dentistry companies, and SmileDirectClub is the only listed company.\n\n[https://www.beckersdental.com/teledentistry/36105-10-teledentistry-companies-to-know.html](https://www.beckersdental.com/teledentistry/36105-10-teledentistry-companies-to-know.html)\n\nThis means that there is no competition for $SDC in the Nasdaq market, there is sufficient liquidity to invest in marketing,\n\nIt is the best company that can monopolize a percentage of the Tele-Dentistry market.\n\n**2. Issues with SmileDirectClub**\n\n..**1). Legal issues with NBC ( CNBC ).**\n\nLast year, SDC filed a $2.85 billion lawsuit alleging that NBC deliberately distorted SDC.\n\n[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/smiledirectclub-sues-nbc-285-billion-1295347/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/smiledirectclub-sues-nbc-285-billion-1295347/)\n\nThe lawsuit is still ongoing. If SDC win, it is possible to secure a huge amount of funds with strong recognition.\n\n..**2). Short-Squeuze play on Reddit**\n\nBased on the content of my previous post about the possibility of short squeeze and the general information above, reports that I was trying to play a short squeeze on Reddit.\n\n[https://twitter.com/KristinaParts/status/1437884294249201669?s=19](https://twitter.com/KristinaParts/status/1437884294249201669?s=19)\n\nGME, AMC, and then SDC, MEMEs started to become popular.\n\n..**3). Analyst raises target price**\n\nBelow is Analyst's upward revision of the $SDC target price (starting price of $5.25 -&gt; target price of $11)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pz36eg/credit\\_suisse\\_analyst\\_matt\\_miksic\\_gives/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pz36eg/credit_suisse_analyst_matt_miksic_gives/)\n\n**3. Danger**\n\nThe short-term risks of SDC are hard to find out now. So let's take a look at three long-term risks.\n\n..**1). Risks from audits after exiting emerging growth companies**\n\nSDC, as an emerging growth company, receives exceptions from audits, and if sales exceed 1.08 B, it will be eliminated from the emerging growth company, and there is a high risk of being attacked by short selling according to financial reporting.\n\nIn fact, according to the investment prospectus of SDC, it is possible to speculate that the current sales are intentionally lowered to some extent because the company intends to take full advantage of the advantages of 'emerging growth companies'. It is a story of the distant future. No need to worry right now.\n\n..**2). Possibility of dilution of Class A common stock by pre-IPO investors**\n\nThe number of issued shares is 118.87 M , the current share price is 6.5 dollars, and the current market capitalization is 773 M $ ( 972 billion won).\n\nThe total number of diluted shares including pre-IPO investor volume (common share B) is 387,61 M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0v6zqi8894t71.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12cad7c7cf680cef8d008bb15a5db1ed0d64f51\n\nReference : 10-Q, page 1\n\nThe lock-up release date for common stock B was released on August 16, 19, 180 days after the submission of S-1.\n\nSo far, a total of 1.2M common stock B has been diluted with common stock A.\n\nClass A change: 104,825,858 -&gt; 118,869,656\n\nClass B change: 281,863,766 -&gt; 269,243,501\n\n**Even after the lockup was lifted, the conversion of common stock B to common stock A was only diluted by 4.5%, a small amount for a year and a half. Moreover, considering the diluted unit price (over $10), the current share price is $6.5, so the possibility of a share price decline due to the dilution of common stock B is very low.**\n\n..**3). Redemption of convertible bonds**\n\nThe convertible bonds issued on February 9, 21st had a conversion rate of 55.3710 shares per 1000$ conversion rate, and were converted to the common share A price of $18.06 per share.\n\nAccording to the contents of convertible bonds, the bill is due on February 1, 26, and from August 1, 25, the issuer of the note can request redemption.\n\nIn addition, according to the will of the company, from February 6, 24, if the stock price at that time is higher than the stock price when the bill was issued, early redemption is possible.\n\nTherefore, the possibility that SDC's common stock A will be diluted due to convertible bonds is a very distant future, and it is not something to be concerned about much at present.\n\n\\------------------------ref---------------------------------\n\nItem 1.01.\n\nEntry into a Material Definitive Agreement.\n\nIndenture and Notes\n\nOn February 9, 2021, SmileDirectClub, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) entered into an indenture (the \u201cIndenture\u201d), between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d), pursuant to which the Company issued $650,000,000 principal amount of the Company's 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The Company has also granted the initial purchasers of the Notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the Notes were first issued, up to an additional $97,500,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes (\u201cOption Notes\u201d). On February 9, 2021, the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase $70,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Option Notes.\n\nThe Notes will be the Company\u2019s senior, unsecured obligations and will be (i) equal in right of payment with the Company\u2019s existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company\u2019s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to the Company\u2019s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including our credit facility and trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\n\nThe Notes will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes will not accrete. The Notes will mature on February 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before August 1, 2025, noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after August 1, 2025, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its Class A common stock, at the Company\u2019s election. The initial conversion rate is 55.3710 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $18.06 per share of Class A common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a \u201cMake-Whole Fundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.\n\nThe Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time, and from time to time, on or after February 6, 2024 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company's Class A common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice. In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.\n\nIf certain corporate events that constitute a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then, then noteholders may require the Company to repurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company\u2019s Class A common stock.\n\n(Reference:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001775625/000110465921016943/tm214449d4\\_8k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001775625/000110465921016943/tm214449d4_8k.htm))\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**4. Conclusions and considerations**\n\n**$SDC This is on the movement, not a moment.**\n\nThe demand for orthodontics is explosively popular all over the world, and SDC is a company that has great advantages. It is also the largest company in the Tele-Dentistry industry and is the only listed company on Nasdaq.\n\nIn view of the move to continuously increase marketing and production capacity,\n\nSDC is a company with great potential to continue increasing its market share by leading the future Online &amp; Tele-Dentistry, and believes that its share price will rise by at least several hundred% in the next few years.\n\nWhen 3Q earnings are announced in November, no one knows whether the short selling will be more aggressive or if the results will exceed expectations and result in an earnings surprise.\n\nThere is one more thing to remember. Long position institutions have already formed strong support at $5, and there has never been any class B dilution near this price range. Therefore, we believe that the current share price is more safe than risky.\n\nIn the short term, there is a high possibility that the stock price will rise quickly due to the pressure on short selling.\n\nIf a squeeze occurs in order to maximize profits (to hold as many shares of $SDC as possible in the long term), as explained in Chapter 3. Risk, there is a factor that will decrease in the long run, so some of them will be forced to sell. , I think it would be good to collect stocks steadily over the long term.\n\nps.

        "selftext": "The stock market has definitely changed over the last year. Corruptions being put to light, borrowed stocks running out of inventory, and shit being thrown in every direction possible. But one thing ive seen the most from WSB since joining are the smoothed brained diaper boys who thought they could come here to make big bucks off of the next big meme. \n\nThese same diaper babies have now been complaining about losing gains because \u201cWSB said $WISH was the way to go and now im down $3k\u201d. If theres one thing that even im able to understand as fresh meat, its that WSB is not a place for financial advice. Its a zoo where the ape pen never gets it\u2019s shit cleaned out, so the retards have nothing better to do than to throw it against the wall.\n\nIf you came here to make big bucks off of the next meme stock, then you should only be looking into $GME and $AMC as those are the meme stocks you came here to make gains on. FUD is a bitch and you\u2019re the slut. You want to invest big into $CLOV because some \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bmade $10k on puts, thats on you. But dont bitch  later because you bought $4k in stocks then lost $3.5k two months after. Thats just the spirit of the thread.\n\nTL;DR: stop soiling yourself, take the diaper off and fling it at the nearest ape to your left.

        "selftext": " \n\nThe covid lockdown has cause a surge in interest for the stock market. Additionally the media coverage on AMC and GME cause a massive surge in users for WSB. This also breed a new toxic community of users that try to take advantage of investors that are still learning the ropes.\n\n**Where can you find these trading gurus?**\n\nTiktok, instagram, youtube and even reddit has a number of so called trading gurus that will try to lure to either their trading platform or discord server\n\n**What's the issue?**\n\nA number of these users will charge a ridiculous monthly or yearly fee to obtain \"signals\" for their plays. What's interesting about these signals is 90% of the time they will be too late to enter when they're posted. Additionally they will also usually never post a loss or simply ignore a stock that doesn't go up.\n\nIt should also be noted that a lot of these guys use paper accounts or photoshop investment pages to show millions in their investment account to lure the idea that they're always right.\n\nThere's servers that will sell bots that post plays and claim its their own when in reality its to have a server that has paying users.\n\n**Why is it bad to follow these guys?**\n\nYes, there can be some plays where you might hit, but it gives a falsified image and view on the market itself. You will not learn the fundamental skills needed and in fact, anyone can be these trading gurus if you understand the technical skills behind measuring a stock based on a chart. Remember everyone is a trading god in a bull market. A majority of these users will either delete everything or run away when a bear market comes.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAs a disclaimer, I am not a investor who is like these guys, but I've been trading enough that I was able to purchase my house, buy a new car and enjoy a better life with the gains, but this is only cause I did my DD and its a bull market.

        "selftext": "There is a stock that closed on Friday at $9.29, that has every chance of being just as big an opportunity. \n\nIt has a CEO that has said you need to be a trillion dollar company to get off the mat. I think that is his goal! They are at the top of their game in a number of product areas. They have suffered in the past from having their hands tied by NDA\u2019s but things are changing and they can now take credit for their own work.\n\nThey have gone from having 1 US office to signing a 10 year lease on a second US office and opening a sales office in Nuremberg in Germany. \n\nTheir board of directors includes a number of staff who have worked at Google and Ford amongst other places. \n\nThey have no debt. At the last earnings call they had $145 million in the bank. \n\nThey have had Microsoft as a customer since 2017 because Microsoft couldn\u2019t make the Hololens without this company\u2019s tech. They have also been crucial in Microsoft winning a $22 billion contract with the US army, and there are likely to be other orders in due course from other armed forces.\n\nThey also have Sharp Foxconn as a customer (you know, the massive company who make iPhones for Apple).\n\nThey have invented tech that is heavily patented that should mean they are a part of any smart glasses that ever become available to buy.\n\nTalking of patents, they have nearly 500 patents.\n\nThey have also created picop projectors that knock spots off the Amazon glow product, and will hopefully get its moment of glory in the near future.\n\nThen we get to the biggest cherry on the biggest cake of all.\n\nThey have spent at least 10 years perfecting best in class automotive LIDAR. They have been working with tier 1/OEM\u2019s and mobility as a service companies for at least a couple of years. They built their product to exceed the spec that manufacturers gave to them. They can double its capability if needed and although it is a very slim profile and only the size of a VHS cassette, the CEO has said they can halve the size if needed! It can be fitted discreetly where your rear view mirror is positioned. It doesn\u2019t negate the stylish appearance of your car, and does not affect its aerodynamics. It means it can even be fitted to convertibles and cars with sun roofs. Initially they planned to produce one luxury LIDAR model, but due to high demand from the prospective customers they have launched 4 versions, the premium model plus a short range, a medium range and a long range ( which can all be used to complement any other systems installed under prior agreements). Their premium version and the long range one have a range of 250 metres. Their LIDAR does not suffer any issues in bright sunshine, it works the same in any weather day or night. It has also been designed to suffer zero interference from any other nearby LiDAR units. It has the highest resolution of any existing LIDAR. The CEO has said they are aiming at a cost under the $1000 mark and that the profit manager is 50%. So that\u2019s a maximum profit of $500 per unit. They have said they envisage maybe 4 units per vehicle. So that\u2019s scope for up to $2000 profit per vehicle. Now we know they have multiple interested companies and it is only a matter of time before orders are placed as they have said the first units can be shipped in this quarter! Let\u2019s take VAG in Germany as an example. They produce 200,000 electric cars per month. Never mind however many petrol or diesel cars. 200,000 at $2000 profit per vehicle is $400,000,000 potential profit per month!!!! That is $4.8 billion per year. For just electric cars in Europe from just one manufacturer!\n\nNow consider how much profit there could be from other manufacturers - Ford, BMW, Bugatti, Renault, Peugeot, Fiat, Ferrari, and then US and Canada and Asian countries.it\u2019s mind blowing how much potential there is for the LIDAR market.\n\nDr Luce recently left a CEO position at Optoflux to become head of sales for Europe and Asia. Ask yourself why someone would take a step down in title. His comment was that he believes this company will take a significant share of the market. \n\nThey showcased their LIDAR at the IAA show in Germany, leaving no doubt they are best in class. Better than any other LIDAR that exists or that is in development.\n\nThey own the patents, they own the hardware and they own the software. They can sell to any company that wants to include this tech in their vehicles.\n\nSo - \n\n*Better than any other LIDAR with highest resolution \n*works in sunlight and nighttime \n*zero interference \n*slim profile and can be even smaller if needed and fitted discretely inside the windscreen\n*cheaper than others\n*Scaleable\n*4 versions to suit all needs\n*units available this quarter\n*made by a team who have proved their pedigree through having Microsoft as their customer for 4 1/2 years.\n\nThe company, in case you haven\u2019t already guessed is Microvision. \n\nFor anyone who is thinking, oh but that was a pump and dump in April. Yes there was hype, as when the A sample was confirmed as being complete rumours did the rounds that Microvision might be bought out. But they weren\u2019t and I don\u2019t think they will be for sale. They are in the strongest place they have ever been and this is finally their time. The world has finally caught up with their tech and is ready to embrace their genius. \n\nNow there will be some who will post negative stuff on this post, I get it. I don\u2019t care. I have enough shares that I and my family will be set for life when this plays out. To anyone who knew what they held, this was never a short term trade, it\u2019s a chance to be in from the start of their success. We don\u2019t know precisely when. But we know it is inevitable that this will soar in the very near future and surpass any pump and dump. But cheers to you all for April as that just led to it being even more shorted than it was before, which will only serve to enhance our profits when those sales orders get announced. There is a very good reason (well millions actually!) why Jeffries included MIcrovision on a list with GameStop and AMC of stocks that they wouldn\u2019t allow people to short. It\u2019s recently taken someone on here over 6 weeks to transfer his 205000 Microvision shares because he suspects his broker hadn\u2019t actually bought his shares and couldn\u2019t quickly buy them. \n\nNow, back to my opening question. If you could turn back time would you want to buy into Google or Amazon or Apple for under $10?\n\nIf so then this is likely to be the closest opportunity like that you will ever get.  Can you afford to not be a part of it? Or will you kick yourself forever, wishing if only\u2026.we can\u2019t turn back the clock for Google or Amazon or Apple, but now is the time to get in on Microvision, and have a tale for your kids or grandkids.\n\nI will happily say I told you so to anyone who doesn\u2019t act on this, when they are dominating the market, which they will.",

        "selftext": "I find it fascinating how anti-BRPM this sub is! \n\nAt the risk of being downvoted to oblivion - I haven't been this excited about a SPAC since CCIV (-400k February checking in woohoo!). \n\nNow it seems there are two major arguments against it:\n\n1 - The valuation is outlandish, the Steelers are worth 3.5B how can these gamer kids be worth 1B!\n\n2 - The revenue projections are completely unrealistic.\n\nBoth are valid arguments, but i hate to see this sub stop there and dismiss it all together. Traditionally, i'd pick apart those two arguments and tell you why they *are* worth the billion and that they'll be able to achieve these monster rev targets by executing on X,Y and Z. However, this is not your granpapi's market anymore and fundamentals (while still obviously a critical component) are not the end all be all. \n\nInvestments need to be looked at with a third lens (beyond value/growth), and we have a number of examples that have proved this to be not only true but wildly profitable. \n\nMaybe this is a stretch, maybe it isn't - but this strikes me as incredibly similar to the Tesla valuation years back. How can a car company that produces a small fraction of the number of vehicles in circulation, be worth more than every other car company combined? They'll never hit their rev projections and how can there possibly be room for any alpha for the investor? Social media platforms were also poo-poo'd for their lack of profitability - but we now all know well that it's the number of active FREE users, the audience size if you will that we value above all. It's not at all unusual for disruptors like this with massive upsides but a tough value argument to face scrutiny at the onset.\n\nBringing it home:\n\n* FaZe is very nearly a cult and a very large cult of impressionable Gen Z / Millennials lead by mega popular, highly visible stars at that. \n   * It's easy to bash crypto and NFT's (trust me i'm right there with you) but this subset of the population has made these industries goliaths, and i believe e-sports is up next. \n      * A quick stat to support without trying to get technical: prize pools for these events are ridiculously huge. We're talking about 35 million dollars for the 'super bowl' winners of a video game tournament DOTA in 2019. This is a number that's increasing notably YoY and represents only a single tournament for a single game for a single year.\n* IF we can agree that e-sports has a serious future, something i think the numbers do without a doubt support (Whether we old pigskin focused fuddy-duddy's like it or not), then this has legs.\n* FaZe clan now represents the only **direct** channel for investors to get a piece of this action, and no Twitch being .00000005% of amazon does not count. \n* This is a new market and success stories have routinely stemmed from untraditional sources.\n   * Discord and twitter furu's instead of TA, WSB / hivemind 'stonks only go up mentality' vs quarterly earnings reports.... dare i say video game superstars w/360 million+ followers vs Jim Cramer?\n   * Meme potential is staggering. Playboy went parabolic for goodness sakes (lol). SPCE, GME, AMC, FAZE? Would shock me if it *didn't* get lumped in with that bunch. \n\nMy point here is this - Faze has more followers than ALL OF THE PGA COMBINED. I'd have trouble understanding how that alone isn't worth more than a B in today's world. There are certainly questions around how they'll translate financial success out of this massive follower-base and so on, but at 11.70 a share, i'm betting on the side that says they do.\n\nI hope you all at least re-examine the business case for it, setting aside traditional notions of value (scary to even type that), and strap in for some good 'ol asymmetric risk with me (and a bunch of preteen fanboys!).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/og6sn25nuvv71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da5871a361108819b78ff95ae7a43505c7b8e07a",

        "selftext": "I know what you\u2019re thinking. The stock is dropping like the mic after a Dave Chapelle special. It\u2019s redder then your wife\u2019s used tampon every month. But here\u2019s why you should get in right now.\n\n# The entire industry is suffering. Buy low, sell high\n\nTheir competitors, Rocket and Loan Depot, are setting new all-time lows on a daily basis.\n\nHome Point is down 69% (lol) from its February high.\n\nUWMC is nearing its all-time low as well.\n\nThe entire industry is depressed far below their true value (except $LDI, they are trash).\n\nThe industry is struggling. But UWMC is, in large part, the reason why.\n\n# What sets UWMC apart\n\nUWMC is not some new tech company that might not make it. They have been around for 30 years. They survived the housing crisis of 2008. They are making a TON of cash, pay a 6% dividend, and are growing volume every quarter.\n\nPeople will always buy houses, and mortgage brokers are their best option. UWMC dominates the wholesale channel with:\n\n1. Fastest closing time\n2. Lowest rates\n3. Growing business, the only major lender to increase volume from Q1 to Q2, and leaked data shows volume exceeded the upper end of guidance for 2021 Q3\n4. New efficiencies in Q3:\n\nStreamlined appraisals in-house, reducing the appraisal time from weeks to days:\n\n[https://www.housingwire.com/articles/uwm-launches-amc-free-appraisal-program/](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/uwm-launches-amc-free-appraisal-program/?amp=1)\n\nLaunched BOLT, new streamlined tool to give approvals in 15 minutes:\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210925005030/en/UWM-Launches-\u201cBOLT\u201d-Giving-Mortgage-Brokers-Tools-to-Achieve-15-Minute-Initial-Approval](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210925005030/en/UWM-Launches-%E2%80%9CBOLT%E2%80%9D-Giving-Mortgage-Brokers-Tools-to-Achieve-15-Minute-Initial-Approval)\n\n# The plan\n\nEarly this year the CEO, Mat Ishbia, initiated a price war to gain market share. He issued an ultimatum that brokers who did business with UWMC could not work with Rocket.\n\nIt\u2019s working: UWMC continues to increase volume at their competitors expense.\n\n**Leaked data shows Q3 loan volume higher than guidance.** They guided $57-62B, but produced $62.9B:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMCShareholders/comments/q50rhh/im\\_just\\_gonna\\_leave\\_this\\_here/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMCShareholders/comments/q50rhh/im_just_gonna_leave_this_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nUWMC had to depress margins with the ultimatum, and grew volume as competitors shrank, detailed here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMCShareholders/comments/p5ht4w/the\\_plan\\_is\\_working/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMCShareholders/comments/p5ht4w/the_plan_is_working/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nWhy would they do this? Because UWMC is so efficient, they can make a profit with razor-thin margins. Their technology sets them apart. They are gaining market share and putting competitors out of business. Once that happens, they can name their price on margins.\n\n# The experts understand\n\nA member of their board bought a ton of shares at $9, just a few months ago. Now it\u2019s under 6.5!\n\n[https://sec.report/CIK/0001841894/Insider-Trades](https://sec.report/CIK/0001841894/Insider-Trades)\n\nPrice target of 12 from Deutche Bank:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qn4vudbi4ns71.png?width=1162&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4909f453593c7509c6e68efeaba7a4f39c78c5e\n\nInstitutional ownership up to 28%\n\n[https://fintel.io/so/us/uwmc](https://fintel.io/so/us/uwmc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$300M share buyback** authorized through 5/2023, enough to buy back half the float at this price\n\n# \n\n# The bear case\n\nWTF is a mortgage broker, nobody wants that. Those middlemen just get in the way. Online is the future!\n\nNope.\n\nBrokers give their clients better rates. And their market share is growing, not shrinking.\n\n[https://www.beamortgagebroker.com/blueprint-blog/2021-mortgage-trends-you-need-to-know](https://www.beamortgagebroker.com/blueprint-blog/2021-mortgage-trends-you-need-to-know)\n\n\u201c1. The independent mortgage broker channel will grow\n\nWhile retail, or direct-to-consumer, mortgage lenders make up roughly 80% of the market share, the wholesale mortgage broker channel has been steadily climbing in the last few years and grown to over 20% share over the past year. As wholesale lenders continue to develop cutting-edge technology with fast turn times and unprecedented levels of support for their broker partners, it\u2019s likely the independent mortgage broker channel will continue to see a significant increase in the next year and beyond.\u201d\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/nonbank-lenders-are-dominating-the-mortgage-market-11624367460](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/nonbank-lenders-are-dominating-the-mortgage-market-11624367460)\n\n\u201cAmericans took out more mortgages than ever before in 2020. Most of them didn\u2019t come from banks.\n\nNonbank mortgage lenders in the U.S. issued 68.1% of all mortgages originated in 2020, up from 58.9% in 2019, according to industry research firm Inside Mortgage Finance. That is their highest market share on record and their biggest yearly gain since 2014.\u201d\n\n# TL;DR\n\nUWMC has been around forever, is growing business in a tough environment, makes a ton of cash and pays a sweet 6% dividend with a $300M share buyback authorized through 5/2023.\n\nIt is rather immune to rising interest rates due to focusing on purchase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Positions or ban\n\n26,730 shares at 7.36\n\n28,000 warrants at 1.01",

        "selftext": " \n\nROOT is the definition of playing the long game which I always said I was playing with ROOT. We do have some upcoming interesting events that could propel it forward in the short to medium termt though. I've summarized below to share with you.\n\nIn the updated $Carvana and $ROOT Commercial Agreement they state that the Product Integration Plan will be completed within 30 days from commencement date which is Oct 1st. If Carvana buying up to 30% of the company for prices up to 6x the current share price doesn't excite you, then I do not know what will! Root issued this 30% in 8 short/long term warrants exercisable at $10-$30/share and up to 129M shares of Class A common stock which represents the 30% of Root ownership fully diluted as of Aug 2021. As we have seen posted many time, there is a strong assumption that an acquisition could take place in the near future.\n\nRoot is aware they need to reduce costs and are doing so both on the selling and general admin cost side but also by using their new tech, i.e. UBI 4.0. Expect to hear about these results soon.\n\nLook I don't know what is going to happen, but Root looks primed for the long term turn around darling backed by Carvana. If we could get a solid retail base it would speed up the increased share price. I'm looking for $27+ which was the IPO price only 1 year ago.\n\n**Possible catalysts:**\n\n**- Technical Analysis**\n\nThis is a 1 year falling wedge pattern lets break it out!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1Y1D Falling Wedge](https://preview.redd.it/4ostsgreq1t71.png?width=1923&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ea8f3587fa2879efac2afbe984b4b5edd0175f1)\n\n1Y1D Falling Wedge\n\n**- Oct 15th Call Expiration**\n\nMassive open interest for expiration this Friday, mainly out of the money though. It looks like it is getting pinned under $5 to have all this expire worthless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Oct Option Chain](https://preview.redd.it/5n666ekgq1t71.png?width=1335&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d26c479061c33a79d61908281c2644c7a8038ef)\n\nOct/Nov Call Option Chain\n\n**- Nov 1st Completion of Product Integration Plan**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Integration Plan](https://preview.redd.it/oiav51vdq1t71.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9772165e28f31c9a6e456336cda617eea6c1f5ac)\n\n**- Nov 4th Carvana Earnings Report**\n\nExpect to hear an update from Carvana on the Root deal.\n\n**- Approx. Nov 15th Root Earnings Report**\n\n\\- Expect to hear about cost benefits resulting from UBI 4.0, projections for the year and hopefully updated cost benefits from the plan in place.\n\n\\- Possible new CFO as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[UBI 4.0 Benefits](https://preview.redd.it/031yv8qhq1t71.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b115aadf97dd83e513678fefa9f5d75966f7415f)\n\n**- When will Shorts start to Cover?**\n\nNo one knows but short interest is over 35% and over 50% of volume in Dark Pool. Similar to AMC and GME lots of Dark Pool trading is occurring. Septeber saw a massive Short Interest increase. We are getting closer but when? Do not know for sure.

Famous last words I know.\n\nAnyway so I was looking into why tesla stock was pumping so hard lately. I know they have been producing more, and tesla vehicles are pretty badass, but it didn't make any sense to me.\n\nEnter DTCC haircut rules starting tomorrow. \n\nFor those of you that don't know, or live under a fucking rock, start paying attention to these rules because they can change alot in the markets. \n\nTLDR on haircuts : they are going to force sell any over leveraged firms stock, AA+ credit ratings at a rate of 5%-35% of their holdings and anything with a lower credit rating is going to be 100% liquidated. \n\nNow that we have that out of the way, \n\nTesla has a credit rating of BBB meaning any over leveraged firm with holdings of tesla are going to have every fucking penny of their tesla holdings liquidated and pumped onto the market.\n\nGuess what firm has a massive position in tesla!? Cmon, you'll never guess! Ahh you there in the back! \n\nUhh, Citadel?\n\nCitadel you say,? Yes, and Susquehanna.God damn you retards are good.\n\nThat's fucking right retards. Citadel and Susquehanna have huge stakes in tesla.... Surely you aren't retarded enough to think that this big tesla move was anything but a fucking pump n dump to get more collateral for what's coming. \n\nThe only thing I can think could help a tesla dump is the new nscc rules about instead of selling all the shares on the market, they take them and give collateral back to the firm at a discounted price. Hopefully for the markets sake this rule would apply here, but if not, TESLA PUTS WILL FUCKING PRINT THESE NEXT FEW WEEKS, also AMC/GME to the moon. :)\n\n\n\nTLDR: TESLA PUTs will print with these new dtcc haircutting rules liquidating any stock with a credit rating under AA+.

        "selftext": " To my fellow WSB investors,\n\nI would like to share with this community a high probability short squeeze set up play to $GME and $AMC based on fundamental and technical rationale. I am constantly monitoring short set up tickers on Fintwit, WSB, etc. (I keep a technical record &amp; alert) as they've gotten popular and I have finally found a set up that is fundamentally sound- meaning high ROI, high probability, and low % of risk. These setups take time and most of the time, a long ass time. This is not a YOLO, HODL, etc. play and I never thought that $GME and $AMC were ever these types of plays. This is key as you are able to average down and hold safely for long term compounded gains.\n\nRoot Insurance ($ROOT) has finally made it to the top of my list as my highest conviction play this year. I've watched and played tickers like $MVIS, $CLOV, and now $SDC (all of these tickers are short term momo plays), but I strongly believe $ROOT is a technical/fundamental stock that emulates $GME/$AMC in the long term. I want to make sure you all understand that one of the main reasons why $GME/$AMC was so successful was because they're both high conviction \"marathon\" plays and not \"sprints\". This is what differentiates $ROOT vs. other ticker plays because it is currently a \"marathon\" play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is a marathon play that will lead to a high probability setup, high ROI, and low risk on investment? You need to have been present and study the fundamentals of $GME/$AMC vs. all other short term tickers that pumped and then dumped. The reasons why $GME/$AMC were successful and why $ROOT is setup to do the same are:\n\n1. High Conviction: The investors need to believe and be confident that they can hold these stocks until their price targets have been met. This is through stocks being fundamentally undervalued, vengeance, high risk/reward, M&amp;A, retail business familiarity (i.e. AMC theatres, Gamestop shop), etc. You need high conviction as when scalpers or hedge funds sell and change the momentum downwards, high conviction investors do not sell but are able to hold (we believe in long term gains).\n2. High Institutional Ownership: As much as $GME/$AMC were shorted by hedge funds, they also had a high % of institutional investors. This is absolutely needed as they are able to hold a significant amount of the total outstanding float over a long period of time. Then this just leaves the shares float and the short float as a percentage of the shares float. i.e. $GME at times had ownership levels greater than 100% which confirmed naked shorting and FTD's taking place by short hedge funds.\n3. High Short Interest: Short Interest needs to be above 25% of the float at the minimum.\n4. Partnership or Benefactor: You need to have a benefactor or partner (high profile) who is willing to create support (large volume entry price) or hard carry/pull the price up if needed, especially on dips. Deepfuckingvalue is the sponsor for $GME and $AMC has Trey/CEO/Mark Cuban, etc.\n5. Fundamentals: Retail was already very familiar with AMC theatres and Gamestop stores. Fundamentals didn't matter as much because the price levels were so low due to Covid depressed demand. However, fundamentals like cash on hand, book value, Price/book value, Price/cash, revenue, net income, earnings, future earnings are all relevant. This is how you are able to determine floor prices or value for companies, future price targets, gauge risk vs. reward, compare similar industry companies to one another, etc.\n6. Technicals: $GME/$AMC were marathon plays and the squeeze didn't happen overnight (90% preparation/10% execution). What we noticed was high volatility in buying/selling, but every single dip was being bought- this created higher conviction holders day after day which reduced the amount of share float to be traded which created less of the float to be able to be shorted significantly. The short ladder attacks was also challenging to overcome, but we overcame it over time. Over a period of time, less and less shares were available to be shorted and we also noticed higher failure to delivers (FTD's) in which hedge funds were not returning borrowed shares (i.e. naked shorting). WSB caught this and made hedge funds pay. ITM/OTM call options were also being bought heavily which meant the shorts had to delta hedge or make sure they had the shares available in case the call expired ITM.\n\n[$AMC\\/$GME Squeeze Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/aa7kcvn8sft71.png?width=1019&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b19fb4e4cf800cdbd2d477ec5d20095452608fd8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$AMC FTD](https://preview.redd.it/zmqx4i1jsft71.png?width=991&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bd529f4f1ed5db964d84756a24564f4909f929f)\n\n7. Hooke's Law: \"*The force exerted on a spring is directly proportional to the distance it moves as a result of the force*.\" Just like how a highly compressed spring works, overtime the amount of compression/tension that was applied to the spring released and caused the greatest of short squeezes. The more time it takes to compress a spring, the farther it will jump.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**To my fellow WSB investors, now for the explanation on $ROOT (I'm taking this information from other sources on WSB as well).**\n\nRoot is a 6 year old car insurance tech company that uses telematics (collecting locational data and machine learning to make decisions) to decide which drivers they would like to insure/not insure. The more data they gather, the better decisions they'll be making to improve their loss ratio (profitability from charging premiums vs. paying out money which is an insurer's business model). Getting approval is difficult and it's state by state but they're approved in 32 States now. They also have an enterprise division which is the tech/telematics division of the company and is able to offer software as a service (SaaS). They are supplying their data to fleet management companies as well as other insurers which is another revenue stream.\n\nRoot had their IPO in late 2020 at $27/share and a $6.7B market cap. As of 10/8, they closed at $5/share (-81.4%) and $1.27B market cap. Per Finviz, their sales are $260M/yr, net income of $-500M/yr, book/share value of 3.06, price/book of 1.63, cash/share value of 3.76, and price/share value of 1.33. The net income is negative due to the high OpEx (operational expenditure on marketing, etc.). Fundamentally based on the amount of cash they have ($1.0B), they are undervalued based on their P/B and P/C compared to other insur-tech companies. They also have 249M total shares outstanding, 97M shares float, and a short float % of 34% although their most recent Fintel/FINRA Dark Pool Short Volume is 53%. Per Yahoo finance, Root has 75% of the float held by institutions at/above $11/share! These institutions like Silver Lake Group and Tiger Global are technology based institutions (they know what they're doing investing in tech). With Root currently being #4 in highest shorted stocks, their FTD's also confirm that they're continuously being shorted. June/July/August 2021 had the highest amount of FTD's (naked shorting) with the highest being over 3M ($20M) shares at one time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$ROOT Fundamentals](https://preview.redd.it/oeq3j4vlsft71.png?width=703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c6246e932cf4464d7c991765f80d374310915e9)\n\n[Fintel\\/FINRA Dark Pool Short Volume at 53&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/6pgx9tjdoft71.png?width=1777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a775605c9c7bcfd06fcc94098e2f59d7215eca85)\n\n[Yahoo Finance Major Institutional Investor Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/dupk2o4hoft71.png?width=1352&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb446a9a105bf3c3324c3bbeb0d61c85036bf171)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Shares Failed to Deliver \\(From Fintel\\)](https://preview.redd.it/2o4eun8rsft71.png?width=1781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc20905552f868da77299e7f9a6380c265430118)\n\nAs of 10/12/21, Carvana has confirmed investing $126M at $9/share (SEC Form 3- exercisable at any time and no expiration) for 11% equity (increased from 5%) in the business + a 5 year commercial partnership. Root has also issued 8 short/long term warrants exercisable at $10-$30/share and up to 129M shares of Class A common stock which represents 30% of Root ownership. As WSB already pointed out, this is a strong assumption that an acquisition could take place in the near future. I consider Carvana to be Root's benefactor. Their latest catalyst on 10/12/21 also included a 7% overall investment of outstanding shares by Schusterman Interests.\n\nTechnicals are self explanatory on this 1 year 1 day chart. This is a 1 year falling wedge pattern (beautiful!) with an RSI at 30-35 and an imminent breakout. You cannot get a chart as beautiful/predictable as this. Volume is also very important as of mid August, a lot of buyers have been stepping in (high conviction) on this value play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1Y1D $ROOT Falling Wedge w\\/confirmed breakout](https://preview.redd.it/38z2j0kpoft71.png?width=1909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c4f88e8f75ca410fe338bca13f65d061cee962c)\n\nThe option chain for OCT is very bullish as there are 46K call options expiring on 10/15. There is a high uncertainty that these options will expire worthless as hedge funds pin the price to collect the premiums that are high IV. If the share price is able to go above $7.5 by 10/15, this alone would be a catalyst for a short squeeze setup. But again, uncertain probability and you need to manage risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Oct Call Option Chain](https://preview.redd.it/tlel14owsft71.png?width=1350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b16f6614496e497e81e3ca657b68b569f077069)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Position: I currently have 1,870 shares at an avg. price of $6.35.

The reasoning is due to high conviction long term holders, high institutional ownership (75% of float) at an average price &gt;$11/share, high short interest at 35% and 52% on dark pool data, benefactor/partnership with Carvana where an M&amp;A above 30% equity is possible, fundamentally undervalued based on price/book of 1.66 and price/cash of 1.33, technically on a yearly falling wedge/imminent breakout setup, and Hooke's Law where this setup is a highly compressed loaded spring.

        "selftext": "# This post will dive into one of the most important concepts in options trading.\n\n# Understanding this concept will change the way you think about options trading (for the better). The concept is called volatility.\n\nAs an option trader, you are expressing a view on volatility... some know this and others don't :P\n\nBecause options expire, we now have be aware not just of what direction the stock will move, but *by how much* it will move in a given time period.\n\nNote: you can find the previous parts of this series on my profile.\n\nIf you have questions about this post, please leave a comment and I will get back to you.\n\nLet's get started!!\n\n# Example 1: Comparing 2 stocks.\n\nLets say we are looking at $AMC and $KO (Coca Cola), and we want to compare how each of these stocks moves over a 3 day period.\n\nIf we look at KO, this is a company that has been around for a long time. We understand how much money they make, how they make it, what their future revenue is likely to be, etc.. So on a day to day basis, we shouldn't expect massive swings in the stock price.\n\nPerhaps on day 1 we see the stock move +1%, then -1% on day 2, and then +2% on day 3.\n\nBut what if we looked at AMC?\n\nFrom what we know about AMC, it moves a lot. It could move up 10% 1 day, down 15% the next day and the back up 20% on the third day!\n\nThinking about these two stocks. It's should be clear that KO is much more stable than AMC. There is a lot less risk on KO than AMC.\n\n# So, which of these stocks do you think would have more costly options?\n\nThe reason AMC options would be more pricey relative to $KO is because there is more *risk* that AMC moves a lot. Remember, the options market tries to price what is going to happen in the future.. Since it is a lot more probable that AMC moves 10% tomorrow than Coca Cola, *the options of AMC imply more future big move risk than the options for KO.*\n\n**The simple way to put this would be:** ***AMC is more volatile than KO.***\n\nIf both stocks were trading at $100 per share, we would expected a $100 strike call option on AMC to be much more expensive, since there's a higher chance of it having a bigger move. Remember! In a trade, there is a buyer and a seller.\n\nSo if that option on AMC was only like $2, we would all want to buy them, and no one would want to sell them, so the price would go up (supply and demand).\n\n# So why do we care about volatility?\n\nIt's the factor that the market looks at to determine how much the options should be trading for.\n\nMost retail traders are *price insensitive* in the options space. They are more focused on the *exposure* the options give them, rather than the cost of the option. But as we move through this lesson.. really start to think about the value of options. If we can go out and find an option trading for $10 that is really worth $5, we've found a really good trade. So let's try to tie everything here back to *the value of options.*\n\n# Checkpoint summary 1:\n\n1. Volatility is simply the size of the move for a given stock.\n2. The a big factor in the price of options is how volatile the market thinks a stock will be in the future\n3. Since volatility is a big part of how the market prices options, we can say that the option prices *imply future volatility*.\n4. volatility is not direction. fundamentally it is the size of the moves, not the direction the stock goes.\n5. If you are trading options, you are trading volatility. Understanding volatility is an important part of understanding how to trade options.\n\n# The 3 Circles of Volatility\n\nNow that we understand (in general) what volatility is, we need to understand that there are *different forms of volatility* that impact every single stock. To explain this, theres a demonstration made by Predicting Alpha that explains it really well. It's called the **3 circles of volatility**.\n\n# There are 3 forms of volatility that impact any given stock.\n\n1. The first form of volatility is called **market volatility**.\n\nThe market has volatility. All of the stocks we can look at exist within the market. Let's say the market crashes. All of the stocks that we are looking at would also take a huge hit. The market overhands all of the stocks we look at, and what happens to the overall market impacts all of the stocks.\n\n[All stocks exist within the market, and are therefore subject to what happens to the market.](https://preview.redd.it/cbppljlin1t71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b0ded0cb0d5b558f3008f4a1efe67f9f7482d17)\n\n2) The second form of volatility is called **non-event volatility**\n\nLet's say we zoomed in and looked at one stock in particular. We would find another form of volatility called *non-event volatility.* Non event volatility is the movement of a stock on its regular day to day. How has the company been doing? Does it move on average 1% a day? or 10% a day? For example, $KO is going to have less non event volatility than $AMC. Different stocks move different amounts regularly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Each stock has its unique day to day movement, specific to the trading around that company.](https://preview.redd.it/4147qqrbm1t71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84e86d5ee4777cb3f564d2578916a5afcfadfbcd)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) The third form of volatility is called **event volatility**\n\nIf we zoom in a bit further, we see that within each company there are key events that drive big movement in the share price. Earnings events, product releases, drug approvals, etc. Company events introduce new information into the market, leading to \"jumps\" in share price that we typically wouldn't see. Because of this, events can drive short bursts of high volatility for a stock.\n\n[Within the regular movement of a stock, there are big events that drive short bursts of rapid stock movement.](https://preview.redd.it/emm3b69am1t71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2291be9a53ffa643efa9a93703aa698600456551)\n\nBy taking these 3 forms of volatility into consideration, we are able to understand what's causing the stock to move, or impacting the price of the options.\n\nFor example, If the stock market crashes, it will overshadow the non-event volatility of a company. Even though the stock maybe moves only 1% a day on average, a market crash could cause it to move a lot more.\n\nFor another example, When GME was moving like crazy over the last few months, event volatility around their earnings releases was almost the same as non-event volatility, almost as if no \"event impact\" was being priced in.\n\n# Relating it back to options\n\nLet's say we are looking at an option expiring in 30 days. Taking into consideration the 3 forms of volatility, the market is going to try to determine how much the stock is likely to move over the next 30 days.\n\nIf the stocks trading at $100 and the at-money call and put are each going for $5 (5% of the share price), we can add them up and see that the \"range\" the market implies (the at-the-money straddle) is $10 in price, or 10% of the share price.\n\nThis tells us that the market thinks the stock will move up or down 10% in the next 30 days. The option prices are reflecting the *market implied volatility*.\n\nLet's say in the middle of those 30 days there is an earnings event. We can now says that the market volatility , non event volatility AND event volatility are all a part of the \"10% up or down\" that the market is baking into the price of the options.\n\n[All 3 forms of volatility are impacting this option. Can you think of how the event volatility can skew our view on the time period?](https://preview.redd.it/o1enqjj8m1t71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55e6e9fc6f3a8526c23bbdcb7051cd6a18b89d76)\n\nWhy is this important? Well, if we know there is an earnings event in the middle of that time period, we can use the 3 circles to think that *a lot of the 10% move the market is implying might happen on that 1 day, and we will see very small moves on the other 29 days.* We can use some analytics tools to try to separate the event and non event volatility to understand if this is the case, which is really useful for selling options and knowing *exactly what you are selling.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[We can extract the event volatility from the non-event\\/market volatility. This helps us understand how much the market is implying for the event, and how the value of options will change after the event passes.](https://preview.redd.it/o8rck0o6m1t71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2e27dde1e3bb5669d9aec66f27bf95ddab48f0c)\n\nThe picture above shows the term structure for DAL and how much earnings event volatility is priced into the different DTEs (earnings is this week).\n\n# A cool thing about the 3 circles of volatility is that we can isolate which one we want to trade\n\nDepending on what you think is mispriced, you can isolate one of the forms of volatility. For example, If you just want to trade an earnings event, you can structure your trade to remove a lot of market and non-event volatility!\n\nMore on this in a future post where we talk about earnings trading.\n\n# Checkpoint summary 2:\n\n1. There are 3 forms of volatility that impact a stock. Market volatility, non-event volatility, and event volatility.\n2. Market volatility is like the \"tide that rises and lows all ships\", non-event volatility is the day to day movement of a stock, and event volatility is a short burst of big movements caused by new information coming into the market (earnings, product releases, etc).\n3. The option price reflects the impact of each of these 3 forms of volatility within the days to expiration of the option.\n4. We can isolate different forms of volatility depending on what we want to trade.\n\n# Implied VS Realized Volatility.\n\nImagine you are at a horse-racing track, and you want to place a bet on the next race.\n\nYou take a look at the odds, and see that the horse named Seabiscuit has 4:1 odds on it coming first place. Nice! The market is saying that you only need to risk 1 to make 4 if Seabiscuit comes in first. You do some math, and you think that theres a 50% chance he will come in first (market is implying about a 25% chance) and decide it's a good bet. So you place your bet.\n\nThen the race starts, and even though he was off to a good start, Seabiscuit ends up coming in 4th place. Damn.\n\nWhen you went to place the bet, the market gave you a bet you could choose to take. The market was *implying a certain likelihood of that horse winning*.\n\nThen the race started , and the *realized outcome,* or what actually ended up happening was that Seabiscuit lost the race.\n\nThis is like what happens in the options space..\n\n**Implied volatility** is how much the market *thinks* the stock will move in the future.\n\n**Realized volatility** is *how much the stock actually ends up moving.*\n\n# How does the market determine implied volatility?\n\nThe basic way to think about this, is that the market participants look at the 3 circles of volatility and make an opinion about how much each of them will impact the stock between now and the option's expiration. The market consensus on each form of volatilities impact will then become the *market implied volatility*.\n\nIf the stock moves more than what was implied, the buyer makes money.. If the stock moves less than what is implied, the seller makes money (there is nuance to this, but for this lesson we are keeping it simple).\n\n**note**: There are tools out there that help you graph and analyze the difference between implied and realized volatility. You can get some basic charts in most brokerages. My preferred tool is Predicting Alpha Terminal which allows me to do some unreal analysis.\n\nFor example, here's the IV/RV ratios for $KO and $AMC.\n\n[There are tons of analytics specific to volatility. The insights help us understand the value of options better, and therefore make more money trading.](https://preview.redd.it/kovfuu04m1t71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b3afacbcd6bdb598d3c39ed1e6061096986e011)\n\nIt's pretty cool. This shows us the gap between the implied and realized volatility for each of those companies on the same graph. Looks like they have both steadied out to a similar spread.\n\n# Checkpoint summary 3:\n\n1. Implied volatility is how much the market thinks the stock will move in the future\n2. realized volatility is how much the stock actually ends up moving\n3. If we have a different opinion from the market, and we end up being closed to what the stock \"realizes\" , we should make money.\n\n# OK so we understand the \"bet the market presents us with\" (implied volatility), and \"what actually ends up happening\" (realized volatility), but how do we know what side of the trade to be on?\n\nYou remember in the horse racing example how we said that you think the odds of Seabiscuit winning are 50%, but the market is implying a 25% chance? This is an extremely important part of the example.\n\nThe reason it is so important, is because *that is why you took the bet!*\n\nThink about it. If you agree with the bookie on his odds and likelihood of winning, why would you take the bet? You know that he skews the odds a bit in his favor (revisit my post on expected value if you need to), so taking that bet would have negative expectancy.\n\n# The reason we took the trade is because our forecast for the race was different from the market.\n\n# We do the same thing in the option market.\n\nThe market presents us with options priced at a particular implied volatility level. *Our job is to come up with our own forecast of future volatility.*\n\nYou can think of your \"forecast\" as your opinion on things. If the market thinks a stock isn't going to move a lot, but you think it will, options are cheap. If the market is implying that the stock will move more than you think it actually will, options are expensive.\n\nIf we can develop a really solid forecast of future volatility, options trading becomes pretty straight forward. Now of course, if it were easy to do we would all have matching lambos already. But this is the fun of trading, the better opinions you can develop, and the better you can express those opinions, the more money you should make.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n*\"Gold slips away from the person who invests gold into purposes through which they are not familiar\"*\n\nThat is a quote from a book called The Richest Man in Babylon that often comes to mind when I see traders getting into trades without understanding the product and space they are participating in.\n\nTo be honest, a lot of times it's this lack of familiarity that can drive inefficiencies that more sophisticated traders profit from.\n\nLet's keep in mind that options are volatility products. Let's strive to learn more about how these products are priced and how to create good views of the future. There is plenty of opportunity for retail traders to make money, but it all starts by understanding the product we trade, and how to trade it.\n\nIf you have questions, please leave them in the comments below and I will do my best to get back to everyone.\n\n# In my next post, I will dive into how to isolate event volatility for earnings trades, and how I have been able to make a living trading earnings events as a primary strategy.\n\nHappy trading everyone.\n\n\\~AG",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI did put a lot of research into the current situation for quite some time and finally build a portfolio I am 100% behind long-term. However, the more I learned, the more sure I am that we will experience a market crash rather soon, than late.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is the issue: If I pull out all of my cash right now, potential Hyperinflation, which I think will be upcoming, will burn through my cash. If not, the market might crash and a good chunk of certificates might be of no value anymore. I currently have 5x leveraged K.O. Long certificates on Apple, MSFT, Biontech and Alibaba with a small amount of money (in total around 15% of my entire portfolio are derivatives), the rest are pure shares. I expected all of them to perform decent in times of hyperinflation, since they can easily adjust their prices to counteract high inflation and institutions will stick to them anyways. Ofcourse, more reasons than that. However, my biggest asset is the Vanguard FTSE All World ETF with around 25% of my total portfolio. How can I expect this ETF to move if the USA and China collapse? If those collapse, Europe might be next.  \n\n\nNow, the catch. I did so much research, learned constantly and came to the conclusion, which I am not here to debate whether or not you think is true, that we might see something like 2008 all over again. The theory behind it would assume that GameStop is the current best hedge and to some degree AMC as well, even heard that from the highs up from a bank when I talked to my bank guy, which is incredibly weird. I should mention, I am from Germany, so things are not as heated here.\n\nAnother hedge and long term hold can not be mentioned in this sub, but you might guess what it is. Sadly, we cant debate this here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, in case of this scenario, I would like to get everyone's opinion on this. I want to be clear, I value every single opinion and would love the most input possible. In order to get knocked out, the stocks mentioned above would need to fall 20% in total. In case of no crash, they would be my go to investments, ontop of a few other non mentioned with the same principal. Again, this is purely theoretical, I do not want to discuss whether or not it is happening, but what you would do in case it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: How would you hedge against a potential market crash ala 2008 due to Evergrande and Gamestop, or just generally if you are not familiar with the topics.",

        "selftext": "# This post explains what skew is and gives 2 examples of how to trade it. \n\n# If you understand skew it will help you understand why options are being priced the way they are. \n\nIt opens many doors for trading opportunities.\n\nSkew is used to infer the implied distribution of the stock in the future. One thing to remember is that options are based on the future distribution of a stock. \n\n# Before we jump into it.. we first we need to understand some of the basics. \n\n**Take a look at the Graph below**. \n\nIt is a chart that shows how often different returns happen for a stock. What do we notice about it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[X axis is daily returns for a stock. Y axis is how frequently that daily return occurs.](https://preview.redd.it/kttyf87qcfu71.png?width=536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70ee691eac662d2709a514fe8dff94eedccc6bab)\n\nWe can see that the *most frequent* return is 0%, and the likelihood of a big move up **or** down is even (same frequency of a 5% up move vs a 5% down move). We call this a \"normal distribution\".\n\nIf we looked at a stocks returns over the last year and saw that it was normally distributed, what conclusions could we draw? Well, we could say that :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Most of the time the stock will move about 0%\n2. There is an equal chance of a large up move and a large down move\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEasy right? But here's the thing..\n\n# Stock returns do not typically look like this. \n\nYou ever hear the saying: \"***Stocks go up like an escalator, and down like an elevator****?*\"\n\nI'm sure most of us have heard that one before. What is this telling us? It tells us that stocks tend to go up slowly, and then crash down quickly.\n\nOR...\n\n***Most of the time, we see a small move up in stocks. Occasionally, we see a large move down.***\n\nBecause of this, the distribution of a stocks returns aren't typically normally distributed. The look more like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[X axis is daily returns for a stock. Y axis is how frequently that daily return occurs.](https://preview.redd.it/fouttvv0dfu71.png?width=776&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9c73eec534f093e7a6f55a1c6f8be3e4539859b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe can see on the graph above that most of the time we have frequent small up moves,  and infrequent large down moves. The top of the line is slightly to the right of 0, and the left side of the graph is a bit more elevated than the right side. \n\nSince this is how a typical stocks returns look, what conclusions can we draw?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The most frequent daily return for a stock is a small up move. \n2. Big down moves happen with more frequency than a big up move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**As we can see, the distribution is** ***skewed.***\n\nA skew in a distribution is when one of the tails is longer than the other. If we look at graph above we can see that the tail on the left is skewed. This is known as a negative skew since it has a long tail in the negative direction. \n\nIf the big positive moves had more frequency than the big negative moves, we would call it a positive skew.\n\n# An interesting question..\n\n*Given this is the typical distribution for a stock returns, and knowing that options are used to make a bet on the future volatility of a stock, how would we expect options to be priced, puts vs calls?* \n\n(Remember, options try to price the future distribution for a stocks returns).\n\n# An even more interesting answer..\n\n*We would expect to see puts more expensive than the calls on equities because* ***the risk is to the downside****.* \n\nLet's break this down. \n\nSkew is the difference in implied volatilities between the out of the money puts relative to the out of the money calls. **It shows us where the demand/supply is located on the chain.** \n\nFor example:\n\nOn a $90 stock you might see something like the $100 call is trading at 40% but the $80 put is trading 60%. \n\nWhat this is telling us is that the *put options are more expensive than the call options*. \n\n**Most people who are long equity look to hedge their exposure to a crash by buying puts, so you would typically see high demand for puts with relatively low supply.** \n\n# This makes sense right? Let's think about the S&amp;P500 options for a second. \n\nThe whole world is basically long equity. So where do they go to hedge? Typically Pension funds and the like will be buying puts or writing calls on something like the S&amp;P500. This creates huge demand on the put side, and lots of supply on the call side. \n\nThe odds are we have small moves upwards, but if there\u2019s going to be a blowout, it will likely be to the downside. Protection, or exposure to that, costs money!\n\n# This difference in price for calls and puts is what we call skew.\n\nLooking at the skew tells us 2 main things\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. What direction the market thinks the most likely move is\n2. What direction the market thinks the big move risk is\n\nThe key word here is that skew tells us the ***market implied*** likelihood of different moves.\n\nThis is important to note because the way we make big bucks as traders is by identifying areas we disagree with the market and trading them accordingly.\n\nIt is important to understand what the market thinks is going to happen so you can compare that with your view on the market. \n\n# Let's pull up the skew for SPY so we can see what it actually looks like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Skew for SPY 19\\/10\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/zoyl48bqtfu71.png?width=1796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dbcd190e020957a89e2e155467544c115f0a7a4)\n\nBasically, on the X axis we have the call deltas, and on the Y axis we have implied volatility. \n\nor in simpler terms\n\n*The left side is OTM Calls, the middle is ATM calls/puts, the right side is OTM Puts.*\n\nnote: Some softwares will plot it the other way around. \n\nBy visualizing this, we can quickly see how the different portions of the option chain are priced relative to each other. \n\nAs we can see, the OTM Puts are higher than the OTM Calls. This is what we would refer to as  \"put skew\".\n\nThis is what we would typically see for a stock. \n\nOnce again, this is because they typically make small frequent moves to the upside, and then large infrequent moves to the downside.\n\n# Does a stock's skew always look like this?\n\nThe market is alive, so things change. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Market conditions change\n* Stocks have big news releases\n* Insiders know about a buyout before it happens\n* WSB tries to squeeze a stock\n* A big court case is about to get settled\n* A new drug is awaiting approval for a pharmaceutical company\n\n# Depending on how different variables in the market change, the skew changes to reflect what the market expects to happen in the future. \n\nIf a stock gets squeezed and jumps up 100%, what is the skew most likely to look like? \n\nWe can take a guess by answering the following two questions:\n\n1. What is the most likely move in the future?\n2. Where is the risk in the future?\n\nIn the case of these meme stocks that get squeezed, the most likely thing to happen is that it moves down a bit. The **risk** is that it keeps moving up by a huge amount. So the skew might look something like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMC 30DTE Skew 03\\/03\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/i0x4k6g0xfu71.png?width=1798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c228c5a61658cf727ce465f47d8b364406833faf)\n\nAs you can see, on AMC, the skew was heavily to the call side! But is it always like this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Green line is AMC 30dte skew in November 2020. Blue line is AMC 30dte Skew in March 2021](https://preview.redd.it/kcumzu8gxfu71.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd005f9c8694088c96325731acefe3f5622bf438)\n\nHere is a prime example of the skew changing! Before the whole meme stock craze, AMC had a lot of put skew. This makes sense, because the *risk* was that the stock would go down a lot. \n\nBut after it started squeezing, things changed.  The risk was now that it moons! So the options market changed to reflect this. \n\n**The OTM Calls went from being cheaper than the OTM puts, to being more expensive!**\n\n# Over time, the skew changes to reflect the market's view of what could happen to a stock between now and the expiration you are looking at.\n\nYep, each expiration has it's own skew. This is because we are looking *across the strikes, and every expiration has its own strikes!* I know, it can be a bit confusing.. but once you wrap your head around the concept of skew you will be able to understand the market a whole lot better. \n\n# How can we take advantage of the skew? \n\nThere are so many different ways to trade the skew. Risk reversals, spreads, selling or buying options.. \n\nIn short, we can trade the skew when we disagree with it.\n\nHere are 2 example of how we can trade the skew (there are more, but here's two):\n\n# 1) We can trade a change in the skew\n\nHere is a time series of the 30 day skew for TSLA:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TSLA 30dte skew over last 30 days. the higher the number, the more put skew. The lower the number, the more call skew. 0 would be flat skew.](https://preview.redd.it/ksluqgzwfgu71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1e8d9d670af85cbffc944207b95076434cb8928)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat can we see? We can see that TSLA put skew got REALLY steep last week. The highest it's been in 2 years. We could have taken a trade here that bet on it coming back down to a more typical level. \n\nThe optimal trade here would have been a **risk reversal**, since it would have made money on the skew coming back down AND on the positive deltas!\n\n# How to find trades like this: \n\nThe first thing you will want to do is scan for stocks that have elevated skew. You can use filters like Skew Rank (It's like IV rank, but for skew) or just \"Skew\".\n\nThen I will look at the skew time series (like the picture above) and use that to help me gauge what the change has been relative to what we see in the past. \n\nFrom there, I will look at the skew for different expirations to see where it is most out of line. \n\nOnce you have found a stock where the skew has changed drastically (to the upside or the downside), the second thing you do is ask yourself the question: **why is it happening?**\n\nIf we can understand why, we can then determine the *rationality* behind it. Are people overly hyped about something? Is there too much fear right now? \n\nIf we think the market is overreacting to something (or under reacting), we can put on a trade like this!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2) We can take advantage of the skew to get a high R:R trade\n\nSomething I like to do is trade unbalanced flys into steep call skew. It's basically the best lotto tickets you can get in the market.\n\n**Check this out:**\n\nI did a scan today for stocks with expensive call skew. COIN came up on my radar. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dgqecqodcgu71.png?width=1966&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6961bd31ca032a679eb6b2e78fcff6d889bec569\n\nHere's what I saw:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Relative to historic skew, it is now the most skewed to the call side that it has ever been!](https://preview.redd.it/pholjik88gu71.png?width=1392&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=332efa99760705008c98f5e38e4fe0a656876c2e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Looking at a few different expirations, it seems the skew is steepest in the near dated options \\(green line\\).](https://preview.redd.it/y4gjejlscgu71.png?width=686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=153c248fae06db969afa5f7590807646449dde4a)\n\nCOIN skew is at the highest call skew it has seen!\n\nThis is pretty crazy, the market is pricing in a lot of risk to the upside here.\n\nNow let's say I am bullish on COIN. I think it will rally another 5% in the coming week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3oidaexc8gu71.png?width=1848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0447f3005107637ead3a895cb4e940a1accd37c0\n\nWhat we did here was trade a 1-3-2 fly *into* the call skew. \n\n**We are paying $65 per fly, with a max payout of $935 each!**\n\nWe bought a call at-the-money, and financed it by selling 3 out-the-money calls! We then went even further out and bought 2 as a hedge, giving us this nice risk defined trade. \n\nThese are my favourite little YOLOs. Low risk, super high reward. \n\nI like to do them around earnings especially, and sometimes you can find wild trades like this one!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSkew just shows us the balance in supply/demand for calls and puts. Are people more hungry for calls? Or more hungry for puts? \n\nWhen we can understand this, a lot of doors open. But remember this: Knowing skew isn't an edge. It's just a feature of the options market that we need to understand if we want to be able to understand what we are seeing and create better ideas of our own. \n\n# Skew helps us see what is actually happening. And by understanding why it's happening, we can uncover some great trading opportunities.",

        "selftext": "### The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week \u2013** **SPY** was higher by about 1.6% (or $7.40) last week, more than the 1% move options were pricing.\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are again pricing about a 1% move (or just less than $5 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY just under **$460** that corresponds to just above **$464** on the upside and around **$455** on the downside.\n\n**Implied Volatility** \u2013 The VIX ended Friday around 16.20, up slightly from the week before. The VIX remains below its historical average entering this week.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\nOptions are pricing similar market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs:\n\n* SPY **1%**\n* QQQ **1.5%**\n* IWM **1.7%**\n* DIA **1.1%**\n\nAs an example of how the 1% expected move translates into strike selections, here\u2019s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $455 and $464 to see Max Gain:\n\n## In the News\n\nThe FDA gave to go-ahead for a lower dose Covid vaccine from Pfizer (PFE) for ages 5-12. Moderna (MRNA) announced that the FDA needed more time to review its vaccine for the same age group. Both companies report earnings this week. Options are pricing about a 7% move this week and roughly a 13% move for the next month in Moderna.\n\n### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings\n\nThe *expected moves* below are for this Friday and link to the Options AI Calendar which is free to use. *Recent moves* on prior earnings start with the most recent quarter. The expected move is extremely useful for strike selection on debit and credit spreads and a gut check on existing positions. Stocks tend to stay at or within their expected move around 70% of the time and implied vol goes lower following earnings, in most cases. Therefore the expected move gives a general sense of what options are pricing for moves needed for debit options and what a stock needs to stay within for credit options trades. In other words, if the stock moves less than the EM, options were overpriced, and if more, options were underpriced.\n\nTuesday\n\n**AMC** AMC / [Expected Move: **10.2%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/AMC) / Recent moves: -6%, +6%, +4%\n\n**Zillow** Z / [Expected Move: **8.5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/Z) / Recent moves: -8%, -6%, +18%\n\n**Activision Blizzard** ATVI / [Expected Move: **4.8%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ATVI) / Recent moves: +2%, +2%, +10%\n\nWednesday\n\n**Roku** ROKU / [Expected Move: **7.7%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ROKU) / Recent moves: -4%, +12%, +3%\n\n**Qualcomm** QCOM / [Expected Move: **4.5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/QCOM) / Recent moves: +6%, +5%, -9%\n\n**Fastly** FSLY / [Expected Move: **11.7%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/FSLY) / Recent moves: -10%, -27%, -15%\n\n**Etsy** ETSY / [Expected Move: **8.5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ETSY) / Recent moves: -10%, -15%, +12%\n\nThursday\n\n**Moderna**\u00a0MRNA / [Expected Move: **6.7%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/MRNA) / Recent moves: -1%, -1%, +2%\n\n**Square** SQ / [Expected Move: **4.5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/SQ) / Recent moves: -2%, +4%, -8%\n\n**Pinterest** PINS / [Expected Move: **9.1%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/PINS) / Recent moves: -18%, -15%, +5%\n\n**Uber**\u00a0UBER / [Expected Move: **7%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/UBER) / Recent moves: +3%, -9%, -4%\n\n**AirBNB** ABNB / [Expected Move: **6.2%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ABNB) / Recent moves: +1%, +4%, +13%\n\n**Peloton**\u00a0PTON / [Expected Move: **8.2%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/PTON) / Recent moves: -9%, 0%, -6%\n\n**Cloudfare** NET / [Expected Move: **9.8%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/NET) / Recent moves: -2%, +4%, -6%\n\nFriday\n\n**DraftKings** DKNG / [Expected Move: **6.4%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/DKNG) / Recent moves: +6%, +4%",

And the weaklings are paperhanding.\n\nThat's why it's important to buy shares and to hold. And if you want to buy options buy ITM so it's harder for hedgies to manipulate the stock.\n\nSo the CTB has been dropping slightly but remains elevated. Not to worry. Why you say? Because the exact same thing happened to AMC back in May when the CTB jumped to 82% and tapered back down to 6%. And do you chimps remember what happened? $AMC skyrocketed 500% within a couple of weeks. And the short interest then was only 21% of the float.\n\nLet me share some charts so you can see the striking similarities:\n\n$AMC back in May:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$AMC back in May](https://preview.redd.it/exrolnqopps71.png?width=1029&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb0eb18d724f48564c6e48d423adc155d82e0625)\n\n**$SDC on Friday:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$SDC consolidating](https://preview.redd.it/t9dind8upps71.png?width=1029&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8d158f4c84e42d2e0a7a7cbc4a04c0110eeb895)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou see the striking similarity between the W formation and how it's starting to consolidate now around $7?\n\nNow let me show you what happened to to $AMC even when the CTB fell as sharply as it rose:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$AMC after spike in CTB](https://preview.redd.it/6bovz7hzpps71.png?width=1029&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec98f24244149749e2bd8374f0434b3b6fecff5e)\n\nAnd here is where I see $SDC in the next few weeks:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$SDC to the moon](https://preview.redd.it/nimyvsg1qps71.png?width=1029&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6ea8ac304b4802b071aa253d1f8b900376cc22c)\n\nFriday is when the new shorts where supposed to report closing 9/30/21 which I suspect will put SI of float even higher than 35%. If you look at how much shorting activity took place on 9/20/21 after we tested $7 compared to previous days, it's substantially more.\n\nThis price is critical and the hedgies are sweating their pants off hoping that you retards are going to paperhand this shit down so they can make the payment on their yachts.\n\nThe gameplan is to hold and buy shares and ITM calls.

        "selftext": "After rising to 53 USD, AMC has been trending down for the past three weeks. Each week, the price fell less than in the previous one, a clear loss of selling momentum. It looks like this week, a bullish hammer pattern on the weekly could be forming. \n\nStronger than expected box office numbers, combined with high hopes for upcoming movie releases like the latest James Bond and Matrix titles to achieve new post pandemic box office records, are making it difficult for the sellers to increase their positions. \n\nThese things are reflected in price action, which seems to indicate quite clearly that sellers are exhausted.  \n\n\n**TLDR at the bottom**  \n\n\n**Price action:**  \nIn the chart below we can see the loss of momentum to the downside in smaller candle bodies, an indicated rounded bottom as well as declining volume. Price currently sits on top of key support as well, indicated by the red line:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l6gh88ujd3s71.png?width=1377&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e893a8de2c39f46e26e621d33ad54455627a3a0\n\n**RSI**\n\nRSI is on key support, every time it thouched that support, a rally followed:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3vwmzy6f3s71.png?width=1388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c4665797ec18e1b5fd74fa9ef03fbe6a7e15761\n\n**MACD**  \nThe MACD has made a double bottom which could possible transform into a bullish divergence if price keeps downtrending. It reflects the loss of bearish momentum and therefore, it is very likely that it will turn any day from here on out (light red candle, possibly tomorrow or monday)  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ngsvi92qg3s71.png?width=1387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de0821ff2d983479a008743cc056e069e937b6b2\n\n**TLDR**\n\nBearish momentum has considerably slowed and this might be a good possibility for dip buyers like me to catch the next rally. My entries are:\n\nLong: above 39.50 with target 50\n\nShort: I usually include long and short positions in my technical analysis, but in this case I will not open any short positions until we see a correction to the upside. AMC has been trending down for a while now, and it is not the right time to short here in my opinion.",

        "selftext": "What up, nerds? Long time no post. I come bearing gifts of knowledge. Whatever you do with that knowledge is up to you.\n\n**THE KNOWLEDGE:**\n\n**$HOOD** is getting primed for a massive short squeeze. All the much-touted WSB metrics are lining up -- and this time they exist in **reality**, and not simply in the minds of inexperienced market newbies experiencing cognitive dissonance when their stock fails to squeeze for the 6th month in a row, and who are puzzled by terms like \"reverse repo\" but are emboldened by rocket emojis and new accounts sporting the \"diamond hands snoo\" avatars. Whew, a lot to unpack there. Anyway, come with me on this journey. Let's do a dive.\n\n**What is $HOOD?**\n\nWe all know about Robinhood, but do we *really*? Everyone knows they shut down trading of GME, AMC, and a bunch of other meme stocks back in January. But did you know that Robinhood was one of at least [**18 different brokers**](https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/l6uur7/payne_sounds_off_on_wall_st_over_gamestop_all_of/gl34eks/?context=3) that shut down trading of these stocks? WSB \"fan favourite\" SOFI is even on that list. Many of you probably didn't know that! That's because Robinhood was set up by the big boys with big bucks to be the fall guy.\n\n**Think about it:**\n\n* Why else would all of these other brokers shutting down trades be memory-holed?\n* Why would none of these other brokers be summoned by Congress to explain their role in shutting down trading?\n* Why would Robinhood &amp; Vlad not publicize the fact that over a DOZEN other brokers did the exact same thing?\n\nThis begs the question -- why would Robinhood accept its \"fall guy\" status? Logically, because they would get something in return.\n\nFast forward to today.\n\n**$HOOD primed for a squeeze**\n\nLet's look at some very basic metrics that indicate $HOOD has huge squeeze potential:\n\n[https://fintel.io/ss/us/hood](https://fintel.io/ss/us/hood)\n\n**Short share availability:** 0. There are no shares available to short. This limits downward pressure.\n\n**Short borrow rate:** 175%. If rates stay the same and the stock price stays the same for the next year, theoretically you could make 175% from lending out your shares. In reality, some brokers split evenly these gains with their clients. For example, if you trade with Interactive Brokers, that means that, if the stock stayed in $40 for the next year and borrow rates stayed the same, you'd make $35 per share. This is another positive catalyst because people shorting the stock would actually have to pay $70 per year per share in interest fees, making it as expensive as a high-class Luxembourgeois hooker to hold this stock. They'd be paying **$70 a year in hopes that the stock drops a few dollars** (because, realistically, there's no way it will go to $0 within a year). It doesn't take a wrinkled brain to see that that investment is FUCKED.\n\n**Days to cover:** 6.7. At current trading volume, it would take almost 7 days for shorts to close their positions. That means that, if the stock starts to pump, the pressure will build exponentially on the stock's price as more and more volume comes in and moves the share price higher.\n\n**Fails to deliver:** I personally think this metric is bullshit, but a lot of newbie autists see castles in these tea leaves, so I've included it anyway. 1 million FTDs yesterday. 8 million over the past week. Something something rocket emoji diamond emoji.\n\n**Options premiums:** Options are hilariously mispriced. Call options are just about 1/3 the value of put options. In other words, it's 3x more expensive to bet that the stock is going to the downside on an already hilariously overcrowded trade than it is to bet that it will go up. Recall that downside is limited while upside is theoretically infinite. Math moment:  \u221e &gt; 40\n\n\"*But, moron who made a horrendously terrible bet on HYLN,\"* you say, *\"doesn't all of this just indicate that people think $HOOD is a piece of shit stock and is really just going to tank?\"*\n\nWell, my ruthless friend with eidetic memory, that *could* be the case, however...\n\n**Consolidation:** For the past month and a bit, HOOD has been touching tips, meat logging, docking, whatever you kids call it nowadays, with $40. Big buys keep coming in at this level. In fact, there was a 250k buy on the 5m candle today.\n\n**Call sweeps:** Large purchases of call options expiring over the next month are being purchased. Huge purchases of call sweeps are what caused AMC to spike a few months ago. People with big money could be betting that AMC is going to fly. Or they could be purchasing cheap insurance to protect themselves if HOOD really does squeeze. Either scenario indicates a squeeze is not a distant probability.\n\n**Earnings:** Robinhood has earnings coming up in October. This is going to be a hell of a catalyst, one way or another. Either the stock flies like RKT did in March 2021, when it doubled in price over a couple of days. Or it could sink like RKT did in March 2021, when it almost halved in price over a couple of days. Hell, it could even do both, like RKT did in March 2021! The market is a fickle mistress, my friends. One thing I find unlikely is that hedge funds will keep their short uncovered heading into earnings.\n\n**Logic:** The early investors who all came together to rescue HOOD from their liquidity crisis via cash infusions -- what do you think THEY'RE getting from that deal? Do you think these bankers and fund managers saved Robinhood from the kindness of their hearts? No, Robinhood raised capital by selling them shares, but these guys have to get something out of it too. Let's see, they collaborated before to shut down trading of meme stocks... I wonder what could happen next...\n\nNow, IMO all of these factors combine to make a squeeze extremely likely, but nothing is guaranteed. Let's take a quick look at the bearish arguments:\n\n**Bear talk**\n\n**1. \"Robinhood is evil and I'm not going to buy their shares, and neither is anyone else\"**\n\nHonestly, and this might be an unpopular opinion, but I truly could not give less of a dick about the immoral shit-doings of a company I own stock in. My baby-dick coin purse isn't going to affect geopolitics, or un-fuck the SEC, or suddenly spawn a spine in the backs of US lawmakers. Sure, Vlad is a dingdong, Robinhood gamifies gambling, and the company shut down the buy button (along with MANY other brokers, as I pointed out, although I will concede that Robinhood held out longer than others). That's all beside the point. Why? Well, I don't know about you, but I'm in this bitch to make money, not to make some hackeneyed fucking social commentary.\n\n**2. SEC recently granted permission to early investors to sell shares**\n\n[This](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-early-investors-granted-sec-144753648.html) is a more legitimate concern IMO. When these shares unlock, these early investors could create downward pressure on the stock if they start selling. This would give shorts more fuel while simultaneously sending the share price lower. Still, my experience in the market is that bad news like this is priced in at the very last minute.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, do you think these early investors will want to sell HIGH or will they want to sell LOW? I anticipate they will do anything to pump the share price before these shares unlock, dumping their bags on shorts that got caught with their pants down. And the perfect catalyst is right around the corner: **earnings**. As I mentioned, there could be a run up to earnings as shorts seek to limit risk by closing before earnings; the stock could pump post-earnings and incredible results -- whatever it is, these early investors can only sell ***after*** earnings, and even then, they can't sell all of their shares -- (not that I think they would even if they could). You think these early investors -- the hedge funds and financiers that helped rescue Robinhood from their liquidity crisis -- do you think they're going to sit around with their nuts in their hands and watch the stock price plummet leading up to the date they're allowed to sell? No way. They're going to pump that mother fucker for as much as it's worth, and then about ten times more. Hell, they might even ask Robinhood to disable the \"Sell\" button. After all, there's precedent for it now!\n\n**3. Payment-for-order-flow will be banned!!!!! Robinhood will lose a ton of their revenue!!!!!!!**\n\nNo it won't. Robinhood was able to pull billions from a hat recently. You think one of the hottest fintech companies is going to go tits up after such a large and high-profile cash infusion? Fucking **LOL**. PFOF is here to stay, and there's plenty of articles online about why that's the case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there you have it, the bullish and the bearish. If anyone has any valid counterpoints, I welcome them with open arms in the comments. Knowledge is money, and dissenting opinions shouldn't be downvoted and reviled simply because they disagree with you. Keep your eyes peeled in the comments section for angry people who post false or inflammatory information. Let's get this bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr: Robinhood ticks all the boxes for a short squeeze, and I don't give a fuck about your tin-pot market commentary.**\n\nDisclaimer: This post represents opinions, not advice. I'm long on the stock via shares and options.\n\nedit: Lot of people throwing shade via downvotes. Get in the comments and make a fucking point or stay salty.",

        "selftext": "RDBX (formerly SGAM) is debuting today and I believe it represents a strong investment opportunity. Most people seem to be excited about the small float (2M shares), but that's only part of the story. The most exciting thing to me is that at $10, it's valued at a forward P/E of 2.3 and has a brand awareness that rivals that most well-known brands in the world.\n\n**Redbox's Financials and 2.3 P/E**\n\nHere are Redbox's financials:  [https://imgur.com/DtQRLFU](https://imgur.com/DtQRLFU) \n\n||2019|2020|2021|2022|2023| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Rev ($M)|829|546|400|906|1112| |Ebitda ($M)|196|114|40|193|237| |New Movies in Theaters|140|69|59|140|140|\n\nAt $10, Redbox is valued at a market cap of $447M and enterprise value of $693M. In 2019, they generated a revenue of $829M and EBITDA of $196M (83% of that being FCF). In 2020 and 2021, the revenue dropped to $546M and $400M, with EBITDA at $114M and $40M respectively. Most people will assume that 2020/2021 dropped because Redbox suddenly fell out of favor, but the actual explanation is that the number of new movies released in 2020/21 were dramatically less than in normal years due to COVID. The average person on Reddit probably has super-fast internet, but there are many rural places in the US that don't have access to fast-internet and rely on Redbox for lag-free movie consumption. Additionally, Redbox's rentals are priced at $2 whereas the equivalent digital rental would be $6, making it a strong option for value-shoppers. \n\nLook at this graph to see how closely their legacy business (physical rentals) revenue tracks with the number of new movie releases per year: [https://imgur.com/a/uAVc0Lz](https://imgur.com/a/uAVc0Lz)\n\nIn 2019 there were 140 new movies, 2020 there were 68 new movies, 2021 there were 59 new movies, and in 2022 it is expected to return to a normal level of 140 new movies. \n\n**Redbox's Brand Exposure**\n\nJust about everyone knows Redbox and has positive feelings associated with the brand (cheap family movie nights). This is backed up by the fact that they have 40 million loyalty members, 43 million app downloads with a 4.8 rating, and 40,000 kiosks (more locations than Starbucks and McDonalds combined). \n\nTheir brand awareness makes me think that this will do on despac, as having a well-known brand is key to generating retail interest as we are well aware with companies like GME, AMC, and even recently WeWork and infamously, DWAC. Throwing out GME and AMC may sound like a pump, but the similarities are undeniable with Redbox having a movie rental disc business that is perceived to be dying. Redbox's profitability and valuation are way more attractive than GME and AMC ever did though even at their lowest points. \n\n**Pivot to Digital**\n\nRedbox's fast-growing digital business by itself would likely justify its entire valuation if it was any other SPAC. In 2019, their digital business had $20M rev, 2020 had $40M rev, and $2021 is expected to have $55M. Their 40 million loyalty members represent people that are late tech adopters, and so they have a promising opportunity to capitalize on a large segment of people that have not been already captured by other apps. Furthermore, Redbox is trying to make the experience simple for them, by combining various streaming apps/services into their one Redbox digital platform. This way, users don't have to download and sign into many different apps to see all of the available content. \n\nDisclosure: holding 50k warrants and 2k commons, not investment financial advice\n\nFurther references:\n\n[Investor Presentation](https://seaportglobalacquisition.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Redbox-Seaport-Global-Investor-Presentation-September-2021.pdf)\n\n[Investor Webcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWZq-LAXb8k)",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nSup everyone. You know how we all love Jpow? Because he just prints infinite amounts of $$$, even though common sense would tell ~~most~~ a few of us that money is logically a finite thing. But since this is not the group to be told what to do by some nerd called \"common sense\", I thought it would be wise to introduce to you: Amyris (AMRS). Pay attention.\n\n**What is Amyris?**\n\nhey- super glad you asked. let's start with a concept called ***'Synthetic Biology'.***\n\nSynthetic Biology is basically this: creating things in a lab that are already found in nature, that make things work. Something made to imitate a natural product. You can also redesign those things in order to give them new superpowers, to be useful in medicine, agriculture, etc..\n\nEnter Amyris.\n\nFormed in 2003, Amyris was given a grant by the Bill and Lafawnda Gates Foundation to create a molecule to treat Malaria. I've had malaria, and my only memory of it is crawling around the little hut I was staying in, looking for a gun to shoot myself in delirium while having uncontrollable diarrhea and puking at the same time, until I finally passed out from not being able to stop puking long enough to breath. I passed out in a pool of my own poo and puke, and about drowned as a result. Anyway, nasty little parasite.\n\nBy engineering the genetics of yeast strains and fermenting hem in sugarcane syrup, they pioneered the ability to convert basic plant sugars into new, useful molecules. To date they have created and have protection over 13 molecules that function for a wide span of uses.\n\n**So why should I care about some nerdy superfarmed molecules??**\n\nI seriously don't even know why I am going through the effort of creating this DD for a bunch of degenerates that are just going to pile what should be child-support money into 0dte FD's for Game-theater anyway.\n\nOk- so these molecules can actually solve a ton of problems.\n\n* Microorganisms can be harnessed for bioremediation to clean pollutants from water, soil, and air\n* Rice can be modified to produce bet-carotene, which prevents vitamin A deficiency (Vit. A deficiency make millions of kids go blind and die every year)\n* Yeast can be engineered to produce rose-oil for perfumes (more sustainable substitute for real roses)\n\nAs I previously mentioned, AMRS has commercialized 13 molecules to date, that benefit a large span of products, making what is scarce, very much not scarce.\n\nOne for example is SQUALENE, (also SQUALANE).\n\nSqualane is an ingredient that is derived from squalene- a natural substance that is found in people, animals, and some plants. Squalane is then used as an ingredient for skin care products like anti-aging cream, lip gloss, sunscreen, etc.. but the primary source of extracting it is by killing sharks. Millions and millions of sharks. Amyris leverages its synthetic biology platform to engineer and ferment yeast with sugarcane to create sugarcane-derived squalane sustainably to replace the shark-derived ingredient, saving more than 2 million sharks per year. Oh, and squalene is also used in something else that is very important and applicable right now.... COVID VACCINES. AMRS saves about 3 million sharks per year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[sad shark do do do do do ](https://preview.redd.it/s3e22wma94s71.jpg?width=217&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a89e9f2308d6bb93fce67687e2817c8c2b33130)\n\nAnother cool thing they produce is Cannabigerol (CBG), a cannabinoid that is the precursor of CBD and THC. Like CBD, CBG does not produce a high, but has therapeutic benefits, and is also used in skin-care and cosmetic products. They make this through yeast fermentation, with is less costly than extracting the compound from plants. Sales of this will begin this year, and I know so many of you are excited for some beer-weed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cannabinoid, made by yeast fermentation](https://preview.redd.it/koog4ixc94s71.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be9b73090e8069520ffe1ab1286b077402c75955)\n\nAMRS provides these various molecules to thousands of different companies around the world, including L'oreal, Natura, Sumitomo, Estee Lauder, etc... It's ingredients are already in products in more than 3000 global brands, reaching millions and millions of people.\n\nAMRS also has its own brands, some of the main ones are:\n\n1. Purecane-*zero cal sweetener made from sugarcane*\n2. Biossance- *Skin care products sold direct-to-consumer through Sephora and other retailers. Reese Freaking Witherspoon is mixed in with this somehow as well.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Don't confuse her for being bearish](https://preview.redd.it/gt9motnk94s71.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c424feb81f363c7024ab3a6181f3339bafb5f4ee)\n\n3. Pipette- *Baby skin-care products*\n\n4. Ecofabulous- *another beauty company with sustainable eco-friendly packaging*\n\n**Good hell, this is the most boring DD I have ever read, why should I buy the stupid stock??**\n\nI seriously hate you.\n\nAlright, I'm going to start making this more to the point. No one is going to read this anyway. Here are some fun bullet points.\n\n* John Doerr is the mega-investor and controlling shareholder in this. He also back Google and Amazon in their infancy. He has been acquiring more and more lately. Good sign.\n* Sales have been increasing biggly YOY. Revenue was just over $343 million for the last 12 months before their last earning call, but the CEO expect 2 billion in sales, and $600 million in profits by 2025\n* CEO (John Melo) announced \" we expect our consumer business to keep doubling every year for the foreseeable future.\n* They have another 18 molecules in the pipeline, each expecting to generate $100 million in revenue per year\n* Also growing through a ton of acquisitions of beauty product companies.\n* big bull pennant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A chart about something](https://preview.redd.it/draaad5q94s71.png?width=178&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bc38f8c621f01b8e5e274d61b79f9c0f050a56b)\n\n**Ok, things that I don't like**\n\n* Cash flow is negative- I never like this. But, it has been making enormous gains YOY\n* They keep issuing shares. I don't like this, but it seems to be a turn-on for AMC apes\n* It has taken a lot of years for all of their products to come to fruition.\n* Their main competitor Ginkgo has been getting a lot of attention lately, and Aunt Cathie is super giddy about them. I'm actually not too worried about this. Ginkgo has a crazy valuation right now, but is going to come back down to earth the same way that AMRS did a long time ago.\n\nAMRS is much more stable now, and is finally in a position to capitalize on their creations. 2022 should be an enormous year for them with these products and partners finally pulling in revenue after many years of lab work. Kinkgo is basically where AMRS was 10 years ago, but with less stuff.\n\nPositions: Just short of 1000 shares @ $12.35. Wanting to do some more research before I add more.\n\n**TLDR:** AMRS synthetic molecules are seeping into all of beauty-care products, vaccines, and are finally positioned to explode in revenue growth, with analyst predicting a potential 4-bagger within the next 18 months.",

        "selftext": "Noticed many meme stock technical breakouts are lining up - just like every time they go on a huge run. Going to drop the charts with brief summaries as there are quite a few of them. \n\nStarting with everybody's favorite:\n\n# $GME\n\n[$GME 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/rnh3m6vcggu71.png?width=2326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c72c02d2093ba1d4e551e201b69ec655516b96c)\n\nFor more on this one see this post I made not too long ago - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q63x0d/gme\\_unbiased\\_ta\\_another\\_nice\\_setup\\_in\\_the\\_works/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q63x0d/gme_unbiased_ta_another_nice_setup_in_the_works/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nWe broke that setup I posted and are on our way to those targets. Key resistance coming up.\n\n# $AMC\n\n[$AMC 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/9o4i0rfhggu71.png?width=2326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e2394aa8854e7e95c979e73d7d5a56b9d4a057c)\n\nBroke a little **broadening descending wedge** of it's own and is running towards the same key resistance. It's sitting around **45.60**. Clear that, and **49.40** is next, followed by **65.01**. Invalid under **39.30** support.\n\n# $RKT\n\n[$RKT 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/cgb5qdeoggu71.png?width=2326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a99b5d7ced50b83f79d3333edc9099a9e1b72add)\n\nBroke a key downtrend and is headed toward it's first resistance at **18.04.** Above that is **21.65.** Invalid under **16.48** support.\n\n# $BB\n\n[$BB 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/1yegnonuggu71.png?width=2326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4343140ee6882d9800af8c522fc8655c4243a11)\n\nBroke two important trendlines, back tested one of them yesterday - and took off today.

Wouldn't call it a falling wedge because it extended so far down from the up move it came from. Just means don't look for far price targets. Coiling between **9.46** and **8.63.** Invalid between the lower level, but above can see **12.67.** After that (unlikely) **14.53.**\n\n\\---\n\n*Use these as roadmaps, not absolute predictions*\n\n*Not Financial Advice*",

        "selftext": "In this post we're going to check on all of our favorite meme stonks and see if they've got anything left in the tank from a technical analysis standpoint. Come one and come all and hear my tale, whether you're a distraught bagholder ape or someone looking to get in on what I believe may be the final moonshot. Not a financial advisor blah blah blah you know the thing.\n\nFirst off, none of these plays work without Meme Stonk Frenzy Round 3. We had Round 1 late January with GME being the big runner, round 2 early June with AMC melting faces, and while this doesn't make Round 3 a sure thing, I'd like to think retail isn't dead, the shorts haven't covered, and with Tesla being overbought as hell and the Trump Pump near a conclusion, money will flow back into the fucking MEMES.\n\n[The Big Triangle Thingy You've Probably Seen 1,000 Times Already](https://preview.redd.it/7wz09ua0vvv71.jpg?width=1841&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29b78952cc21ea41be357476a63d691169d2ddf7)\n\nAh yes. The fan favorite. I often wonder if u/TheRoaringKitty has secretly cashed in his tendies and escaped all this madness, but then I remember he's not a paper handed bitch, as I'm sure all of you aren't either. Either way, the GME saga could be coming to a massive close in the form of one last big move. Having briefly just broken below the 200 day simple moving average yesterday and bouncing back well, a break to the upside could make everything right in the world once again and bring GME back near 300 territory. A break and hold below the 200 MA is a possible sign of more downside to come. I have to admit the risk to reward here is juicy and am looking to fire up a few 200C  Jan 2022 and will add more upon confirmation of a breakout  of this massive triangle to 300 and beyond. Green line I have there is around 250 where it may be wise to take profits as the hedgies will try to short ladder attack as the perevious resistance of 240ish is broken. Oh yeah and the yellow line is beginning of 2022 so if we don't get a move by then we're prob fucked imo.\n\nGME TLDR: hold 200 MA, breakout top of triangle, then moon.\n\n[Another Triangle Thingy but Not Quite as Big](https://preview.redd.it/d28ufb91yvv71.jpg?width=1829&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc047671ee092bccd4412db8eeb2a0c5ee12c3bb)\n\nAnd now for the second meme that has become many apes meme stonk of choice. This guy has been coiling for a while since the absolute monster rip and like GME could be primed for another move. Sitting at the bottom of our nicely developing trendline, this is another great risk to reward opportunity. 50 would be a take profit zone as the shorts will look to hold it down there at previous resistance but hey, we know you apes aren't selling for that cheap. Red line could be a stop loss for those of you with wrinklier brains at about 32. 200 MA is catching up but not really a factor like GME. Break of 50 MA could easily fuel us to break the wedge and then to 50 and beyond.\n\nAMC TLDR: hold lower trendline, break top of triangle, then moon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Different Triangle Thingy Already Broken to Upside](https://preview.redd.it/16y3bd712wv71.jpg?width=1833&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3aa8314e63d9eac4c37e89f296758ce13e1c98a)\n\nDon't think I forgot about the meme stonk little brother, BB. This was to many not nearly on the same level as GME or AMC, but my how the tables have turned. This meme has actually gotten a LOT of good news (not going to include here but check it out) and many consider it to be more a fundamental play than meme at this point. But don't let them fool you, BB will be there aboard the rocket ship too when Round 3 begins. Already broke our wedge with nice volume a few days ago and has pulled back nicely to the 200 MA. Hold of this and a break above that blue dotted line near 12.25 should get us back to 15+ in no time.\n\nTLDR: Hold 200 MA, break 12.25, then moon.\n\nThese are just the big 3 I've seen upside in, but I'm sure there's many more memes to be had. Be fully prepared to lose all the money you put in as an options play, but if you go stocks then you can control your risk a lot better. Don't take this as real financial advise, as I'm just a fellow retard looking to be ready for Meme Frenzy Round 3.",

        "selftext": "I'm sure you've all seen the headlines over the past week or so about rising bond yields, and I'm honestly surprised that the majority of investors I've talked to don't know how this affects their stock allocations. They read about the rising bond yields and how that hurts growth stocks, but the articles never dive into exactly why this happens. I felt compelled to write this post because I found out my mother put the majority of her 401K into QQQ, ARKK, and ARKG back in July. The recent downwards move in these names has her spooked, and on the phone she mentioned she has no idea why these ETFs (ARKK and ARKG in particular) are going down more than the rest of the market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo preface this post, this is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor. But I have been investing my own money for the better part of the past two decades and have seen long term success. I've learned a lot from my friends who work in the industry over the years so hopefully I can shed some light on how institutions, the ones driving the market, operate. I commonly rotate my investments based on what I've learned and macroeconomic variables in order to achieve a more optimal strategic positioning in the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, onto rising bond yields. This site lets you see the yields for notes of various maturities: [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield). All of the bond yields have risen this past week, but the one of particular concern is the yield on the 2 YR treasury note. It hasn't been this high since March 2020, and analysts are projecting it will rise even higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis move was fueled by fears of more persistent inflation, the upcoming taper that will begin after the November Fed meeting, and the prospect of rate hikes coming sooner than originally anticipated.  The Fed isn't alone either. Central Banks all around the world have signaled plans to tighten monetary policy: the BoE for example [https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691](https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691), Brazil (except no one really cares about Brazil) [https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike](https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike), and countries in the Eurozone [https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH](https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFed officials at the most recent meeting moved up their expectations for a rate hike in 2022 and increased the number of rate hikes expected in 2023 ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/)). If inflation continues to persist, which is likely due to strong demand-pull and supply-side constraints like the disruptions we're seeing in Southeast Asia due to Covid, then we'll see these rate hike expectations move forward even more. A higher federal funds rate results in higher bond yields.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe market digested this information from last week and it is now being priced into the market. So why do growth stocks get hammered more than the rest of the market when bond yields rise? Even today, for October 1st, the NASDAQ rose 0.65% while the S&amp;P 500 rose a whopping 1.23%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason is because of how companies are fundamentally valued. After all, the market isn't a casino, even though it can seem like it at times. Shout out to GME and AMC. So what does a company's stock price really represent? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFundamentally, a company's stock price represents the present value of its future cash flows. This valuation method is commonly used in the industry and is known as a discounted cash flow (read [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) if you want to expand on this even more but I'll summarize). Basically, how do you calculate the **present** value of **future** cash flows? You take those future cash flows and you *discount* them by the risk free rate, often represented by bond yields. The reason we do this discounting is because that future cash flow is worth less BECAUSE it happens in the future. That money, if available in the present, could have generated the risk free rate each year. \n\nLet's look at an example to see how discounting works. Let us assume stock A is expected to produce cash flow of $100 in 2022, $200 in 2023, and $500 in 2024 and the risk free rate is 1%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.01 + $200/(1.01)\\^2 + $500/(1.01)\\^3 = $780\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut what happens if the risk free rate increases to 2%?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen we get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.02 + $200/(1.02)\\^2 + $500/(1.02)\\^3 = $761\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe key takeaway from this is that rising bond yields mean future cash flows will be worth less at present. The reason growth stocks get so hammered on moves in bond yields is because the majority of their cash flow comes in the future, and that's why they can be valued so richly when bond yields are at record lows (like through all of 2020 and the beginning of 2021). Take Nikola, for example, it currently has no free cash flow but it's valued because it promises future free cash flow. Quantumscape, TuSimple, and so many more names fall into this category.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrowth stocks have fallen out of favor for this reason and is why ARKK, ARKG, and all of the other ARK ETFs have already dropped over 20% from their all time highs. The concentration of growth stocks in the NASDAQ is also the reason for its underperformance this past week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReddit forums always scream, \"don't fight the FED,\" and they're right. For times like these, it's best to rotate out of growth and into value names. The Fed TELLS you what they're going to do and this past Fed meeting was the most hawkish Fed meeting I've listened to in a long time. I'm not claiming that markets will crash, far from it, I'm simply claiming that growth stocks are not where you want to be. \n\nThis is going to hit a capitulation point when bond yields rise even more. This Twitter post shows the underperformance of ARKK's investments: [https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2](https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2). The only reason ARK is even alive is because of Tesla, and rising bond yields will eventually catch up to Tesla too, which is currently valued at 400x PE. You might be thinking now is a good time to pick up these names at a discount, but that would be ill-advised. If you're planning to hold for the next decade and through a potential 50-90% drawdown, then go ahead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a reason Michael Burry has been shorting ARKK ([https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html)) and one of the largest positions in his fund is a Tesla short ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html)) specifically because he foresees an unfavorable environment for growth stocks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've been wondering why SPACs have been dying, this is why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've been wondering why your growth stocks have been dying, this is why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've been debating whether or not to sell your ARK ETFs, this is why. Cathie Wood is simply a marketing genius who got lucky off moonshot plays in Bitcoin and Tesla, and then leveraged that success to convince the public to drive in-flows into her ARK ETFs over the past years. Those inflows helped propel a bunch of growth names higher, but ARK will eventually be a victim of its own success as outflows force selling into already declining stock prices. This reddit post is from February of 2021 when ARKK died because of, you guessed it, rising bond yields: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors\\_beware\\_arkk\\_is\\_a\\_liquidity\\_disaster/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors_beware_arkk_is_a_liquidity_disaster/). Looking at the 2 YR yield, this time might be significantly worse. This is why I told my mother to move everything over to $VTI and a selection of value names: $ADNT, $GM, $F, $KRE, $HEES, $HRI, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ONLY stock in ARKK with a reasonable PE multiple is COIN. Every other name has a multiple in either the high-flying hundreds, or the stock is simply a money burning piece of shit experiencing slowing growth. GL investors - stay safe out there. If you've been holding ARKK, it's okay to take a loss. When investing, and over the long run, losses are bound to happen.

        "selftext": "A percolating theme among retail investors came to a boil on Thursday and some meme stocks ended the day simmering . Since being knocked out of January\u2019s short squeeze by online brokers trying to avoid margin calls, retail investors have been seeking alternatives to their multi-front war on short selling hedge funds, and after months of research they appear to have found it. Cutting the brokers out altogether.\n\nIn recent days, an increasing number of retail investors have swapped their torches, pitchforks and TD Ameritrade accounts for direct registration platforms like Computershare CPU, +1.24%, which have seen an influx of business from the meme crowd. Shares of AMC Entertainment AMC, +5.70% soared 8% at its peak Thursday, to close up 5.7%, as \u201cdirect registration\u201d chatter took hold on social media, with users on Reddit flooding message boards with screenshots of purported evidence that they had moved their trading accounts to transfer agents that allow them to hold stock in a company directly rather than through the more common \u2018street\u2019 ownership. Typically, a broker holds an investor\u2019s shares on its books and keeps a record that you own the asset without the broker or the individual ever having to actually hold the physical shares. There are, of course, benefits to this indirect ownership.\n\nHowever, the trend into direct registration\u2014in some ways, the equivalent of a Gen Xer\u2019s late-teen child finding their Sony DiscMan hidden in a an old briefcase and deciding that this was the pinnacle of music technology\u2014started weeks ago as self-professed \u2018Apes\u2019 realized after January that using zero-commission trading apps didn\u2019t mean they were buying stock in a company, but were instead paying a broker to hold their stock via a \u201cstreet name.\u201d It didn\u2019t take long thereafter for those Apes to decide that this sort of indirect ownership was fueling short sellers, who borrow shares and create the kind of synthetic trading environment that some retail investors believe has allowed hedge funds and other institutions to execute shorts and avoid the pain of being squeezed themselves.\n\n\u201cIn the last few weeks, we\u2019ve seen a significant increase in direct registration transactions in some U.S.-listed \u2018meme-stocks\u2019,\u201d Paul Conn, Computershare\u2019s president of Global Capital Markets, told MarketWatch\u2019s MemeMoney. \u201cRetail investors have asked their broker or bank to remove their investments from the \u2018street name\u2019 system and into their own name directly onto the company\u2019s share register, which Computershare manages as agent for the relevant company.\u201d\n\nComputershare declined to share specific data outlining the magnitude of inflows that it has seen. But if a quick perusal of Reddit is any gauge of interest, with users posting screenshots of what they describe as newly activated accounts, the Abbotsford, Australia transfer agent is seeing a good flow of new business. \u201cSome of the benefits of direct registration include the right to receive dividends and other corporate communications directly from the company,\u201d Conn said. \u201cRegistered investors also receive their proxy and can attend, ask questions and vote directly at a company\u2019s shareholder meeting. Another benefit includes the right to transfer ownership directly,\u201d he said.\n\nBut for Reddit\u2019s retail Apes, there is one other huge perk to direct registration in meme stocks: keeping brokers, short sellers and market makers from creating a condition in which the amount of shares sold short in any given company exceed the total amount of shares outstanding. So-called naked shorting, where investors profit from bets on stock without owning it is illegal on Wall Street, but many Redditors believe that naked shorting is alive and well due in part to indirect ownership. Short bets are inherently risky because losses on a wrongway wager can be infinite. \u201cWhen the music stops, there aren\u2019t enough shares to go around,\u201d said Susanne Trimbath, CEO of STP Advisory Services, and an economist who has been a key voice in educating retail investors on market structure.\n\n\u201cThese retail investors are trying to stop the music.\u201d But while the music was still playing on Thursday, it was a sweet tune for some meme stocks. In addition to AMC (which appeared to finally capitalize on days of #AMCSqueeze trending on Twitter), shares of BlackBerry BB, +4.59%, Clover Health CLOV, +0.87% and Palantir PLTR, +0.91% all closed higher. \u201cThis buying spree is among the brokers,\u201d mused Trimbath. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s easier to come up with the money than to come up with the shares.\u201d\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-reddit-crowd-has-found-a-new-tactic-in-the-war-against-wall-street-cutting-brokers-out-altogether-11634250783?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-reddit-crowd-has-found-a-new-tactic-in-the-war-against-wall-street-cutting-brokers-out-altogether-11634250783?mod=home-page)",

So I was wondering what experience do you have with yours.  What are the fees, can you buy fractional shares and what is the minimum deposit.  Is the ui beginner friendly?I am not going to invest in meme stocks but I prefer a broker that didn\u2019t restrict buying Gme and Amc in January.

        "selftext": "So I recently tried to post some info about AMC on WSBs showing how the local AMC theater where I live had about 5 people total for the Bond opening premier. Apparently you all can\u2019t handle any criticism or truth so it was just taken down for no reason. I find it so interesting that people who complain about the financial system being rigged and being the underdogs will then take down posts that show anything that goes against the narrative of which stocks they like. I have avoided all possible words that would get the post removed by auto mods. So if it\u2019s removed again then it\u2019s just more roof of how WSBs is basically full of the exact same people who you all seem to be against. Either accept truth or silence it, the theater was nearly empty. That\u2019s a fact. And it doesn\u2019t care about your options calls or investments.",

        "selftext": "**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation AND Analysis (Q3 Week 4) - $AMC, $CRSR, $ROKU, $PINS, $SQ, $RKT, $FSLY and More**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' bull gang, hope you all had a fun weekend! We\u2019ve got an absolute boatload of companies reporting this week across many different sectors, meaning we\u2019ve got plenty of opportunities to make some money. I prefer playing sell side this week, though that\u2019s not to say that there isn\u2019t chances to make money elsewhere! Educated gambles, theta plays, and collateral plays are all valid this time round. Let\u2019s get into it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Options are extremely expensive this week. Sell side reigns supreme.** Relative to their historical moves, most stocks have extremely expensive options.  $NKLA, $SKLZ, $CRSR, and $AMC will be the main tickers to trade, as they all have inflated premiums to the tune of nearly 2x their historical, giving us insane margins of safety. Even if there is an earnings blowout, we\u2019ll still be well within the wings of our spreads, allowing us to bag premiums for free. Most companies who\u2019ve already reported earnings this quarter have had very muted moves, and that trend is likely going to continue into this week. There\u2019s no reason for week 4 to be proportionally more volatile than the rest. I plan on running strangles on most of the above companies given that the premiums stay inflated throughout the week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to  [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$PINS is inefficiently priced.** $PINS has a priced move of 10.5% but a historical move of 15%, meaning we have edge in this trade. Pinterest is a historically aggressive mover, and that\u2019s only going to be amplified due to the awkward resolution of the Paypal deal, leading me to believe we\u2019re going to have another large move this quarter. $PINS reports on Thursday, meaning that the options will be even cheaper due to theta, moving the 10.5% priced move closer to 8% or 9%, giving us added margins of safety.  For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to the link in the point above.$SNAP. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity. So do $PENN and $DKNG.** Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you\u2019re bullish or bearish on *either company*, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we\u2019ll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, the IV on $UBER will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!  If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",

And of all the stupid meme things you can pump you give Trump another chance at a cheap cash grab? Seriously, why would you help enrich Trump? So he can continue to spread lies and scam people. \n\nI understand AMC and GME but this is supporting corruption, entitlement, and incompetence. Those companies have good memories attached to them, they hire young people, they are nice relatively harmless institutions. Trump is awful, he bankrupted multiple casinos and fooled people into thinking he\u2019s successful through a reality TV show. Now he\u2019s getting another windfall for doing nothing. \n\nSeriously this guy would happily watch the world burn for another buck. He fooled millions of idiots into believing the election was stolen just to grab donations.

        "selftext": "TLDR: $SDC is a brand people have heard of, see commercials for, can relate to (we all have teeth); $SDC is objectively undervalued from a fundamental and growth perspective yet is egregiously shorted due to obstinate bear narratives; there are a whole generation of people losing their second mortgages chasing the next big squeeze only to get dumped on and end up bag holders--the people need to find that next $AMC or $GME without getting hung out to dry on de-SPACs etc.; $SDC = Lambo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background**\n\nMalcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference explores socio-cultural phenomena that, in retrospect, were likely the butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil that caused a tornado in Texas. The book describes three characteristics that lead to these \"epidemics.\" They are, The Law of The Few, The Stickiness Factor, and The Power of Context. I'll describe each of these and its relevancy to these short squeeze scenarios.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Law of the Few**\n\nEveryone has heard the 80/20 rule--80% of the work is done by 20% of the people. How do things go 'viral'--which wasn't even a concept when Malcolm first wrote this book? He describes the critical work that is done by three types of people that helps develop momentum: Connectors, Mavens, and Salesmen. In today's age the impact these few have is extraordinary with global connectedness and social media. It's what Malcolm observed on steroids.\n\n* Connectors - those with a knack for sociability; they know people and introduce people; they're worldly; have a lot of experiences; are generally likeable; and have many 'weak ties;' these are the people with a bajillion friends on social media\n* Mavens - those who either know a lot of information or know where to find it; they're known for connecting you to ideas, providing information that will help you; they're generally trusted to have your best interest at heart; they thrive on helping others\n* Salesmen - persuasive people, we all know them; charming sons of bitches that could convince us to do just about anything\n\nIt's almost self-evident that $GME and $AMC had people in all these categories on board--creating some idols and virtual cult followings. This is gradually becoming true for $SDC as well. It is starting to trend and getting attention. It is still early and luckily they've avoided attracting too much attention from known pumpers. But I think for a true short squeeze to have enormous, sustained upside it'll need people in all these categories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Stickiness Factor**\n\nThe Stickiness Factor refers to how memorable, relatable, appealing something is. In his book he describes the enormous work that went in to having children sample episodes of Sesame Street and Blue's Clues to get them just right. $GME and $AMC had this. There are a whole generation of investors that grew up in the 80's, 90's, 00's that played video games... went to GameStop... watched movies in the theater... etc. We know these companies, they're in our neighborhoods, we might have worked at one in High School. One of the primary bear narratives has focused on $SDC's debt. Admittedly, it's not small. However, in context they've had to dramatically escalate marketing due to the total hit job against them after IPO. The result is we see the commercials frequently. They're visually appealing. The logo is a smile so we feel drawn to it. You might have seen a SmileBus in your neighborhood. This probably explains how $NEGG and $WOOF jumped as well, but they lacked some of the other ingredients to sustain momentum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Power of Context**\n\nThis characteristic of epidemics deals with the Robert Sapolsky-esque notion that human behavior is disproportionately influenced by the \"conditions and circumstanced of the times and places in which they occur.\" During a global pandemic, when people are *working* from home, retail investing is becoming mainstream through Robinhood, WeBull, and other platforms; when cryptocurrency is facing regulatory pressures; when the market is bubbling all over the place; retail investors are chasing these enormous paydays they're seeing posted on WallStreetBets without recognizing the risks of being the loss porn. Additionally, stocks like $AMC and $GME were being targeted for bankruptcy. The laziness of 'experts' and 'professionals' is an entirely different subject worth exploring--look up Phillip Tetlock's work on how experts are often worse than random chance at predicting outcomes. What's worse, often some of these 'experts' and 'professionals' have ulterior motives to taint the brand or the company in the eyes of investors--whether that be to facilitate a poop and scoop, for anti-competitive reasons, or if they're just biased against the company. All this to say we're in an era where these types of stock surges aren't going anywhere and will likely make a lot of people rich if they learn how to predict their occurrence early.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**About Me**\n\nPositions: 500 shares at $6.24",

        "selftext": "Hi, everyone I'm a distraught ocgn investor and Canadian waiting on a Covaxin approval and I recently had a good discussion with some relatives (one who works closely with the Canadian government) on why Canada won't do Covaxin contracts. Her main points were we already have Pfizer and Moderna contracts set for 2022-2023 and there is no emergent need for new doses. \n\nThat is a good point. However, through a bit of research I realized Canada is a big supporter of the COVAX initiative and the Act-Accelerator program both run by  the who organization. \n\nWhat is the ACT accelerator:\n\n[ACT who program](https://www.who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator)\n\nThe Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is a groundbreaking global collaboration to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd as we all know, Covax is lacking very behind on vaccine promises but through a bit of speculation we can deduce that WHO is working very well with Bharat. Why? Well to supply low and Middle income countries with Covaxin! \n\nDon't think who will approve? Check out the going viral panel featuring Soumya, other who officials, presentation of Covaxin and Bharat Biotech's director. Why so much collaboration? \n\n[going viral](https://youtu.be/IoKSxqw4tBY)\n\nIts been very clear that existing vaccine manufacturers have no interest in low to middle income countries and who has been begging countries to help with the  Covax program. \n\nHow does Covaxin fix this? \n\nCOVAXIN:\n\n\n**Traditional inactivated whole virion vaccine (trusted polio method that eradicated polio in youth 45+ years ago 1955 ) **\n\n\n**Expected Shelf Life Approximately two years at 2\u00b0- 8\u00b0C and three months at room temp (25\u00b0C)**\n\nOnly Vaccine for 2yrs+  \n\n**Reaches lower income, and rural populations that have no access to extreme refrigeration**\n\n\n[Covax vaccines what went wrong](https://www.google.com/amp/s/time.com/6096172/covax-vaccines-what-went-wrong/%3famp=true)\n\nHere is a link to Canada's initiatives for Covax:\n\n[Canada Covid 19 response](https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/issues_development-enjeux_developpement/global_health-sante_mondiale/response_covid-19_reponse.aspx?lang=eng)\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n**Canada joined the\u00a0ACT-Accelerator\u00a0on May 4, 2020, and continues to be among its leading contributors. This global partnership ensures that people worldwide have equal and affordable access to COVID\u201119 health products like:**\n\n**vaccines**\n\ntests for diagnosing COVID\u201119\n\ntreatments, therapies and drugs (therapeutics)\n\n\n**Canada to fund $220\u00a0million through the COVID\u201119 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Advance Market Commitment (AMC) to buy vaccine doses for low and middle-income countries, announced on\u00a0September\u00a025, 2020**\n\nCanada to fund $230\u00a0million to UNICEF for COVID\u201119 therapeutics, announced on\u00a0December\u00a014, 2020\n\n$180\u00a0million to develop, deliver and distribute vaccines and therapeutics, including targeted support to Latin America and the Caribbean through the World Health Organization (WHO), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and CEPI\n\n\n$75\u00a0million in funding to support the activities of the ACT-Accelerator, announced on\u00a0February\u00a019, 2021\n\n$375\u00a0million announced by the Prime Minister on\u00a0May 7, 2021, for the ACT- Accelerator.\n\n\n**Additionally in December 2020, the Prime Minister announced that Canada would be sharing any vaccine doses in excess of Canada\u2019s domestic needs with countries who needed them most. Since then, Canada has committed to sharing over 40 million doses via the COVAX Facility\u2019s dose sharing mechanism, which is built to ensure equitable and efficient allocation and delivery of COVID-19 vaccine doses**\n\nFurthermore, Canada has also shared over 762,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with countries in Latin America and the Caribbean through direct bilateral agreements. These doses had already arrived on Canadian soil and were in excess of Canada\u2019s domestic needs.\n\n**Canada will continue to prioritize the delivery of any potential excess doses through the COVAX AMC, exploring other dose sharing options on an exceptional basis, as needed, to ensure vaccines get to those in need.**\n\nNow how does this relate to OCGN. Well, we own the rights to distribute Covaxin into both US and Canada. Bharat is in the process of getting who approval and is working very well with WHO to supply middle low income countries. Canada is a big supporter of the COVAX initiative. Now all we need to do is connect the dots and wait. \n\nFor those saying Canada is irrelevant, I don't think so. We are going to need vaccines for children, boosters, and COVAX. \n\nPositions:\n\n1000 shares\n36 Jan 2023 30$ calls",

        "selftext": "A little-known microcap energy stock that had become a favorite of the meme-stock crowd plunged 50% on Tuesday after a short-seller issued a report saying that the underlying business is troubled. The stock is falling again Wednesday. Houston-based Camber Energy (ticker: CEI) had the second-highest volume of all U.S. stocks on Tuesday. More than 700 million shares changed hands despite the stock having a float of just 104 million shares. Camber had been rising steadily in recent weeks, from 50 cents at the end of August to a high of $4.85 on Sept. 29. It closed at $1.53 on Tuesday and is down to $1.19 in premarket trading Wednesday.\n\nThere was little news from the company to explain the price surge over the past month. One person trading the stock said that the volume came from meme traders looking to ride a short-squeeze. \u201cIt has been close to the top talked-about stock on social media for the last couple of weeks,\u201d said Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple of big influencers who were big supporters. To their benefit they\u2019ve been talking about it since it was like 50 cents a share.\u201d\n\nTuttle runs the FOMO ETF (FOMO), which invests in companies that are part of the meme-stock phenomenon that gained notoriety after GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC) rocketed higher in January. Tuttle said he has been trading in and out of Camber in recent days, attempting to make money off the surges while making sure he doesn\u2019t hold a large position at the close of trading. His interest has little to do with the company\u2019s fundamentals\u2014it\u2019s all about the trading dynamics, the short squeeze and the momentum created by social media \u201cfinfluencers.\u201d He sold most of his position on Monday, and is holding about 4,700 shares, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re using limits, we\u2019re using stops, we\u2019re being real careful with it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe latest data on short selling, from Sept. 15, shows 24% of Camber\u2019s float has been borrowed for short-sales. But Tuttle said that proprietary data he uses shows even higher interest from shorts, with 91% of shares outstanding being borrowed.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/camber-one-of-the-most-talked-about-stocks-on-social-media-plunges-50-51633468075?mod=mw\\_latestnews](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/camber-one-of-the-most-talked-about-stocks-on-social-media-plunges-50-51633468075?mod=mw_latestnews)",

I'm 21, full time student, with part time work so my income is pretty low. I have both a personal account and TFSA on Wealthsimple. On my personal account right now I'm holding some meme stocks that I got during the GameStop hype (GME, AMC, BB, NOK) and in my TFSA I have ATZ (awesome, get it if you haven't yet), RBLX (I think Roblox is gonna be a cool long term play) XEQT, and VEQT.\n\nMy understanding of things is pretty limited and other than doing my own (brief) research and lurking this sub, I basically have no idea what I'm doing.\n\nI'm wondering: is it better to just pick one ETF for the long haul? My current plan is to just max my TFSA between XEQT, VEQT, VFV, and VGRO, and then I maybe in my personal account is where I'd put ATZ and RBLX.\n\nAt some point, I'm going to dump all my meme stocks and just put all that money into said ETFs. I'm just waiting to see what happens with GME. My meme stock money was all money I could afford to lose anyway.\n\nI have about 10,000$ saved up that I'd really like to dump into good investments.\n\nI'm also curious about crypto. At some point I used Wealthsimple crypto to get some BTC but I lost 100 bucks and decided to pull out. I just downloaded the Newton app and am wanting to research other coins.\n\nThank you.",

We\u2019ve got an absolute boatload of companies reporting this week across many different sectors, meaning we\u2019ve got plenty of opportunities to make some money. I prefer playing sell side this week, though that\u2019s not to say that there isn\u2019t chances to make money elsewhere! Educated gambles, theta plays, and collateral plays are all valid this time round. Let\u2019s get into it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Options are extremely expensive this week. Sell side reigns supreme.** Relative to their historical moves, most stocks have extremely expensive options.  $NKLA, $SKLZ, $CRSR, and $AMC will be the main tickers to trade, as they all have inflated premiums to the tune of nearly 2x their historical, giving us insane margins of safety. Even if there is an earnings blowout, we\u2019ll still be well within the wings of our spreads, allowing us to bag premiums for free. Most companies who\u2019ve already reported earnings this quarter have had very muted moves, and that trend is likely going to continue into this week. There\u2019s no reason for week 4 to be proportionally more volatile than the rest. I plan on running strangles on most of the above companies given that the premiums stay inflated throughout the week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to  [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$PINS is inefficiently priced.** $PINS has a priced move of 10.5% but a historical move of 15%, meaning we have edge in this trade. Pinterest is a historically aggressive mover, and that\u2019s only going to be amplified due to the awkward resolution of the Paypal deal, leading me to believe we\u2019re going to have another large move this quarter. $PINS reports on Thursday, meaning that the options will be even cheaper due to theta, moving the 10.5% priced move closer to 8% or 9%, giving us added margins of safety.  For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to the link in the point above.$SNAP. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity. So do $PENN and $DKNG.** Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you\u2019re bullish or bearish on *either company*, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we\u2019ll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, the IV on $UBER will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!  If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",

Pioneered by financial fraudster Bernie Madoff, payment for order flow (PFOF) is the cost for market makers, such as Citadel, to route trades away from the NYSE and into the dark pools (off-exchange trading). This leads to dark pool abuse and price suppression, made possible by corrupt entities holding losing bets, which goes against the concept of a \u201cfree market.\u201d The (ab)use of dark pools is a MAJOR conflict of interest; Citadel is both a hedge fund AND a market maker, both run by Kenneth Griffin. Off-exchange trading is blatantly being used for purposes it was not intended for. PFOF puts retail investors at a great disadvantage because their buy orders do NOT make an impact on the underlying stock price.\nWhy is PFOF allowed in the US when it's been banned in so many countries, such as the UK, Canada, and Australia? We demand that the SEC suspends dark pool trading for securities with abnormally high dark pool activity, such as AMC and GameStop. On 10/19/2021, AMC\u2019s dark pool activity reached ~75%. GameStop also suffers from significant price suppression. If that wasn\u2019t enough, short positions are hidden in options, and buy orders can take over a month to settle when they SHOULD be immediate or T+1.\nWe do not want our brokerages to receive payment for order flow. We have a right to participate in an equal-opportunity market and easily route our own trades to lit markets. Dark pools should have already been suspended for AMC and GME, yet we're 9 months in without regulatory action. Citadel is suing the SEC over the new D-Limit order, with the next court date being October 25th. We don\u2019t need Citadel speaking on behalf of retail investors to tell the SEC what's best for us. Commission-free trading doesn\u2019t help everyday investors when the US stock market is rigged and in favor of the wealthy. As individual investors, we agree to the commission charges per trade in order to ensure a safe and more transparent market with no conflicts of interest between institutions and those in power.\n\nD\u00ea o pr\u00f3ximo passo.\n\n\n Please sign petition and share it. 6000 signatures are still needed, can you add your signature? \u270d\ufe0f\nhttps://chng.it/Y47WqZB6",

I believe the hedge funds would not be able to make hand over fist like they have been, simply put they will make a lot less money.  \n\nSo what does it mean for us?\n\nTheir liquidity will go down and if GME and AMC stay at the current price or higher, they would be forced to close on most of their short positions.

        "selftext": "The Next Great Meme- Wework \n\nThe Invisible Hand \n1) The stock market is essentially that a marketplace, buyers and sellers. Prices move up and down depending on whatever whoever is willing to pay. If a stock rises so much sellers come in and drop the price, if it falls to much buyers come in and pick up the price. If every single person puts a $100 order for a $1 stock but there are no selling orders $100 is the new price. Every other thing you hear about the market are attempts at justification for those prices, cashflow discount, dividend discount, P/E, EPS, all mumbo jumbo to try to make sense of why A trades for more than B. It is also why you see \u201cMEME\u201d stocks trade at traditional mind boggling prices/valuations, because it just boils down to what someone is willing to pay for those shares and the majority agree that AMC should trade north of $35 and GME over $150.\n\n Making a MEME\n\nThere are a few key points that contribute into turning a stock into a MEME Stock. The stock must be recognizable to have staying power. In order for the MEME to stay a MEME and hold its price, it has to be a company people have heard about or MSM (Main Street Media) have or will cover heavily. Secondly America loves a Comeback, and so does the market/Members, the stock has to be heavily beat down if a narrative about how its business was destroyed by Covid that\u2019s a double plus. Finally the stock has to have a very low float or highly shorted, I would contend the first point is magnitudes more important. With these 3 points in our mind lets dive into who the target is. \n\nFrankenstein\u2019s Monster \n\nWework was once a shining Jewel in the Softbank investment portfolio, investing at least $18.5 billion in WeWork since 2017, including $6 billion when a fundraising round valued the startup at $47 billion in January 2019(1). But governance and profitability concerns in addition to a disaster IPO lead to their $47B valuation getting chopped down to nearly $10B in oct 2019 (2). Over this time MSM loves to take about WeWork it was a darling that got absolutely obliterated, can you imagine if it went on a monster AMC/GME run, point 1 check. Wework\u2019s primary business is real estate, they buy/renovate office space and then sublease this same workspace to multiple companies or share of whole offices for 1 largely customer. Covid19 has dramatically changed the work/life balance, we are going on almost 2 years of the pandemic where most white collar has been done remotely or at home. Now with labor holding a lot of the cards the ability to work from anywhere for at least for 2-3 a week the traditional office model is being disrupted. A fundamental argument can be made that WeWork\u2019s business is about to experience a renaissance driven by the Covid 19 pandemic as corporation adopt smaller satellite offices since more staff can work remotely or at home. If you watch CNBC you may have caught David Faber mention the \u201cSPAC POP\u201d which is a sudden increase in the SPAC price when the deal closes due to a large 95 or greater percent redemption of space shares. Due to point 1 and 2 I expect the /Wework Spac to have an insanely high redemption rate maybe 98%, this will result in a super low float. \n\n\n\nGamma Gameplan \n\nOne of the most potent tools in the MEME trader arsenal is the long naked call option. The call option gives you the right but not the obligation to purchase 100 shares at a price you choose. A market maker sells you this call for a premium which is determined by a number of factors such as length of time, difference in price, volatility of the stock, etc. Now MM\u2019s have a number of ways they can neutralize the risk to selling these options, 1 of which is buying the underlying stock, so that as the stock rises so does their share price thus offsetting their losses. The other option would be buying a higher strike so cap their losses. I believe a GAMMA Blitz can be executed around the SPAC POP in order to drive the stock price up. For Example the vote to close the Wework SPAC is set for Oct 19, if passed Wework shares will start to trade on Oct 21. The nearest call option for  is the Nov 19 call with the highest strike being the 17.5. If enough of these calls are sold there is currently no higher strike for MM\u2019s to hedge with, they would have to buy the underlying stock to cover themselves, but this will move the price significantly since the float will be dramatically reduced due to the high redemption. \n\nI am targeting a share price over $20 by Nov 1st. This is not financial advice or a call to action, I am simply sharing my thoughts and ideas, please invest/trade at your own discretion.",

        "selftext": "So far, I have only covered the possibility of short squeeze of $SDC (see link below in previous post)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pymseb/sdc\\_cost\\_to\\_borrow\\_just\\_picked\\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pymseb/sdc_cost_to_borrow_just_picked_up/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut there is something more important than that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are many stocks that show the possibility of a short squeeze,\n\nbut among them, there are reasons why we should focus on $SDC and invest a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs discussed in the previous post, the data on the short squeeze was the most perfect with $PROG, but the most important reason is the value and potential of the company.\n\nMany institutions hold stocks at an average unit price of $10 or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to write an opinion and analysis on why SDC became the target of short selling and why the judgment of short selling is wrong.\n\n==================================\n\n**contents**\n\n1. The Future Value of SmileDirectClub\n2. Issues with SmileDirectClub\n3. Danger\n4. Conclusion and Consideration\n\n==================================\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1. The Future Value of SmileDirectClub**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n..**1). Trends for orthodontics (increasing demand)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased on the growth of orthodontic-related companies, the demand for orthodontics is growing explosively around the world, and $SDC also has explosive growth potential in this trend.\u200b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's take a look at some of the very important companies involved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n....**(1). ALGN (Align Technology)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$ALGN is in the business of developing, manufacturing and selling orthodontic 3D printers.\n\nIt is amazing to see the growth of this company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ya2i0837us71.png?width=1234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7f361f53a02d3043608649853f7600aca3e32df\n\nThe stock price has risen 58527 % from its lowest point ($1.26) to the maximum ($737.45), and is currently at $643.56, up 51076 %.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNumber of shares: 79.01 M\n\nMarket cap: 50803 M $\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n....**(2). XRAY (Dentsplay Sinora)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$XRAY is also in the business of developing and selling dental equipment in addition to orthodontic 3D printers.\n\nThe growth rate of this company is also surprising.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ga4z19y37us71.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16dd0021d2b97d46ca31fd101ad0fd5e54f33a26\n\nIt reached the high of $69.54, which is 13120 % higher than the low of $0.53, and is now 10949% higher at $58.03.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNumber of shares: 218.55 M\n\nMarket cap: 12682.46 M $\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition to this, the main tickers are\n\n\\* Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC)\n\n\\* 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD)\n\netc., but I'll skip these.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven dental care/treatment around the world is expensive, so unless you are upper-middle class or higher, you have not been able to straighten your teeth well. In particular, there **were** many negative views on corrections for beauty.\n\nHowever, the explosive growth of orthodontic equipment companies,\n\nSeeing that orthodontic for beauty are now increasingly popular with the young generation in many countries,\n\nDemand for orthodontics has exploded in recent years and is expected to increase in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n..**2). the importance of price**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOrthodontic at SDC is generally much cheaper than actual visits.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lwdnc8w57us71.png?width=631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5b1a30c17acbe001f0bb912812284fc2d9d2de3\n\nIn addition, due to the pandemic, masks have become commonplace and the frequency of going out has greatly decreased.\n\nAt this time when people are not showing their teeth, more and more people want to have orthodontic treatment, and SDC has a very strong advantage in this regard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor this expensive orthodontic treatment to **become common**, it must not be too burdensome for the middle class to afford.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd SDC is one of the most affordable solutions,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I think SmileDirectClub will lead the way among companies that make orthodontics universal for beauty in the future.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Get a smile with just 3$ per day!](https://preview.redd.it/seulolk77us71.png?width=1301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac812717add7b092518597c2813922ec67a6cee3)\n\n..**3). Sales and operating profit**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's look at the change in sales of $SDC.\n\nAnnual Sales Trend\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ms0c5qqd7us71.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f1ddb452f614c12d9cfa6e9bb99ce8bb0691748\n\nMonthly Sales Trend\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t8qtdm3e7us71.png?width=1245&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4416d6ca6bf28f7bde6ce7fd493c73e7cb302b78\n\nSDC's quarterly sales are doing pretty well. I think this has a big impact on showing good results in marketing as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince this orthodontic treatment is highly likely to become a trend from the young generation, reviews and promotions through SNS will spread very quickly during the transition period when orthodontic treatment becomes common. In fact, SDC can easily find promotional materials on SNS, Youtube, and TV.\n\nPoor operating profit is one of the biggest causes of recent short selling attacks, and in fact, ignorant 'self-proclaimed analysts' cite operating profit as the reason for 'the reason you should not buy SDC'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the reason why the operating profit is currently poor is largely due to the cost of plant expansion, new patent development, and business expansion into new countries.\n\n\\--------------------ref----------------------------\n\nItem 2. Properties\n\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Nashville, Tennessee. We also lease our manufacturing facilities in Antioch, Tennessee and Columbia, Tennessee, where we expect to open a second manufacturing facility. We have 114 SmileShops across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Hong Kong, U.K., Germany, and Singapore all of which are either leased or licensed from our retail partners. Lastly, we lease our facility in San Jose, Costa Rica and our facility in Cartago, Costa Rica. Management believes the terms of the leases are consistent with market standards and were arrived at through arm\u2019s-length negotiation.\n\n( Reference : File number 21907839 , 10-Q, page : 52 )\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the 10-Q filing, the number of manufacturing plants and retail shops are increasing.\n\nIt is an accurate approach to the business core elements of the current SDC.\n\n\\---------------------ref------------------------------\n\nKey Business Metrics\n\nWe review the following key business metrics to evaluate our business performance:\n\nUnique aligner order shipments\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we shipped 374,982 and 453,053 unique aligner orders, respectively. Each unique aligner order shipment represents a single contracted member. We believe that our ability to increase the number of aligner orders shipped is an indicator of our market penetration, growth of our business, consumer interest, and our member conversion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAverage aligner gross sales price\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe define average gross sales price (\u201cASP\u201d) as gross revenue, before implicit price concession and other variable considerations and exclusive of sales tax, from aligner orders shipped divided by the number of unique aligner orders shipped. We believe ASP is an indicator of the value we provide to our members and our ability to maintain our pricing. Our ASP for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1,797 and $1,771, respectively. Our ASP is less than our standard $1,950 price as a result of discounts offered to select members.\n\n( Reference : File number 21907839 , 10-Q, page : 57 )\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe core business element of SDC presented in 10-Q is to secure a large number of orders, and recently sales are good and capacity is increasing, so operating profit is negative.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n..**4). Alabama State Dental Association is so territorial but Fair Trade Commission recognized SDC business.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSDC was planning to expand into Alabama, but the Alabama Dental Association requested SDC to stop remote/visual orthodontic diagnosis and treatment, and SDC abandoned its expansion plan to Alabama.\n\nHowever, the Fair Trade Commission said that this was an unreasonable request and violated the antitrust law and that SmileDirectClub's business was justified as a result of a 5-0 vote.\n\n[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/alabama-board-dental-examiners-agrees-settle-ftc-charges-it](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/alabama-board-dental-examiners-agrees-settle-ftc-charges-it)\n\nAlabama Board of Dental Examiners Agrees to Settle FTC Charges that It Unreasonably Excluded Lower Cost Online and Teledentistry Providers from Competition\n\nTo settle FTC charges that its actions violated the antitrust laws, the Board of Dental Examiners of Alabama has agreed to stop requiring on-site supervision by licensed dentists of alignment scans of prospective patients\u2019 mouths seeking to address misaligned teeth or gaps between teeth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSDC is fighting these existing dental associations' territory and regulations,\n\nI sent an inquiry email to SDC regarding these.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dxuz1wxf7us71.png?width=1581&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5321b7839f8dd3175d449fbcc307b7c4d8037d16\n\nIn this regard, SDC received a reply that it would deal with it in more detail when it released 3Q earnings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n..**5). $SDC is the only Tele-Dentistry company listed on Nasdaq**\n\nThe link below is a list of US Tele-Dentistry companies, and SmileDirectClub is the only listed company.\n\n[https://www.beckersdental.com/teledentistry/36105-10-teledentistry-companies-to-know.html](https://www.beckersdental.com/teledentistry/36105-10-teledentistry-companies-to-know.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis means that there is no competition for $SDC in the Nasdaq market, there is sufficient liquidity to invest in marketing,\n\nIt is the best company that can monopolize a percentage of the Tele-Dentistry market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Issues with SmileDirectClub**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n..**1). Legal issues with NBC ( CNBC ).**\n\nLast year, SDC filed a $2.85 billion lawsuit alleging that NBC deliberately distorted SDC.\n\n[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/smiledirectclub-sues-nbc-285-billion-1295347/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/smiledirectclub-sues-nbc-285-billion-1295347/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lawsuit is still ongoing. If SDC win, it is possible to secure a huge amount of funds with strong recognition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n..**2). Short-Squeuze play on Reddit**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased on the content of my previous post about the possibility of short squeeze and the general information above, reports that I was trying to play a short squeeze on Reddit.\n\n[https://twitter.com/KristinaParts/status/1437884294249201669?s=19](https://twitter.com/KristinaParts/status/1437884294249201669?s=19)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGME, AMC, and then SDC, MEMEs started to become popular.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n..**3). Analyst raises target price**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow is Analyst's upward revision of the $SDC target price (starting price of $5.25 -&gt; target price of $11)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pz36eg/credit\\_suisse\\_analyst\\_matt\\_miksic\\_gives/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pz36eg/credit_suisse_analyst_matt_miksic_gives/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. Danger**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe short-term risks of SDC are hard to find out now. So let's take a look at three long-term risks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n..**1). Risks from audits after exiting emerging growth companies**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSDC, as an emerging growth company, receives exceptions from audits, and if sales exceed 1.08 B, it will be eliminated from the emerging growth company, and there is a high risk of being attacked by short selling according to financial reporting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn fact, according to the investment prospectus of SDC, it is possible to speculate that the current sales are intentionally lowered to some extent because the company intends to take full advantage of the advantages of 'emerging growth companies'. It is a story of the distant future. No need to worry right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n..**2). Possibility of dilution of Class A common stock by pre-IPO investors**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe number of issued shares is 118.87 M , the current share price is 6.5 dollars, and the current market capitalization is 773 M $ ( 972 billion won).\n\nThe total number of diluted shares including pre-IPO investor volume (common share B) is 387,61 M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Reference : 10-Q, page 1](https://preview.redd.it/ges4rc1i7us71.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cb8214fc80fe66aef4f1067007c89b63f757803)\n\nThe lock-up release date for common stock B was released on August 16, 19, 180 days after the submission of S-1.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far, a total of 1.2M common stock B has been diluted with common stock A.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClass A change: 104,825,858 -&gt; 118,869,656\n\nClass B change: 281,863,766 -&gt; 269,243,501\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Even after the lockup was lifted, the conversion of common stock B to common stock A was only diluted by 4.5%, a small amount for a year and a half. Moreover, considering the diluted unit price (over $10), the current share price is $6.5, so the possibility of a share price decline due to the dilution of common stock B is very low.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n..**3). Redemption of convertible bonds**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe convertible bonds issued on February 9, 21st had a conversion rate of 55.3710 shares per 1000$ conversion rate, and were converted to the common share A price of $18.06 per share.\n\nAccording to the contents of convertible bonds, the bill is due on February 1, 26, and from August 1, 25, the issuer of the note can request redemption.\n\nIn addition, according to the will of the company, from February 6, 24, if the stock price at that time is higher than the stock price when the bill was issued, early redemption is possible.\n\nTherefore, the possibility that SDC's common stock A will be diluted due to convertible bonds is a very distant future, and it is not something to be concerned about much at present.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------ref---------------------------------\n\nItem 1.01.\n\nEntry into a Material Definitive Agreement.\n\nIndenture and Notes\n\nOn February 9, 2021, SmileDirectClub, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) entered into an indenture (the \u201cIndenture\u201d), between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d), pursuant to which the Company issued $650,000,000 principal amount of the Company's 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The Company has also granted the initial purchasers of the Notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the Notes were first issued, up to an additional $97,500,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes (\u201cOption Notes\u201d). On February 9, 2021, the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase $70,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Option Notes.\n\nThe Notes will be the Company\u2019s senior, unsecured obligations and will be (i) equal in right of payment with the Company\u2019s existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company\u2019s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to the Company\u2019s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including our credit facility and trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\n\nThe Notes will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes will not accrete. The Notes will mature on February 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before August 1, 2025, noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after August 1, 2025, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its Class A common stock, at the Company\u2019s election. The initial conversion rate is 55.3710 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $18.06 per share of Class A common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a \u201cMake-Whole Fundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.\n\nThe Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time, and from time to time, on or after February 6, 2024 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company's Class A common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice. In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.\n\nIf certain corporate events that constitute a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then, then noteholders may require the Company to repurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company\u2019s Class A common stock.\n\n(Reference:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001775625/000110465921016943/tm214449d4\\_8k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001775625/000110465921016943/tm214449d4_8k.htm))\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. Conclusions and considerations**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$SDC This is on the movement, not a moment.**\n\nThe demand for orthodontics is explosively popular all over the world, and SDC is a company that has great advantages. It is also the largest company in the Tele-Dentistry industry and is the only listed company on Nasdaq.\n\nIn view of the move to continuously increase marketing and production capacity,\n\nSDC is a company with great potential to continue increasing its market share by leading the future Online &amp; Tele-Dentistry, and believes that its share price will rise by at least several hundred% in the next few years.\n\nWhen 3Q earnings are announced in November, no one knows whether the short selling will be more aggressive or if the results will exceed expectations and result in an earnings surprise.\n\nThere is one more thing to remember. Long position institutions have already formed strong support at $5, and there has never been any class B dilution near this price range. Therefore, we believe that the current share price is more safe than risky.\n\nIn the short term, there is a high possibility that the stock price will rise quickly due to the pressure on short selling.\n\nIf a squeeze occurs in order to maximize profits (to hold as many shares of $SDC as possible in the long term), as explained in Chapter 3. Risk, there is a factor that will decrease in the long run, so some of them will be forced to sell. , I think it would be good to collect stocks steadily over the long term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nps. Oversold stocks are more risky than blue-chip stocks. I am not a financial advisor, and the content of this post is my personal opinion and not a buy/sell recommendation.",

        "selftext": "(Disclaimer, I'm long CCL with a combination of long calls and long shares. I am short a few covered calls with CCL shares of collateral too as a risk-management tool.)\n\nLots of my friends are apes, and I love that this subreddit has made them rich, so this is my attempt at giving back and making apes rich. I'm more of a Warren Buffett style investor, and I'm kinda anti social media so I have never posted here or even on Reddit. But CCL is an opportunity all investors should love, apes, speculators, and value investors alike.\n\nCCL is the last reopening play still trading at a 50% discount from it's pre-COVID peaks. This price is not justified: it is as undervalued as GME or AMC.\n\nRight now it\u2019s fallen to a support of 23 a share. Looking at the last times CCL fell to a support of 23 should show you the market is overlooking a big play.\n\nLast time we were at 23 was only September 18th 2021, and since then CCL has announced they are fully booked through 2023, and they\u2019ve refinanced a lot of high rate debt they put on earlier in the pandemic thus ending their liquidity crisis and giving them the cash on hand to expand their fleet further. Delta and United\u2019s earnings last week shows that travel stocks have recovered, or will soon recover. Merck's antiviral will further boost reopening plays. Americans have a well documented cash glut that will translate into luxury sales, like a cruise ship vacay. Even Morningstar, fucking Morningstar, agrees that 23 is a low price\u2013though their fair price of 27 still feels pretty low. \n\nIn fact, CCL is down from its recent high of 26 in September, down from 30 where it stood before the Delta variant stunted a number of reopening plays, and down from 60 where it was before the pandemic.\n\nHow can this be? Oh, because like GME and AMC it's a popular short target. The put to call ratio is 1.2. Definitely not as dramatic as AMC or GME was, but buying and holding will make a few hedgies cry.\n\nBecause the hedgies are so obviously fucking wrong on this. For 23 bucks, I am going to hold CCL and never let go, because owning a company with orders booked through 2023 and at half the price it was in 2019 is pretty fucking rad.\n\nIf you could see the deep fucking value in AMC and GME, you can see that CCL's value is as rich as the deep blue sea. I'm hodling, feel free to get rich with me.\n\nLinks:\n\nHedge Funds are Dumping CCL (lol this article was published while I was writing this post): [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-dumping-carnival-corporation-152552278.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-dumping-carnival-corporation-152552278.html)\n\nCarnival Corporation (CCL) Announces More U.S. Homeport Ship Restarts for January and February 2022:\n\n[https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/carnival-corporation-ccl-announces-more-u-s-homeport-ship-restarts-for-january-and-february-2022](https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/carnival-corporation-ccl-announces-more-u-s-homeport-ship-restarts-for-january-and-february-2022)\n\nCarnival Corporation: Liquidity Crisis Averted\n\n[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4459615-carnival-corporation-stock-liquidity-crisis-averted](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4459615-carnival-corporation-stock-liquidity-crisis-averted)",
