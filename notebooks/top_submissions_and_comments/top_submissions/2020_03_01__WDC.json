Here's my watch list\n\nGap Ups: AAPL, AMD, BA, BIDU, DAL, LYFT, LYV, NUGT, NVAX, RCL, ROKU, SAVE, SPCE, TDOC, UBER, WDC, WYNN, Z\n\nGap Downs: MIST\n\nSPY sitting right underneath the 234 pivot which is acting as resistance pre market. All gappers are gapping up with the market, not any earnings plays and almost all gappers are sitting at the 9 EMA. There is lots of stocks gapping and plenty will be tradeable, I just picked what I thought were interesting to me. Not sure how today goes. If SPY can get over 234 and hold, that is a good sign. If the markest is strong, hopefully these stocks can break the 9 ema and we should get some nice plays. Since there is no catalyst we are dependent on the market so pay attention to SPY and QQQ for timing. Trades have been working pretty good. If you are new and have any questions, comment or shoot me a message. Good luck trading",
