        "selftext": "[Position Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/6csObKs)\n\nLumber Liquidators (LL) stock has been beaten down for years but the company is actually making a turnaround. They had issues in the past with product quality, but they have 420 stores across the USA. These stores are small (like 5000sq.ft) and they only have 2 employees per store, but the average store does $2.6 million in revenue per year. It's one of the highest sales per sq.ft in all of retail.\n\nHere is where it gets interesting. The stock used to trade at over $100, but has since fallen to $7. Housing and renovation stocks took a bath in 2018 and 2019, but in 2020 housing is staging a huge turnaround due to tight supply and low interest rates. The housing and renovation indexes ITB and XHB are now at all time highs. LL has been lagging, but the same store sales comps going forward are super easy because the company had a terrible 2019. They should be able to post comps in 2020 of 5%.\n\nAlso, the company will receive $25 million from the government because they overpaid on tariffs last year. They are literally getting a check from the gov for $25 million. \n\nAnd in December, the company upped their guidance for 2019. And they will announce earning next week. This was their December [press release](http://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=101533&amp;ref=114672187&amp;type=HTML&amp;symbol=LL&amp;companyName=Lumber+Liquidators+Holdings+Inc&amp;formType=8-K&amp;dateFiled=2019-12-12&amp;CK=1396033 ).\n\nI have 25,000 shares this morning and plan to buy more. I also have 140 calls for Jan 15, 2021. I really do believe in the company and I see it as a much safer bet than some of the tech stuff which it trading at massive valuations.\n\nThe best way to play this is with call options. The close term Feb 28, $8 calls are trading at $0.50. I think this stock will see a huge bump on earnings day (Feb 25) and these could easily be worth $2. (I plan to buy 100 of these calls). \n\nAlso, for a longer term play, the Jan 2021 $13 calls are trading at $0.60. I am thinking the stock should easily reach at least $15 by the end of the year, so these should be $2. It's a triple and you have a whole year to get there. And if it can get to $20, (it was at $26 less than 2 years ago) you will more than 10x your money. (I have 140 of these calls).\n\n*ALSO* The short interest in LL shares is almost 40%. When this stock starts running there will be an epic short squeeze, even worse than what happened with TSLA. It will go up by dollars at a time. And volume is pretty tight and just last week there were [filings](http://investors.lumberliquidators.com/sec-filings ) by Blackrock (owns 16%),  Vanguard (owns 6.4%),  Neil Gagnon (owns 4.8%) and  T. ROWE PRICE (owns 5.7%). So, over 30% is owned by these 4 firms, plus in total almost 80% is owned by [institutions]( https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ll/institutional-holdings ). The 40% short interest will be difficult for shorts to unwind given the light volume. Any covering will send shares much higher on any good news. \n\n*Remember, LL shares doubled in 2 weeks last August when the founder tried to buy back the company - This thing has legs*",

        "selftext": "I see many comparisons of the coronavirus outbreak to SARS everywhere. From the media to analysts to WSB posters, everyone loves to compare this coronavirus outbreak to SARS and say that the economy recovered quickly last time, so it will do the same this time. A lot has been discussed about the supply chain disruptions in [other reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f07zut/some_specific_details_about_impending_supply/), so I do not think it is necessary to talk about that. The differences between the diseases themselves as well as a potential pandemic breaking out has been discussed at length too, so I don\u2019t find it necessary to go into that either. What I will do is show how the Chinese economy is much weaker and much different now than when SARS hit in 2003 and focus not too much on the supply side, but mostly on the demand side and the banking industry based on the research I have been doing. I believe that even if factories reopen tomorrow at 100% efficiency (they have been struggling to reopen amidst [labor shortages](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/china-coronavirus-its-still-far-from-business-as-usual.html)), coronavirus is completely eradicated, and everyone starts consuming at the same levels that they would have otherwise, the Chinese economy (and the world economy with it) is still in significant trouble.\n\nChina today is much different than China during the SARS outbreak in 2003, [here are some graphs that show just how different](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/coronavirus-how-china-economy-has-changed-since-sars.html). Notice how China was a much smaller share of the world economy back then (just above 4% according to this graph) compared to 16% now. Services and consumption make up a much larger part of the Chinese economy now, going from a little over 40% back then to around 52% now. According to [this](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/Coronavirus-costs-China-service-sector-144bn-in-1-week) source, that service industry was hit with a $144b loss in a week from coronavirus. SARS was estimated to do [$33 billion in damage to the world economy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/u-s-and-others-tighten-curbs-on-travel-to-china-virus-toll-hits-213-idUSKBN1ZT374), coronavirus did an estimated 330% more damage (not adjusted for inflation) just to the Chinese service industry (and I think that is an underestimate) in one week. China also accounts for over 12% of global exports now as opposed to a little over 6% back in 2003. China also accounts for [one-third of global GDP growth](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/07/25/na072618-chinas-economic-outlook-in-six-charts).\n\nChinese tourism has boomed since 2003 too. Tourism to Hong Kong has dropped off sharply thanks to the protests as well as coronavirus, [going from 200,000 visitors per day in February 2019 to less than 3,000 now](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQ358ruWsAA8AZb?format=jpg&amp;name=medium). Most flights to/from America (and other countries) are cancelled through the end of [March or April](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/14/world/14reuters-china-health-airlines-factbox.html). SARS hit a manufacturing based economy growing at a 12% rate and that was only 4% of the world economy. This is a service based economy growing at 6% (if you believe the real numbers) that is 16% of the world economy. You can't make up the tourism or services revenue like you can with manufacturing. 750m people [according to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/business/china-coronavirus-lockdown.amp.html#click=https://t.co/ZuO31QVi6g) are currently under some form of lockdown. Even if these quarantines lift soon (that\u2019s a major question), the massive tourism industry both to and from China has taken a huge hit for the near future that cannot be recovered.\n\nIn December 2019, a Moody\u2019s analyst called Chinese corporate debt the [biggest threat to the global economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/17/chinas-corporate-debt-is-biggest-threat-to-global-economy-moodys.html). [4.9% of China\u2019s private issuers defaulted on loans in 2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-markets-default/chinas-private-firms-face-record-default-risk-to-stay-high-in-2020-fitch-idUKL4N28K1YM). This number is up from 0.6% in 2014. Banks have been [encouraged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-gdp-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-shadow-bankers-sneak-back-to-market-idUSKBN1ZG0D5) to give loans to tiny, risky businesses while also trying to get bad debt off their books. Due to problems with their banking system, China nationalized its first bank in [20 years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-27/china-s-first-bank-seizure-in-20-years-spooks-lenders-investors) last year. Then they proceeded to take over [two more](https://www.theepochtimes.com/beijing-nationalizes-third-bank-in-3-months_3036953.html). This over-leveraged banking system had been showing its cracks before coronavirus made China grind to a halt for a month. Questions have been raised as to whether or not the industry can be leaned on for an economic recovery as hard as the Chinese government is leaning on it now.\n\nThis was an economy [in trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/economy/china-economy-gdp.html) before the coronavirus hit. The [shadow banking system](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-08/trouble-is-brewing-in-the-darkest-corner-of-china-shadow-banking) appears to have gotten out of control. [Shadow banking accounted for 39% and 45% of total lending in Q1 and Q2 2019](https://www.ft.com/content/4c66b622-dea5-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc). According to Bloomberg, wealth managers have been offering \u201chigh yield products\u201d to investors and have been using their own capital to make these returns whole due to that high default rate mentioned in the last paragraph. The Bloomberg article states that, \u201cbecause the products are opaque and regulation is minimal, nobody knows exactly how much money is at risk.\u201d This article is from October 2019, before coronavirus became a concern.\n\nThis is not an economy poised to bounce back like it did with SARS in 2003, despite what the market thinks. It might take a while for the market to realize it, but all it takes is a look at the data to see why that assertion is false. The market is focused on the fact that the virus won't kill us all and not on the fact that the lost revenue from Chinese consumption cannot be made up, despite the CCP propaganda that is being put out from Chinese government officials and Chinese economists. [An article from Barron\u2019s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/coronavirus-brings-chinas-debt-problem-back-into-light-51581679800?mod=hp_LEAD_1) has this to say:\n\n&gt;One area, in particular, is back at the forefront\u2014local debt. Policy makers have directed regional lenders to tolerate a higher threshold for bad loans, hoping to keep thousands of small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) from collapsing amid the economic standstill. A survey conducted recently by Peking and Tsinghua universities\u2014China\u2019s top two schools\u2014found that two-thirds of such firms said they could stay afloat no more than one to two months with their current savings. An additional 18% said they could last at most three months.\n\n&gt;Put another way, 85% of China\u2019s SMEs would crumble within three months without financial injections of some sort.\n\n[Here](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/china/china%20and%20the%20world%20inside%20the%20dynamics%20of%20a%20changing%20relationship/mgi-china-and-the-world-full-report-vf.ashx) is a report from McKinsey from July 2019 that has a lot of good data in it regarding China\u2019s exposure to the world economy. I\u2019m just going to post some direct quotes and charts from the report and let you decide what they mean:\n\n&gt;In 11 of the 16 quarters since 2015, consumption contributed more than 60 percent of [China\u2019s] total GDP growth.\n\n&gt;In the United States, among the firms listed in the MSCI USA index, revenue exposure to China amounted to 15 percent of the IT sector, 7 percent of materials, and 6 percent of industrials. In 2017, US companies were estimated to have generated around $450 billion to $500 billion revenue in China through a mix of exports and revenue from Chinese subsidiaries.\n\n[Here](https://i.imgur.com/tebHQRv.png) is a chart from the report showing how exposed the world is to China. Luckily for us, as shown in the above report, US exposure to China is not as massive as you might think. The exposure comes mostly from the rest of Asia, Australia, and Africa instead of developed markets. However, the amount of exposure from developed countries is not negligible. The technology sector, which has driven the majority of our stock market growth, has a [disproportionate exposure](https://i.imgur.com/UeBdEB0.jpg) to revenue coming from China, especially semiconductors like Intel, Micron, Nvidia, and AMD. That chart uses data from 2017 so I would almost guarantee it is less now, but still concerning.\n\nWhile 4 of the 5 mega caps that make up [almost 20% of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s value](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4323952-s-and-p-500-five-great-tech-titans-of-america) and have generated [1/5 of S&amp;P 500 returns since 2009](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-15/all-the-ways-stock-market-bulls-have-gone-off-the-rails-again) don\u2019t have much, if any, China exposure on a surface level. However, Apple derived [16.7% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/apple-impact-of-coronavirus-on-china-business.html) from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in 2019. Not to mention that Foxconn factories are still mostly closed down over there and not producing anything. Additionally, [20% of Amazon\u2019s COGS for private label brands is attributable to China](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/how-much-amazon-wayfair-will-have-to-boost-prices-tariffs-2019-9-1028499095). Due to how prevalent indexing is, I believe that a tech selloff lead by semiconductors and Apple (just like the old trade war selloffs) would drag down all megacap tech stocks and present a good entry point for an eventual recovery.\n\nAll of this comes on top of Boeing\u2019s struggles with the 737 Max, which are expected to cut US GDP growth by [20%](https://www.axios.com/boeing-production-freeze-gdp-impact-737-max-d2b3b7c9-9a3b-4a2a-a3a0-a49fb54156d0.html) in 2020. In 2017 and 2018, China accounted for [22%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/boeing-plane-deliveries-china-737-max-crash-comac-airbus-trade-deal-51579101765) of Boeing plane deliveries. In 2019, that number dropped to 12%. These struggles with China\u2019s economy and the self inflicted 737 Max struggles will put even more downward pressure on US GDP growth for this year. The phase one trade deal was expected to help Boeing out, but there are now [questions](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/14/china-united-states-trade-deal-commitments-coronavirus-trump-energy-huawei/) as to whether or not China will hold up to their end of it. \n\nIn addition to these Chinese economic struggles, other Asian countries are showing economic woes as well. Singapore just cut their 2020 GDP forecast from 0.5%-2.5% to -0.5%-1.5%. Japan released their Q4 2019 GDP numbers, showing its largest GDP decline since 2014, an annualized rate of [-6.3%](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en/news-and-analysis/singapore-cuts-2020-growth-forecast-japan-gdp-slumps), coming in way lower than analyst expectations of -2.6%. This was before the coronavirus started sweeping Asia, the Q1 GDP numbers could be worse. While China is responsible for 12.6% of our trade, Japan accounts for 5.4%. A Japanese recession will hurt us too.\n\nTo summarize and give some of my personal opinions to go along with this data, I believe the Chinese economy is in a lot more trouble than most people realize. The shadow banking system is massive and their banks are incredibly over leveraged. There are questions as to whether or not banks can perform the economic stimulus that China is demanding from them to keep small and medium sized firms open. I believe that the data shows China is in very dangerous economic territory that could lead to a recession or at least a major drop in growth for at least Q1 and Q2 2020 that cannot be made up in the second half of the year. It appears to me that these China economic troubles will take a lot of Asia and other developing economies down with them. It remains to be seen if it will take the American economy down too, but I believe that semiconductors and Apple should be trading lower than their current valuations to reflect potential lost growth and revenue streams. I also see Boeing\u2019s struggles continuing to weigh on our GDP growth. I believe the market is fundamentally mispricing risk in the technology sector right now and it will overcorrect downwards in the near future.\n\nTL;DR: China\u2019s economy is potentially going down led by an over-leveraged banking system and it may cause our tech stocks, which derive supply and demand from China, to lead a market correction. Comparing this coronavirus situation to SARS is extremely disingenuous due to the state of the Chinese economy in 2003 compared to the state of the Chinese economy now. The downward pressures from China on world GDP growth as well as Boeing\u2019s pressures on our own GDP growth create a significant risk in all world equity markets that is not being priced in. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re definitely heading towards a US recession or even a global recession, but the risk should not be ignored by world markets, no matter how much liquidity central banks pump in.",

        "selftext": "Following another post this morning, u/closethefuckinglight has been banned from r/wallstreetbets. \n\nThe influx of media attention over the past week on SPCE and LL has made it clear that some users are attempting to use this forum to pump their positions (against Rule 8 of the sub). In addition, the sub has seen a rise in users resulting from media attention and r/all over the past few months. Recently, some pumpers have been able to leverage the size of this community to pump stocks. \n\n**The reason** u/closethefuckinglight **was banned:** \n\nFirst, though not a reason for the ban but an important fact, the user's post on $LL was his first on reddit although he had an account greater than 3 years of age. He used the platform for personal gain by moving markets. \n\nHere is how u/closethefuckinglight was able to move markets:\n\n* The user took a position on a highly shorted, small cap company ($LL has a short interest of 38%, $MIK at 49%)\n* The user posted DD on this sub on the name. Due to the low attention span of users, a post of greater than a paragraph was taken as genius thinking. Users and others that visit the forum then bought calls in large amounts (Call volume on $LL was 73x the 20d average; see: [https://imgur.com/a/iisk8fd](https://imgur.com/a/iisk8fd) taken at 1pm EST)\n   * Posting DD is a good thing. However, it was obvious this user had the intention of pumping. Inn the future, DD should be on stocks that are not penny stocks or small caps. \n      * To those that say this is no different than Citron posting a research piece, tough shit.\n* The large amount of call buying forces market makers to delta hedge their short delta positions by buying stock. When call buying is as widespread as it was yesterday, this causes moves (especially in the low float, penny stock names favored by the poster) \n* Naturally, this causes the underlying to rise and users (including the poster) profit. \n\n**Let's revisit a few rules now (specifically number 8):**\n\n* No penny stocks (stocks under &lt;$10 or market caps below $1bn); users who violate this, will be banned\n   * \"Ford is under $10 and it's not a penny stock\" \n      * \"Go take your shitty dividend and head to r/investing\"\n* No pumping. Period. \n\n**Other actionable items:**\n\n* Any posts or comments on $MIK will be banned. \n* Users seen commenting on posts of u/closethefuckinglight relating to markets in his personal subreddit will be permanently banned. \n\nr/wallstreetbets was created to allow users to discuss higher risk plays. Recent pumping is not in the spirit of this sub, is against the rules, and may be market manipulation.",

Catch a falling knife, wait for the bottom, blahs blahs blahs. I am buying. I am mostly in index funds, although I have positions in several large companies also. I have been around a while, possibly longer than many people here. I was also buying in 2008 when people were freaking out and I have done quite well\n\n2 - Unsubscribe from this sub\nSeriously. This place has become a fear mongering echo chamber lately. Last week people were asking if they should buy at all time highs. Now people are shitting themselves because everything is on sale. I am going to Unsubscribe and try to focus more on my side hustles to generate more cash for buying (see item #1). I am not saying this to be a dick. I am saying it because it is legit unhealthy to freak out and surround yourself with other people that are freaking out.\n\nTake a deep breath. New flu strains surface from time to time, it is very cyclical. Yes, things will get a little worse, but it will rebound and people who buy will be the beneficiaries (don't buy with your rent money obviously,  just be smart). Watch what happens when a vaccine is announced.\n\nJust my two cents. I am going to Unsubscribe now and go for a run. Because good mental &amp; physical health is key.\n\nDownvote away and peace out brothers.",

        "selftext": "Alright so here\u2019s a brief rundown while I wait to hear back from u/WSBgod for permission to post more details.  For now, this is what I\u2019m sharing.  \n\nLet me start by saying that during the mania today, my position was that the whole thing was a hoax.  Many comments were focusing on how options prices were nicely rounded 100.00 and shit like that.  While I didn\u2019t have time to really dive into those details, I was skeptical simply because he claimed to go from $4 million to $8 million.  Nicely doubling your bet is not something you typically do with options, that\u2019s what you do with roulette when betting on black.  It was just too clean.  Of course, it was also very lucky and extremely ballsy\u2014neither of which is uncommon on WSB.\n\nNevertheless, [I took the post down](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f006zu/wsbgod_post_removed_pending_indisputable_proof/) until there was indisputable proof.  Behind the scenes, this was roughly the exchange in modmail with timestamps.\n\n***\n\nHere's the timeline (all in central time)\n\n&gt;1:55pm u/ITradeBaconFutures stickies a comment on mega thread saying [\"Proof or ban\"](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezwbve/reports_of_my_death_have_been_greatly_exaggerated/fgq6q81/)\n\n&gt;3:32pm u/WSBgod messages mods and asks \"What do you recommend?\"\n\n&gt;3:34pm I reply \"idk but it better be good. I'm recommending a screen sharing session\"\n\n&gt;4:28pm u/WSBgod replies \"I'm happy to verify, have nothing to hide and my post history is the best evidence a person could ask for. But I won't do anything that reveals personal information, login credentials, or anything that could be used against me.\"\n\n&gt;4:53pm \"This should be all the evidence you need:\n\n&gt;&lt;link to imgur with his account summary&gt;\n\n&gt;PLEASE do not share this or pass it around and make me regret doing your verification. I know you need to verify to keep BSers off here, but please keep my privacy in mind. Thank you.\"\n\nThe picture was a screenshot of his account summary from his broker with many trades, including tesla\n\n&gt;4:55pm \"Not good enough sorry.\"\n\nThen there was bickering back and forth about what standard of proof meant, and what we could do about it until u/WSBgod capitulated.\n\nAt 5:18pm He accepted the screenshare which we did shortly after.\n\n***\n\nWe went on discord and he shared his screen, where he had a chrome window up with a couple of tabs open to vanguard, one of which was logged in and had a clearly visible **SSL** icon to the left of the address.  He scrolled around (without hitting the top of the screen where his name/account would show).  Once he was done showing me the numbers, I asked him to refresh the page.  He then took the discord window and carefully placed it such that it covered only the contents of the website to hide his name from showing up after the refresh.   The \u201cdiscord censor window\u201d was small enough so that I could see the address bar at all times, and most of the contents of the webpage.  There was no keyboard shortcuts\u2014everything was done by mouse.  He clicked the refresh button, and after a visible refresh of the site, he moved the \u201cdiscord censor window\u201d and showed me that all the numbers remained the same.\n\n***\n\nI\u2019ve taken the video and edited it such that it removes all personal information, but I can\u2019t in good conscience publish it without his consent.  Doing so would eliminate the possibility of anybody ever trusting me (or the mods) with any sort of proof again, and for that reason I will wait and hope to get permission to post it.  Otherwise this is the extent of what I\u2019m sharing.\n\nSo the question remains, could this be fake? Absofuckinglutely.  Could he fake the url, website, broker summary, ssl certificates and inspect/refresh? Yes.  Of course it can be faked.  For all the retard talk that\u2019s thrown around, you all are actually really fucking capable (you\u2019ve proved it time and time again).  I\u2019m not saying that u/WSBgod\u2019s claims are irrefutable, I\u2019m just laying out the proof he gave me.\n\nWhen people make huge ass claims, as mods, the best we can do is ask for \u201cproof.\u201d  Short of asking for his username and password, this was the closest thing that I could think of and I gave him a very short window of time.  Never in the history of WSB have I ever asked to log into somebody\u2019s computer to see their screen. There\u2019s no precedent for that and there\u2019s no reason for him to have anticipated that.  u/fscomeau faked a video but he filmed, edited it on his own time and uploaded it to youtube.  In today\u2019s case, I gave u/WSBgod less than 2 hours to let me on his computer and he did exactly what I asked him to do once I was watching his screen.  As a mod, that is as much proof as I can reasonably ask somebody to give me.  And as a mod, I'm sharing it with you.  If there\u2019s a better method of proof, I\u2019m open to ideas.  If he faked it, then congrats to him for doing a good job at faking and anticipating my response when asking for proof.  And if he made money then congrats to him for scoring big.\n\nThe last note I\u2019ll share is his account balance **did not show $8 million dollars**.  The total balance was slightly less, but it was pretty damn close.  \n\nI\u2019ll let you decide for yourselves based on this information and I hope to be able to post the video soon.",

What you are seeing from the market today is not a panic, it is a realization of how bad the situation has gotten.\n\nCurrently 2 billion people have been directly affected by the coronavirus.

The virus is currently going international, it's incubation period has been proven to be 27 days. That's 27 days when a person without symptoms can start infecting the people around them, and the virus has hit countries where they can't even test for it properly.\n\nI can go on and on about the virus, but the thing is the world is feeling it's effects and stuttering. \n\nNow if you really want to buy the dip, wait. Today is just a tiny stutter before the crash and the best thing you can do is to hold cash untill the full situation is able to be fully assessed.\n\n\nGood luck with getting the tendies, \nand please guys, don't make any rash decisions that will come back to hurt you later.",

Tesla (TSLA) stock has stormed Wall Street with its price surging a whopping over 80% since the beginning of 2020.\n\nShort-sellers are burning their hands on Tesla as the electric car maker released its strong Q4 2019 numbers last week. In less than a week, the Tesla stock has added over $200 to its price making it the first American automobile company to hit $100-billion valuations.\n\nOn Monday, February 3rd, the Tesla stock surged 20% to $780 levels taking the company\u2019s valuations at $140 billion. Indeed, with this move, Tesla has taken Wall Street and global investors by surprise. Monday\u2019s stock price gain was the biggest one-day surge of Tesla in the last six years.\n\nSince the beginning of 2020, the Tesla stock price is up 85% in one-of-its-kind performance. Tesla\u2019s stock performance has forced analysts to revise the calculation and set up new targets ahead.\n\n\nhttps://thecoinrise.com/tesla-stock-hits-780-raising-more-than-80-since-the-start-of-the-year/",

No, I'm still alive and still selling options on TSLA. \n\nSadly I closed those naked calls on Tuesday last week and did not benefit from the the complete reversal on Wednesday. That 69k day loss would have been no loss plus a gain if I were to have held til Friday. However since I was way over leveraged and had negative 113k option buying power that morning, I don't think riding it out would have been a good idea. Shit could have continued up for all I know, and that would have deepened the losses. Life goes on. I could have moped and stayed home, but I actually went out to the gym soon after market close, and then the grocery store afterwards. Still have to eat and workout, even though it was the worst trading day of my life.\n\nThe lone Feb 21 $480c was nearly a reverse 100 bagger when I closed it. Quite possibly the WSB record for a reverse bagger, not that anyone would want to break it. Sold for $4.50 credit, bought back in the $410 range I believe ($40k loss on that strike alone).\n\nMy goal is to get back to even on the year on TSLA alone. I won't give any updates until I get there (if I do). Similar goal is to get back to positive for the year overall even if I don't quite get there with TSLA. Will provide an end of year update. I'm sure you can get an idea of how I'm doing based on my post/comment volume. I tend to turtle when shit is going bad in order to focus on trading. \n\nDespite TSLA only moving 0.68% Tuesday, I happened to capture $11.6k due to the nature of being short vega and benefiting from a drop in volatility: \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hQBre71.png\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or concerns. If you're going through a hard time or similar losses, remember that it isn't the end of the world. It's a blessing and privilege to be able to trade. We once started with nothing.

        "selftext": "I think because of the great recession in '08, when people hear about a coming 'recession' they think it will basically be a collapse like the last time. In reality, a recession is literally just 2 consecutive quarters of GDP growth.\n\nNow since we have to assume bull markets and awesome economies can't last forever, *something* will eventually have to cause a recession. Often times, such as the great recession and great depression, it's caused by unmitigated greed and delusion. Then delusional euphoria for 'no reason' followed by people shutting down (financially) because of fear. Things are great and then all of a sudden things collapse when delusion reaches a maximum. In this case, it's a self fulfilling prophecy.  When confidence returns, and all the nonsensical businesses are purged, things can return.\n\n**BUT**, say we get a recession because of this virus. Would that even be surprise at all? Obviously people are going to not want to go outside, or buy a new car for a trip they no longer want to go on, and suddenly people are more concerned with staying healthy than having the latest new dumb gadget or fancy clothes. It's a recession that has a **reason**. \n\nAnd I think it will be a lot easier to swallow for the general public. Like, \"of course we had a recession, no one was buying anything because of the virus!\" But once things cool off\n\nBut I'd argue the result is the same. The crappy unnecessary businesses and products will fail, and the higher quality stuff remains. But once things cool down, like if we get a vaccine after a year, it's possible we'll come out of the other end with the benefits of having the fat cut, but way less uncertainty, and dare I say optimism. There will be a light at the end of the tunnel so to speak.\n\nI don't know if I really have a point, I was just wondering what thoughts everyone else had and it might make a good discussion.",

        "selftext": "Oh boy, where do I begin. I just wanted some people to share my story with. Very few friends (1), no family. I hope that it's not the end of the road for me. You guys can be my friends too. I did enjoy my time spending here.\n\nI'm genuinely somewhere on the assburger spectrum. Have experience in a few graduate level work. PhD in physics and masters level experience in two other STEM fields. Got hired by an AI consulting firm with 100k salary. Worked for a year or so there, saved up about 30k. I was the best at the office! Delivering results after results and my superiors loved me.  Even got a raise near the end of last year. Annual review was stellar.\n\nThat changed when my superiors handed me a project that made no sense at all. They have no relevant experience, and they wouldn't listen when I told them that it is not going to work. They must have signed a contract with clients. I had no say in what projects are feasible even when I have the experience. I tried to get something to work - but in the end they just told me not to do it. Note that I still got a raise at the end of year review. \n\nThe manager misunderstood some key concepts and I tried to tell him. He doubled down and pretty much called me an idiot (note that I had 10 years experience more than him). I stopped going to work social functions. I think that this is the reason why I got fired. There was no warnings what so ever. I don't even know what I did wrong. \n\nMy first bet was on BYND put $6000 for Feb 25 125c just a day after it went parabolic early January. It went so high! I think it reached a price of $125 in two days, and my $6000 turned into 24k. I was a moron and didn't sell. Only panic sold when it was at $12000. Making a 6k profit. I thought I really cracked the stock market with my TA then. And I kept making OTM bets like that. I thought BYND was a good stock so I kept buying calls on it. \n\nThen the beer flu happened. Everything just dropped, and I sold everything,  taking a 80% loss. Account down to about 6k. RIP. But I'm determined to build it back up. Did some researches on meme stocks everyone's talking about and found out SPCE. Everything seemed to click, many catalysts in the near future, and Richard Branson just won't die in a rocket crash. I put everything in and it's at about 10-12k. I shared what I found with WSB and everyone seemed to like it, I'm glad that I was able to help you guys print money. The post was here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f18oud/spce\\_is\\_going\\_parabolic\\_very\\_soon\\_and\\_this\\_week/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f18oud/spce_is_going_parabolic_very_soon_and_this_week/).\n\nI feel like I'm going to take on another career path. Too much political correctness in AI, I was actually trying to look around for another job for a few months. Even given my experience and credential, it was very hard to get an offer. I guess being being an aspie can't really bond with the interviewers during the short times spent in interviews. I'll talk to my personal trainer next week and see if I can find a job as a trainer. At least I will be able to help guys get healthier, which is a much more meaningful job than making sure AI's aren't racist.\n\nIf you get through this far, thank you. I really appreciate. I just wanted to share this with someone. Peace.",

Can I dump my net worth into $0.01 OTM contracts to quickly double or triple my money?\nA: You sure can, and theta gang will thank you for it. See: theta, liquidity, delta. You will lose.\n\n2. Is (insert generic meme RH ticker) a good option to buy? (Note they don\u2019t mention call/put or strike)\nA: Quit polluting our sub and do your own research. There are so many books and videos you may never finish all the resources.\n\n3. I have $3k to blow, what should I spend it on?\nA: See 2, also odd flex but ok.\n\n4. Options trading is so easy, how do you guys even lose money lol?\nA: First one (or two, maybe three) is free. I\u2019ll be on the winning end of your trade before you know it, rookie.\n\n5. What is a call (or a put)?\nA: A way to donate money to theta gang. Seriously I\u2019m all for answering questions but I can\u2019t handle this dumb shit that google can answer in 10 seconds.",

        "selftext": "So first of I'm a german, and I've been a perma bull up until today.\n\nThe first 16 infections with the coronavirus Germany had were all people that worked at \"Webasto\", a car part supplier from bavaria. These infections happened because a woman from china came to webasto to take part in a seminar. Webasto even closed their Headquarters and people that came in contact with infected people were closely monitored and had to stay at home. This way there weren't any new infections.\n\nNow we got an issue tho. First there was a new infection in Baden-Wuerttemberg that was related to the infections in Italy. But even worse, yesterday we got headlines that a new infection in North Rhine-Westphalia (A state in germany that isn't close to bavaria or the company Webasto) was diagnosed and the person is being treated in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\nSo what's the big deal? Well this last week we had carnival in Germany. People who know carnival know it's fucking wild. A ton of drunk people partying and dancing together, hugging, making out whatever, you get the deal, it's basically the perfect place to infect a billion people in 3 seconds. And the guy I just talked about? Well, he reportedly took place in carnival celebrations... oh and by the way his wife works as a Kindergartener.\nLike 30 minutes ago the news were saying there are five new cases, now there are apparently 7 and it's unclear how many people might walk around infected without noticing.\n\nTo top it off our health minister Jens Spahn just said that we're at the beginning of an epidemic in Germany.\n\nI think Germany might be fucked, not sure yet... but potentially pretty fucked. And I know people said nobody cares about italy when somebody said \"GuYs ItS rEaLlY bAd In ItAlY\". But I do feel like germany might have a bigger influence on the global economy than Italy. \n\nTL;DR: Some dude went partying to celebrate carnival without knowing he had the coronavirus. Germanys coronavirus infections might potentially skyrocket over the next couple of days.",

At all. And at the risk of sounding alarmist, I am going to put my neck out there and say that this thing is the inevitable shock that always seems to kick off a recession. With that said, it's going to take a little bit of time before markets digest the supply shocks that are going to come through from China's shutdown. And past that point, I really don't think anybody is pricing in the fact that this is going to start to mandate shutdowns elsewhere. \n\nThe funny thing, is that from a data perspective, we actually were starting to get a mild recovery in the macro regime, suggesting the Fed may have actually engineered a sort of soft landing, at least for a short bit. Given, that soft landing would be heavily stimulus and debt fueled, but, the means don't matter in the short term.  But this item is coming at a very very very bad time, and the economy just is not prepared to handle this even slightly. The markets obviously are not reflecting this right now, but markets are not efficient, and there are a variety of reasons for this.\n\nI will say, we likely will see some sort of massive wave of additional stimulus, or at least an attempt at it. But the transmission mechanisms of getting said stimulus to the people who need it is going to cause this to falter when it's needed most.",

What an actual load of horse shit. Just like with Iran a few months ago. There was a minor sell off every week and it was because of \u201cfears over Iran\u201d. But then the market would be back up to all time highs. These news sources try to explain market volatility in the most clickbait ways possible. I get that the corona virus is temporarily affecting profit speculation and some production but the market has bigger issues such as the inverting yield curve, outrageously high PE ratios, overbought market as a whole, illiquid funds from investors, and potential for an interest hike.",

Needless to say after finding this community last week, I pulled some money from my personal savings that I was using to put towards fixing up my basement a bit to try to invest and get some extra capital to help out back home. Worst case if I lost it all, it was for my basement, no big deal.\n\nI watched probably 30 hours of video around options, read nearly every discussion on here, and observed the discord for a while. I started trading around the Ally / AMD spam, was up 2k on my way to work and down 1700 by the time i got there. Lesson learned. \n\nI reached out to some of you for advice in the discord, was called a retard (thanks, I know it's a term of endearment) , and was given some really great advice and guidance. I asked probably 100 stupid questions, but was always given some really strong answers (and sarcastic abuse)\n\nEnd of today I sold my last group of SPY puts (right before the stupid 2.5% upswing) . I ended up around +2000 total . Far from the likes of a lot of you, but 2000 more that will immensely help back home. \n\nI just wanted to take a minute to say thank you to everyone here, even the psychopaths that sometimes blow my mind. \n\nNot sure if I'll dive back in next week - I think Im just going to take the money and run and do what I can to continue helping out - but again, thank you, retards.",

        "selftext": "I see so many comments on here anytime the market drops like \"stocks are on sale\" or \"if you loved stocks last week, then you should love them even more this week,\" which seem to focus only on the price, without understanding what the price of a stock or the market consists of: future earnings expectations. \n\nJust because the price of a stock was X last week doesn't mean that price has any relevance to the price this week. And just because a stock rose 100% last year, doesn't mean that the stock is any more or less attractive today based on its past history, at least from a fundamental perspective. \n\nWhen you are only factoring in past prices (without analyzing new, forward-looking information) you are engaging in **anchoring,** a psychological concept that overweights initial information you are presented with. \n\nHere is a relatively concise analysis of the current market's outlook from Frank Curzio, who like every analyst, has had his hits and misses, but is usually quite bullish that actually displays analysis based on new information related to earnings. I would link, but this came from an email update.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAccording to Capital IQ, S&amp;P's research division, companies in the S&amp;P 500 are expected to generate a combined $181 in earnings per share (EPS) in 2020. That's 14% higher than the $159 in combined EPS the S&amp;P 500 generated in 2019.\u00a0\n\nNow that the coronavirus has spread... there's no way earnings are growing 14% this year. In fact, Goldman Sachs\u2014which once called the virus a \u201dshort-term problem\"\u2014just published a report saying earnings will not grow in 2020.\u00a0\n\nI think this is conservative, given the number of companies that have lowered earnings over the past two weeks (including Apple and Microsoft, two of the biggest names in the S&amp;P 500). But it's important that investors understand these numbers.\u00a0\n\nIf we see no earnings growth in 2020... that means 2020 earnings will come in at $159 a share, at most. But if we divide the current price of the S&amp;P 500 (about $3,050) by the $159 in combined earnings... we can see that **the S&amp;P 500 is** **already** **trading at 19x forward earnings.**\n\nIn other words, even though the market pulled back more than 10%... the S&amp;P 500 is still trading like there's no coronavirus. (Remember, earnings are falling alongside the markets... that's why the market is still expensive despite its 10% correction).\u00a0\n\nAt 19x forward earnings, the markets are still pricing in significant growth. Yet, earnings probably won't grow at all in 2020...\u00a0\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n**There's likely another 20% downside from here.**\n\nWith no actual growth forecast for 2020, the market should be trading closer to 15x\u2014the 10-year average... and more than 20% lower than current levels.\n\nOf course, this downside could be limited if we find a vaccine for the coronavirus in the short term... or if we see massive government intervention to help backstop the markets. (Things like lowering interest rates, preventing short selling, or injecting cash directly into the markets.)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo anytime someone says stocks are on sale, or cheap, or a good time to buy, you should ask them, \"what are you basing that information on?\" The fact that the price is cheaper than it was last week/month/year means nothing without understanding the earnings picture.",

        "selftext": "Yo fuckers, listen up!\n\nI see a lot of people just YOLO'ing their life savings on the next meme stock here. Yes, it's more fun than buying a lottery ticket and your chances of success are higher. Wait, are they?\n\nAs a physicist and mathematician, I feel the need to at least tell my fellow autists how to bet properly.\n\nThere's something called the [Kelly criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion), which tells you whether a bet is favorable or not. I'm not boring you with the details, so just read the article if you're smart. But at its core it's a really simple formula:\n\n    f* = p - q/b\n\n, where f\\* is the Kelly criterion, p is the probability of success, q is the probability of going tits up and b is the profit-risk-ratio.\n\nTrading software like TWS and many others give you the probability of success, when you create an order. So p and q are known. f\\* needs to be positive, the bigger the better. b is what we want to know.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n    p - q/b &gt; 1\n    p &gt; q/b\n    b &gt; q/p\n    b &gt; (1-p)/p , because q = 1-p\n    b &gt; 1/p - 1\n\nI wrote out every step, so even the biggest idiot can understand it. So if your probability of success is 70%, your profit-risk-ratio needs to be `1/70% - 1 = 42.9%`. That means if you risk $100, you need to potentially earn at least $43.\n\nBut those numbers are only interesting for the theta gang and them losers in r/investing.\n\nMy strong handed r/wallstreetbets friends, with balls made out of steel, need an example that better suits their need for the ultimate thrill.\n\nSo let's say you buy a call that is 20% OTM at 280% IV. For example a Feb'28 40c on $SPCE. The underlying is currently at $33 and the call costs $3.50.\n\nThis will give you a 27% chance of success, so the profit-risk-ratio needs to be `1/27% - 1 = 270%`. If you exit these trades at less profit than an average 270% on your investment, math clearly states that you'll definitely go tits up. \n\nIf you bought this Feb'28 40c on $SPCE for $350, you need to sell it for at least $947 (on average over all your trades). It's even a bit more, because of commissions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow listen, this is the optimal way of betting, but there's still a risk of going bankrupt. If you do an evolution on the Kelly bet, more than 90% of them diverge (go to infinity), but 10% still converge (go tits up). So people like Warren Buffet only do 20%-50% of the Kelly criterium.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you retards actually learned something.",

        "selftext": "In my city there's a big bank that offers trading courses with the idea that you will know what you're doing when you open a trading account with them. So far so good, as what I've been learning is mainly from shitposts on the internet and fundamentals in investor books have not been of much help making quick tendies which is just how I like them - what I do is pretty much the opposite as I'm getting richer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I sign up, start going, guy talking is professional but still you can tell he's not dead inside, pretty cool. He's talking about doing analysis, volatility, figures and so on. He's always repeating himself saying how important risk management is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe shows a graph tracking his first 10 months of trading when he started some years ago, he turned 2k into 180k.... and then to 1k in 2 trades. Of course I start laughing a little bit, thinking yeah well that's life, other people in the course are very concerned, they seem to be r/inv\\*sting kind of people. He says to never put more than 10% of your portfolio into 1 thing and not allow yourself to lose more than 2% in a trade. Emphasizes that we need to follow the current trend as it's likely to keep going but never go overboard and blah blah\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo later at one point he's once again saying how important it is to keep in mind some boring real numbers, people ask him about currency trading and he's explaining the boring figures. I ask him what he thinks of $TSLA, he stops for a moment and says that this is just some hype and not sustainable. Then another guy on the course asks how we should trade during the China virus, guy says basically that we should be extra careful. He implies Trump tweets have an important role in market movements. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen he says that if you're having any emotions while trading, you're doing it wrong. I feel personally attacked as trading has become a big source of entertainment, despair and anger, often all at the same time. Ask him how he's trading during a market that's at an all time high. He says he has sold all his positions rn because it's not sustainable and shit will hit the fan any moment now even though he admits it probably won't happen before the end of summer. Ask him why he's not making tendies until then, he says it's beyond his personal risk tolerance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what I learned is that I'm doing trading totally technically wrong but still making more tendies than this professional guy is. Turns out we are smarter even though perhaps more retarded than professional traders. Buy all the dips and market can't go down, stonks only go up. If you read this far you should know MSFT is boring, what the hell is that slow rise pffft, going 90% of portfolio in SPCE. Make money while you can and good luck bulls",

        "selftext": "I've been reading all these SPCE bullish posts and it seems like no one has figured out the math behind this company. I'm hearing valuations of 50B, 100B, etc. Currently it is valued at 5B per the ticker value. \n\nSo lets do some math here.\n\n5B valuation - company has 120M in potential revenue for the 600 customers (250k per ticket).\n\nThey will probably begin flying something after July since they are trying to reserve the first flight for Sir Richard for his 70th birthday, so I'd imagine the 600 pre-ordered customers will have to fly thereafter which should take up the rest of the year. \n\nAt 5B, they are valued at almost 42x their revenue. That's at roughly $30 per share.\n\nThen there's raging bull over there with 750k in options talking about seeing $50 end of this year, that's 8.3B valuation. only 69x their revenue. YEAH 69.\n\nThen we have retard analyst over there telling his relatives to buy up those calls to make them proud on television talking about $60PT. Which is an 82x revenue.\n\nJust think about it. Space tourism is big and all, but SPCE cannot scale like BlueOrigins or SpaceX. The moment these guys IPO, these analysts and fake bulls gonna hop right over like a gold digger.\n\nAnd, even at 5B valuation, let's say a reasonable revenue forward is 20x. That's still 500M in revenue that it has to do. Do the math again, based on the 250k pricetag, that's about 2000 passengers a year. \n\nHow many millionaires you think gonna drop 250k on a couple minute trip in space each year? 2000?",

        "selftext": "What's up fellow tendie-chasing autists!\n  \nI wanted to point out some option plays that are prime for a run over the next several weeks.  I entered these positions today.\n\nDisclaimer:  Again.  I entered these positions today.  This means I am holding this position.  This is a meme post, not financial advise.\n  \nRight.  Anyway.\n  \nVSLR.  It's a sympathy play to ENPH.  All of those who are butt hurt about missing a 40%+ run in ENPH should look at this one.  It has earnings coming up in March.  And there was a 3K contract sweep in the March 15 strike calls.  Why?  Because it's going to follow suit.  And you have a freaking MONTH.\n  \nNext up on the list is ACM.  Consistently hit my significant volume scanner and the MM's kept knocking it back down each and every time.  Huge volume spikes to $51 then they'd kick it back down to the median $50.  Then a huge volume spike to $52 and then they'd kick it back down to $50.50.  Almost to get people not to notice?  But hey scanners notice.\n  \nSo what's cool about this one.  There's 13K contracts swept in the March 50 strike calls.  And another 13K contracts swept in the March 55 strike calls.  There's chatter that they're going to be sold.  For what price?  Your guess is as good as mine.  There were articles circulating back in January that they were reaching an agreement.  So, with this many contracts purchased, it seems like somebody knows something.  So I followed it.  Oh - and it reminds me of the same exact thing that happened with TCO (taubman mall or whatever the hell it's called).  I noticed significant volume and it kept going right back to the median price.  Over and over.  And tons of call sweeps.  I bought calls for months out, and then I sold them a few days later for a few thousand buckaroonies.  Low and behold, I woke up a week ago to find that the company was bought for $50-something-retarded dollars per share.  Which would have netted me a cool $100K but I panzied and sold for just a few hundred Big Macs.\n  \nFinally I'd like to point out CARG.  What's going on there?  Nothing.  Nothing's going on there.  There's not really any sweeps.  But I like the chart.  It looks like a potential gap fill to $35.  The $30 and $35 strike calls for March are retardedly cheap.  And CAR just had a blowout earnings, so it could be sympathy with it.  They're clearly running the auto stocks - CAR, KAR, CVNA, and CARG, all popping on my scanner today, all day long.\n  \nNext on the block is what everyone's already heard - L brands (LB).  Yeah yeah they're selling Victoria's Secret, it's about to close, blah blah blah.  But earnings are coming up, too, and there was a big sweep on the $25 strike calls expiring this Friday.  And a nice volume on the $27's.  Do they close this week?  I have absolutely no idea.  But I followed it.\n  \n**This is not financial advice.  These are just things I saw in the market.  Do your own due diligence.  I'm not selling any of my contracts to anyone here.  In fact this post is a giant meme and should be laughed at.**",

With points one and two in mind I would expect a little more pain though is possible because a) we have a hit to a manufacturing sector b) retail leverage and stock marker prices are at an all time high\n4. Media outlets only care about the \"dramatic\" - the will say \"worst drop ever\"  \"1,000 points\" etc. They will start to reference \"points\" vs percentage in headlines for the dramatic effect (a 1,000 point now is not as significant as a 1,000 drop a decade ago)\n5. Expect wild swings due to retail investors who never saw a drop and leverage being used - especially in the afternoons as people get margin called.  \n6. Dramatic increases in volume will also be a sign of a bottom (The Bottom) as people finally \"give up\" and go back to their fast good job\n7. The hit to China is UNDER estimated while the hit to the USA is OVER estimated.  We are not China. I spent a lot of time there... Friends and Family from China travel to the US for products and health care.  China has almost no healthcare and shit sanitation.  If they are not all dead the virus cannot be that bad.

That said, when it drops it'll be epic and I look forward to seeing the fallout.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck fellow autists!",

        "selftext": "I see many comparisons of the coronavirus outbreak to SARS everywhere. From the media to analysts to WSB posters, everyone loves to compare this coronavirus outbreak to SARS and say that the economy recovered quickly last time, so it will do the same this time. A lot has been discussed about the supply chain disruptions in [other reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f07zut/some_specific_details_about_impending_supply/), so I do not think it is necessary to talk about that. The differences between the diseases themselves as well as a potential pandemic breaking out has been discussed at length too, so I don\u2019t find it necessary to go into that either. What I will do is show how the Chinese economy is much weaker and much different now than when SARS hit in 2003 and focus not too much on the supply side, but mostly on the demand side and the banking industry based on the research I have been doing. I believe that even if factories reopen tomorrow at 100% efficiency (they have been struggling to reopen amidst [labor shortages](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/china-coronavirus-its-still-far-from-business-as-usual.html)), coronavirus is completely eradicated, and everyone starts consuming at the same levels that they would have otherwise, the Chinese economy (and the world economy with it) is still in significant trouble.\n\nChina today is much different than China during the SARS outbreak in 2003, [here are some graphs that show just how different](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/coronavirus-how-china-economy-has-changed-since-sars.html). Notice how China was a much smaller share of the world economy back then (just above 4% according to this graph) compared to 16% now. Services and consumption make up a much larger part of the Chinese economy now, going from a little over 40% back then to around 52% now. According to [this](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/Coronavirus-costs-China-service-sector-144bn-in-1-week) source, that service industry was hit with a $144b loss in a week from coronavirus. SARS was estimated to do [$33 billion in damage to the world economy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/u-s-and-others-tighten-curbs-on-travel-to-china-virus-toll-hits-213-idUSKBN1ZT374), coronavirus did an estimated 330% more damage (not adjusted for inflation) just to the Chinese service industry (and I think that is an underestimate) in one week. China also accounts for over 12% of global exports now as opposed to a little over 6% back in 2003. China also accounts for [one-third of global GDP growth](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/07/25/na072618-chinas-economic-outlook-in-six-charts).\n\nChinese tourism has boomed since 2003 too. Tourism to Hong Kong has dropped off sharply thanks to the protests as well as coronavirus, [going from 200,000 visitors per day in February 2019 to less than 3,000 now](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQ358ruWsAA8AZb?format=jpg&amp;name=medium). Most flights to/from America (and other countries) are cancelled through the end of [March or April](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/14/world/14reuters-china-health-airlines-factbox.html). SARS hit a manufacturing based economy growing at a 12% rate and that was only 4% of the world economy. This is a service based economy growing at 6% (if you believe the real numbers) that is 16% of the world economy. You can't make up the tourism or services revenue like you can with manufacturing. 750m people [according to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/business/china-coronavirus-lockdown.amp.html#click=https://t.co/ZuO31QVi6g) are currently under some form of lockdown. Even if these quarantines lift soon (that\u2019s a major question), the massive tourism industry both to and from China has taken a huge hit for the near future that cannot be recovered.\n\nIn December 2019, a Moody\u2019s analyst called Chinese corporate debt the [biggest threat to the global economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/17/chinas-corporate-debt-is-biggest-threat-to-global-economy-moodys.html). [4.9% of China\u2019s private issuers defaulted on loans in 2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-markets-default/chinas-private-firms-face-record-default-risk-to-stay-high-in-2020-fitch-idUKL4N28K1YM). This number is up from 0.6% in 2014. Banks have been [encouraged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-gdp-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-shadow-bankers-sneak-back-to-market-idUSKBN1ZG0D5) to give loans to tiny, risky businesses while also trying to get bad debt off their books. Due to problems with their banking system, China nationalized its first bank in [20 years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-27/china-s-first-bank-seizure-in-20-years-spooks-lenders-investors) last year. Then they proceeded to take over [two more](https://www.theepochtimes.com/beijing-nationalizes-third-bank-in-3-months_3036953.html). This over-leveraged banking system had been showing its cracks before coronavirus made China grind to a halt for a month. Questions have been raised as to whether or not the industry can be leaned on for an economic recovery as hard as the Chinese government is leaning on it now.\n\nThis was an economy [in trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/economy/china-economy-gdp.html) before the coronavirus hit. The [shadow banking system](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-08/trouble-is-brewing-in-the-darkest-corner-of-china-shadow-banking) appears to have gotten out of control. [Shadow banking accounted for 39% and 45% of total lending in Q1 and Q2 2019](https://www.ft.com/content/4c66b622-dea5-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc). According to Bloomberg, wealth managers have been offering \u201chigh yield products\u201d to investors and have been using their own capital to make these returns whole due to that high default rate mentioned in the last paragraph. The Bloomberg article states that, \u201cbecause the products are opaque and regulation is minimal, nobody knows exactly how much money is at risk.\u201d This article is from October 2019, before coronavirus became a concern.\n\nThis is not an economy poised to bounce back like it did with SARS in 2003, despite what the market thinks. It might take a while for the market to realize it, but all it takes is a look at the data to see why that assertion is false. The market is focused on the fact that the virus won't kill us all and not on the fact that the lost revenue from Chinese consumption cannot be made up, despite the CCP propaganda that is being put out from Chinese government officials and Chinese economists. [An article from Barron\u2019s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/coronavirus-brings-chinas-debt-problem-back-into-light-51581679800?mod=hp_LEAD_1) has this to say:\n\n&gt;One area, in particular, is back at the forefront\u2014local debt. Policy makers have directed regional lenders to tolerate a higher threshold for bad loans, hoping to keep thousands of small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) from collapsing amid the economic standstill. A survey conducted recently by Peking and Tsinghua universities\u2014China\u2019s top two schools\u2014found that two-thirds of such firms said they could stay afloat no more than one to two months with their current savings. An additional 18% said they could last at most three months.\n\n&gt;Put another way, 85% of China\u2019s SMEs would crumble within three months without financial injections of some sort.\n\n[Here](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/china/china%20and%20the%20world%20inside%20the%20dynamics%20of%20a%20changing%20relationship/mgi-china-and-the-world-full-report-vf.ashx) is a report from McKinsey from July 2019 that has a lot of good data in it regarding China\u2019s exposure to the world economy. I\u2019m just going to post some direct quotes and charts from the report and let you decide what they mean:\n\n&gt;In 11 of the 16 quarters since 2015, consumption contributed more than 60 percent of [China\u2019s] total GDP growth.\n\n&gt;In the United States, among the firms listed in the MSCI USA index, revenue exposure to China amounted to 15 percent of the IT sector, 7 percent of materials, and 6 percent of industrials. In 2017, US companies were estimated to have generated around $450 billion to $500 billion revenue in China through a mix of exports and revenue from Chinese subsidiaries.\n\n[Here](https://i.imgur.com/tebHQRv.png) is a chart from the report showing how exposed the world is to China. Luckily for us, as shown in the above report, US exposure to China is not as massive as you might think. The exposure comes mostly from the rest of Asia, Australia, and Africa instead of developed markets. However, the amount of exposure from developed countries is not negligible. The technology sector, which has driven the majority of our stock market growth, has a [disproportionate exposure](https://i.imgur.com/UeBdEB0.jpg) to revenue coming from China, especially semiconductors like Intel, Micron, Nvidia, and AMD. That chart uses data from 2017 so I would almost guarantee it is less now, but still concerning.\n\nWhile 4 of the 5 mega caps that make up [almost 20% of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s value](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4323952-s-and-p-500-five-great-tech-titans-of-america) and have generated [1/5 of S&amp;P 500 returns since 2009](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-15/all-the-ways-stock-market-bulls-have-gone-off-the-rails-again) don\u2019t have much, if any, China exposure on a surface level. However, Apple derived [16.7% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/apple-impact-of-coronavirus-on-china-business.html) from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in 2019. Not to mention that Foxconn factories are still mostly closed down over there and not producing anything. Additionally, [20% of Amazon\u2019s COGS for private label brands is attributable to China](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/how-much-amazon-wayfair-will-have-to-boost-prices-tariffs-2019-9-1028499095). Due to how prevalent indexing is, I believe that a tech selloff lead by semiconductors and Apple (just like the old trade war selloffs) would drag down all megacap tech stocks and present a good entry point for an eventual recovery.\n\nAll of this comes on top of Boeing\u2019s struggles with the 737 Max, which are expected to cut US GDP growth by [20%](https://www.axios.com/boeing-production-freeze-gdp-impact-737-max-d2b3b7c9-9a3b-4a2a-a3a0-a49fb54156d0.html) in 2020. In 2017 and 2018, China accounted for [22%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/boeing-plane-deliveries-china-737-max-crash-comac-airbus-trade-deal-51579101765) of Boeing plane deliveries. In 2019, that number dropped to 12%. These struggles with China\u2019s economy and the self inflicted 737 Max struggles will put even more downward pressure on US GDP growth for this year. The phase one trade deal was expected to help Boeing out, but there are now [questions](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/14/china-united-states-trade-deal-commitments-coronavirus-trump-energy-huawei/) as to whether or not China will hold up to their end of it. \n\nIn addition to these Chinese economic struggles, other Asian countries are showing economic woes as well. Singapore just cut their 2020 GDP forecast from 0.5%-2.5% to -0.5%-1.5%. Japan released their Q4 2019 GDP numbers, showing its largest GDP decline since 2014, an annualized rate of [-6.3%](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en/news-and-analysis/singapore-cuts-2020-growth-forecast-japan-gdp-slumps), coming in way lower than analyst expectations of -2.6%. This was before the coronavirus started sweeping Asia, the Q1 GDP numbers could be worse. While China is responsible for 12.6% of our trade, Japan accounts for 5.4%. A Japanese recession will hurt us too.\n\nTo summarize and give some of my personal opinions to go along with this data, I believe the Chinese economy is in a lot more trouble than most people realize. The shadow banking system is massive and their banks are incredibly over leveraged. There are questions as to whether or not banks can perform the economic stimulus that China is demanding from them to keep small and medium sized firms open. I believe that the data shows China is in very dangerous economic territory that could lead to a recession or at least a major drop in growth for at least Q1 and Q2 2020 that cannot be made up in the second half of the year. It appears to me that these China economic troubles will take a lot of Asia and other developing economies down with them. It remains to be seen if it will take the American economy down too, but I believe that semiconductors and Apple should be trading lower than their current valuations to reflect potential lost growth and revenue streams. I also see Boeing\u2019s struggles continuing to weigh on our GDP growth. I believe the market is fundamentally mispricing risk in the technology sector right now and it will overcorrect downwards in the near future.\n\nTL;DR: China\u2019s economy is potentially going down led by an over-leveraged banking system and it may cause our tech stocks, which derive supply and demand from China, to lead a market correction. Comparing this coronavirus situation to SARS is extremely disingenuous due to the state of the Chinese economy in 2003 compared to the state of the Chinese economy now. The downward pressures from China on world GDP growth as well as Boeing\u2019s pressures on our own GDP growth create a significant risk in all world equity markets that is not being priced in. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re definitely heading towards a US recession or even a global recession, but the risk should not be ignored by world markets, no matter how much liquidity central banks pump in.",

        "selftext": "Alright so here\u2019s a brief rundown while I wait to hear back from u/WSBgod for permission to post more details.  For now, this is what I\u2019m sharing.  \n\nLet me start by saying that during the mania today, my position was that the whole thing was a hoax.  Many comments were focusing on how options prices were nicely rounded 100.00 and shit like that.  While I didn\u2019t have time to really dive into those details, I was skeptical simply because he claimed to go from $4 million to $8 million.  Nicely doubling your bet is not something you typically do with options, that\u2019s what you do with roulette when betting on black.  It was just too clean.  Of course, it was also very lucky and extremely ballsy\u2014neither of which is uncommon on WSB.\n\nNevertheless, [I took the post down](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f006zu/wsbgod_post_removed_pending_indisputable_proof/) until there was indisputable proof.  Behind the scenes, this was roughly the exchange in modmail with timestamps.\n\n***\n\nHere's the timeline (all in central time)\n\n&gt;1:55pm u/ITradeBaconFutures stickies a comment on mega thread saying [\"Proof or ban\"](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezwbve/reports_of_my_death_have_been_greatly_exaggerated/fgq6q81/)\n\n&gt;3:32pm u/WSBgod messages mods and asks \"What do you recommend?\"\n\n&gt;3:34pm I reply \"idk but it better be good. I'm recommending a screen sharing session\"\n\n&gt;4:28pm u/WSBgod replies \"I'm happy to verify, have nothing to hide and my post history is the best evidence a person could ask for. But I won't do anything that reveals personal information, login credentials, or anything that could be used against me.\"\n\n&gt;4:53pm \"This should be all the evidence you need:\n\n&gt;&lt;link to imgur with his account summary&gt;\n\n&gt;PLEASE do not share this or pass it around and make me regret doing your verification. I know you need to verify to keep BSers off here, but please keep my privacy in mind. Thank you.\"\n\nThe picture was a screenshot of his account summary from his broker with many trades, including tesla\n\n&gt;4:55pm \"Not good enough sorry.\"\n\nThen there was bickering back and forth about what standard of proof meant, and what we could do about it until u/WSBgod capitulated.\n\nAt 5:18pm He accepted the screenshare which we did shortly after.\n\n***\n\nWe went on discord and he shared his screen, where he had a chrome window up with a couple of tabs open to vanguard, one of which was logged in and had a clearly visible **SSL** icon to the left of the address.  He scrolled around (without hitting the top of the screen where his name/account would show).  Once he was done showing me the numbers, I asked him to refresh the page.  He then took the discord window and carefully placed it such that it covered only the contents of the website to hide his name from showing up after the refresh.   The \u201cdiscord censor window\u201d was small enough so that I could see the address bar at all times, and most of the contents of the webpage.  There was no keyboard shortcuts\u2014everything was done by mouse.  He clicked the refresh button, and after a visible refresh of the site, he moved the \u201cdiscord censor window\u201d and showed me that all the numbers remained the same.\n\n***\n\nI\u2019ve taken the video and edited it such that it removes all personal information, but I can\u2019t in good conscience publish it without his consent.  Doing so would eliminate the possibility of anybody ever trusting me (or the mods) with any sort of proof again, and for that reason I will wait and hope to get permission to post it.  Otherwise this is the extent of what I\u2019m sharing.\n\nSo the question remains, could this be fake? Absofuckinglutely.  Could he fake the url, website, broker summary, ssl certificates and inspect/refresh? Yes.  Of course it can be faked.  For all the retard talk that\u2019s thrown around, you all are actually really fucking capable (you\u2019ve proved it time and time again).  I\u2019m not saying that u/WSBgod\u2019s claims are irrefutable, I\u2019m just laying out the proof he gave me.\n\nWhen people make huge ass claims, as mods, the best we can do is ask for \u201cproof.\u201d  Short of asking for his username and password, this was the closest thing that I could think of and I gave him a very short window of time.  Never in the history of WSB have I ever asked to log into somebody\u2019s computer to see their screen. There\u2019s no precedent for that and there\u2019s no reason for him to have anticipated that.  u/fscomeau faked a video but he filmed, edited it on his own time and uploaded it to youtube.  In today\u2019s case, I gave u/WSBgod less than 2 hours to let me on his computer and he did exactly what I asked him to do once I was watching his screen.  As a mod, that is as much proof as I can reasonably ask somebody to give me.  And as a mod, I'm sharing it with you.  If there\u2019s a better method of proof, I\u2019m open to ideas.  If he faked it, then congrats to him for doing a good job at faking and anticipating my response when asking for proof.  And if he made money then congrats to him for scoring big.\n\nThe last note I\u2019ll share is his account balance **did not show $8 million dollars**.  The total balance was slightly less, but it was pretty damn close.  \n\nI\u2019ll let you decide for yourselves based on this information and I hope to be able to post the video soon.",

Unfortunately ended up losing money on it. \n\n**Account totals:** \n\nCash - 245 CAD or 184 USD\n\nOpen - 10900 CAD or 8216 USD\n\n**Total Equity:**\n\n11145 CAD or 8400 USD \n\n**Profit/Loss all time**\n\n+3254 USD\n\nGoal - 120k USD\n\n\n\nI'm only going to be updating on days I make plays so if I didn't post means I'm just holding the same positions. (or that I made a small insignificant trade). \n\nI got the 100k loan today in cash. Had to pay 20% up front like last time (so loan is 80k). Then knowing me I went to an underground poker place and lost about 8k right now. Paid my other loan shark back his 14k so now that that's taken care of my only debts are to this guy for 100k (20% interest due end of every month starting in March). \n\nHave around 70k in cash right now. Going to see my brother on Sunday to see if he will write me a cheque for it so I can deposit it in the bank and then fund my trading account by Tuesday-ish. \n\nIf not, just going to deposit the cash and say that I got it from a friend as a loan. Deal with the back lash of that with taxes later.",

Tesla (TSLA) stock has stormed Wall Street with its price surging a whopping over 80% since the beginning of 2020.\n\nShort-sellers are burning their hands on Tesla as the electric car maker released its strong Q4 2019 numbers last week. In less than a week, the Tesla stock has added over $200 to its price making it the first American automobile company to hit $100-billion valuations.\n\nOn Monday, February 3rd, the Tesla stock surged 20% to $780 levels taking the company\u2019s valuations at $140 billion. Indeed, with this move, Tesla has taken Wall Street and global investors by surprise. Monday\u2019s stock price gain was the biggest one-day surge of Tesla in the last six years.\n\nSince the beginning of 2020, the Tesla stock price is up 85% in one-of-its-kind performance. Tesla\u2019s stock performance has forced analysts to revise the calculation and set up new targets ahead.\n\n\nhttps://thecoinrise.com/tesla-stock-hits-780-raising-more-than-80-since-the-start-of-the-year/",

        "selftext": "https://i.imgur.com/hVLtoSA.png\n\nJust an update since everyone thinks I'm dead after TSLA went ballistic last week. No, I'm still alive and still selling options on TSLA. \n\nSadly I closed those naked calls on Tuesday last week and did not benefit from the the complete reversal on Wednesday. That 69k day loss would have been no loss plus a gain if I were to have held til Friday. However since I was way over leveraged and had negative 113k option buying power that morning, I don't think riding it out would have been a good idea. Shit could have continued up for all I know, and that would have deepened the losses. Life goes on. I could have moped and stayed home, but I actually went out to the gym soon after market close, and then the grocery store afterwards. Still have to eat and workout, even though it was the worst trading day of my life.\n\nThe lone Feb 21 $480c was nearly a reverse 100 bagger when I closed it. Quite possibly the WSB record for a reverse bagger, not that anyone would want to break it. Sold for $4.50 credit, bought back in the $410 range I believe ($40k loss on that strike alone).\n\nMy goal is to get back to even on the year on TSLA alone. I won't give any updates until I get there (if I do). Similar goal is to get back to positive for the year overall even if I don't quite get there with TSLA. Will provide an end of year update. I'm sure you can get an idea of how I'm doing based on my post/comment volume. I tend to turtle when shit is going bad in order to focus on trading. \n\nDespite TSLA only moving 0.68% Tuesday, I happened to capture $11.6k due to the nature of being short vega and benefiting from a drop in volatility: \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hQBre71.png\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or concerns. If you're going through a hard time or similar losses, remember that it isn't the end of the world. It's a blessing and privilege to be able to trade. We once started with nothing. Money comes and goes, and it's not the most important thing in life.",

        "selftext": "Oh boy, where do I begin. I just wanted some people to share my story with. Very few friends (1), no family. I hope that it's not the end of the road for me. You guys can be my friends too. I did enjoy my time spending here.\n\nI'm genuinely somewhere on the assburger spectrum. Have experience in a few graduate level work. PhD in physics and masters level experience in two other STEM fields. Got hired by an AI consulting firm with 100k salary. Worked for a year or so there, saved up about 30k. I was the best at the office! Delivering results after results and my superiors loved me.  Even got a raise near the end of last year. Annual review was stellar.\n\nThat changed when my superiors handed me a project that made no sense at all. They have no relevant experience, and they wouldn't listen when I told them that it is not going to work. They must have signed a contract with clients. I had no say in what projects are feasible even when I have the experience. I tried to get something to work - but in the end they just told me not to do it. Note that I still got a raise at the end of year review. \n\nThe manager misunderstood some key concepts and I tried to tell him. He doubled down and pretty much called me an idiot (note that I had 10 years experience more than him). I stopped going to work social functions. I think that this is the reason why I got fired. There was no warnings what so ever. I don't even know what I did wrong. \n\nMy first bet was on BYND put $6000 for Feb 25 125c just a day after it went parabolic early January. It went so high! I think it reached a price of $125 in two days, and my $6000 turned into 24k. I was a moron and didn't sell. Only panic sold when it was at $12000. Making a 6k profit. I thought I really cracked the stock market with my TA then. And I kept making OTM bets like that. I thought BYND was a good stock so I kept buying calls on it. \n\nThen the beer flu happened. Everything just dropped, and I sold everything,  taking a 80% loss. Account down to about 6k. RIP. But I'm determined to build it back up. Did some researches on meme stocks everyone's talking about and found out SPCE. Everything seemed to click, many catalysts in the near future, and Richard Branson just won't die in a rocket crash. I put everything in and it's at about 10-12k. I shared what I found with WSB and everyone seemed to like it, I'm glad that I was able to help you guys print money. The post was here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f18oud/spce\\_is\\_going\\_parabolic\\_very\\_soon\\_and\\_this\\_week/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f18oud/spce_is_going_parabolic_very_soon_and_this_week/).\n\nI feel like I'm going to take on another career path. Too much political correctness in AI, I was actually trying to look around for another job for a few months. Even given my experience and credential, it was very hard to get an offer. I guess being being an aspie can't really bond with the interviewers during the short times spent in interviews. I'll talk to my personal trainer next week and see if I can find a job as a trainer. At least I will be able to help guys get healthier, which is a much more meaningful job than making sure AI's aren't racist.\n\nIf you get through this far, thank you. I really appreciate. I just wanted to share this with someone. Peace.",

Various sticky notes will be left in the mods' office to ensure the people managing this place in 2030 unearth this very high quality post for your reflection.\n\nThis post will be locked and buried on February 28. The quarterly portfolio sticky (posted in December 2019) will be unstickied in favor of this post until then. The new quarterly portfolio sticky will replace this post in March when the automod posts it.",

It took our company over 7 months through litigation, red-lines, etc to finalize a contract.

And past that point, I really don't think anybody is pricing in the fact that this is going to start to mandate shutdowns elsewhere. \n\nThe funny thing, is that from a data perspective, we actually were starting to get a mild recovery in the macro regime, suggesting the Fed may have actually engineered a sort of soft landing, at least for a short bit. Given, that soft landing would be heavily stimulus and debt fueled, but, the means don't matter in the short term.  But this item is coming at a very very very bad time, and the economy just is not prepared to handle this even slightly. The markets obviously are not reflecting this right now, but markets are not efficient, and there are a variety of reasons for this.\n\nI will say, we likely will see some sort of massive wave of additional stimulus, or at least an attempt at it. But the transmission mechanisms of getting said stimulus to the people who need it is going to cause this to falter when it's needed most.",

I'm hearing valuations of 50B, 100B, etc. Currently it is valued at 5B per the ticker value. \n\nSo lets do some math here.\n\n5B valuation - company has 120M in potential revenue for the 600 customers (250k per ticket).\n\nThey will probably begin flying something after July since they are trying to reserve the first flight for Sir Richard for his 70th birthday, so I'd imagine the 600 pre-ordered customers will have to fly thereafter which should take up the rest of the year. \n\nAt 5B, they are valued at almost 42x their revenue. That's at roughly $30 per share.\n\nThen there's raging bull over there with 750k in options talking about seeing $50 end of this year, that's 8.3B valuation. only 69x their revenue. YEAH 69.\n\nThen we have retard analyst over there telling his relatives to buy up those calls to make them proud on television talking about $60PT. Which is an 82x revenue.\n\nJust think about it. Space tourism is big and all, but SPCE cannot scale like BlueOrigins or SpaceX. The moment these guys IPO, these analysts and fake bulls gonna hop right over like a gold digger.\n\nAnd, even at 5B valuation, let's say a reasonable revenue forward is 20x. That's still 500M in revenue that it has to do. Do the math again, based on the 250k pricetag, that's about 2000 passengers a year. \n\nHow many millionaires you think gonna drop 250k on a couple minute trip in space each year? 2000?",

I made $16 from investing $80, which the easiest money I had ever made. \n\nJump to August when I open an account and pour $700 into a single ADSK call day before earnings. LOL dumbass to the stars over here lost $600 because ADSK fell 10 f\\*\\*king percent post-market. Died a little. Irrationally &amp; with little research began yoloing in hopes to gain back what I had lost. Come to it 2 months later down -$1100 relentless mocking red every time I opened the app. \n\nDown to the last $1800 to my name (being that I'm a high school student.) Finally do research, self teach. Take a week to figure shit out and jump back on the wagon. At this point, I am a walking (options basics) Investopedia page ready to find a company and hit it big. Lost another $1100 three weeks. Crippling regret brings me to yolo the last of it into calls for SNAP a company I had been following and doing DD on. MFW it actually works and hit a gap up in the following week. From $700 to $1200, then $2300. By this time it's mid-December and I'm 100% in SNAP calls every week. December 30th and I'm finally at a net positive, $4,600 (give or take.) I invest it all 31st before the new year and market open on Jan 2nd mark my first huge profit and the beginning of (probably the most lucrative month of my life) my tendies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kept in SNAP calls until about JAN 14th when news broke of the novel coronavirus. At this point, I'm at +$52,000. The Friday before the 24th I go bearish (hey, tendies are tendies no matter how you get them) 17k into SPY puts. The market opens &amp; HELLO SIX FIGURES!!

If the shares continue to rise, dynamically managing that hedge can entail increasing purchases.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cSo, now you get the picture, that every day **at the open lately, folks are grabbing call options quickly and driving the stocks/indexes higher,\u201d** writes Scott Murray of Volatility Analytics. \u201cIt is much easier for this kind of market to be unhinged, as long call holders\u2019 corresponding dealer position is long the underlying.\u201d\n\nSo /r/wsb thinks it discovered the holy grail, because it learned that sellers of options hedge their delta. \n\nu/SuXs, managed to distinguish himself from the imbecile masses of the subreddit, by appearing to truly believe that if he manages to convince some people to buy $200 MSFT calls, the dealers will buy enough shares to offset their delta to make a $1tn stock rally. \n\nJust check out his recent submission history - reads like a strong CV for a position of a full retard: [https://i.imgur.com/x3T544x.png](https://i.imgur.com/x3T544x.png) \n\nNews flash - delta hedging becomes a factor when a stock goes up 20% in a day. Or 100% in a month.  Not when you place a $100k (let's be generous) order for $200 MSFT calls. Also, while TSLA can conceivably go to $1000 or $1200 or $700 over the next week, those kinds of moves are not in cards for MSFT - hence even less need to aggressively delta hedge.\n\nMSFT is a solid company. But today, I sincerely hope it totally shits the bed or else you dumb motherfuckers will really believe that by having 20 guys spend $300 each on an OTM call you can make the share price of a $1tn company go up.\n\nBTW buying OTM calls at the open has nothing to do with HFT spoofing of orders that Navinder Sarao got busted for. That guy was just flashing a huge order on the bid side to move the market marginally up (and opposite for ask side). He never intended for those orders to be filled, so he was quickly cancelling them after getting the desired effect.\n\nSometimes you make me ashamed to be part of this subreddit.\n\ntl;dr; the post is not about advocating selling of MSFT (I have no view on the stock), the title is a clickbait.",

I've bought one cheap $3 Ford Call just out of curiosity to see how the transaction worked on RH.  \n\nAs I have been reading it occurs to me that that the real money (read consistent profit) is writing options.  Obviously more capital is required to play that game.  Specifically selling puts seems particularly lucrative.  If I write a put, I collect the premium and if it remains OTM at expiration I have no obligation to buy.  If ITM at expiration I buy and now I own 100 shares of that company.  I could then turn around and write a call option on that same stock at a price that exceeds my cost basis and collect premiums until it is ITM. I then sell for a profit.  Rinse and repeat.\n\nI feel like I am missing something. What is the biggest risk? Seems like you need significant capital to make it lucrative. So may not be worth tying up small amounts of capital for such small returns.",

        "selftext": "Let's break it down based on some research I did while the market was closed yesterday:\n\nLet\u2019s look at profitability: with a current Operating Margin for Microsoft Corporation \\[MSFT\\] sitting at +33.96 and its Gross Margin at +65.81, this company\u2019s Net Margin is now 31.70%. These measurements indicate that Microsoft Corporation \\[MSFT\\] is generating considerably more profit, after expenses are accounted for, compared to its market peers.\n\nThis company\u2019s Return on Total Capital is 23.74, and its Return on Invested Capital has reached 19.90%. Its Return on Equity is 42.41, and its Return on Assets is 14.39. These metrics all suggest that Microsoft Corporation is doing well at using the money it earns to generate returns.\n\nTurning to investigate this organization\u2019s capital structure, Microsoft Corporation \\[MSFT\\] has generated a Total Debt to Total Equity ratio of 84.49. Similarly, its Total Debt to Total Capital is 42.52, while its Total Debt to Total Assets stands at 30.17. Looking toward the future, this publicly-traded company\u2019s Long-Term Debt to Equity is 15.87, and its Long-Term Debt to Total Capital is 77.31.\n\nYou're not still reading this, you're commenting something about \"TL:DR which strike\" and I actually copied the above paragraphs from an outdated article. This is not real DD and while I'm sure 90% of you have stopped reading -- oh who am I kidding, 99% of you have stopped reading up until this point that literally nothing I type here matters. \n\nThe only substantial point you should take away from this is you need to buy MSFT calls and pump up the price this week because while my calls are expiring in April, I have no intention whatsoever in letting Theta trap me in losses until then and I really need to get out of this position to make money in other places this week and next. Okay, back to the con.\n\nShares of Microsoft Corporation \\[MSFT\\], overall, appear to be a solid investment option, with Wall Street analysts expecting its price to rise considerably in the next 12 months. This company generates high value from the labor resources and other capital it has available, and while it has heavy Long-Term Debt to Equity, the majority of the metrics point to this investment being highly attractive. \n\n**As you can see, it's the perfect time to buy MSFT calls.**",

They\u2019re the market leader in diabetes monitoring technology. They monitor your blood sugar levels via non-invasive techniques (basically no needles or blood involved) and you can track your blood sugar anytime, anywhere through your phone or smart watch. Pretty revolution stuff, they\u2019re first to do it too. If you\u2019re blood sugar is outta wack it notifies you so you can get your insulin pump and get it back to normal.\n\nNot convinced yet? Well here\u2019s the low. I\u2019m a med student, I\u2019ve seen patients with diabetes, every type 1 diabetic patient is buying one of these monitoring kits if they haven\u2019t already. Hell even Karens are buying them for their kids just to make sure their precious angel\u2019s blood sugar are in normal range.\n\nThe number of diabetics is only increasing, so the market for this monitoring device is only gonna go up with it. What\u2019s better is these will be life long customers since the disease can\u2019t be cured. This is reflected on the stock, up 12% in the last day, 18% last week, 21% last month, 40% in the last 3 months.\n\nSo what the fuck are you fucking autists waiting for?

        "selftext": "Since it's a holiday and we're all bored anyway I'm going to give you some *very* basic things to think about before you open a position. Who am I? I'm just a random dude with some business and finance education. I have had limited success and failures (over the past two years I've been up 90% and down 60%), but the key is that I *haven't cashed out of the game yet*. So, if you're looking for ways to justify your gambling addiction, read on. If you want to be the one retard who learns something today and not the 9 retards posting stupid shit in the comments, read on.\n\nToday I've picked a nice mix of glaring WSB faults and interesting things:\n\n1. Risk and reward expectations\n2. Stock and Options packages (ETFs and multilegs)\n3. Research aka Due diligence (DD)\n\nLet's dive in friendos!\n\n**Risk and reward expectations** \\- Generally investment managers, financiers, and traders gauge their performance for a quarter or year based on how they did **relative to the market**. So if the S&amp;P 500 only grows 6% in a year, a trader is successful if they made 9% gain that year. If the S%P 500 grows 20% like in 2019, you could literally just park your money in stocks and sell a year later for 20% gain, no skill involved. **Historically, the market has grown 10%** ***a year.*** I mention this in bold because most newcomers here really need to have their risk/reward expectations reframed. Usually the rewards are directly related to the risk that you lose everything. Doubling your money with a yolo call position is *incredibly risky and you are likely to lose all of your money*. This isn't a bear/bull thing (which is fucking stupid anyway. Imagine gambling/investing based on a fucking animal mascot). Pouring your money into shares of an S&amp;P 500 index is much more safe and likely to preserve your money. I think there is a big contingent of big brained smarties on this board who want much more risk and reward than buying shares, but don't want to fuck in the dark on WSB meme options. If you are ok making 5-10% a week instead of 5-10% a year, read on.\n\n**Stock and options packages** \\- Stocks get packaged up by companies and resold to you in two ways: mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are pretty much the same thing - a bundle of stocks that you buy into - except ETFs are... exchange-traded aka sold as shares. Why do companies do this? To hedge against the risk we talked about before!\n\nWe need to digress for a second into different kinds of risk. If you had 0 toleration for risk, if you wanted a virtual guarantee of not losing money, how can you invest? You can buy **US Treasury bonds.** The rate of return on US treasury bonds is literally called *the risk-free rate* in finance and is about 1.6%/year or something right now. Pitiful. In our desire to see bigger returns *we must take on bigger risks.* There is **firm specific risk** related to the operations and financing of a specific firm ($BABA, $MSFT, $ADI). Let's say we didn't want to deal with this risk. We just want to take advantage of their growth of an industry, sector, or the market as a whole, without getting burned by the mistakes of any one individual firm. Then we can *diversify away* *firm-specific risk* and deal only with **market risk** by purchasing shares of every company in an industry, sector, or market. So State Street Global Advisors purchases a weighted average of the S&amp;P 500 and sells that package to you as $SPY. Any one success or failure in the S&amp;P 500 doesn't make SPY move much; it moves the way the market moves in general.\n\nOk, so, there are indexes/ETFs for everything. Whole market, biotech, manufacturing, industrial power, you name it. These are incredibly successful products - $SPY, $TQQQ, $PEY - because they are less risky and move slower than the individual stocks in the funds. What's the deal with options packages? **Options packages hedge risk in exchange for lower returns and are available on Robinhood (but never take the pre-built offered packages)**. Take a second at this point to go to investopedia and get a handle on spreads - you'll see things like Bull/Bear Put/Call credit/debit spread.\n\nSo let's say you have a belief that $MSFT is going up, but you don't want to *risk* everything on straight calls that could expire worthless in a week. You have some *options* (pun intended). You can reduce your risk by changing the rules - open a *bull put (credit) spread* so that you don't need $MSFT to go up, you just need it to not go down. Or you can lower the cost of your calls (and the reward) by opening a *bull call (debit) spread.* What I love about these is that the only cost/collateral RH requires is that difference between strikes in a spread. For instance, I have a SPY bull put spread right now with strikes at 330 and 329 - RH required $100 in collateral and gave me 12 dollars credit when I opened it (the difference between selling to open the 330 put and buying to open the 329 put), and I think I can close it out this week for a cost of 5 dollars, netting me 7$ on my 100. That doesn't sound flashy except that *7% a week is literally rich people insaneo gains on a relatively safe bet.* If you've read this far, my secret volatility play this week is opening a condor tomorrow on $ADI and closing it after earnings. EPS is estimated to be pretty low, but the firm's operating cycle is absolutely solid, so I think it'll move sideways on the news and we're going to make money on the IV crush. $1 spreads on the low and high ends, with strikes roughly 6% out of the money. Open it for 30 bucks credit tomorrow, close it for 15 bucks debit on Thursday.\n\n**Due Diligence** \\- DD is more art than science, and it's going to look different for stocks than for options, but in either case often the only difference between sweating nervously for a week while you look for a way to not lose so much, and relaxing confidently in your purchase, is 15 minutes of research. **The price of a share is related to the performance of the firm, even in 2020.** If you're trying to do DD on a specific firm as an amatuer, you want to look at 3 things - Quarterly/annual reports of earnings, analyst opinions, and the sector as a whole. Let's take $MSFT for example: Big revenue growth each year for the past decade, analysts say that Azure and Teams are solid products, and the tech sector is growing, so there's room for $MSFT to go up without having to take market share from competitors. That info took me 5 minutes to find, and with it I'm very confident that purchasing shares of $MSFT is a good idea. You can usually go to a company's website to find their financial information in a government tax filing form called a 10-k, but that can be pretty dense. You're looking for a page called the Balance Sheet.\n\nAnyway, hope you had a good read and learned something. If not, fuck off and lose all your money and disappear unnoticed in a few weeks like 99% of the people on this board.",

        "selftext": "I'll keep this short and sweet. LSCC (Lattice Semiconductor) is announcing earnings tomorrow and is worth your consideration as a YOLO for two reasons:  \n\n\n1.) Jim Anderson, the CEO  \nThis fucker used to be my boss (corporate overlord, I never met him). Our company was sold to AVGO back when they were trading at $65/share and Mr. Anderson made out like a bandit on the increase in value in his shares. Then in May of 2015 he went to become a VP for A-M-Fucking-D. In case you were too young to remember what AMD's stock price was back then I'll remind you. It was $2.30. Motherfuckin' Jim stayed on until August of 2018 and then peace'd the fuck out to become CEO of Lattice Semiconductor. You know what AMD's stock price was in August of 2018? Twenty-Five-Fucking Dollars. Homeboy literally worked for three goddamn years and 10x'd on AMD.  \n\n\nSo August of 2018 he goes to become CEO of Lattice Semiconductor when their stock price is around $7.50 and sneaky Jimbo goes and delivers a terrible earnings, tanks the price all the way down to $5 bucks so he can accumulate shares like the sly multi-millionaire fucker he is. Then the stock proceeds to fucking skyrocket up to a peak of $24 over the next 12 months.  \n\n\nSo that's reason number 1. Follow the money. Follow Jimbo.  \n\n\n2.)

        "selftext": "For example, why not just buy a long-term call option (an actual good legitimate proven company that\u2019s clearly poised for more growth such as MSFT or VISA) that expires January 2021 with the closest strike price from the current share price? Yes, the option price is going to be expensive but assuming you have somewhat of a significant capital to play with (let\u2019s say at least 30 grand or beyond), wouldn\u2019t it be relatively easy to rack in $1000+ profits once your strike price hits or it goes above? Why don\u2019t more people do this as there\u2019s very very minimal risk to it? \n\nFor example, let\u2019s say I buy a MSFT call option that expires January 15th 2021 with the price per option being roughly $13.43 and I buy 22 contracts (x 100), which would equate to about $29,5400. I can bet my fingers, toes, and testicles that MSFT will reach $195 SOMETIME before January 15th 2021 (They say only death and taxes are guaranteed, but come on, let\u2019s be real, this is a guarantee). Fine, worst case scenario, let\u2019s say it takes another 1-2 months for MSFT to reach $195 \u2013 still, if I wait 1-2 months and it\u2019s at $198, I\u2019ll still make over $9K, which I\u2019ll be very happy with. Is this not a viable strategy if you have the capital? Why don\u2019t more people just risk more capital on long term call options with the closest strike price from the current price? Am I missing something here? If I understand correctly, you can hold your position for as long as you can before the expiration date and sell whenever you want once MSFT reaches $195+.",

        "selftext": "Renaissance Technologies is the Greatest Hedge Fund of All Time.\n\nFounded by math genius Jim Simons, it's flagship fund Medallion has an average gross return of 66.1% since 1988.\n\nWith an average net return of 39.1% after fees.\n\nThe Medallion Fund is available only to current and past employees and their families, closing to outside investors in 1993.\n\nSince, 1988, the Medallion Fund has racked up trading profits of more than $100 billion.\n\nNow, I mentioned a net return of 39.1% after fees: well, the fees have been greater than the usual '2 and 20' structure (which means a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee).\n\nMedallion has had a 5% management fee, and from 1988 to 2001, a 20% performance fee and from 2002 until now, a 44% performance fee.\n\nNotice in particular the return in 2007 and 2008, a time when many were completely REKT.\n\nIn 2008, a return (after these monstrous fees) of 82.4%\n\n**To make us all feel terrible, if you had invested $1000 into Medallion in 1988 you would have today, after fees, around $23MM**.\n\nThat certainly beats inflation...\n\nSo, how did they do it and what can we take away from this story (aside from searing jealousy)?\n\n**PART 1: The Early Stages**\n\nEarly on, Simons had a goal of algorithmic investing.\n\nRemember, this was the late 1980s before the phrase big data became a household name and most investment decisions were made over the phone based on gut with the likes of Jordan Belfort trying to scam you!\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to worry about the market every minute. I want models that will make money while I sleep,\u201d Simons said. \u201cA pure system without humans interfering.\u201d\n\nSimons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information\n\nStraus\u2019 was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.\n\nHe became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.\n\nOver time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.\n\nIn fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!\n\nAt the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.\n\nThe return in 2008 is a prime example of that.\n\nCommodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.\n\nThe fund wasn't bothered as to why these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.\n\n**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**\n\nNow in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the \"best math department in the world\".\n\nTherefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.\n\nWe are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.\n\nRenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.\n\nThe strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).\n\nSimons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.\n\nIn 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&amp;P 500 at an unusually low level.\n\nThis test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.\n\nIt had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.\n\nMagerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.\n\nFinally, the simulator\u2019s algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.\n\nThe resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman\u2019s calculations.\n\nOnly then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good....\n\n**PART 3: Infrastructure**\n\nNow I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.\n\nBig data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.\n\nThe problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high:\n\nBuilding a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.\n\nTo then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.\n\nRenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.\n\nThey have completely automated the process of signal discovery:\n\nThey don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.\n\nRenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.\n\nThe data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.\n\nThe mathematics of *efficiently processing* that data are what matters.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\n**The takeaway from this is the following: do not day trade, you will get REKT.**\n\n**You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.**",

So I never had many gains.\n\nHowever, I spread my money on 5 strong tech companies, such as Microsoft and Apple.\n\nSo I am not worried at all that it goes down for a while (maybe with recession), because I believe that they will be up again eventually.\n\nDoes my optimism make any sense?",

        "selftext": "Insider buying on Monday at upscale hotel REIT **Hersha Hospitality Trust** $HT.  Brothers Neil and Jay Shah, President and CEO respectively, bought a combined $100,000 in their seventh joint purchase over the past 6 months in the REIT that owns 48 upscale/luxury  hotels in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington DC, South Florida, and the West Coast. \n\nValued at 6.1x AFFO Hersha Hospitality Trust already looks cheap with a discount to NAV of 37% and a yield of 8.6% based on an AFFO payout rate of just 56%. \n\nThose metrics should improve further as numerous upgrades have disrupted operations but should start adding to cash flow growth in the near term.  Specifically, two of the REIT\u2019s most profitable hotels in south Florida are operational again (after Hurricane Irma in 2017) and are expected to boost EBITDA by 20-25%.\n\nHotel REITs are out of favor at the moment but $HT\u2019s already cheap valuation offers downside protection while 20%+ AFFO growth provides a tangible catalyst for upside supported by insider buying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Grand Canyon Education** $LOPE dropped 16% to $78 after a Citron report on Tuesday  called it \u201cThe Educational Enron\u201d and lowered their Price Target from $30 to $0\n\n\u201cCitron believes that management of Grand Canyon has been both incompetent and deceitful in its ability to transform the school to adapt to the rapidly changing for profit education space.\u201d\n\nCitron Research also say that \u201c\\[t\\]he corporate structure between Grand Canyon Education and Grand Canyon University is one that the SEC should investigate. GCE\u2019s revenues are almost entirely from Grand Canyon University. Having a captive customer that is 90% of revenues with the same CEO and no \u201cChinese wall\u201d does not pass the smell test.\u201d  Additionally, \u201cCitron believes GCE is stuffing GCU with expenses to inflate its own profitability and as a result bankrupting GCU.\u201d\n\nCitron says \u201cIn light of the significant fraud we have uncovered, we are lowering our Price Target from $30 previously to $0\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Acceleron** jumps 70%, after reporting on Phase 2 trials on Tuesday, but as the only drug for a $10 billion TAM its $4.8bn market cap still looks reasonable\n\nAccording to Fool;\n\nPulmonary arterial hypertension is a condition in which a patient has high blood pressure in the lungs. This means that the part of the heart responsible for pumping oxygen to the lungs, the right ventricle, has to work even harder to do its job. Eventually, this can lead to right ventricular failure and death.\n\nAt the moment, there are no drugs that specifically treat PAH and as far as I can see the market is growing and expected to hit $10 billion in 2026.\n\nWith the only cure for a fatal disease, a large market share and big margins would seem reasonable assumption for any forecasts.  Back of the envelope, a 50% share at 20% margins and 14x PE would justify a market cap of $14 billion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Microsoft** $MSFT jumped on Wednesday after a strong performance across the board and a thriving cloud business helped revenues and earnings grow 14% and 37% respectively. Guidance suggests the company expects its strong growth to continue and MSFT has a habit of underpromising and overdelivering.  The stock has had a remarkable run up but, even on 30x trailing earnings it still looks like good value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Farfetch** $FTCH jumped 10% after reporting a $250 million investment on Thursday from Tencent and west coast investment firm Dragoneer that will increase the company\u2019s exposure to China and help to finance its technology platform. \n\nFarfetch is a high-end fashion retailer that carries no inventory which is a major advantage when the risk of getting stuck with expensive stock you cannot sell is significant. Instead the company runs an online marketplace where more than 1,000 retailers and 3 million customers from over 50 countries. Growth has been spectacular with revenue increasing by 50%+ for several years in a row.\n\nThis rapid growth has led to increasing networking effects and allows Farfetch to charge a 25% to 33% commission fee on sales made through its site. Current year forecast sales are still modest at just under $1 billion. Equally modest, in comparison to the opportunity, is the current market capitalization of $2.74 billion. The $300 billion global market for luxury products is in the midst of a structural shift to online and Farfetch, with its network effects, is in prime position to benefit.\n\n\u201cTencent\u2019s deep technology expertise and ongoing relationship with Farfetch, paired with Dragoneer\u2019s expertise in supporting growth-oriented technology companies, makes both investors outstanding partners to support Farfetch\u2019s next chapter of growth,\u201d commented Farfetch founder and CEO Jos\u00e9 Neves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlant-based burger maker **Beyond Meat** $BYND dropped 15% this week as it emerged that the company is facing a lawsuit from former business partner Don Lee over claims the company misappropriated its trade secrets and broke a contract. \n\nDon Lee alleges that it helped Beyond develope the \u201cbeyond meat\u201d product using its own family secret while they were partners.  When Beyond Meat left the partnership, it allegedly took Don Lee\u2019s family secrets with and reportedly shared those secrets with other competitors in order to develop similar products.  The trial is to begin officially on May 18th.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Grocery Outlet** $GO dropped 7% after reporting a secondary offering, even though it was non diluting, but this is a stock that is definitely worth a closer look.  The company has been called the TJ Maxx of grocery and its business model is very similar. It sells branded goods at discounts of 40%-70% by acting as a clearing channel for producers. That offers a treasure hunt experience for buyers and useful way to offload excess inventory for producers.\n\nI was initially sceptical of the ability to implement the model for grocery but the results speak for themselves. In November, the company reported strong Q3 earnings with revenues up 13.1%, comparable store sales up 5.8%, adjusted net income up 58.8% and adjusted EBITDA up 13.2%. Full year guidance was raised across the board with EPS rising from 69 cents to 73.5 cents at the midpoint (and comparable to 18 cents last year).\n\nIt is true that the company has to buy and sell certain staples such as bread and milk like any other grocery store. However it appears that there is a huge range of goods (dry goods, cereals, wines, deli, frozen etc) that lend themselves very well to the model. Opportunistic purchases of fresh produce such as meat, fruit and vegetables enhance the product range.\n\nThe two drivers for this business are;\n\n* There is a huge opportunity, Grocery Outlet currently has 330 locations but believes there is demand nationwide for 4,800 stores\n* Grocery Outlet (similar to TJ Maxx) is establishing itself as the go to market place for both producers and consumers. That leads to a virtuous circle of more high quality goods, more variety, more customers, more high quality goods.\n\nThe stock isn\u2019t cheap on 40x current year estimates but, given the size of the opportunity, the valuation appears very justifiable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, **Sorrento Therapeutics**' $SRNE board of directors unanimously rejected a proposal to acquire a majority or all of the company's shares for up to $7 per share (current $3.83). They concluded that the offer \"significantly undervalues the company and is not in the best interest of the shareholders.\"\n\nSorrento has a number of commercial and late stage non-opioid pain therapies as well as four immuno-oncology (treatments that use the body's immune system to fight cancer) programs in development. Management as usual believe that these have a great outlook for growth. To be fair the non-opioid market is expected to grow from $4 billion to $9 billion over the next 10 years and I have to say it looks like an exciting opportunity for Sorrento with numerous therapies and a market cap of just $763 million (after the recent increase).\n\nThe $7 bid follows two bids in December between $3-$5 which Sorrento immediately declined saying \u201cthe offer significantly undervalued Sorrento and was not in the best interest of the Company's stockholders.\" The recent $7 bid suggests other parties may very well agree. Either way, management clearly think the company\u2019s value is well in excess of yesterdays close at $3.83 and, with all their insider knowledge, they probably know more than most.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hepion Pharmaceuticals** $HEPA (WARNING SPECULATIVE NANO CAP)  jumped on Wednesday after positive findings from a Phase 1 expanded study\n\nHepion's drug candidate \"CRV431 offers a novel approach to the treatment of fibrosis caused by NASH and possibly other causes of liver injury,\" stated Dr. Robert Foster, CEO of Hepion Pharmaceuticals. \"This is because CRV431 acts, in part, by directly targeting fibrotic scar formation by down-regulating an important regulator of collagen synthesis, cyclophilin B, thereby reducing collagen production. This contrasts with most other NASH drug candidates that target events such as dyslipidemia or diabetes that may lead to fibrosis. Combining the direct antifibrotic actions of CRV431 with the indirect actions of other drug candidates likely represents the best opportunity for rapidly and effectively decreasing liver fibrosis in NASH.\"\n\nThe global Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) market is expected to cross US$20.0 Billion by 2025 growing at a CAGR of more than 10.0% during given forecast period from 2018-2025.  Hepion has a long way to go before approval or commercialization of its drug and has since given back most of its gains.  However, with a market cap f just $18 million, even a small chance of developing a successful treatment for such a large prize makes this an interesting stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Follow\" me if you would like to receive updates during the week.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everyone.  Some of the stocks mentioned are risky small cap and/or highly speculative.  Please do your own research.",
