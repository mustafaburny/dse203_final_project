        "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

[The end is near!](https://giphy.com/embed/Jn3fqI2I0m5cB2L8g6) And sweet baby Jesus it will be spectacular.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI legit thought we weren't going to fall into the same trap as last time, and we'd start dumping earlier than last time. But we are. God damn this market is so retarded even the Fed got caught off guard:\n\n[Fed Unexpectedly Deviates From POMO Schedule, Buys Only 70% Of Scheduled Treasurys](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/fed-unexpectedly-deviates-pomo-schedule-buys-only-70-scheduled-treasurys)\n\nThat's Jerome screaming \"What the fuck is going on, why are these retards still buying???\". Meanwhile, overnight repo draws are spiking again, ie liquidity pressure:\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RPONTTLD](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RPONTTLD)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So, here's what's happening:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLiquidity on the Nasdaq-100 futures is absolutely gone. Here's a picture of the Level II book from yesterday: \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/v0zI1Tn](https://imgur.com/a/v0zI1Tn)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor comparison, here's the /ES book at the same time:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/OO5O6zz](https://imgur.com/a/OO5O6zz) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, it's normal for /ES to be more liquid than /NQ, but that's a huge gap. Liquidity on /NQ is non-existent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why is this happening?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarket isn't willing or able to short or sell /NQ futures anymore. There isn't a single reason for that, it's a multitude of factors such as: shorts that shorted the March lows got blown the fuck up, others are fucking broke, big boys can't hedge shorting /NQ very well anymore, some drank the kool-aid and went full \"stonks only go up\" again, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What does this mean?**  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Market is stretched extremely thin\n2. It's the reason SPX and DJI have been outperforming NDX recently.\n3. Leveraged funds like TQQQ are completely fucking up the market again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **How?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou see those stupidly large gaps at 3:50pm for the past several days?  That's TQQQ and all the other dogshit leveraged funds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"you're retarded, TQQQ is too small to move the market like that\" - /u/random_wsb_autist\n\n Bitch, sit down. \n\nAs of 06/03, the open interest on /NQM20 futures (Nasdaq June futures) is 208,571 contracts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOut of that, lev funds hold outright 3670 contracts. But they also hold a fuckton more notional in swaps. And you know what happens when the funds buy swap contracts from the big banks? The banks in turn go out and hedge all or most of the position by buying or selling futures. SQQQ, QID and PSQ in turn hold short positions. Estimating an approximate net positioning across all these funds looks like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Date|Futures contracts held|Total futures equivalent|1-day change|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|06/03|\\+3670|\\+66534|\\+605|\n|06/02|\\+4335|\\+65929|\\+1388|\n|06/01|\\+3755|\\+64540|\\-|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, out of 208,571 OI on /NQM20, these lev. funds alone keep long 66,534. Almost 32% of the OI is in these garbage ass funds. On 6/2 at 3:50, these things bought about 1.4k contracts, hence the retarded spike. Yesterday, at 3:50pm, they bought about 600 contracts, hence the retarded spike. But right after, UVXY, TVIX and the rest of the long vol funds came in and bought a fuckton of VIX futures, which dunked everything back down. \n\nUVXY:\n\n|Holding|Contracts 6/2|Exposure 6/2|Contracts 6/3|Exposure 6/3|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CBOE VIX FUTURE Jul20 |12776|383599400|16509|479999175 |\n|CBOE VIX FUTURE Jun20 |14196|400682100|14855 |401085000 |\n|IPATH SERIES-B S&amp;P 500 VIX SHT-TERM FUT SWAP - GS |1542183.61|49931725.84|1542183.606 |48050940.41 |\n|Cash||555951374.59||618918110.14 |\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou'll notice 2 things:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* A fuckton of cash coming in long vol\n* Futures weight shifting from June futures towards July futures. And this, motherfuckers, **is very important.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's important due to its effects on the VIX. As VIX futures get bought, the short side will be hedging them via short SPX exposure. The VIX is calculated from SPX options with more than 23 days and less than 37 days to expiration. See:\n\n[https://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/vixwhite.pdf](https://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/vixwhite.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat means June VIX futures are hedged via SPX June short positioning, which is also reflected in the options. But starting with 5/27, those 6/19 positions that hedge VIX Jun futures slip out of the calculation for the VIX itself, hence vol started shredding at that point just for this stupid-ass reason. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now,  money is finally pouring back into long volatility AND VIX etfs started rolling to the July futures. This means that July SPX will be hammered down, and those expirations ARE included in the VIX calculation, which is going to move the VIX higher and the market lower. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd guess what, we're also in a short squeeze on volatility. TVIX &amp; UVXY short fees are over 5%, and almost no shortable shares available anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of that, all these garbage-ass long leveraged etfs have to start rolling those June /NQ futures soon, and they're not going to be able to roll those huge amounts in this dogshit liquidity =&gt; TQQQpocalypse again. Short interest on TQQQ is going up big as well.\n\nSee expiration and roll dates:\n\n[https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/rolldates.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/rolldates.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So, what you want to do is this:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Dump every-god-damn-long except long volatility\n* Long VIX 7/7 &amp; 7/21 calls @ 60 strike\n* Long TQQQ way OTM puts for every god damn expiration from 6/12 to 7/21.\n* If ya played the akimbo, close the put spreads, should be a 2-3x right now, ride the other positions for free.\n* For the love of god, if you don't want to go short, at least move to cash. You can move back in after the 1st week of July, if market's still intact. But fuck me who am I kidding you guys are greedy assholes, see you in a couple of weeks when you'll be shitposting about \"cLoSing thE mArkEtS\" again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd if you want to be cocky ass retards, how about you inverse this and post some screenshots. **I double-dare you, motherfuckers**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: If you're holding ZM puts (exp. next week or later, this week's probably fucked) you want to keep those. You retards think that was bullish action yesterday on ZM? It was shorted so hard on open that it went straight into a short squeeze, just on IBKR over 300k shares were shorted in the first minutes all the way to no shortable shares available. That was a market hatefuck like I've never seen before. \n\nPPS: Zoom sucks, blow me.\n\nTLDR: Short every-fucking-thing-except-the-vix-and-especially-tqqq.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck, retards.",

        "selftext": "\u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed.\u201d That mantra is repeated as fact amongst almost every market participant across the globe (other than Davey Day Trader, who doesn\u2019t know what a central bank is). Based off of that logic, one could reasonably assume that the Fed and Jerome Powell are the reasons for this recent market rally. All of WSB is bullish, and you can\u2019t go more than four posts on WSB without seeing some exhausted money printer meme or a pro-Powell love fest. After a week of reading economic research papers nonstop, I think I have stumbled into something that the market and the Fed won\u2019t see until it is too late to stop.\n\nFull disclosure: I am not an expert and this post should not be construed as anything other than my opinions and theories. This will be an extremely long and conceptual post (with a lot of references to research papers) that focuses more on economics than any financial analysis. It is not hard to understand, but be prepared to read.\n\n**Fed Reaction to Coronavirus**\n\nThe Fed\u2019s reaction to coronavirus was extremely quick. After seeing what worked to stop the financial crisis in 2008, the Fed used the same playbook. Lower rates to near zero, buy treasuries (quantitative easing), buy mortgage backed securities, cut the reserve ratio to 0%. That playbook didn\u2019t work though, the market kept selling off though. The Fed then did something unprecedented, they started buying corporate bond ETFs. They only bought high grade corporate bonds at first, but quickly realized that they had to buy junk bonds in order to keep the corporate bond market stabilized. Recently, the Fed [quietly announced](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-mainstreet/fed-eases-terms-of-main-street-loans-tells-banks-to-start-disbursing-idUSKBN23F2N8) a ramp up of their Main Street lending program, along with guaranteeing 95% of the loans instead of a range of 85-95%. This implies, to me, that banks don\u2019t want to give out loans unless the Fed backstops them more. That will become important later in this post.\n\nThe Fed has also been buying commercial mortgage backed securities. These CMBSs are facing [extremely high levels of delinquency](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/cmbs-delinquencies-climb-in-may-with-hotels-and-retail-faring-worst-58714661). According to that article, 7.6% of all CMBS loans are delinquent as of May, along with 19.3% of hotel loans and 10% of retail loans. A [whistleblower report]{https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds) indicates that the loans in these securities did not go through much scrutiny and could be massively overpriced as well. These assets are so toxic that the Fed [won\u2019t even take that many of them](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities-operations). In fact, the Fed has quietly [reduced their asset purchases](https://i.imgur.com/zlMFwbr.jpg) since the last week of March. This is just background information so I can explain what the Fed has been doing to the market so people can stop attributing the rally to Jerome Powell.\n\n**Reasons For the Rally**\n\nNow that I have explained what the Fed has been doing, I want to explain the reasons for this rally. This rally is driven by retail. How? Delta hedging. Some of you know about delta hedging, but for those who don\u2019t I will explain a quick summary. A retail investors buys a call from a market maker. That market maker, being more risk averse than we are accustomed to, doesn\u2019t like to sell naked options so the market maker will buy enough shares to become delta neutral. That means that as the call they sold goes up in price, they have shares that will cover most or all of their losses. Options are highly leveraged instruments, which is important because it gives retail the leverage that they need to get market makers to pump the market for them.\n\nThe important thing is that the analysts and value investors that are crediting the Fed for this rally don\u2019t understand the options market as well as degenerates like us do. Retail has been [piling in](https://i.imgur.com/xuzFRSw.jpg) to the stock market at an astounding rate, especially into everyone\u2019s favorite [broker](https://i.imgur.com/mNve5Mu.jpg). This data is as of the beginning of May and I suspect it\u2019s a hell of a lot higher. \n\nBloomberg published some more up to date data recently regarding small option traders buying calls. Take a look at [the graph](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ixvGtK3QI_Aw/v0/1400x-1.png) for yourself, it has gone parabolic. The [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/speculative-fervor-in-u-s-stocks-surges-to-stunning-levels) states, \u201cTraders established fresh bullish positions last week by buying 35.6 million new call options on equities, according to Sundial founder Jason Goepfert. That\u2019s up from a peak of 28.7 million in February, when speculative activity was rampant, he wrote in a note Monday.\u201d The volume from small options traders is estimated to be 50% in that same article, the highest since 2000. Google Trends for [\u201chow to trade options\u201d](https://i.imgur.com/6nf8LTw.png) and [\u201crobinhood trade options\u201d](https://i.imgur.com/4NJwVfh.png) have gone parabolic recently as well. The put/call ratio across all equities is also at [historic lows](https://c.stockcharts.com/c-sc/sc?s=%24CPCE&amp;p=D&amp;b=5&amp;g=1&amp;i=p77530317141), indicating a mass wave of euphoria and a lack of hedges. \n\nAfter seeing all of this, it is clear to me that this is a retail driven bubble and not driven by the Fed after April. Where is retail getting the money for this? The answer lies in the [savings rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT). According to the Fed, the savings rate \u201cis calculated as the ratio of personal saving to DPI. Personal saving is equal to personal income less personal outlays and personal taxes; it may generally be viewed as the portion of personal income that is used either to provide funds to capital markets or to invest in real assets such as residences.\u201d As you can see in the graph, the savings rate is now significantly higher than it has ever been before, coming in at 33%. This means that consumers are not spending money, they are saving or investing it. Consumers are also paying down [credit card debt](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TOTALSL) at much higher rates than anticipated. In the month of April, consumer credit had the [largest decrease since tracking began in 1968](https://eyeonhousing.org/2020/06/april-consumer-credit-indicates-recovery-challenges/). Remember the data in this paragraph, I\u2019m going to refer to it later in regards to deflation.\n\n**Effects of Quantitative Easing**\n\nBefore talking more about the bubble, I am going to outline some data that shows the impact of QE on our economy since 2008 up until now.\n\nThe main effect of low interest rates along with quantitative easing is an increase in the money supply. You can see that increase [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2). Typically throughout history, an expansion in the money supply has lead to an increase in the inflation rate. That [has not happened](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA), the Fed has struggled to hit the target inflation rate since the crisis. With such an increase in the money supply, hyperinflation is stopped by the velocity at which the money moves. In 2006, Ben Bernanke noticed this phenomenon, [stating](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/10/business/worldbusiness/10iht-fed.3490493.html), \u201cthe empirical relationship between money growth and variables such as inflation and nominal output growth has continued to be unstable.\u201d A recent [research paper](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolet/v182y2019icp23-25.html) has also found a significant positive correlation between wealth inequality and monetary growth.\n\nVelocity of money is defined by the Fed as: \u201cthe frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy.\u201d This velocity has been trending downward in a big way since 2008 (and before), not just in the US but everywhere. Velocity of the M2 money supply in the US broke through the previous low (tracking started in 1960) by 2012. Velocity is now [significantly lower](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V). M2 velocity includes bank reserves though, so let\u2019s take a look at the [velocity of M1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V) (which is physical currency and checking account deposits). [Demand deposits](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WDDNS) (checking account balances) have been exploding since 2008, with another massive jump starting in March. This means that cash is not being used and not adding to consumer prices or any economic productivity. I believe all of this to be an effect of QE and a prolonged period of low rates.\n\n**Liquidity Trap**\n\nThere has been a safe asset shortage since the advent of QE, as central banks of developed economies accumulate safe government bonds and US treasuries. This has lead to a shortage of safe assets, driving prices up and yields down artificially. Ricardo Caballero, an MIT economist, said [this](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.31.3.29) (warning: PDF) in 2017: \u201cThe ongoing pressures driving the imbalance in safe asset markets has in recent decades helped to drive the steady decline in interest rates on safe assets. However, interest rates on these assets cannot fall much further. When the equilibrium full-employment interest rate needs to be negative, but cannot adjust sufficiently downward, then (other things equal) the equilibrating mechanism is an endogenous decline in safe asset demand through a reduction in aggregate income and wealth. That is, equilibrium is achieved through recession.\u201d At the end of 2019, the Fed owned [36% of all US treasuries](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/funding-covid-19-debt-splurge-risks-the-independence-of-major-central-banks-58610836), with that number only set to increase after their open market operations this year. of April 21st, central banks around the world have bought [5 times](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/central-banks-buy-trillion-financial-assets-g7-march-federal-reserve-2020-4-1029113160) the value of treasuries as they did in 2008.\n\nThis shortage of safe assets has pushed yields down and made it so that banks have no desire to make loans to decrease their reserves. Take a look at the [excess reserves](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXCSRESNS) banks have been holding. Since the 2008 crisis, excess reserves have exploded. This means that the bank is sitting on cash that they are doing nothing with. The common belief is that lending goes up as rates go down, since banks have to make more loans in order to sustain the same amount of profit. However, the data does not show that to be the case since the introduction of QE. The key thing that I have noticed in regards to excess returns and loans is that banks do not want to make loans at these low yields, possibly due to the massive unpriced systemic risk of our debt bubble popping. In Q1 2020, banks tightened their loan standards at a rate [comparable to 2008](https://www.barrons.com/articles/banks-are-tightening-lending-standards-like-it-was-2008-again-51588881348).\n\nA liquidity trap is created when low interest rates are low and consumers and institutions decide to save money instead of investing in low yielding bonds. The Fed started paying banks a [small risk free interest rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IOER) in 2008, which moves along with the Fed funds rate. I theorize that the shortage of safe assets and low interest rates has gone past the \u201creversal rate\u201d and accommodative monetary policy has become contractionary. In these uncertain times, banks would rather collect the small guaranteed risk free interest rate instead of introducing their balance sheets to any more risk, especially underpriced risk. The Fed believes that they are stimulating lending by cutting rates to 0. However, banks appear to not want to make non-guaranteed loans and instead are content to sit on their excess reserves. This means that the expansion of the monetary supply is not working as intended and that the money sitting in bank reserves is becoming contractionary. If loans aren\u2019t being made and that money isn\u2019t being spent, then that money may as well not exist in the money supply at all. According to a [Princeton economist](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/markus/files/25b_reversalrate.pdf) (PDF), quantitative easing raises this reversal interest rate and should only be done after rate cuts are exhausted. This means that the Fed could be unknowingly contracting the money supply, even though it appears that they are massively expanding it on paper.\n\n**Deflation**\n\nDeflation occurs when institutions and individuals don\u2019t spend their money in the real economy, whether by purchasing goods/services or making loans to businesses. The Fed\u2019s [deflation probability](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLPPMDEF), which is the possibility that personal consumption expenditures price index change will go below 0 in the next 12 months, spiked from .001 in January to .763 in May. The [probability](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLPPM) that we have inflation over 2.5% over the next 12 months has crashed down to .002 as of last month. As shown in the data above, consumers aren\u2019t spending and banks are stockpiling their reserves. This is deflationary and will lead to lower prices, lower corporate earnings, and lower asset prices.\n\nAs mentioned in the data further up in the post, consumer credit dropped at a much quicker rate than expected, even with projections taking coronavirus into account. Economists expected consumer credit to fall by [$14 billion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-consumer-credit-plummets-in-april-as-credit-card-use-tumbles-by-record-amount-2020-06-05) in April, but it fell by $68.8 billion instead. This was the largest one month drop in consumer borrowing since 1943. The core consumer price index (CPI) also [missed expectations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/10/us-consumer-price-index-may-2020.html) of a 0-0.1% jump, instead falling by 0.1% for last month. This came after April was the largest drop (-0.4%) on record since data started in 1957.\n\nAccording to [research from the Netherlands central bank](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecosys/v42y2018i1p45-63.html) (PDF), QE encourages risk taking by market participants and creates asset pricing bubbles. We are seeing bubbles across all asset classes thanks to the levels of debt in the economy (the stock market being an example). We even see debt bubbles too, like the $9 trillion of [corporate debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/21/theres-a-9-trillion-corporate-debt-bomb-bubbling-in-the-us-economy.html) (as of 2018) which help fuel these asset bubbles. The research from the Netherlands central bank also shows that asset bubbles popping are worth -4% inflation. An asset price bubble does not signal inflation either. I have picked out some quotes from the researcher that show QE might be leading to deflation:\n\n&gt;Overall, the results suggest that the signaling value of asset prices for inflation is weak and unstable, implying that while QE is effective in boosting asset prices \u2013 one of the main transmission channels of QE \u2212 higher asset prices may not always lead to higher inflation. High asset prices may even precede a low inflation regime. For policymakers this is useful information because, based on the outcome of our models, one cannot presume that QE by definition leads to higher inflation.\n\n&gt;If [\u2026] a surge in asset prices is not supported by real economic developments and therefore becomes unsustainable at some stage, the subsequent asset price collapse may cause a recession. \n&gt;While central banks intend to raise inflation by purchasing government bonds to reduce bond yields, our results indicate that this policy can have the opposite effect on inflation.\n\n**Conclusion: The Fake V-Shaped Recovery**\n\nI conclude after doing this research, that there is no chance of a V-shaped recovery in the economy, despite what the market is signaling. I believe that we are about to enter into a massive deflation cycle that is being assisted inadvertently by the Fed\u2019s policy of QE and the near 0% interest rates. Consumer credit is contracting and banks are stashing extra reserves, meaning that the real money supply is contracting. Default risk on commercial mortgage backed securities, corporate bonds (thanks to lower earnings), and other forms of debt will continue to rise as the economic effects of coronavirus and monetary policy undertaken by the Fed continue to be revealed. Defaults will rise even more if we get prolonged and sustained deflation as the weight of our debt crushes our financial system. I believe that, due to the historically high levels of retail activity in the market, it will crash soon as well. The wealth inequality effect of QE (which Powell denies the existence of) will make it increasingly harder for the economy to recover.\n\nAll of these things will feed off of each other as we get further into a deflationary cycle. It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for the Fed to get out of this crisis when we get into it. Deflation is rare historically and makes monetary policy ineffective, it is a central bank\u2019s worst nightmare. Deflation will dry up economic activity and cause us to go into a depression which will be difficult to get out of.\n\n**tl;dr**: Powell thinks he is injecting money into the economy but it really isn\u2019t going anywhere, the stock market is in a bubble that will pop very soon, corporate bond and CMBS default rates will increase over the coming year, deflation will make debt a heavier burden and cash more valuable, the Fed is powerless to stop it. Our economy enters a deflationary cycle that will be hard to get out of, until the bank reserves find their way into the real economy.\n\nI\u2019ve spent a very long time researching this stuff but I am not an expert in economics or monetary policy, just another idiot on WSB. I look forward to seeing any discussion or disagreement with the ideas that I have discussed.",

        "selftext": "Ok I\u2019ve seen a lot of posts on Hertz. Here\u2019s the thing. If you know my posts, I\u2019m a huge proponent by saying a stock goes up when \u201cthere\u2019s more buyers than sellers.\u201d  This is true and applies to a lot of stocks, so you can throw fundamentals, especially in the short term, all out of the window. \n\nHowever, Hertz is different. Right now, it is indeed going up because there are more buyers than sellers, like with any stock that goes up short term, but the reason it is different is the bankruptcy is actually an event that will cause the stock to go to 0 or near 0 (if you are lucky) regardless of how many buyers or sellers there are. \n\nThink of it like an option. An option\u2019s price, directly related to by its IV, is also controlled by buyers and sellers. However, if at expiration it is OTM, it\u2019s worth 0, no matter how many buyers there might be. That\u2019s because theta takes over and it goes to 0 at expiration. \n\nThis is like Hertz. Hertz has an event, when they officially finalize bankruptcy, that will wipe out all equity holders and treat this event as an \u201coption expiration for an OTM option.\u201d  So in this case, this stock will go to 0, so if you are buying now you are gonna be completely screwed. If you have Hertz, you should sell immediately next week. \n\nLook at the Jan leap options. You\u2019ll notice that almost all of the put options are worth similar to their strike price, so it\u2019s pretty much implying that it\u2019s going to 0 in the future. The 1 strike put didn\u2019t even decrease in value despite the stock going up like almost 100%. The bonds are still basically worth nothing. The only thing propping it up is supply and demand and that won\u2019t matter unlike the other stocks since there\u2019s an event that actually will cause the stock to go to 0. \n\nNow, someone smart here will be like \u201cyea but it can go up in the short term.\u201d Sure it can. But anything can. If you just wanna gamble like that, you should gamble in like an option on one of those highly volatile travel stocks in that case. Because that gamble is strictly more +EV than buying HTZ stock. You can get lucky and maybe get it right one random day, but on average buying HTZ stock is literally the most -EV thing on average you can do right now.",

That's how they (and we who are buying today) get your money. As long as you HOLD your positions you will be safe, and you will likely make up your losses within the next week. But you can't do that if you sold out of your positions.\n\nIf you have solid positions with good companies or index funds, DON'T panic sell. If you do, you are basically handing me your money. And to be perfectly honest, I don't need it as much as you probably do. I looked at my portfolio just now, i'm down $20,000, and I didn't bat an eye. Just thought to myself, \"I hope the newbies don't make any bad decisions today\" and back to my coffee and enjoying my family. And that isn't even that much. Some people saw six figures down today. They're probably sitting on a beach somewhere sipping Coronas. Do you want that to be you someday? You won't get there panic selling.\n\nIf you are 25 and barely have an emergency fund and you are down a few thousand bucks, I don't want your shares. I've got lots.

        "selftext": "I get it, many people are scratching their heads over why the stock market keeps going up, including professionals. They point to the terrible economic numbers and worsening social situation. But they are missing the point.\n\nThe stock market is going up because the value of the US currency, relative to productive assets, is going down. When the Fed prints trillions, and the amount of assets stays the same or declines at a rate lower than the increase in currency, this inflate asset prices. It's not captured in inflation numbers because of the way CPI is calculated and because of how these new supply of currency is distributed. We saw this after the financial crisis -- not much inflation in consumer goods, but massive inflation in housing and the stock market.\n\nThe stock market will continue to go up as long as the Fed continues to increase the supply of currency faster than the decline in earnings.\n\nSource: me. I manage money.\n\nEdit: Also look at gold, for example GLD. It's going up. All limited assets are going up because the USD is losing value. Since the USD is a key reserve currency with \\~ 2/3 share, a lot of foreigners are subsidizing US asset owners. I learned this from Ray Dalio.\n\nAlso, I don't like gold. Why? Because its value as a currency &amp; store of value has greatly been reduced by innovation in financial technology. What are you going to do, pay with gold? I don't think so. It is my view that equities of top tier companies, given it's liquidity and scarcity, is a better store of value and a better currency than gold.\n\nAgain, the world isn't crazy, most people just don't understand that currencies are being devalued relative to securities.\n\nEdit 2: So why are riots good for the market. One, it limits the US government's ability to escalate geopolitical issues, which means less screwing around with the supply chain, which is good for large cap stocks, which drives the indices that we call \"the market\". Two, unrest will incentivize the government to stimulate on the monetary and fiscal front. ",

Ideanomics price re-climbed after hours after good news about their second-stage of debt conversion. If the Chairman and Vice-Chairman and the company's investors, Venturas and YA II PN, don't believe that the company could grow, they wouldn't put money into the company with the intention of converting it into equity.\n\nSo, what is a convertible debt?\n\n&gt;It's simply a loan that an investor provides to a startup. It's a loan that's made with the intent that it's not going to be paid back, but  the intent that in the future it'll convert to ownership in the company. Typically, it'll convert into stock in a C corp. Convertible debt is very common method to startup companies.\n\nOn June 11, 2020 IDEX announced the second-stage of debt conversion, with the noteholders of each of the senior secured convertible debentures, and subordinated secured convertible debentures originally issued by the company during 2019, representing approximately USD 10.6 Million owed to two NY-area funds, ID Venturas and YA II PN. This comes on the back of last week's announcement that the Company's Chairman and Vice-Chairman had each converted their debt as part of the Company's plans to clean up its balance sheet and reduce interest payments as it gears up for growth. The effect of this has pushed out the average maturity on remaining debt until mid-2021.

They [already reported earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sptn/earnings) and beat estimates by $0.20/share. It had a 23% run-up before earnings ($16s -&gt; $20s).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's also consider United Natural Foods (UNFI) which reports on the 10th and already prereported blockbuster earnings and pulled 2020 guidance because they've already met it and plan to issue an update when earnings comes out. In the last couple of weeks, they've also experienced a run-up ($17s -&gt; $20s) despite most of the good news being priced in. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n## Why Kroger? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's similar to the above two companies with earnings not until next week. For those who follow my posts, I posted [DD on UNFI last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gun1mo/my_next_june_earning_play_during_this_pandemic/). TBH I waited too long to get into UNFI watching it rise, waiting for a dip to buy in, and missing out on a lot of gains. So I'm posting this early and buying in as early as possible to get ahead of the game on this one. As mentioned, there was a price run up on both UNFI and SPTN this last month, so I'm buying now and early to capture this. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTheir EPS estimate has a $0.88 consensus which I believe they're likely to beat. When UNFI revises their guidance on June 10th, I think the entire supermarket segment will rise on sentiment from the UNFI guidance which will be a strong upward price catalyst for Kroger the week before their earnings. It will confirm that grocers should have continued strong results through 2020. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRecovery is slow and restaurants are just starting to reopen. Unemployment is still in the double digits and people have gotten used to eating at home and are also weary of spending extra cash on eating out.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShould be continued strong sales throughout the summer and revised upward guidance from Kroger when earnings come out. They are up 37% over the last year but have traded relatively flat through the pandemic (last 3 months). They were deemed essential and made to work a lot of hours to get food back out to the stores. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n## What I'm doing\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo basically the trade on this is trading the news for the rest of the sector. The stock is about $4/share off their 52 week high, so the $35c 6/19 is the play due to it's ample open interest and tight bid/ask spread. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**tldr $35c 6/19**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: It's important to note that a portion of KR's rise today [was attributed to it's partnership with Roku](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/roku-stock-gains-after-company-announces-new-ad-targeting-program-2020-06-08). This should definitely add to the stock's upward momentum this coming week.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR - $WORK is not fully priced in; there is still time to jump in for earnings. 7/17 55c &amp; 8/21 44c\n\nUnless you've been living under the bed your girlfriends boyfriend bangs her on, you know that there's a pandemic on and a lot of need for remote working. Putting aside the actual issues and benefits of it, most of companies that have provided these services have been posting some pretty impressive earnings reports and guidance. $ZM in particular, as you know, has posted very impressive gains this past week, but the cloud and virtual workspace companies in general have done pretty damn great. But we're nearing the end of earnings and there isn't all that much left, but there is something for today, and that's $WORK.\n\nSlack ($WORK) is a subscription-based distributor of virtual workspace technology. There are groups, rooms, support for 3rd party apps so you can send shit back and forth between colleagues, etc. Obviously they're set to do pretty great right? And if it's been on your radar recently, you'll know that it's up pretty significantly even since last week. In fact, today it reached the highest its been since IPO; and it's set to keep going up. &gt;But wait, you say, ain't it priced in? And for the more intelligent among you, you might point out that $MSFT offers basically the same thing through Microsoft Teams, which unlike $WORK's product comes free for businesses which also have a deal with Microsoft. So why, you may ask, would any business shell out for what they already get for free? Doesn't that hurt $WORK both for earnings and for future guidance?\n\nHere's the thing though. Teams is like using hand cream and your hand to crank it; Slack is like Astroglide and a top-tier pocket pussy to do the same. One gets the job done, and one gets the job better and makes you cum. I want you guys to cum with me. You get what you pay for in the virtual workspace market, and Slack has the name recognition and quality to be something companies are willing to pay a subscription for. It's just better overall. Of course what's one autist's take on it, when you could ask what the top dogs are doing. IBM is rolling this shit out to it's entire 350k member workforce; IBM isn't some millennial orgy startup, it's a real company with real weight. There's also some behind the scene \u201crumors\u201d that Amazon is gonna be adopting it the coming months for a large section of their operations. YES AMAZON. ONCE THAT NEWS BREAKS IT WILL MOOOOON.\u00a0 Ya know, that one. If that isn't a resounding endorsement of Slack's quality, idk what you're waiting for, because God himself isn't about to come down telling you Heaven's adopting Slack anytime soon.\n\nWe can see that the stock price is way above the VWAP line indicating a bullish run coming. Further more using the different SMAS I have implemented in my studies it has auto made the upward trend to create those purple lines all pointing upwards. Furthermore we can see it broke the $40 resistance ah and can see the continuation during premarket . Also we can see that the rsi is rising above the 60 line indicating a bullish run as well. The run it has had has no gaps below to fill so we will continue to rise and incorporating UOA showing big money is predicting a big rise after earnings as well. If any of you fucking idiots don\u2019t know TA then it means stonk go up dumbasses.\n\nI think it's pretty clear that $WORK has some mid-term growth in it, and if you're expecting Wave 2: Electric Boogaloo that's even more assured. I'm pretty bullish, so I've grabbed 7/17 55c. It's pretty far OTM, I know, but they're cheap and with what I'm expecting on earnings, they're gonna blow past some of the deep algorithmic TA that I've been seeing putting WORK at $42 a share, and I think it's going to stay up there and keep going. So why bother with the IV crush of short-dated options? Slack's becoming to the virtual office game what Zoom is to the video-conferencing game, and I fully expect AH is gonna be like watching the 1969 moon mission from a front-row seat.\nIBM - \u00a0https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/slack-stock-price-ibm-biggest-account-global-employees-messaging-platform-2020-2-1028890304\n\nMy stake -\u00a0https://imgur.com/a/LtfjJnz\n\nFurther reinforcement its compatible with AMZN -\u00a0https://imgur.com/a/QdHbxs5\n\nTA -\u00a0https://imgur.com/a/eREtF4V\n\nDisclaimer: None of the above is financial advice. Don't buy options just because some random tells you something; do the research and make an informed decision for yourself.

        "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/09/robinhood-traders-cash-in-on-the-market-comeback-that-billionaire-investors-missed.html\n\nOne 26-year-old Robinhood trader made $1,500 in less than 24 hours betting on a beaten-down airline stock, while many so-called experts on Wall Street warned about buying into an overvalued stock market that was bound to tumble again amid the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nLast Thursday, Lequon Godbolt, purchased a call option for American Airlines that made him $200 on the millennial-favored stock trading app.\n\nAfter seeing reports that the airline was increasing domestic flying for summer travel, Godbolt bought another call option minutes before the close. When the market opened higher last Friday after a surprisingly positive jobs report, Godbolt raked in his profits. \n\n\u201cI just started taking it seriously about two months ago,\u201d Godbolt \u2014 a New York resident\u2014 told CNBC. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching AAL since the beginning of that time and I felt eventually, once Covid relaxed, markets would move up.\u201d\n\nGodbolt is not alone is his success trading this market. One Chicago-resident flipped his sister\u2019s stimulus check into nearly $10,000. \n\nRobinhood traders lived up to their outlaw name during the coronavirus market downturn. The young investors booked profits \u2014 trading stocks with some of the best returns in the past two months \u2014 while other Wall Street veterans were left scratching their heads. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like momentum begetting momentum,\u201d Tim Welsh, founder and CEO of wealth management consulting firm Nexus Strategy, told CNBC. \u201cThe aspect of just access is really driving a lot of this and the whole upward tick in the markets, again, just fuels demand.\u201d\n\nYoung investors, like Godbolt, appeared to have a prescient understanding of the market, unlike the billionaire hedge fund managers who said stocks would retest their lows. Longtime investor Stanley Druckenmiller \u2014 who misjudged equities\u2019 comeback \u2014 said Monday that the market\u2019s strong performance over the last three weeks has \u201chumbled\u201d him and that he underestimated the power of the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven legendary investor Warren Buffett sold his stake in airlines during the pandemic. Of course, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman is a long-term, bargain shopper and the airline industry\u2019s long-term outlook is yet to be determined. \n\nV-shape after all?\nSigns are pointing to a V-shaped recovery \u2014 a sharp fall in economic activity followed by a dramatic rise \u2014 in the economy. This theory was rejected by economists and investors who found it unrealistic due to the detrimental ramifications of the mandated shutdown of the U.S. economy. \n\nStocks have soared in June, helped by the historic Labor Department jobs report that showed the U.S. economy added a record 2.5 million jobs in May. Wall Street was calling for a decline of 8.3 million. The unemployment rate dropped to 13.3%, far better than the expected 19.5% rate.",

        "selftext": "In this week's edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we'll be exploring the most common way that investors calculate what a stock's actually worth, and then why this valuation method no longer anymore. Also, apparently mods disabled image uploads, so this post is going to be a bit hard to read since I rely a lot on visuals in them; please direct all your complaints to them.\n\n  \n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so; look at what happened to all the SPY 220p 4/17 bag holders. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n# The Discounted Cash Flow Model\n\nThe DCF model is the most common model for valuing companies in finance, and hence the fair value of a stock. It\u2019s based on one simple principle: the value of a company is based on the ability of that company to generate cash flows in the future. This principle is used in virtually every other financial instruments, like bonds, and is also used to help aid capital expenditure decisions. This method of valuing a company became popular after the 1929 stock market crash, once the \u201cstonks\u00a0only go up\u201d mentality broke and investors started investing in equities based on value and returns rather than speculation, which drove much of the stock market in the 1920s, but this idea has been used as far back as ancient Egypt.\n\n**Time Value of Money**\n\nBefore looking into the math behind the DCF model, another principle needs to be understood - Time Value of Money. This is the principle that money today, or the Present Value, is worth more than money in the future, or Future Value. The difference in worth can be caused by many things, such as inflation, the interest rate of Treasuries (i.e. risk free rate), and risk of default. This difference of worth is calculated to some interest rate, r, which is then used to calculate the Present Value of some future cash flow.\n\n[Time Value of Money Formula](https://imgur.com/a/1DGJMFj)\n\n**Cost of Capital**\n\nIn the case of valuing a company, what would this rate be? Typically, the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, or WACC is used for this percentage.\n\n[WACC Formula](https://imgur.com/a/pBwR0xB)\n\nWACC in simple terms is the rate of return typically required to be paid by the company to shareholders and bondholders to raise capital from them. In this formula,\n\n*E is the market capitalization of all equity in the company*\n\n*D is the value of all debt in the company*\n\n*V = E+D*\n\n*Tc is the tax rate paid by the company*\n\n*Rd is the cost of debt, for simplicity let\u2019s say this is the average interest rate paid by the company for its outstanding debts*\n\n*Re is the cost of equity. The most common way of calculating this is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), with the formula below*\n\n[Cost of Equity Formula](https://imgur.com/a/l8hRXa4)\n\nIn this formula,\n\nRf is the risk free rate, which is the interest rate an investor can receive when investing in some risk free asset, like a US treasury\n\n\u03b2 represents the volatility of a company\u2019s stock on the stock market; this value has its own complicated formula but this value can be usually found in most stock trading platforms\n\nRm is the long-term return of equity markets. Hence (Rm - Rf) is typically seen as the equity risk premium, which is the excess returns given by the stock market for taking on the risk of investing in equities rather than treasuries\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFree cash flow is typically reported as part of a public company\u2019s financial statements and hence can easily be discovered. Intuitively, it\u2019s the company\u2019s ability to generate cash from operations to pay back stock and bond holders, and is calculated by adding non-cash expenses (i.e. depreciation, amortization), subtracting capital expenditures, and adding increases in current assets - liabilities to the post-tax EBIT, or Earnings before Interest and Taxes.\n\n**Putting it all together**\n\n[Enterprise Value Formula](https://imgur.com/a/IXoFalW)\n\nWith all of these in mind, let\u2019s use them to calculate the Enterprise Value of a company. This is done by adding the sums of all future cash flows generated by the company, and discounting it by the weighted average cost of capital. Since a company can have a potentially perpetual stream of cash flows, and future cash flows beyond a few years becomes very unpredictable, we would instead only do this calculation for the first five years, and then add some \u201cTerminal Value\u201d of the company to represent how much the company would be worth by the end of that period, and discount that as well.\n\n[Terminal Value Formula](https://imgur.com/a/3dfSLS9)\n\nTo calculate this Terminal Value, we\u2019ll need to have some rate, g, which represents the \u201cgrowth rate\u201d of the company once it\u2019s mature and no longer growing rapidly (i.e. taking market share).\n\nOnce you add all of the discounted near-term cash flows and discounted Terminal Value, you now have the Enterprise Value. Once you have that, figuring out the fair value of all the equity in a company, or the market cap, is easy.\n\n**Fair Market Cap = Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash**\n\n# Where we are right now\n\nLet\u2019s see how recent events have changed the equation for equity valuations today compared to in January for the stock market overall.\n\n**Cost of Equity**\n\nRisk Free Rate - Looking at US Treasuries, this is this most obvious and well-known change in this equation, with yields plummeting from 1.5% from the start of the year to near 0% today.\n\n[Risk Free Rate Graph](https://imgur.com/a/LLcMoDC)\n\nMarket Risk Premium - This one is a bit complicated because it can\u2019t really be immediately calculated and is based largely on investor sentiment. Historically, market risk premium has been between 5% to 6% for the US stock market. This can easily change, however, based on economic and financial conditions. Right now, let\u2019s assume this has remained unchanged, but we\u2019ll get back to this later.\n\n**Cost of Capital**\n\nDebt - Corporate debt this year has exploded, with an [additional $1 Trillion raised by companies](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/corporations-raise-1-trillion-in-the-bond-market-after-fed-backstop-double-the-pace-of-last-year.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861873000)\u00a0so far, more than double from last year at the same time of the year\n\nEquity - SPY started at this year at $325; As of time of writing, it\u2019s within 2% of this number\n\nCost of Debt - Despite skyrocketing bond yields in March as the economy experienced a liquidity crisis, bond yields have since stabilized, aided by the Fed backstop, and bonds yields are now at about the same levels as it was at the start of the year.\n\n[Bond Yields](https://imgur.com/a/wFITrco)\n\nSo assuming the risk premium being the same, compared to the start of the year, we have a slightly lower cost of equity from a lower risk free rate, roughly the same cost of debt, and having increased corporate debt, making the debt weigh more proportionally than before in our WACC. Since the cost of debt is usually slightly lower than the cost of equity, this provides a slight downwards pressure towards WACC as well. Thus, WACC has decreased by a small amount since January, due to increased debt levels and decreased risk free rates.\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFor most non-tech companies, the lockdown has severely hurt their cash flows, with many industries such as airlines burning billions of dollars per month. It\u2019s pretty hard to find up-to-date metrics of what free cash flow is for the S&amp;P500, so instead, I\u2019ll just use earnings as a proxy to make a very rough estimate of what it might look like. According to [one source](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_051520.pdf) I found, Q1 saw the YoY decline of 14.6%, with an estimated 36% decline in earnings for Q2.\n\nWhat free cash flow looks like for the remainder of the year, and future years depends on two very fundamental questions.\n\nFirst, will there be a second wave of lockdowns later in the year? On one side of this, based on the history of similar pandemics and what most medical experts are saying, a second spike of cases is extremely likely to occur in the fall. On the other hand, the US population seemed to have stopped caring about the virus, and is currently distracted by other problems. It\u2019s unclear whether or not the US population will care enough to lock down the country once again when the second wave hits after being desensitized with the first wave. In fact the first wave never really stopped; the US just started pretending that the pandemic is over and it\u2019s time to go back to business as usual.\n\n[US Daily Cases](https://imgur.com/a/iVirLQ4)\n\n[Daily Cases for Italy; What \"flatten the curve\" actually looks like](https://imgur.com/a/fhaz2IR) \n\nThe second question, assuming the answer to the first question is \u201cNo\u201d, is what kind of recovery the US economy will see. According to [one source](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://conference-board.org/publications/Economic-Forecast-US&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861874000), \u00a0\u201cV\u201d-shaped recovery will see earnings going back to normal as early as 2021. A \u201cU\u201d-shaped recovery, which will represent a recession, could see it take up until 2022 to return back to pre-COVID output levels. If we do see a second wave of lockdowns, then what might be seen is a \u201cW\u201d-shaped recovery, where we\u2019ll see a second steep decline in GDP, and prolong the recession and make it tougher to get towards a recovery as more businesses go bankrupt.\n\n[GDP Projections](https://imgur.com/a/jK78km1)\n\nMissing from this model is an \u201cL\u201d-shaped recovery, similar to what happened in Japan in the 1990s, and the US in the 1930s, which would represent a decade-long depression. This is what I personally believe would look like in [my long-term thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqgwfg/dddd_cycles_and_human_history/), along with some of the most famous investors in the financial world, [like Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/).\n\nBack to the DCF Model; we have an additional $1 Trillion of corporate debt. With a total market cap of $32 Trillion, the effect of this on the fair value of equities are negligible. With nearly the same market cap as in the beginning of the year, this would mean the market is pricing in the same Enterprise Value for the market as the start of the year. This implies either one of two things, based on the factors explained about\n\n1. The stock market has priced in a \u201cV\u201d-shaped recovery for earnings, with earnings and free cash flow beyond 2020 to remain unimpaired.\n2. The stock market has priced in a \u201cU\u201d-shaped recovery, but this is offset by a lower WACC as the market risk premium has significantly lowered. This can be caused by a few things, such as decreased perceived risk by investors of companies due to fiscal and monetary stimulus, and inflows of cash that was previously waiting in the sidelines (eg. retail investors), large international funds (eg. Saudi and Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth funds), and yield-seeking institutions as Treasury yields drop to 0%, with no prospect of a rate increase anytime soon.\n\n**Why Fundamentals Might Not Matter Anymore**\n\nThere\u2019s another thing that can explain the recent stock market movements other the reasons explained above of what the stock market was pricing in - a stock market bubble. This happens when speculation in the market overpowers fundamentals, and the money in the market is no longer investing for long-term, earnings-based gains, but rather trying to get short-term gains through speculation. In other words people throwing their money in the stock market aren\u2019t investing because they legitimately think the company has good fundamentals and will give a good return on their investment through earnings in the long term, but because they believe that stocks only go up, and hence they can make a quick buck by throwing some money in it and cashing out later and making money through capital gains. This is how every asset bubble starts, from the Dutch tulip-mania bubble, the English South Sea bubble, the 1920s stock market bubble, the dot com stock market bubble, and the real estate bubble in the 2000s.\n\nTo give an example to illustrate what\u2019s happening, let\u2019s look at one of the first major bankruptcies to have happened during the stock market crash - Whiting Petroleum (WLL). I\u2019ve previously covered WLL, but the most interesting part of it is the dislocation of the valuation of its stock and bonds.\n\nWLL [reached a bankruptcy agreement](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1255474/000119312520118310/d922194dex10.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861876000)\u00a0with some of its key creditors on April 23. To be clear, this agreement has not been agreed upon with all its creditors and has yet to be approved by the court, and represents the best-case outcome for existing WLL shareholders; the court or creditors and reject this and demand better terms, or even worse, request to change the bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 and liquidate all the assets. The agreement was to restructure the corporation such that the bondholder will receive 97% of the restructured company\u2019s equity, and the remaining 3% will be given to existing shareholders and management.\n\nAs of this writing, the price for WLL bonds were all between $15 - $16.50.\n\n[Example WLL Bond Pricing](https://imgur.com/a/ktLeGQo)\n\nUsing this, we can calculate what the bond market is pricing the restructured WLL at; multiplying the market value of all the outstanding bonds by 97% would give you the implied price of it. From the most recent [10-Q](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc%3D/Archives/edgar/data/1255474/000125547420000011/wll-20200331x10q.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591575861876000), the face value of all notes involved in the bankruptcy agreement is $2.4B. Using the highest bond price of $16.5, or 0.165% of face value, the implied market cap of the restructured WLL would be $2.4B \\* \u00a00.165% \\* 97% = $384M.\n\nWith 91M shares outstanding, this would mean the fair value of the old WLL shares would be $384M \\* 3% / 91M = $0.13. As of writing, the current share price is more than 10 times higher than this, at $1.38.\n\nHow could this be possible? It\u2019s because absolutely no one speculates with bonds, and bond prices are usually entirely grounded in fundamentals; people buying bonds buy it to hold onto it and not to sell it later at a higher price. The opposite is clearly happening with WLL stocks. Noone is buying WLL to receive a small stake in the reorganized corporation once the bankruptcy agreement clears in the best case; if an institution really wanted it, they would have just bought the bonds. Instead, people are buying these shares because they believe they can sell it shortly after for a higher price. This is what\u2019s going on in the stock market right now, which is how bubbles form.\n\n**Making Tendies in a Bubble**\n\nOkay, so you now believe, like me, that the stock market is now in a bubble, and has been in a [longer-term bubble for the last decade](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzmlsv/spy_1125_150p/). Does this mean that I should sell all my long positions, buy puts, and short the market? Absolutely not. **Never short a bubble**. The whole idea of a bubble is that asset prices no longer reflect its intrinsic value, but is based on sentiment and speculation. Just because it\u2019s overvalued now doesn\u2019t mean it will immediately crash, and there\u2019s nothing stopping it from being even more overvalued in the near future; fundamentals aren\u2019t stopping it anymore. This has been the most clear the past week, with the first wave of COVID-19 cases never actually ending, bad vaccine news, and most US cities literally on fire, yet the stock market is skyrocketing for no apparent reason.\n\nInstead, my personal strategy is to play into this bubble, while holding a substantial amount of VIX calls as a hedge for when the stock market bubble eventually pops. I\u2019m holding VIX calls of multiple strike prices and expiry dates, mostly in Fall, since I personally believe the stock market will go back towards reality once more companies become insolvent (i.e. Fed can no longer help them), and a second spike in cases forces countries around the world to a second wave of lockdowns, as warned by most medical experts.\n\nIn the meanwhile, I\u2019ll be using Technical Analysis, which is most useful for markets on assets with no fundamentals and driven by pure sentiment, to drive my short-term and medium-term strategies. Some of you who have been following me for the past few weeks may know that my previous thesis revolved around SPY never breaking above 293 (+2%), which looked like it was going to happen until it didn\u2019t. This is because according to historical precedents, breaking above this level will bring SPY above the 62% retracement, and 200D EMA, and cause a 1W MACD crossover, which always resulted in a V-shaped recovery and new ATHs soon after. Of course, back then I believed fundamentals still mattered a bit and that this would not happen, but I was clearly wrong and it became clear we're in a short-term super-bubble within the longer-term bubble; SPY will be hitting new ATHs within the next few weeks.\n\nMy personal strategy for playing the bubble is the same as previous weeks, for those that have been following me - if the market is pricing in a V-shaped recovery, go long on the weakest and most beaten-down stocks that are not currently in bankruptcy, since those will be skyrocketing within the next few weeks as we see a rotation of capital from strong stocks like FAANG that have retraced back to their ATHs towards weak stocks, such as airlines, cruises, and banks. In other words, I'm literally inversing my strategy from a few months ago. Two weeks ago, some of these positions included CCL, JPM, and BA, which I entered into as soon as I saw their 1W MACD crossover, and have been doing phenomenally well last week. However, I have since exited BA and JPM and taken profit and rolled them into M, GE, WFC, and DAL, among other positions.\n\n[CCL, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/XZrR7kj)\n\n[BA, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/YXFkNji)\n\n[GE, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/RrZftMq)\n\n[DAL, Daily](https://imgur.com/a/7OrpvTa)\n\nMy strategy for these tickers\u00a0are simple - enter long positions (i.e. calls) as soon as they break the 24% retracement, which acted as a resistance for these industries until recently, and hence means that their stock price will skyrocket once it breaks it, and exit at the 50% retracements. BA and JPM have since hit these marks, so I exited. This week, I\u2019m holding calls from CCL, DAL, WFC, and GE, which has yet to have broken these levels. The market will probably need to consolidate next week because we\u2019ve had a lot of green days in a row, and it\u2019s getting pretty overbought, so I\u2019m not expecting these to print immediately. As I exit all of these positions and take profit, I\u2019ll be rolling half of the profits over towards more VIX calls for more hedging.\n\n# Live Updates\n\nAs always, I'll be posting some thoughts throughout the next few days in this thread below for people interested.\n\n6/7 8PM - Futures very green, especially /RTY, maybe the market is just gonna go for a 5th green day in a row with strong bullish momentum.",

        "selftext": "Alright boys time to let the people that don't already know in on another beautiful SPAC play that has ridiculous potential. FMCI, or Forum Merger II Corp announced on May 13, 2020 that they have\u00a0[signed a letter of intent](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390020012047/ea121786-defa14a_forummergii.htm)\u00a0with \u201c*a high-growth, plant-based food company with a broad portfolio of innovative products that are aligned with major food trends and sold through leading retailers and distributors across the United States.*\u201d  They also stated that the Target\u2019s disruptive strategy is focused on addressing the growing consumer demand for nutritious, great tasting, better-for-you products with plant-based food. The Target\u2019s alignment with today\u2019s secular food trends, combined with its robust, plant-based offerings that feature unique ingredients, innovative recipes and creative branding, has allowed it to establish a meaningful market presence in a short period of time. Best case scenario is a merger with Impossible Foods. Impossible also just recently had a job listing for a \"Stock admin\" which is something a publicly traded company would be looking for. They are looking for a company valued between $500 million-2b. Impossible is a bit outside of that range but it's still a possibility. (Valued around $2.5b)\n\nFMCI had a stockholder meeting today to vote to extend the SPAC that expires on June 10th to the end of September. They also stated at their meeting that they will be officially signing with and announcing the company they intend to merge within the next couple of weeks. In connection with the extension, none of the Company\u2019s public shares were redeemed by stockholders. (very bullish imo)\n\nOther possible companies include Just, Inc, Before the Butcher, Follow Your Heart, Turtle Island, etc. \n\nCurrently, Beyond Meat $BYND is the one and only stock in the plant-based meat market that is publicly traded with a current market cap of 8.4 Billion, but this has been as high as 15 Billion back in July less than 3 months after their IPO. Even if it's not Impossible, I think giving Beyond a competitor on the market will help both companies.

        "selftext": "It should go without being said that Stonks in fact, only go up. But how high will Ford go?\n\nWhy I think Ford will be mooning over the next few weeks.\n\n1. Even though its been a meme, it seems this market follows memes more than anything else. So it may be very true that with all of these Ford police vehicles being damaged in the riots, it would in fact cause more orders from the local PD's to Ford. \n\n2. Ford is becoming a 'trend' brand car in China. Its very rare to see an American branded car in China, due to imports, etc, but since Ford started a venture there, their sales jumped over 130% from last year. For some reason Chinese people adore americans. If you go there, they will literally want to take pictures of you just because you are white. \n\n3. Most importantly, with Robinhood users soaring since the lockdown came into place, there are a lot of millenials trying to dabble with stocks. Not only is Ford one of the most common stocks for new traders to buy, but just the other day Ford put out a statement condemning George Floyd's death and spoke out against racism. This will only draw the attention to Ford more for early investors and drive the price up.\n\nLet me know how retarded I am for thinking this and why.",

        "selftext": "Heard ya'll were looking for more DD Threads, so here's my play:\n\n**COTY**\n\nCoty is a huge manufacturer of luxury brand cosmetics (Think: Burberry, Adidas, Calvin Klein, Cover girl, Bourjois, Tiffany &amp; Co). This is one of the global titans of cosmetics and beauty.\n\nCoty has been getting absolutely murdered in the streets during COVID, which makes sense considering the lockdown. Why would you buy buying make up if you're stuck inside and no one can see you?\n\nCoty initially started recovering some of their large stock losses in april, but with a recent fiasco of Kylie Jenner's networth being potentially false and Coty's new partnership with Kyle Jenner, the stock was hit hard again on Mid may due to doubts that this collaboration would succeed, dropping to $3.2 compared to a local max in Feb at $13. ATH was $32 in 2016.\n\nAt max it was down 75% in only three months. It hasn't even recovered a portion of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why is this a buy now?**\n\n**Re-opening Hype**: We've all seen the reopening hype of sports, bars, casinos, air travel. Coty serving luxury beauty, health, make-up, and fragrances will see significantly increased attention as the COVID lockdown absolutely slammed the demand of their products.\n\n**\"Scandal\" over:** It has an absolute huge room to grow with the scandal behind them. It has gone up a bit since the scandal crashed the price, but it has significant room to grow in comparison to their february local peak. Even recovering half of the price drop as so many other lockdown hit stocks did, this would be more than a 10 bagger.\n\n**Potential buyout rumors:** There's been talk on the streets about a potential buyout. **(**[link](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/28/the-company-that-wants-to-buy-coty.aspx)).\n\n**Robinhood Buyers increasing:** The past 3 weeks there's been a massive increase in buying of Robinhood users, hitting around top 30 robinhood buy increase last week.   This is increasing each week. If you want in on this play you should jump on soon before the risk isn't worth the reward.

However, 2021 is expected to show a 5% gain followed by 3.5% in 2022.\n\nThe central bank repeated its commitment from the April meeting that it \u201cexpects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.\u201d\n\nThe Fed also said it will continue to increase its bond holdings, targeting Treasury purchases at $80 billion a month and mortgage-backed securities at $40 billion.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee met this week as states begin to reopen and after unemployment saw its worst monthly drop in history followed by its biggest gain. In addition, the meeting comes the same week the National Bureau of Economic Research declared that a recession started in February, ending the longest expansion in U.S. history.\n\nFed officials skipped releasing their quarterly economic projections at March meetings as uncertainty permeated over how long the U.S. would remain in stay-at-home mode and how deep the damage would be.\n\nThey did release their forecasts this week. Here are the key numbers for 2020, followed by the next two years and the long-run projection:\n\nFed funds rate: 0%-0.25% through 2022, with the long-run rate at 2.5%\n\nGDP: -6.5% in 2020, 5%, 3.5%, 1.8%\n\nUnemployment: 9.3%, 6.5%, 5.5%, 4.1%.\n\nHeadline inflation: 0.8%, 1.6%, 1.7%, 2%.\n\nCore inflation: 1%, 1.5%, 1.7%.\n\nMarkets reacted positively to the news, with stocks coming well off their lows of the day and edging toward positive territory.",

Maybe revealing the two Retailers that renewed contracts with IZEA, one of them a **Fortune 10** customer.\n\n[Current FORTUNE 10](https://preview.redd.it/83vzg0hu2z351.png?width=639&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d5904999c04eb786904c21c5a6e3626e79288c1)\n\nOn IZEA's [Customers landing page](https://izea.com/managed-services/our-customers/), Wal-Mart is (technically) the only current Fortune 10 company that previously has had a contract with IZEA. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pn2v0ffy2z351.png?width=995&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=471d7a737bf9826697169060a5e62a1baa2473ec\n\nHowever, we know that [Twitch and IZEA are already in bed together](https://izea.com/influencer-marketing/twitch/). And who owns Twitch? Yep, you guessed it...AMAZON. Could Amazon indirectly be the Fortune 10 customer because they own Twitch? Maybe. But Twitch is not on the above Customer's page which was surprising to me.\n\nThis brings me to the Jump in Line lyrics that have been used as captions on each of the Social Media posts so far. The song has had appearances in:\n\n1. [The Little Mermaid](https://youtu.be/5p6DUZUFC7E)\n2. [Beetlejuice](https://youtu.be/QooqZkNk8Bw)\n3. Even [Pitbull and T-Pain made their own version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmuKdoe8MvI) (screenshot of lyrics below so you don't have to listen to the song....)\n4. Steve Wozniak\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Shake Senora lyrics](https://preview.redd.it/xqspo4956z351.png?width=379&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef15c6818331ec2f9202fd9113c19884e95cef71)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Little Mermaid**: Disney is currently ranked 53rd in the Fortune 500. That eliminates them from being the Fortune 10 customer. Have they had a previous contract with IZEA? I couldn't find anything publicly but did confirm [the CEO has consulted with Disney before](https://izea.com/company/leadership/ted-murphy/).\n\n* [IZEA HQ is in Orlando, a short drive from Disney World](https://izea.com/contact-us/orlando/) (Keep in mind that Walt Disney Co. is technically HQed in Burbank, CA)\n* A Live-action remake of the Little Mermaid, originally announced back in 2016, was originally scheduled to begin production in April 2020. Then COVID happened. [Filming is now expected to begin as early as JULY 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(franchise)#Live-action_remake) \n* [They have finished recording all the music for the film](https://thedisinsider.com/2020/04/17/first-look-at-prince-erics-castle-for-the-live-action-the-little-mermaid/) \n\n**Beetlejuice**\n\n* Distributed by Warner Bros. A sequel has been shelved as of April 2019.\n* One of the most memorable appearances of this song was in Beetlejuice during the climax of the movie.\n* Warner Music Group ($WMG) - On June 3, WMG officially had its second IPO on Nasdaq (went private in 2011), raising $2 billion with a valuation of $12.75 bilion.\n* Could there be some connection to WMG? Unlikely, since Harry Belafonte released all his albums with RCA Victor which is owned by Sony Music. With no sequel in the works and Sony owning rights to Belafonte's albums, it's hard to find a connection there.\n\n**T-Pain**\n\n* In a \"random\" social media post today, IZEA gave a shoutout to a past marketing campaign for  [Target and Trident Gum](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBN8qj5h0OB/) \n* I reached out to the users tagged on this post to find out how recent the campaign happened but received no responses.\n* HOWEVER, this past February, T-Pain had a pop-up performance in Chicago to unveil his partnership with Trident Gum and drive awareness to their new product Trident VIBES gum.\n* Yes, T-Pain was featured in Pitbull's rendition of Shake Senora, AND partnered with Trident Gum for this recent marketing campaign that IZEA spotlighted on its social media accounts TODAY.\n   * \"The campaign produced 41 pieces of content, 295k+ social interactions, and an engagement rate of 10.32% \ud83c\udfaf Instagram stories drove 11x more click through traffic to the coupon redemption page than Instagram photos in this campaign\"\n*  [Trident's IG post revealing T-Pain partnership](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9Xio9NhifB/) \n* This still seems like a stretch to me, but Target is actually on IZEA's customer's page (link above), right next to Wal-Mart....\n* **Apple**\n* This one seems furthest from likely, but I wanted to include all my findings.\n* In 2009, in season 8 of Dancing with the Stars, Steve Wozniak danced a Samba to this song.\n* It was terrible lol. He got a 10 out of 30, the second lowest score in the history of the show. \"It was the only dance that got 3s or less and was not the celebrity's final dance.\"\n* Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs and AAPL, as you know, is #4 in the FORTUNE 10.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, this leaves us with the perpetual question:\n\n# What does it all mean? \n\nWell, I don't fucking know. But let us commence this Discussion. Share your feedback. Share your own thoughts that might connect some dots I didn't. Hell, maybe it'll become a megathread by Friday's announcement. I will add on as I make new discoveries. Bless everyone that is along for the ride! And cheers to all who may profit from IZEA.\n\n \n\nOP's Investments into IZEA:\n\nCurrently, here is my investment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpgo5cuihz351.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ed3fa6bb775b22f4688b1fc4bea900864dc03e0\n\nLast month, I had owned 5,547 shares at an avg price of 0.6199. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18tqh3tmgz351.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9221064dfc0547716cfa2d4f850cf576bb0f86f1\n\nWith weak hands, I regrettably sold for a loss to put that equity elsewhere.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rbrnongogz351.png?width=704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c2e106b100f12a4e8244f1dfcb491f451d1d2c1",

Buy PRPL calls.   New higher strikes are now available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't post links or pictures, so this will be brief.   Check my post history for the last three posts I made on PRPL if you want full DD.   I'm going to write this for those following the stock who have read those.  I did have a diagram made for all of this too...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Underwriter Exercise of Secondary Offering Option\n\nOn Monday, Purple \"announced that the underwriters of its previously announced underwritten secondary public offering have exercised in full their option to purchase an additional 1,618,405 shares of its Class A common stock\".\n\nThis was fully expected as the Underwriters got the option to buy 1.6M shares at only $10.50 as a result of running the book on the secondary offering.   Remember, that this offering was just founders selling shares, so it was non-dilutionary, as is this exercise.\n\nThe underwriters are in the business of making transactions occur, not determining whether to invest in the company itself, so my hypothesis on the trading behavior today and unexpected volume is that the underwriters are just cashing in their shares they got.\n\n***This artificially depresses the price, but creates a great buying opportunity today/tomorrow.***   Volume was just over a million shares today, which is much higher than the last week or so of volume by far.\n\nIf you go look at a 6-month chart, you will notice that 12/17/2019 was the very beginning of a nice run up after the last secondary offering for PRPL.   This was also the date of the last exercise notice and the last time the downward pressure was relieved on the stock that comes from a secondary offering.\n\nMonday, with the announcement of the exercise, today with the cashing in of shares, and likely tomorrow with remaining shares being exited also ***represents the end of significant downward pressure on the stock during the secondary offering period.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going to reiterate my $19 price target by 8/12 earnings and that the stock should be trading at $20-$24 right now.   ***Today and tomorrow represent a great entry point if you are looking for one.***   I'm expecting the run up of 1-4% per day to continue until we reach the price range mentioned earlier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy apologies for being a day late on this call out, but life has been busy.\n\nI'm long 521,400 PRPLW warrants, 301 shares of PRPL, 30x 15c 6/19 and 10x 15c 10/16.

The only thing he said that can be construed as positive today was\n\n1. no rise in rates for a year or 2. no shit. if they raise rates it will stall the economy. no brainier there.\n2. the fed will step in if markets stop functioning correctly.

        "selftext": "Airlines are a notoriously low margin, competitive business. There are highly restrictive regulations surrounding training+safety which give labor unions a large amount of bargaining power. Airplane fuel, airplane maintenance, and airplanes are all extremely expensive as well. It is also highly competitive. This is why Warren Buffet hates the industry-in 2013 he said *\u201c*Investors have poured their money into airlines for 100 years with terrible results..*.*It's been a death trap for investors.\u201d\n\nTake a look at American Airlines business in normal economic conditions. Here are some financial statistics from Q4 2019. These are all taken from their 10q.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5832t7st2451.png?width=990&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e11c0fc2cae69fef4df0e1263c1242d192996094\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTotal operating revenues: 45,768 million\n\n\\-93% of revenues are from passenger sales\n\nTotal operating expenses: 42,703 million \n\n\\-29.5% of expenses are for labor. These costs are FIXED until September 30: per the terms of the CARES act, AAL is restricted from firing a single worker until then. Therefore, any layoffs must be involuntary w/severance packages. \n\n\\-9.4% of expenses are for aircraft payment+depreciation. These are also fixed. \n\n\\-17.9% of expenses are regional expenses, which are just all the expenses for their regional carrier (American Eagle). That carrier has similar expense composition. \n\nInterest expenses: 1,095 million - also fixed. \n\nAAL also has the worst management out of the top American Airlines. For a quick comparison, Delta (considered the best managed airline) in Q4 had a net income of 1,099 million with an operating revenue of $11,439 million- - a significantly better profit margin. \n\nSo, the financial statements make it clear that AAL has razor thin margins and completely relies on their gigantic volume of low margin flights (AAL is the largest airline in the world by passengers carried). \n\nNow, let's look their revenue outlook for 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n07yyh9ut2451.png?width=919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7c9ef2f84ad3b0edcf0e8d2f3b742b39d6cf912\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wpu0bzjvt2451.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=153258835c6a313d196a63328602fe6c09a01fd6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cmuz38uwt2451.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7c912c6f30e5e46642ade0965beb324a0e97393\n\nThe graphs speak for themselves-the industry has been absolutely decimated, and the little amount of recent demand has been sparked by extremely low prices. American Airlines also relies heavily on international travel + business travel, unlike more leisure focused airlines like JetBlue and Southwest. This makes them even more screwed. \n\nNow, lets look at the balance sheet- taken from Q1 2020\n\nTotal assets: 58,580 million \n\nCurrent Liabilities: 19,213 million  \n\nNon Current Liabilities: 42,003 million \n\nShareholder equity: -2,636 million \n\nThis horrible, horrible financial health is why American\u2019s debt is rated well under junk bond status. Because of the very real bankruptcy risk, they are having trouble raising money even in today\u2019s easy money environment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/de5vd6fyt2451.png?width=790&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8e5d6a3e92ab785de08fa1c2f9b12473ef5dd79\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mz3uyzszt2451.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b6dc4195fabf02cdec3a9d5d4ea6d5b133add91\n\nIn just 5 days, their stock has almost doubled. What sparked this rise? AAL management stated that they predict July 2020 to have 55% the demand as July 2019, and have modified their schedule as such.\n\nAs you can see from the forward booking graphs, this demand is simply non existent.35% of their float was also sold short, which means the run up was a classic short squeeze. On top of all of that, AAL is the perfect example of a prized retail investor stock\u2014 gigantic company that the average person would never predict to be financially fucked, and is willing to buy like crazy, not knowing a single thing about finance. \n\nAAL is the airline that is in by far the worst shape financially due to utter mismanagement, therefore I highly doubt they will be bailed out. Bankruptcy is a very, very real possibility.\n\nTLDR: The entire airline industry is fucked. AAL is even more fucked because of their insane amount of debt. \n\nPosition: Buy puts on AAL, expiration date Q4 (after CARES act support runs out)",

The volatility of the market bestowing random lotto wins upon a handful of risk takers, who then proceed to (justifiably) claim bragging rights along with their newfound cash isn't helping the issue.  People will, of course, daydream themselves into a similar scenario, and the likelihood of a large, UNeducated gamble increases with each \"missed\" opportunity perceived.  \n\nFor those of you who are in your university years or a little past, we're looking at most likely a baseline hourly wage of $12.50 (CA assumption).  This is what you'd be standing on your feet for 8 hours a day to earn, a daily intake of roughly $80 after taxes, all the while dealing with the dumb shit that presents itself in every entry level position.  \n\nDid your trade today result in a profit greater than $80?  Congratulations, you have no cause to be regretful.  Did your profit for the week average out to greater than $400?  Nice, you just made a week's salary without enduring the arduous process of punching in a time card every day.  Maybe you made double, triple that, quadruple, or even 10 times that in the span of a week or less.  You should be ecstatic; you just earned several months' paychecks in a fraction of the time and with a sliver of the work.  Maybe you have an actual job on top of this windfall; now you've doubled your financial stability (or more) and take that trip with the boys. \n\nMaybe the stock or contract climbs after you sell.

        "selftext": "Ok maybe far fetched but here is why I believe Nikola's surge is completely unjustifiable.\n\n - Zero revenues: The company has zero revenues and does not expect to see any through 2021.\n\n - Preorders: Anyone can preorder a vehicle through their website without placing a down payment. My theory here is that Milton is doing so to avoid a potential investigation by the SEC should the orders not be fulfilled (even though they explicitly state so in their filings). Otherwise, why wouldn't Milton require customers to place down payments? 250 bucks, 500? It doesnt make sense, something seems fishy.\n\n - Trevor Milton: This man has pocketed almost $8B (per wikipedia) within the past month without delivering any substance to support such a big payday. Just potential delivery numbers that no one knows will even be met. He posts one picture of a concept car and investors lose their shit. Nikola is now valued between the range of $22-$25 billion, essentially larger than American Airlines and Delta Airlines combined. I've compiled a list of established companies and their market caps to compare with Nikola:\n\nMarket Caps:\nNikola: $25B\nFord: $24B\nRealty Income: $20B\nDelta Airlines: $17B\nCarnival Cruise Line: $14B\nAmerican Airlines: $6B\n\nYou read that right, a company with no revenues, no production facility, and no operations, is larger than a Big 3 car manufacturer, one of the largest and growing real estate companies, 2 goddamn airliners, and a global carnival cruise line.\n\nWatching their videos on YouTube explains most of it though, they are very convincing in their marketing and personalities. Point blank, they look cool and revolutionary but they are missing everything else.\n\nThe stock is currently trading around $60/share,  and this... this my friends has taught me so much about market manipulation. \n\nIt's a great story to tell though and I have to give it to the Nikola team, they're essentially a shell company who are in the process of yeeting billions of dollars of investors money and all it took was a few pictures of a concept car and 2 prototypes.\n\nCongrats Mr. Milton.",

        "selftext": "# Previous Plays\n\n* [An SPY Guide (-$2538)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd2zbu/the_normie_playbook_wait_is_this_happening/?sort=new)\n* [End of May Calls (+$654)](https://www.reddit.com/user/kjtocool/comments/gnb25s/the_normie_playbook_end_of_may_call_for_600/)\n* [Play the Incoming Dip (+$752)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs5u38/the_normie_playbook_play_the_incoming_dip/)\n\n# Positions\n\nI don't have a defined position currently, I'll be looking to find the right timing to enter short today, maybe tomorrow, updating here.  Some notes:\n\n* You could play down to 296p, challenge is if we don't move with velocity, you'll be stuck in a position with less interest, that takes far more movement to push price, higher risk\n* I'll be playing higher, likely in the 303 to 306 range\n* I favor the 6/10 strike, as I expect all movement by Mon-Tues, and might be out by Friday.  6/12 is also an option, as is 6/8 for the high risk lotto plays.\n\n# Why\n\nI base this play on the oscillators and MACD indicators, among other TA.  Some notes:\n\n* ES 3h oscillator has pushed above 52 now for the 4th time\n* SPY 3h oscillator is also forming a 4th top, the first blew off 2.91 points, the second blew off 2.83, the third blew of 6.81, this fourth peak should exceed the third in both duration and depth\n* Playing the downside is harder, it will move quick when it does\n* Velocity can increase when we're this overbought, meaning we can pop upwards from here, 316 forms the upper range of current targets, and I expect a quick snap down of around 12 points.  I don't think we hit 316 before plunging, we could fail our 309 test and drop.  The higher we climb, the nastier the initial fall.\n* MACD has not crossed over, it's a reliable indicator, though lagging, so I try to guess ahead\n* 3h oscillator looks like it wants to flash sell, though hasn't yet.  At these levels, it's a reliable indicator, slightly less lagging than MACD, but also more prone to fakeouts\n* On ES, 1d oscillator is at highest level since Jan 24, 4h at highest since Apr 30th, 2h is oversold flashing sell, 1h flashed sell during AH and is about to have a MACD crossover\n\n[https://imgur.com/QMQYDAj](https://imgur.com/QMQYDAj)\n\n# So what to do\n\nFor now, don't do anything.  It's too early, literally and figuratively, to enter.  We've started a trend of rising overnight and selling into open.  We might do the same today.  The only way I consider entering at open is if we sell out under 3080, we're at 3091 now.  Rather I know I'm going to play this, and will be searching for an entry.  I expect to enter today, but that's not a guarantee.  \n\nIf you'd like to play along, or even just watch and laugh as my money does a vanishing act, you're welcome to.  This isn't a good day for me, numerous real life aspects pulling me away, but I will do my best.\n\nAs always, I'll be transparent about my positions, including date, contracts, average, and movement.  Will share TA I'm watching as well.  I expect an initial buy of around $1000-$2000, might double or triple position as averaging dictates.\n\n**Side note:** I don't believe this is a further leg down, this is a healthy reset to burn off steam on a strong upward climb.",

And we're going to ignore the rising China tensions. It seems like the only risk that bulls will acknowledge is if the virus surges again. So. How are we not looking at the very likely outcome of a surge in coronavirus cases from the nationwide protests? A completely unforeseen risk a couple weeks ago that could drastically change the dynamic of the curve.\n\nAlso, you can say civil unrest doesnt hurt the market but are these protests not showing that trumps time is about up? Ive seen the market rally on hopes of his reelection, but no reaction to him losing the faith of the nation? And I swear if I see another headline saying \"the market eyes reopening\" im going to lose my mind. We've priced in the market reopening like a million times at this point. It is not news.

        "selftext": "## What is UNFI Food?\n\nUnited Natural Foods (UNFI) is a food wholesaler. They are currently best known as the [supplier to WholeFoods](https://www.refrigeratedtransporter.com/foodservice/grocery/article/21712244/unfi-extends-distribution-agreement-with-whole-foods) and is one of the largest food distributors in America.\n\n## How the coronavirus plays in\n\nGrocery spending is higher, [up 27% from this same point last year](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/shoppers-shift-from-stockpiling-to-penny-pinching-at-the-grocery-store.html). Online groceries have skyrocketted as well, projected to [increase by 40%](https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/online-grocery-sales-grow-40-2020) in 2020. The growth in online grocery sales is obviously the result of COVID with 52% of consumers polled stating that 2020 was the first time they had purchased groceries online; note the massive spike in [APRN](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/APRN). Let's also not forget about lower fuel costs and higher food inflation, which increased [2.6% in one month, or 4.1% for 12 months so far](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm), for \"food at home\" category. This obviously benefits UNFI further. In addition to this, UNFI will benefit from the [CARES act](https://www.waste360.com/food-waste/keeping-food-table-pandemic) via increased deductibility of interest expenses, potential for tax loss carrybacks to prior years (at a higher, 35% tax rate) and faster depreciation of improvements. The exact amount is hard to estimate, but it will be just icing on the cake. The cake is described below.\n\n## Earnings\n\nEarnings is [June 10th](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/unfi). What's interesting is that this company were so excited to release their earnings, they put out a [preliminary report](https://ir.unfi.com/news/press-release-details/2020/United-Natural-Foods-Announces-Preliminary-Third-Quarter-Results-and-Provides-COVID-19-Business-Update/default.aspx) and they absolutely hit it right outta the park. Adjusted earnings per share was up 130% from 61 cents during the same time last year. Revenue for the quarter comes in 12% higher than the $5.96 billion reported in the fiscal third quarter of 2019. They also reported a net income of 88 million a 57% increase from the same period last year. **The company pulled their 2020 guidance since they said they already hit it and they\u2019ll update it when earnings come out.** These guys did their ENTIRE year of projected earnings in ONE QUARTER. They used this to pay off massive amounts of debt and even sold off some stuff that they can use to pay debt down further. As a result of this preliminary report, the stock price popped to $22ish and has now dropped a little since. When the updated earnings report comes in, I expect the stock to really pop. But since it won't be for another 13 days, we can play off the earnings run-up as well as more investors buy in with anticipation. A lot of people are going to say the news is already priced in due to the preliminary being released, but it really isn't. Updated guidance for 2020 should be announced at earnings and this will be the catalyst for movement. Last reported short percentage is 18% of float, so this could put a hurt on the shorts when guidance comes out. \n\n## Previous Highs\n\nThe [stock traded at high 40s](https://i.imgur.com/aH4Spts.png) back in 2018 and has been getting shit on since down in the teens. But right now, everything about this stock shows it\u2019s going to continue upward and the full earnings report will be the catalyst. In 2018, the company [bought SuperValu](https://ir.unfi.com/unfi-acquires-supervalu/default.aspx) to expand into conventional grocery, increase scale, realize synergies and, likely, diversify away from reliance on Whole Foods. A large part of this massive drop from high 40s was due to investors thinking this decision was trash. For a while it seemed that SuperValu acquisition was an expensive mistake as there were delays, extra expenses and customer service issues. Well jokes on them because it ended up working out and now it\u2019s paying off in spades. This acquisition gave the company a leg-up from other competitors who are struggling from coivd19-related supply chain issues, as UNFI can easily reach all of their retail partners quickly with 58 locations.\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nSkip this part if you're not super into the technical details. While the expected GAAP ([generally accepted accounting principles](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/GAAP-generally-accepted-accounting-principles) earnings per share and net income are already impressive, it is actual free cash flow that matters most. It is especially true for UNFI, since they need to reduce debt and move from around 5x leverage to the target they have of under 3x. The free cash flow, or FCF, is significantly greater than net income for the following reasons.\n\nThe company made a 338g tax election, which allows it to depreciate acquired SUPERVALU assets accounting them at a high tax base, resulting in high depreciation non-cash charges, much greater than ongoing CapEx. Depreciation appears to be running $30 million less than CapEx per quarter, or $120 million annualized.\n\nAt $30 million per quarter or $120 million  a year, the difference between D&amp;A and CapEx contributes another $2.24 per share in free cash flow. The end result is $426 million in annual adjusted FCF or $7.96 per share. Assuming the cash flow goes to debt reduction, the annual interest expense gets reduced by $25 million a year, improving net profit by $20 million and increasing EPS by $0.37.

If I change my mind, I'll be putting edits at the bottom of this post like I did with my previous DD's. This stock was given a price target of [$22, raised from $10](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+PT+Change/United+Natural+Foods+%28UNFI%29+PT+Raised+to+%2422+at+BMO+Capital/16889479.html) by BMO Capital analyst Kelly Bania about 2 weeks ago, but I think it'll go higher. There are some analysts that claim it can go back to last year's valuation of $40 per share long term, so holding shares of this stock wouldn't hurt either.\n\nAlso shoutout to /u/theodros1 who posted DD on this a week ago but only got like 16 upvotes. \n\ntl;dr I'm buying $22.5c 6/19",

        "selftext": "BLS released its unemployment numbers last week, showing a decline in unemployment month over month to 13.3%. The number of unemployed is 21 million. Absent from this statistic is the number of \"employed\" individuals who are still on payroll through PPP, but are not actually working or who would be laid off in the absence of PPP. So PPP is masking the extent to which labor is being underutilized and the extent to which demand shortages exist.\n\nFor those not familiar with the [Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program), this program provides loans to small businesses so that they can continue to pay workers and certain business expenses. If at least 75% of the proceeds of the loan are used for payroll, the loan will be forgiven. Otherwise, the loan must be paid back in full with 1% interest in two years.\n\nThe first round of PPP was launched April 3 at the heigh of the lockdowns. The budgeted $310 billion, intended to last for months, was doled out in less than two weeks. A second round of PPP was approved on April 27. As of May 30, A total of [4.48 million loans had been approved for a total of $510 billion.](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/PPP_Report_200530-508.pdf) Assuming one loan per business, this means that 8.96 million businesses took out PPP loans with an average loan size of $113,800. In 2018, there were an estimated [30.2 million small businesses with 58.9 million employees](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/2018-Small-Business-Profiles-US.pdf), implying 1.95 employees per small business. So 8.96mil\\*1.95 = 17.5 mil employees being covered by PPP.\n\nThe [average amount spent by employers per hour to keep an employee on payroll](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ecec.pdf) in December 2019 was $34.72. [Average weekly hours worked](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/AWHAETP) by an employed individual in the same month was 34.3. So per week, the cost of keeping the average employee on payroll is $1,191.\n\nLet's assume that all borrowers are using 75% of the loan for payroll to meet the loan forgiveness requirements.\n\nWith an average loan size of $113,800 per business (75% of which is for payroll) payroll of $1,191 per employee-week and 1.95 employees per business, PPP should cover payroll for the average business for 37 weeks. So roughly 29 weeks until PPP starts to run out for the first wave of borrowers.\n\nAssuming PPP loans were only taken out by businesses who actually needed them to afford to keep their employees on the payroll, there are 17.5 million \"employed\" who are either not working and continuing to collect a paycheck (effectively unemployed, but receiving the equivalent of unemployment benefits from their employer) or who may no longer be employed once PPP runs out if macro conditions do not improve. In the absolute worse case scenario that none of these jobs came back and the unemployed in May remained unemployed, unemployment would be (21 mil + 17.5 mil)/158 mil = 24.4%.\n\n24.4% is certainly too high; some of these jobs will be coming back once PPP expires. But 13.3% is too low; some of those on PPP are \"employed\", but not working (the BLS concedes that [accounting for this number increases their May unemployment estimate by about 3%](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm)) and many of those who are working are working in jobs that continue to exist only through government intervention. I have seen many anecdotes on Reddit about employees who expect to be laid off once PPP runs out.\n\nTLDR: I don't think the BLS is manipulating their unemployment rate, but it greatly understates the lack of demand for labor and just how much trouble the economy is in.",

That said, I believe are now going past this cash injection into bubble territory. driven by retail investors.\n\nIf you are long term DCA'ing and holding quality stocks then you can ignore this post. keep up the disciplined approach.\n\nHowever, if you are piling into cheap stock for the sake of them being below their ATH's you might want to show some caution. I think sooner or later you will get badly burnt.\n\nRetail investors are now in a euphoric state. The sentiment is the fed has their back, the markets can only go up. Nothing can go wrong. There is no risk. Rip up the rule book\n\nA classic example is [60,000 Robin hood account recently buying stock in Hertz after it filed for bankruptcy, just because it is cheap](https://www.thestreet.com/etffocus/market-intelligence/robinhood-investors-pile-into-hertz-as-stock-approaches-0), to me this is a big red flag.\n\n[Here are](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stocks-robinhood-most-popular-owned-widely-users-may-market-buy-2020-6-1029269968#1-ford10)[ Robin hoods top 10 holdings](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stocks-robinhood-most-popular-owned-widely-users-may-market-buy-2020-6-1029269968#1-ford10)[.

        "selftext": "Now that the S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ are in the green for the year, a lot of opportunities are no longer there (or as obvious). For those who have some cash lying around, what are the stocks you think are still undervalued? \n\n\nHere\u2019s a few I\u2019m looking at:\n\n\n**$WFC** - 30% down from Feb 2020 prices. This is a stock which has had a long spell of scandals and issues, and has been beaten down due to the coronavirus crisis. It\u2019s now under new management which is hoping to turn around its scandalous past, and other banks stocks (such as $JPM) have started a significant recovery now that calamitous debt delinquencies seem less likely. This offers 42% gains if it gets back to it\u2019s pretty-COVID pricing. \n\n\n**$BA** - Even with a massive run-up, $BA is still undervalued. It\u2019s defense business is strong, and the 737-MAX will likely be recertified (and subsequently rebranded) in the fall. Boeing is no longer in danger of bankruptcy given a huge new debt offering. I\u2019m not sure when it\u2019ll fully recover, but it also has streamlined management to bring it back from complacency. \n\n\n**$RCL, $CCL, $NCLH** - Huge run-up recently but these companies will eventually return to near their former highs, probably huge gains to be had. \n\n\nWhat others are you looking at?",

        "selftext": "**Asset valuations**\n\nThere is a growing school of thought that the Fed and other central banks are driving an asset bubble when the evidence is wanting. In fact, I\u2019d go further than that and suggest that the Fed can stimulate away and should tolerate richer asset valuations yet.\n\n* First, on stocks, traditional relative measures that were recapped in yesterday\u2019s note showcase how stocks are not cheap but there is nothing particularly out-of-sample going on here. Yet investors are buying on a price relative to forward earnings basis over multiple quarters ahead in anticipation of a rebound. They\u2019re not buying stocks to get a claim on earnings this quarter (or lack thereof\u2026) or last quarter or even this full year\u2019s earnings that will be depressed by the first half experience. In fact, for the S&amp;P500, price compared to 2021 earnings expectations sits at about 20 times (chart 1). If the earnings rebound turns out to be anything close to analysts\u2019 expectations, then maybe\u2026.gasp\u2026stocks are cheap and nobody wants to say as much.\n\n* If so, then daily gyrations aside, stocks could have considerably more room to run. This runs counter to the common narrative that the Fed\u2019s stimulus is driving ridiculous stock valuations rather than viewing such valuations as based upon post-COVID-19 earnings expectations in a recovery (I\u2019ll come back to recovery evidence in a moment).\n\n* Second, given that the Fed looks at broad asset markets, we also need to do so. When I look at commodity valuations, we\u2019ve got a long way to go yet before we get to over valuation. Talked to the oil patch lately? Enough said.\n\n* Housing also doesn\u2019t seem over-valued. One gauge is homebuyer affordability that before the COVID-19 shock was only slightly more affordable than the two decade average. Another is repeat sales home price indices that were climbing by 4.4% y/y before the shock and well below the recent peak rate of growth in early 2018.\n\n* And then of course we have the Fed\u2019s preferred core PCE gauge of inflation that is likely to decelerate sharply over the faces downside risk over the duration of the year. Not only is evidence of asset inflation often overstated, it principally matters when it shows up in broad price signals and that\u2019s not likely to happen for some time.\n\n**Rebound expectations**\n\n* Equity analysts\u2019 earnings expectations are based upon underlying expectations for an economic rebound. In my opinion, there are already signs that the global economy is recovering and quite possibly going V-shaped which should inform a cautiously optimistic bias at the Fed. Heck, that\u2019s not even entirely a forecast as there is evidence that conditions are already headed there such that by the time GDP growth returns to the black in Q3 we\u2019ll already be well into recovery mode.\n\n* Look at the evidence. German restaurant bookings are soaring (chart 2). Chinese air travel has already recovered to well above where it was at the start of the year (chart 3). Global air travel is gradually recovering (chart 4). North American retail foot traffic is starting to recover, albeit out of a deep pit (chart 5). US homebuyer foot traffic is slowly inching higher (chart 6) and mortgage purchase applications have not only recovered the COVID-19 shock but are at levels seen well before the US economy shut down in mid-March (chart 7).\n\n* Is all of this durable? Some will argue this time is different and that we\u2019ll never return to the same activities. I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. As for second-wave COVID-19 risk, yes it\u2019s real, especially as reopening efforts gain speed and social inhibitions toward large gatherings so obviously decline. But will that stop the economy again? Probably not. One reason is that governments can\u2019t afford to do that all over again; to take on balance sheet the shut down economy again could risk deficits rapidly soaking up excess world saving and impairing the ability of companies and households to roll over debt from the last cycle. Governments across the world were running procylical fiscal policy with varying shades of abandon before the shock and this limited their flexibility to address this one.\n\nIs all of this durable? Some will argue this time is different and that we\u2019ll never return to the same activities. I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. As sophisticated as humans like to think we are as a species, we are not. We never change, or maybe we just adapt and move on by doing things differently, spending money in different ways or on different things with varying time periods toward a full recovery. History offers abundant evidence. I\u2019ve been doing this gig in one form or another for about a quarter century which is just barely enough time in the grand sweep of history\u2019s humbling lessons to have learned that every time a shock arises, we\u2019re told we\u2019ll never be the same again and things will never return to some sense of normalcy. We do. Every time that view turns out to be dead wrong. One of my favourite examples was when demographics best sellers told us during the early 1990s recession that an aging population meant fundamentally changed behaviour and we\u2019d never have another housing boom after the 1980s.

        "selftext": "*\"In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but, in the long run, it is a weighing machine\" -Benjamin Graham*\n\nWarren Buffett has taken some heat recently over his decision to sell all of his airline stocks near their lowest point. Amid investor optimism for the return of \"normal\" travel behavior, airline stock prices took flight, so to speak, as a primary beneficiary of this exuberance. This has every investor with a Pied Piper trading account sitting on his couch thinking he is smarter than perhaps the greatest investor of our time. But is he?\n\n* Warren Buffett is not a short-term swing trader, he is a long-term, buy-and-hold investor. He looks at the prospects of a company 20 to 30 years down the road, not 2-3 months\n* Airlines represented a significant, but relatively small portion of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Taking a loss on an industry that is in turmoil for the chance to redeploy in another industry with clearer skies ahead is more in line with the investing philosophy that made him a success\n* Armchair investors think to themselves, \"Well, people won't stop flying\", I'll buy AAL, UAL, and DAL. While that is certainly true in the broad sense, think about the practical sense. Airlines need to squeeze every dollar out of every flight to remain profitable. Under the \"new normal\", not only might the incredibly important Middle Seat be in jeopardy, but the ridiculously profitable Business Class seat is also going to see massive declines as more and more business is conducted remotely.\n* With cash burn rates in the double-digit millions of dollars PER DAY, many major U.S. airlines are only in business due to federal government bailout money -- one of the conditions of which was that they keep paying their employees that are not doing much flying (or revenue generation) these days.\n* While it is a near certainty that \"people won't stop flying\", there is no certainty about who will be doing the flying. When the bailout money is gone, the cash is depleted, and the revenues are a fraction of where they need to be, a company goes bankrupt. It is entirely possible that one or even two of the major U.S. airline carriers never get their head above water again. Which ones? (\\*Casually glances at American and United\\*) I'm not sure, BUT, what I am sure about, is that Warren Buffett has access to way more information about the companies he invests in than you or me.\n* Last Thursday, while AAL stock was almost doubling, 14 of its top officers VOLUNTARILY took buyouts to leave the company. Now, ask yourself -- why would anyone in their right mind in a leadership role at a prominent U.S. company with a huge salary and comfy corner office voluntarily leave that company and deny themselves the personal glory of being part of a turnaround story?\n\n**My advice:** Take your profits now and buy yourself something nice -- like stock in a company that actually has massive future growth and profit potential. And do not think that you are smarter than Warren Buffett.\n\nFinally, they are a few years old, but these nifty infographics offer a fun insight into what makes the Oracle of Omaha tick:\n\n[Part One: The Early Years](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/warren-buffett-series-early-years/)\n\n[Part Two: Inside Buffett's Brain](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/inside-warren-buffetts-brain/)\n\n[Part Three: The Warren Buffett Empire](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/warren-buffett-empire-giant-chart/)\n\n[Part Four: Buffett's Biggest Wins and Fails](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/warren-buffetts-biggest-wins-and-fails/)\n\n[Part Five: Wisdom from The Oracle](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-25-best-warren-buffett-quotes-in-one-infographic/)",

        "selftext": "Things just got very seriously bad for Uber and Lyft ....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-regulator-uber-lyft-drivers-employees-044824014.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-regulator-uber-lyft-drivers-employees-044824014.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUber and Lyft drivers are classified as employees, the California Public Utilities Commission has officially ruled. The regulator, which oversees ride-hailing companies, [declared](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/California-regulators-say-Uber-Lyft-drivers-are-15330779.php) its decision in an [order](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M339/K545/339545137.PDF) published on Tuesday. It said \u201ca person providing labor or services for remuneration shall be considered an employee rather than an independent contractor\u201d under AB5, the state\u2019s new law covering gig work, which became effective on January 1st, 2020.\n\nIn its order, the Commission mentioned that Uber [filed a lawsuit](https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-30-uber-and-postmates-sue-california-over-ab5-gig-worker-law.html) in federal court to prevent its drivers from being classified as employees under AB5. It also noted that Uber and Lyft successfully \u201cplaced on the November 2020 ballot a [measure](https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-30-uber-lyft-60-million-ballot.html) that would exclude all app-based drivers from AB5.\u201d The lawsuit and ballot don\u2019t affect the Commission\u2019s authority over ride-hailing services, though, so their drivers are \u201cpresumed to be employees.\u201d That means the regulator must ensure that ride-hailing services \u201ccomply with those requirements that are applicable to the employees of an entity subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nJust last week, the regulator also warned the companies that they have to provide workers\u2019 compensation for their employees by July 1st. If they don\u2019t comply, it could revoke their operating authority under state law. As [*NBC News*](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/uber-lyft-drivers-are-employees-california-regulatory-agency-finds-n1229616) notes, it\u2019s unclear if this ruling can compel Uber and Lyft to formally reclassify their drivers. In a statement sent to the organization, Uber spokesperson Davis White said it \u201cremains committed to expanded benefits and protections to drivers.\u201d However, he also said that:\n\n&gt;*\u201cIf California regulators force rideshare companies to change their business model it would affect our ability to provide reliable and affordable services, along with threatening access to this essential work Californians depend on.\u201d*  \n\n\nAs for Lyft, a spokesperson simply told *NBC News* that the commission\u2019s \u201cpresumption is flawed.\u201d",
