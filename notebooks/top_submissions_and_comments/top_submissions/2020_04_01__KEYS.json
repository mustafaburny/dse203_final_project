        "selftext": "Ive been think about this a lot lately. Of course they would say they will purchase until the cows come home, but can they really? \n\nI think they are constrained by 1 of their dual mandates, inflation.  I believe this won't be changed because the powers that be, the elite Americans who hold the keys, would have their fortunes eroded should high inflation kick in.  At this point, the Fed would limit its buying paper bonds and limit funding.\n\n1) since the deflationary pressures are currently very strong, this risk is low at the moment.\n\n2) the Fed is heavily distorting the price of bonds. Especially private sector bonds.  Risk of default has increased dramatically, so naturally any lender would need a higher return to offset this risk....but instead, rates are dropping un naturally due to the FED intervention. As the spread of real versus artificial cost of this paper widens, many many companies will not be selling to any rational private person, so the FED will need to buy, rocketing up their balance sheet.\n\nWhat happens when a lot of these companies go bankrupt? If it is real estate backed then over time this land can be auctioned back off to the public.\n\nBut what about companies whose equipment rusts and deteriorates, companies whose vaule is more intrinsic, etc....when companies whose value is not in land or gold, something that can't last 50 years....what then? \n\nDoes the dollar get destroyed? How? Interest rates skyrocket?\n\nAnswer:  i think interest rates will skyrocket after inflation picks up and the Fed stops buying commercial paper and as much government bonds.  I think what will happen is the Fed will continue this program, but unlike 2008-09, as real demand has crumbled from underneath the feet, the cash injected will start to bid up the shrinking circle of areas that cash can be used to buy for investment. \n\n Inflation begins.  If this happens the Fed has to cut back their purchasing and interest rates will sling shot up to the real world.  \n\n\n\nSo how long can this go on for? And what is the long term (maybe short) cost of what the Fed is doing going to be?",

Stimulus bill is being passed to soften the blow to...\u201d \n\nThe nightly news illuminates a dimly lit studio apartment. Richard Glover, a closeted furry enthusiast stares on, fixated upon his 9 inch tube television. \u201cThe end of the world as we know it. How can nobody see it but me?\u201d He opens Robinhood on his refurbished Nokia knockoff. SPY puts: -87%. \u201cSoon.\u201d, he mutters. \u201cJ Pow can\u2019t keep his magic money machine running forever.\u201d 2 weeks have pasted since the locked down was instated and Dick was getting restless.

His phone viberated, \u201cMeet me behind the Arby\u2019s for a good time.\u201d He was torn. He had sunk every penny of his life savings into believing the total collapse of the global economy was imminent. He had sold his grandmothers cane, and emptied his anime trap waifu body pillow fund into his SPY put monthlies. The virus was here and was about to fuck us, but Dick craved a different type of fornication. His phone vibrated again, \u201cI\u2019ll let you be on the bottom ;).\u201d He pondered for a second, \u201cMaybe just this one time.\u201d He grabbed the keys to his 1993 Honda Civic and headed for the door.\n\n2 WEEKS LATER\n\nThe walls had a sickly egg shell white color. A shade befitting of the clientele. A robotic heart beat added to the oppressive ambiance of the room. Richard had many mistakes, but few that he had the wherewithal to regret. He knew he\u2019d beat this plague; the doctor was to come around any minute and give him the good news. Despite his shortness of breath, watching the market put the wind back in his sails. The market had been taking a hit recently, and his SPY 230p 4/17 was almost ITM. He fantasized about all the sweet, sweet tendies. The yachts. The mansions. Models, blow, and fast cars. He was only up $23 on his puts, but he knew it was coming. SPY 232. Time 3:45pm. A drill was coming EOD this time. He was sure of it.\n\nA doctor entered his room in full hazmat attire. Doctor Chad Bullard. Even through all the coverings, Richard could tell the docs\u2019 furrowed brow was not a good sign. \u201cMr. Glover, I have some unfortunate news to share with you about your medical situation.\u201d Shock had gripped Dick. \u201cOutlook dire.\u201d Chad continued to drone on, but Richards thoughts raced. At least he would sell his puts, and for once in his life, he\u2019d see his portfolio in the green. He glanced down at his laptop. SPY 270. Time 4:05pm. Portfolio -97%. The incessant robotic beeping came to an abrupt halt.

        "selftext": "# Plutus.it - The First NeoDeFiBank\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nPlutus.it - The First NeoDeFiBank\n\nWhy I\u2019m bullish on this idea, on this project, on this team:\n\nPlutus is a crypto-friendly finance app available 24/7 on desktop/laptop and mobile that allows users to manage both fiat and crypto from the same user interface without handling the users\u2019 crypto-assets (\u2018\u2019Not your keys, not your coins\u2019\u2019).\n\nPlutus currently offers a minimum viable product (MVP) with a bank account, a VISA debit card and a P2P (Peer-to-peer) exchange (DEX) with 0% fees for Premium/Pro users. Every time a Premium/Pro user spends from the card, they earn up to 3% in rewards (crypto back) in Pluton (PLU - The first decentralized loyalty token). If you use the card to spend just \u00a3/\u20ac170 per month, you can pay your monthly fee only with the crypto back.\n\nOn the top of this crypto back and just by staking some PLU, the Premium/Pro users can at the same time win cash back from companies like Amazon; Nike; Airbnb; Radisson and many others. The more PLU you stake (1 to 5000), the more cash back you receive.\n\nPlutus made a \u2019\u2019flash\u2019\u2019 ICO in 2016 and sold 850.000 PLU for 1 million dollars (ICO price of 1 PLU = 0.00177136 BTC / 0.09472537 ETH) and the remaining 19,150,000 PLU were locked in a Ethereum smart contract for the crypto back rewards.\n\nThe project took a long time to come to life but the team is now very focused. They launched before and they had to do it all again because of the Wavecrest fiasco but, the crypto rewards were launched in Q1 2020 and the Perks with cash back will follow in Q2. Besides PLU, only ETH is accepted at this time but you can expect BTC for Q2 as well.\n\nPlutus operates in the EU, the United Kingdom, and will expand in the future to other countries.\n\nBesides to be a product for everybody over 18 years old, there is three main niche markets for Plutus: 1- Crypto users for the convenience and security; 2- People that are curious about crypto; 3- People that travel; People that like to go to entertainment outings; High spenders; Executives and VIPs. With this product Plutus is giving back to the crypto ecosystem, helping crypto users and being a \u2018\u2019school\u2019\u2019 that introduces Crypto to the daily lives of people!\n\nAbout PLU value: It\u2019s specially related to the growth of Plutus user base. The goal is to have 100.000 customers by the end of 2020, that for such a product is a low estimate. Let's do some math using only the 100.000 users targeted for this year: You get up to 3% crypto back for any purchase you make with your card, but to receive cash back you need to stake 1 or 100 / 500 / 2000 / 5000 PLU and the most you stake, the more cash back you receive. If from 100.000 people only, 20 % will want to have just the first level of 100 PLU, we already have 2 million PLU staked. So far, there is only 850.000 PLU in circulation and can take more than a century for all the Pluton to be rewarded. Imagine how much the price of PLU can grow with 500.000 users or 1 million and beyond\u2026\n\nWith only a total supply of 20 million (less than the BTC 21 million), with crypto back up to 3% counted according with the value of BTC and decreasing to 1% \\* due to a growing user base, PLU will become more and more valuable - 1 PLU has a first target of more than 1% of the value of 1 BTC !!!\n\nWith time and more and more customers, with the Perks and cash back, with PLU in more and more exchanges for the fairest price and with the Marketing campaign on, used as a collateral and other different DeFi applications - The Moon or maybe Pluto :) is the limit. Very promising!\n\nBesides all this, PLU is a good hedge for crypto in general (including BTC) because the lower BTC price is, less PLU are emitted and more value they have.\n\nLook at the goals of the project in a way that you will be able to see the possibilities - Imagine when they will have a bank license!\n\nFinishing with some words of the CEO of Plutus:\n\n\u2018\u2019Now that we have achieved a working product, a core focus for the team is to further enhance the token utility and use cases for Pluton. It was not designed with the intention of bringing financial gains, however, it was formulated with a deflationary model, meaning as our user base and transaction volume increases on the PlutusDEX, the amount emitted through the reward pool to customers is proportionately reduced.\n\nTo simplify even further, more users results in a lower supply rate, keeping the circulating amount scarce and the demand high. The purpose of this design is to bring value to our members who earn PLU via the rewards system and convert them into fiat for in-store or online purchases.\u2019\u2019\n\nKudos to the Team and Community!\n\n\\* The reward system resets everyday and has a scale equal to the fiat equivalent of 30 to 150 BTC as per the daily volume of the DEX (BTC/ETH/PLU to \u00a3/\u20ac), with a transaction (card spending) in the first 20% volume (30 BTC) getting a 3% reward and with each 0.1 increase in volume resulting in a 0.0165 % decrease in rewards till 150 BTC where further rewards are set at 1%.\n\nLegal disclaimer:This is simply a general overview and my opinion about Plutus.it.
