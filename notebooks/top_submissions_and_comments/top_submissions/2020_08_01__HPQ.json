        "selftext": "People ask, why should my \"checking account\" just be FAANMG, $TQQQ (fun to own 100 shares to wheel) and $SPY and forget about \"actively managed funds?\"  \n\nThis is the year of the active investor ETF and I have no time to rebalance all these positions PLUS my FANG (not included at all in all but one has GOOG in these ETFs.)   I suggest buying $TSLA and realize it is down to 5% in the $ARKK (these numbers below change because active management!  And that is why they are better than the $QQQ vs. $SPY or $VOO vs. $VOOG!\n\nARKK Top 10 Holdings Tesla Inc 8.75% Invitae Corp. 6.97% Square, Inc. Class A 6.75% CRISPR Therapeutics AG5.88% Roku, Inc. Class A4.99% Proto Labs, Inc. 3.87% 2U, Inc. 3.76% Illumina, Inc. 3.55%\n\nARKQ Top 10 Holdings Tesla Inc 9.83% 2U, Inc. Xilinx, Inc. Materialise NV Sponsored ADR 5.40% Stratasys Ltd. Proto Labs, Inc. Alphabet Inc. Class C 3.77% Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, Inc.\n\n**ARKW Top** **10** **Holdings** Tesla Inc 8.92% Square, Inc. Class A 7.47% Roku, Inc. Class A 6.11% 2U, Inc. Zillow Group, Inc. Class C 3.14 Xilinx, Inc. LendingTree, Inc. Facebook, Inc. Class A 3.01%\n\nAgain, ARK has sold $TSLA to rebalance their actively managed fund because it is not just indexed equal weight ($QQQE and $QQEW equal weighted) vs large weighted heavy on FANG ($QQQ.)    \n\nARK is to be held in ADDITION to FAANMG.  \\[FB, Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix, Google\\] or just holding the $XLK (think $APPL about the same dividend) and $XLC (Netflix and Google exposure.)\n\nARKF Top 10 Holdings Square, Inc. Class A 12.72% MercadoLibre, Inc. Zillow Group, Inc. Class C 5.16% Apple Inc. Tencent Holdings Ltd. Unsponsored ADR 4.18% LendingTree, Inc. Pinterest, Inc.

MGI Digital Graphic Technology 5.02% Straumann **Holding** AG 5.00% HP Inc. Stratasys Ltd. Materialise NV Sponsored ADR 4.58%\n\n**ARKG Top 10 Holdings Invitae Corp**. CRISPR Therapeutics AG 11.25% Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. Illumina, Inc. Compugen Ltd. Twist Bioscience Corp. Iovance Biotherapeutics Inc 3.57% CareDx, Inc.\n\nNOTE:  $ARKG shares NOTHING but Illumina with the $IBB, and the $XBI has no Moderna, so buy all three!  Also, I would be buying shares of $DHR at $200, $TMO at $400, and Regeneron at $595 as they seem to not be loved by these ETFs.\n\n**IBB Top** **10** **Holdings** Gilead Sciences, Inc. 6.92% Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 6.51% Illumina, Inc. 6.10% Biogen Inc. 3.54% Moderna, Inc. 3.05% Seattle Genetics, Inc. 2.98% Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2.44% BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. 2.30%\n\n**XBI Top** **10** **Holdings** Novavax, Inc. 3.63% OPKO Health, Inc. 2.20% Emergent BioSolutions Inc. 1.84% Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. 1.77% Invitae Corp. 1.71% Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1.51% Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. 1.37% SAGE Therapeutics, Inc. 1.36%\n\nI prefer to have 100 shares of $ARKG and I cannot tell if the $IBB is breaking out or breaking down.\n\nSolar:  the myth is that $ARKK has solar in it.  I suggest both $ICLN at $12.50 and $TAN at $45.\n\nICLN Top 10 Holdings Sunrun Inc. 6.90% SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. 6.80% Plug Power Inc. 6.04% Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd. 5.98% Enphase Energy, Inc. 5.96% First Solar, Inc. 5.05% Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A.4.76% Vestas Wind Systems A/S4.51% Search Results\n\nTAN Top 10 Holdings SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. Sunrun Inc. First Solar, Inc. Enphase Energy, Inc. Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd. Vivint Solar Inc 5.48% Daqo New Energy Corp. Sponsored ADR 5.02% Solaria Energia y Medio Ambiente, S.A. 4.22%\n\nTL;DR ONLY $TAN and $ICLN overlap because both are SOLAR. ARK are the best actively managed funds ever. You are getting zero exposure to the companies I listed if you do not add Solar. Also note $ARKK sold $TSLA so buy the stonk when it dips down to $1350 again. Please buy $PRNT and $ARKG as well, put them in a drawer, and hold them for 3-5 years.",
