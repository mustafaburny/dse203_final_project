        "selftext": "Alright boys. This is going to be my final gains post. I cracked the 7-figure mark, and then some. I started with $35k in my ROTH IRA in late February/early March. I took out $50k, so current balance is after this amount.\n\nTotal balance:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aza8wfympn951.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bf62f41c7548042e7155fc7988cb55b63e74f69\n\nYTD graph, it's been an insane wild ride.

There was a total of about 350 trades I made.\n\nHere are all my winning trades:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fu0a7hn4qn951.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a2fcc6bb5b52e10ba50301aa0374feb8d0fe863\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzsx6d2aqn951.png?width=1165&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06a5639feb386ebd2ca83bfaed92b6b70d197803\n\nAnd here are all my losers:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/50o2gaufqn951.png?width=1159&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d08b45c387251b1ad9d89fb13ba9ed733cb98503\n\nPaid over $14k in commissions to Fidelity:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6jsl4utqqn951.png?width=472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1238eed7f211baf66e79fbb8a3a9d8c8f1ec6d38\n\nI will update this post if anything else comes to my mind. But to put it succinctly. There is a process I follow. I outlined pretty much everything I do in the series of edits and comments I made in my original gains post here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h83cfp/35k\\_590k\\_in\\_3\\_months/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h83cfp/35k_590k_in_3_months/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\nIf you have any questions in addition though, ask away, I will try to get to everybody. And yes, it fucking feels amazing.\n\nAlso, gaymods... can I please get a flair change to \"$35k to $1.25M\"?\n\nI'm copying and pasting the tips I had in my other post into this since many of you retarded fucks can't even seem to click a link. The following are the general rules I follow in my trades. They have served me well. Luck has a lot to do with it. Probably 60% or more, but learning to click the damn sell and buy button when you don't feel like it (due to greed or fear) is the second biggest component.\n\nEDIT:\n\nLet me try to answer some of the common questions.\n\nI started with $35k in my ROTH. That was money I saved up from previous job.\n\nHold 50% cash reserve at all times as a minimum. YOLOs on FDs are not how you build wealth using options.\n\nGo into OTM positions but only about 10-15%, and a reasonable chance that you personal feel the company can get to the strike before expiration\n\nLearn the greeks. Check current IV levels of the company. Try not to get into trades where the IV is at the top tippy top of a 12 month period.\n\nLearn to not beat yourself up over your trades/mistakes/woulda-shoulda-coulda's. &lt;- This right here was the biggest lesson I learned. Staying focused and not killing myself over my huge mistakes. That sense of dread and horror after seeing your account run up to $550k and then plummeting below $100k in a matter of a week or so, I know is horrific, but learn to focus on what you still have left and climb back up.\n\nLET YOUR WINNERS RIDE. If you are cashing out on a hugely green position, consider taking out only a chunk or better yet, put a trailing stop loss around 20%. I put t-stops once a position goes green about 50%. I don't put trailing stops on currently red positions. I exit my losers by hand usually. I think psychologically I prefer to kill the red deals myself because I'd feel even more horrific and blame the system of the broker if I had a losing position exit out on a trailing stop.\n\nDo not put more than 25% of your account into a single position. We celebrate YOLOs and retardism around here yes, but that doesn't mean you need follow the ultra-retards.\n\nDon't hold 20 different positions. I see so many people holding fucking LUV/AAL/UAL/DAL positions at the same fucking time. No, just pick one and focus on it. Doesn't fucking matter which one, currently besides maybe LUV, the airlines move in lockstep.\n\nLEARN TO CUT YOUR LOSSES. Even at -90%. That 10% through the magic of options trading can easily be used to make the 90% again. Try to climb back out of a hole with 0% left though.\n\nI'll edit more in if I think of anything else, but overall, try to stay disciplined. Learning to control (I admit still very ineffectively but enough to usually put a rein on a runaway destructive thought process) my emotions was key. Losses don't kill options traders, calculating your alternate universe net worth on your woulda-coulda-shouldas do.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI will say this. My undergraduate degree was in Economics, and I'm finishing up my MBA in Finance right now.\n\nMy education I think did give me a great deal of edge, over the average person just plunging into options. That doesn't mean you can't educate yourself. First and foremost go fucking watch some videos on options and their greeks. Implications of volatility on price as well is a basic knowledge you should have.\n\nEDIT 3:\n\nI usually buy contracts 1-2 months out. My plan is to sell around the half way point. Leaving a lot of theta meat on the bone so that they are still more valuable.\n\n10-15% OTM. I never buy ITM. That 10-15% level has worked for me. I go for a strike price that I personally feel the stock can hit within the expiration. Almost all my winning trades have been ITM by the time I sold I believe.\n\nEDIT 4:\n\nIf you look at my history, I followed the trends down, and then the trends up. If there's one \"strategy\" to what I do, you can say I ride trends. Knowing the trend was more instinctive. When China, the second biggest fucking economy in the world, was willing to take an extreme measure of forced quarantine of almost 500 million of its citizens, I understood just how fucking serious the virus was. Was that getting priced in the US stock market though? The potentially similar lockdowns in the US? No. Market was fucking hitting ATH at the same time. I shorted the shit out of everything about a week after (including DIS, $80p I bought when it was at $130) market hit ATH I think. My instinct was right, I went up to $550k\\~ or so from this.\n\nBut then I made the mistake of holding when the trend had reversed. The market was no longer responding to the bad news. More death count than any other source of death in the country per day? Green. Record setting unemployment? Green. I went from $550k down to $91k. Bought ballsdeep calls from here and rode the wave back up.\n\nLearning to get a sense of the current trend is the hardest part I think. And who is your best friend? The trend. Who gives you your giant pile of tendies? The trend. Who buys your wife a new iMac pro? The trend. Never try to \"outsmart\" the market. You're going to lose you fucking shirt.\n\nEDIT 6:\n\nAlmost forgot one of the biggest lessons I learned. I never ever close a position within the first \\~1 hour of market opening. I usually close them in the last hour instead. Contract pricing is usually way out of wack across the board you are going to have massive amounts of slippage, mispricing, and just retarded level of lag and shit, even on the big boy brokers like Fidelity. (The only exclusion here would be for SPY...I don't go into SPY anymore, but if I did, I will sell at market open. The liquidity and the price movement is already built in when market opens for SPY. Any other tickers like AMZN, this rule applies)\n\nEDIT 7:\n\nI will add one more thing that led to my biggest gain trades. When a stock currently is at ATH, I mean actual ATH not high of 52 weeks, then there's a massive momentum going for the stock and chances are it will keep that momentum for a while. Using this logic, I went into AMZN calls. Many people asked me why I got in when it had already run up from $1.9k to like $2.1k or something, it's because I used that logic. (Be aware of buying into meme stocks ATH though, I'd be ready to cut my losses the next day if I got into a meme stock and it didn't continue going up/down)\n\nEDIT 8:\n\nLet me make one point clear. You are nothing. You are a nobody. Nobody gives  a fuck about your gut feeling, or TA voodoo, or this, and that, and the market doesn't owe you shit. You are a dumbass. You are a dumbass. Repeat after me, you are a dumbass. The sooner you get this fact through your thick skull and learn to respect the trends of the market, the better it will be for your trades. Learn humility, stop fucking bragging about your 1 or even 10 wins, and more importantly, don't delude yourself into thinking you figured out the secret after your few trades. You haven't. Learn to be humble, and always fucking respect the market trends. It may feel like it, but this is not a fucking game, unless you want it to be and think the #'s you see on the neo screen are not real. You are trying to make serious $, not be proven right or how smart you are. I'll repeat, take ego out of it. Or not. But for me to get to this level over about 350 trades, these tips I outlined above worked remarkably well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "selftext": "After watching several interviews with Trevor Milton, I noticed that he engages in behavior that is similar to other fraudster CEOs, such as Elizabeth Holmes, Jeffrey Skilling, Adam Neumann, Billy McFarland, etc.\n\nAlmost every interview of his includes contradictory information. It would probably take an hour-long YouTube video to explain all of the instances, but I'll just go by a few here that you can watch yourself. A few quick instances first:\n\n* His company obviously copied Tesla by naming their company after Nikola Tesla, just choosing the first name instead. Then Trevor has the audacity to say that he can \"out-Elon Elon\". K, based on what? All of your past failures?\n\n* His company is a patent-troll. They sued Tesla for $2 BILLION, over something so incredibly stupid, and *expected* Tesla to pay out because \"they have billions anyways\". This is on the level of those people who fake-trip in a Walmart and sue because \"they have billions anyways\". It's trolling/sociopathic behavior.\n\n* Trevor said \"they're focusing on products that generate revenue\", which is why they got into hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) long-haul trucks. This was *completely contradicted* by their introduction of a pick-up truck, off-road 4x4, and a HFC jetski. Like, those are fun products, about 95% of customers buy those products for fun, not to make money off of. \n\n* He cashed out $70,000,000 in NKLA stock and purchased a $35,000,000 home before the company even sold a single truck.\n\n* Another thing that irks me: Trevor keeps saying \"we want to cut emissions, that's our driving force\" or whatever. He just bought a $35 Million house that uses WAY MORE emissions than a normal size house. And, it's way up in Utah, so he has to commute down to Arizona via air travel or more likely a private jet, which produces tons of emissions more than a normal person. This is like a \"limousine liberal\" personified. \n\n* NKLA applied for a $4 Million PPP loan, despite Trevor cashing out $70,000,000 in stock, and his company being worth Billions (on paper, but they still have a credit line). \n\n* On numerous occasions and interviews, Trevor talked about their company being \"vertically integrated\", i.e. owning the entire process from design, to production, to hydrogen fueling. What's really happening is their trucks are being built by a company all the way in Italy (or Germany), and then shipped to the US. He also has no plans on building out the Hydrogen fueling infrastructure. The \"renderings\" they keep showing he says will only cost \"$10-15 Million each\". That's ridiculous, the renderings for his HFC truck-stops are massive complexes that take up tons of land. Yeah, that's okay for Arizona and Utah, but not in the urban environments where most Trucks operate. And if you only have HFC-filling stations on the outskirts of cities, they'll be busy all the time which will increase transit times and cost more money. It's not like a Tesla Charging station that can just be built in a parking lot or near a loading dock. \n\n* Videos of their \"warehouse\" are all empty. It's not like Tesla's Fremont plant where there are thousands of workers. \n\n* NKLA went public through a \"reverse merger\", which isn't always bad, but it's still a sneaky/backdoor way to become publicly traded and in my opinion is worth staying away from on that basis alone. \n\n* The terms of their lock-out period expiration are just ridiculous. Some people are becoming millionaires before anything has even been sold. All they did was photoshop a few renderings for a few months, and that's somehow worth millions??\n\n* They don't even plan on having any trucks for sale for *years*. That means the next few years they're just going to be burning investors cash. Reminds me of DryShips, MoviePass, Theranos, etc.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qn2p3Lrn4A\n\n* Their \"Badger\" truck is nothing more than a rendering, and they're already accepting deposits for it?? That doesn't make any sense at all, it's *years* away from production. Their truck is nothing special compared to something like Rivian's or Tesla's, and both of those companies actually have working prototypes.\n\n* It'll be interesting if \"Nikola World\" even has a Badger Truck to show off. (Also, the name completely sucks)\n\n* He always sidesteps questions asked by interviews and twists the questions. She asked about them not producing a pickup truck, and then he says \"Well we have made a truck, we made the world's most advanced HFC truck...\" Yeah, not what she was talking about.\n\n* Anheuser Busch has made FREE reservations of about 800 trucks, but they haven't committed any money to the project. Anyone can go reserve a truck for free. Reservations ARE NOT sales, and Trevor talks like they're sales. That's what got Enron in trouble in the 2000s with their \"Mark-to-market accounting\" tricks.\n\n* In this interview, he mentions \"fun\" way too often. Not really sociopathic, just kind of weird. \n\n* They threatened to sue Bloomberg over the fact that their truck wasn't functional, which was true. If you haven't performed safety testing, then the truck isn't functional. People don't buy products without safety testing. That's why they're not actually following through on the lawsuit, because Trevor knows they would lose.\n\n* He uses the same logic as Elizabeth Holmes, when she would spout that bullshit like \"First they say you're crazy, then they fight you and then all of a sudden, you change the world.\" Worked out well for her, lmao!\n\n* Why do they have such a big factory/warehouse space in Arizona, when their trucks are being \"hand built\" in Germany (wait, not Italy anymore??)? Also, hand-built means not an assembly line, right? He also continuously gets his dates messed up. In this interview he said they'd be beginning production within the next few months, [but in this article he says production won't begin until 2021](https://www.electrive.com/2020/02/07/nikola-tre-to-be-built-in-ulm-germany/). \n\n* [Why is he taking shitty vertical cell-phone footage of trucks?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C2LDmkEmP0) Can't he have other employees do that?\n\n* He talks about \"tickets to Nikola World\" like it's fucking Coachella or something. It's a company-sponsored event dude, no one gives a shit. Ooh, you get a $100 ticket if you put down a $1,000 deposit for a truck that's not going to be coming out for years?? What a deal!\n\n* That factory in Ulm, Germany he keeps mentioning? Right now, they only produce [fire trucks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iveco), they don't even manufacture semi-trucks. So, uh, they're just going to convert from building diesel powered fire trucks to building electric and/or HFC trucks? Has that ever been done before ever?\n\n* [Trevor thinks that two days of reservations is enough to forecast an entire year's worth of reservations.](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/i-ve-got-a-message-for-nikola-s-ceo-and-he-may-not-like-it-15365601)\n\n* In that article, he takes all criticism as \"haters\" or whatever, and not people who just want to understand what's going on. That's cult-like behavior, something to avoid in droves if you ever see it as an investor. \n\nI could go on, that's what I've seen so far, and I'll probably keep updating this in the future. Result: I'd stay far away from this stock simply because they have nothing for sale for years, which is ridiculous. The CEO acts like a sociopath, and seems to embody the types of traits seen in other sociopaths who were engaging in fraudulent/vaporware products. They're just going to burn through any money that investors have added before delivering anything.\n\nEdit: As mentioned in the comments, Trevor Milton isn't even the CEO any more. That job has been taken up by [Mark Russell](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2020/06/12/nikola-stock-surge-turns-ceo-mark-russell-into-hydrogen-truckmakers-second-billionaire/#2acd467c31d8) who was the former CEO of Worthington Industries, a metal manufacturing company.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Corporation\n\nEdit: Update, banned from /r/nikolacorporation, lmao: https://i.redd.it/jv61sp70r8c51.png\n\nEdit: Another point is that it seems like Nikola thinks the Diesel trucking industry is just going to roll over, die, and replace all their trucks with Nikola Trucks. There is no way these companies are going to let that happen:\n\nhttps://drilling-deep-with-john-kingston.simplecast.com/episodes/the-diesel-engine-isnt-going-anywhere-for-a-long-time\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/diesel-trucks-arent-going-anywhere-2018-3\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/pilot-truck-stop-empire-moves-away-from-family-leadership-11595341279\n\nhttps://www.truckinginfo.com/10121641/new-gen-diesel-powered-trucks-vital-to-clean-air-goals\n\nIn this video he sounds like a straight-up sociopath, also talks about having \"fun\" again: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpLrxblsWZE",

        "selftext": "In today's DDDD (data-driven DD), after a long hiatus due to less free time, we'll take another broad view of the current state of the United States economy and public health. We\u2019ll be looking at some data to answer a few questions. Namely, what the state of the pandemic is globally and in the United States, whether or not we will have a second Great Lockdown (yes, historians are now calling this [the Great Lockdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_recession)), statistics on the resumption of economic activity, and the looming unemployment and eviction crisis, and how this all might affect the stock market.\n\n**COVID-19 Data**\n\nOn face value, we can see the number of confirmed cases rising exponentially again in the United States, after a flattening of new cases during the lockdown.\n\n[New cases by country](https://preview.redd.it/0ppbgmjkuua51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8364b49db7f55f39ec285f7aec731eda1b83f1d4)\n\nThis is in contrast to countries like New Zealand, which has been declared COVID-19 free for several weeks, and much of Europe which has significantly reduced new cases and has even reopened for tourism. Within the US, the previous epicenter, New York, has seen a drastic reduction in new cases and is moving towards re-opening.\n\n[NY New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/uww1vjlwuua51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0df5aff508e31aa0450e33459a2a2790e5eb505b)\n\nOn the other hand, another exponential rise in confirmed cases have been seen in several other states that have fully reopened, including California, Texas, and Florida, the three largest states in the union.\n\n[California New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/969nv8hzuua51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e227e2a481190f3e4d3a28e777a217b19e8ea256)\n\n[Texas New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/7kiy7rv0vua51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bcdcc26e402e1456088cb1792a0b4d434522691)\n\n[Florida New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/khrmq322vua51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a3f4efe562bcf5d5995747a8042e248d153e3dd)\n\nPart of the increase in new confirmed cases can be attributed to more widespread testing within these states, so we\u2019ll have to look at confirmed deaths to really see if things are getting much worse. If deaths weren\u2019t rising, then the increase in cases could even be considered good news because this implies excessive testing and a much lower case fatality rate than expected.\n\n[California New Deaths](https://preview.redd.it/t6970z73vua51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afc9073e0e402a6c1f6537478e09536c1bbba3df)\n\n[Texas New Deaths](https://preview.redd.it/b7l6gke4vua51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74f3dacdfd5f0e73967cb4e97bce3c80846b323d)\n\n[Florida New Deaths](https://preview.redd.it/ticc80p5vua51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1b829f5bf0ae83bde766042de8cc7fba5a615fb)\n\nIt looks like there is a true increase in cases within these states. Keep in mind that the new deaths statistics will lag behind the new infections rate by several weeks. The new deaths rate has just started increasing exponentially again at the beginning of July, and this will become even worse, even if governors impose new lockdowns and restrictions because of the delay.\n\n**Will a Second Lockdown Happen?**\n\nThe second question to ask is if there will be a second wave of lockdowns. California recently just announced a [rollback in the lifting of restrictions](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/13/california-to-close-indoor-restaurants-movie-theaters-and-bars-statewide-as-coronavirus-cases-rise.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594749851411000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2qxWTtCYwlbOxvW8cvVKT6)\u00a0in response to the new increase in cases, setting a precedent for other states to follow suit. However, whether or not there will be a second wave of lockdowns in states is unclear, and depends on several key factors.\n\n*Mask Usage*\n\nDespite initial opposition from health officials telling the public masks do not work, there has been a reversal in messaging, and the government is now encouraging people to wear masks in public. [Even Trump is wearing one in public now](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/opinion/letters/coronavirus-trump-mask.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594749851412000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Yj5a4KXhVBc67mi8IEf5m), especially since there is no longer a shortage. The scientific consensus seems to be that surgical masks are effective in preventing the wearer from transmitting COVID-19 to others if they are sick, but not so effective from having the wearer catch it. This has worked in many other countries, especially in Asia, where people might be publicly shamed or shunned for not wearing a mask and potentially exposing others to COVID-19, which explains why places such as Japan and Taiwan have never seen real widespread transmission. However, in the US there is [significant opposition towards mask wearing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/health/california-lifts-mask-requirement-trnd/index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594749851412000&amp;usg=AOvVaw38DVurc7sTHBNetNmD_FO2), and wearing mandates may not be widely followed in some states. According to [one study](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096644v2&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594749851413000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3k20celrv3_h--S1KA8gCR), the critical mask adoption rate is calculated to be approximately 73% for the epidemic to be contained. If states are able to successfully convince their population to start wearing masks in public, above that rate, then a second lockdown will not be needed. However, even with a [mask mandate](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/us/california-coronavirus-face-covering-order/index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594749851413000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3JdCcj0ul9-vtCuYeAPnS3)\u00a0in California in all places where social distancing is not possible being enacted a month ago, it does not seem to have been widely followed enough to prevent a rise in new cases and deaths. My personal opinion is that most people are now desensitized to COVID-19 news, and no longer care enough to wear masks in public, and hence the 73% critical adoption rate will not be met in most states, even if there is a mandate implemented.\n\n*Political Opinion*\n\nEspecially important as it\u2019s an election year, a new wave of lockdowns will likely be dependent on the political popularity of it. I wasn\u2019t able to find any reliable recent polls about it, but based on media and political discourse, it looks like the concern right now is more with saving the economy, with the population desensitized towards COVID-19 deaths. A Single Death is a Tragedy; a Million Deaths is a Statistic. This famous quote can be applied to virtually every natural disaster and massacre. Nobody cared about COVID-19 until March when suddenly Tom Hanks and NBA players were diagnosed with it. Everyone then started panicking and raided their local grocery store to buy up all the toilet paper (for some reason). So what will make people care about the pandemic again?\n\n*ICU Beds*\n\nThis is probably the best indicator for when things will go crazy. Once enough hospitals run out of ICU beds to treat COVID-19 patients, they will start having to turn away patients and the case fatality rate will skyrocket. This will likely cause a media frenzy and re-instill widespread panic, shifting political opinion towards more lockdowns. How close are we to this? This statistic is much harder to collect data on and interpret because available ICU beds tend to be fragmented. Since it\u2019ll be logistically difficult to relocate patients to the other side of a state if all the ICU beds in one county fills up, what matters isn\u2019t necessarily how many beds are available in the state, but how many hospitals in each county have reached capacity. Since that\u2019s much harder to interpret and find data on, we'll just look at the available ICU headroom, which does not include potential extra beds that may be created in response to COVID-19.\n\n[California ICU Headroom](https://preview.redd.it/3sdx8la7vua51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa5ec78a13e1f26ecf308fad9544bcec1bad0e32)\n\n[Texas ICU Headroom](https://preview.redd.it/5l8h71vbvua51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=796ed67e262d180aae0270e4db3bb64da28237a4)\n\n[Florida ICU Headroom](https://preview.redd.it/klgx21bevua51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0c21f85eb21bcbb8b0e11394fde26a2c191851a)\n\nFrom this data, California\u2019s pretty much safe, while Texas\u2019 is close to running out of beds and Florida has pretty much reached capacity.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that it will be much more difficult to solve the lack of ICU beds in these states compared to New York. The vast majority of the state\u2019s population live at or near New York City, which is densely populated (in case you\u2019re geographically deficient). This means the problem can easily be solved by simply adding a bunch of beds in one central location, and sending a hospital ship to one place. This can\u2019t really be done in more sparsely populated states like Texas and Florida. Based on this data, we\u2019ll likely see some panic about COVID-19 again in the coming weeks with ICU beds running out in multiple states.\n\n**The Reopening, Oil, and Economic Activity**\n\n[The state of reopening](https://preview.redd.it/zdz0zq3hvua51.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a47986120b693fc8dcd6b61cc30aac48cec595f)\n\nIn general, the north east, which was the hardest hit in March, is still in the process of rolling back restrictions, with most other states having already fully reopened. However, many of the new hot spots, like California, Florida, and Texas, are starting to impose new restrictions. The stock market is starting to realize this, with a selloff happening once California announced a complete rollback of re-opening, closing all indoor dining in the state, and there\u2019s fears that the other hotspot states might follow suit.\n\n[New Jobless Claims](https://preview.redd.it/xlnulkljvua51.png?width=1596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82f15416b73529866b809f98a43e10fb8295e88a)\n\nWith a few weeks of many states completely reopening we\u2019re now able to see what the best case scenario for the economy would be. Although dramatically reduced from April highs, there\u2019s still over 1 million new joblessness claims per week, way above pre-pandemic figures. Furthermore, these new joblessness claims have stopped decreasing and are starting to slowly rise back up again, and this is with most of the economy re-opened. Since full reopening in many states are still recent, we don\u2019t have other economic indicators, such as personal savings rate and consumer confidence to see if people are actually re-engaged in the economy or people are still avoiding economic activity out of fear of COVID-19.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on for a while is crude oil stocks. Despite a rally back up from the (negative) lows on the May contract, WTI has been struggling to break $40 and recover to pre-COVID levels, although being near it. While digging through some data [provided weekly by the EIA](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/data.php&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594749851416000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bDA78iR9amTL3rriK4Wvl), I noticed something interesting with crude oil stocks - despite re-opening, it\u2019s still increasing.\n\n[Crude Oil Stored \\(kbbl\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xdgrc3hlvua51.png?width=1378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f7694baf5c7b8143c091f38778b736530820382)\n\nExcept for one small dip in the middle of May, crude oil stocks have been slowly rising throughout this entire re-opening, despite many oil producers cutting back capacity. Worse yet, an OPEC meeting scheduled later this week is expected to [relax production cuts](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/13/oil-markets-opec-in-focus.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594749851416000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3uuF8qeo1DP2VKiGuOkdQg), putting even more crude oil into the supply. Excluding the SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserve), the story looks slightly less scary for commercial producers.\n\n[Crude Oil Stored for Commercial Use \\(kbbl\\)](https://preview.redd.it/csen71vqvua51.png?width=1356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=485df51d36c9a6262d8c42156d68c81971ad0cd8)\n\nThis however does not mean we\u2019re going to be seeing negative oil futures again, since producers have gotten smarter about avoiding a storage squeeze in Cushing.\n\n[Crude Oil Stored for Commercial Use @ Cushing \\(kbbl\\)](https://preview.redd.it/awlcjzcxvua51.png?width=1362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=275b43ecabc5521978002db198c099f8f1bf5b49)\n\nRefinery utilization, although steadily increasing, is still significantly below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n[Refinery Utilization Rate](https://preview.redd.it/s1l8rl40wua51.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b8926c8faf1baf3282c6b2dd530ece560ebe29e)\n\nThe conclusion that can be drawn from this is that oil-based economic activity (i.e. travel and energy usage), while increasing, is still well below what it was in February. Crude oil producers however, are still outproducing what refineries are taking in, and crude stocks have been steadily increasing throughout the entire reopening despite increasing oil prices.\n\n**The Looming Housing Crisis**\n\nAnother thing to mention is the ticking time bomb that is the expiration of the unemployment boost provided by the federal government on July 31, and the eviction crisis coming our way as eviction courts reopen and process them. Mortgage forbearances are also starting to expire, with around 8% of all [active mortgages in forbearance](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/10/coronavirus-mortgage-bailout-sees-biggest-one-week-decline-yet.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594749851418000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2JRDx43Q0y7IYcupImyxDZ). According to [one source](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/08/32-percent-of-us-households-missed-their-july-housing-payments.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594749851418000&amp;usg=AOvVaw24JU1zP70LJmgOsUopIb3Q), 36% of renters and 30% of homeowners did not pay their full housing payment in time. This will probably take a few months to really see the effects of this, but it\u2019s definitely something to consider.\n\n**How This Might Affect Stocks**\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing the first waves of bankruptcies, mostly from companies that were already in a poor financial position like Hertz, JCPenny, and GNC. For the bull case, most of the rally for the past few months have mostly been concentrated in tech stocks, which are much less directly affected by the pandemic, with some companies like Amazon even benefitting from it. They\u2019re usually very financially healthy, and can easily operate in a pandemic, if not benefitting from it. In fact, some stocks like AMZN, TSLA, ZM, and SHOP have gone parabolic in the past few weeks, which is usually not a good sign. On the bear case, most economists predict a prolonged U-shaped or L-shaped economic recovery, and a wave of bankruptcies for companies that couldn\u2019t be rescued by the Fed. As mentioned above, I also believe we\u2019re going to be seeing a second wave of lockdowns in the coming weeks as ICU beds start running out, making the economic situation even worse. Eventually, a shrinking economy, mass unemployment, and reduced spending will ultimately hurt the earnings of even the tech stocks. GOOG and FB earnings ultimately rely on businesses buying ads. AMZN and SHOP earnings rely on consumers buying things. Another argument for the bull side is that due to monetary policies such as QE and 0% treasury yields, along with the unattractiveness of emerging markets in the current economic climate, there is a [massive modern savings glut](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/straub/files/mss_richsavingglut.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594749851419000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ThBvbFFnJeTPQWxsBHFQQ)\u00a0\\- money that has nowhere else to go. This by itself could take another essay to explain, so I might talk about this more in a future post.\n\n**My Positions**\n\nFor those that have been following me the past few months, my positions remain unchanged. After briefly joining the bulls for a few weeks, then \ud83e\udd98gang, I've now converted back to a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. My only major position right now are VIX calls, with July, Aug, and Sept expiry, which I entered a few weeks ago when VIX was at 26. There's a few reasons for this - I still believe in my [long-term thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) that the stock market is in a bubble, with the past few months accelerating the inflation of it, and my belief that the US will eventually mishandle the COVID-19 response, forcing the government to lockdown again once ICU beds run out. I'm no longer day trading, and will swing trade my current positions when a good selling opportunity comes - I'll keep this post updated if I sell.",

He makes fancy charts and pictures and probably has a math degree. \n\n**My latest DD can also be found here:**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hv5xx4/purple\\_has\\_hired\\_330\\_people\\_in\\_60\\_days\\_and\\_has/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hv5xx4/purple_has_hired_330_people_in_60_days_and_has/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Purple latest Bullish press release can be here:** [https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Expands-U.S.-Manufacturing-with-a-New-Facility-in-Georgia/default.aspx](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Expands-U.S.-Manufacturing-with-a-New-Facility-in-Georgia/default.aspx)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt appears that I was a little conservative in my run up and even I got some FOMO and sold my short leg slightly earlier than I wanted to. To all the followers, Although we may cap our gains at 25.00 with these spreads, our gains will likely be max after a positive earnings call. That being said, **if you are wanting a conservative play, the 22.50/25.00 debit spreads for August, Sept and October will all likely net you more than 100%.** Right now, the Sept spreads are showing a return of 155.00 for every 95.00 at risk, a 163% return. this run up is likely due to the massive hiring spree along with the new factory expansion that was announced yesterday. I expect that we will get more run up if we can maintain green tomorrow. I also expect that purple will smash earnings.\n\n* **If you cannot do options or do not have capital then the PRPLW are still a good play. I still own 45K warrants.**\n* **If you sleep on a casper because you're a giant sissy lala, then PRPL stock is probably the play for you. I still own 45K shares.**\n* **If you are a giant gay bear, just buy the mattress so that you have some comfort when the Mods come over to have their way with you**\n* **I didn't expect this stock to MEME but it is possible as it's still undervalued and will be a cash cow with surging DTC sales. forward PEG may be in the single digits. the last three days of movement lead me to believe earnings day could push this to 27-28, which is about 10% higher than my original expectation. If it memes, then 30+ is not unrealistic.**\n* **This is NOT investment advice- I learned all my investing strategies from TIK TOK, do your own research.**\n* *For those that like selling puts, I would sell 25.00 August, 25.00 September, 30 september, 25 october, 30 october and 30 Januarys. this strategy is independent of the above mentioned strategies. If you have huge balls, 35.00 january's might be a good play.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease use the following site to calculate potential scenarios for options plays. The following is a sept 22.50/25.00 debit spread with the max return of 163%.\n\n[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/call-spread.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/call-spread.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Automated site that shows different scenarios.](https://preview.redd.it/0amjz4lttwd51.jpg?width=643&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21fa97715ded189a50fe9df90b2ef793c2ec9a4c)\n\nAt this point, you have a few options if you haven't completed your positions.

        "selftext": "Simple answer: [Dr. Lisa Su (how she turns around AMD)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHT5MRky9SA)\n\nWhen you invest in a company, it's not just the product that's important for the company, but its people and leadership as well. Because ultimately, a corporation is just an organization run by bunch of people, which Elon Musk emphasized this point. A company's leader who has a clear vision for the company will bring its people together and its competitive products to market for the future. You look at the leaders between Intel's and AMD's. One got a Ph.D in electric engineering and has a firm grasp of where the industry is heading toward, whereas the other person who was previously a CFO just looks at spreadsheets and uses any means to appease the shareholders. How likely would a business major know anything what the semiconductor industry will look like in five years?\n\nIntel has been dominating 90% of the PC market for many years. The company becomes complacent and so do its shareholders' base as the stockholders enjoy their annual dividend payouts. You do that in a highly competitive semiconductor industry, your company will lose value and eventually get abandoned. You have to be constantly innovating to stay ahead, especially in the technology sector because that's just the nature of the industry. This isn't like consumer staples where the market remains static for a long time. A technology company's moat is easily broken if the company doesn't plan out its roll map &amp; product lines for the next five years. A lot investors could tell this became quite apparent at the last Intel's earning report.\n\nThis also separates the difference between value investing &amp; growth investing. Value investors look at financial statements of a company to judge how it appears now, whereas growth investors look at a company and make financial projections where the company can potentially go toward for the next several years. Growth stocks will never appear cheap at any current time, because if they do, then by definition they already stop growing. If you're a value investor by heart, I advise stay away from investing into tech stocks if you don't have a firm grasp about their respective, ever-changing industries, because most of them will never make sense to you.\n\nThere will be a time to revisit Intel. In my opinion, Intel needs a better leader who has an expertise in the field. Hitherto, AMD will continue to take market shares away from Intel to grow its revenues &amp; earnings, because its leader already planned this out from the last few years. She knew her competitor would have a tougher time catching up in manufacturing the technology. AMD stock is going much higher for the next 2-5 years.\n\nDisclosure: AMD shareholders since $8.00",

        "selftext": " \n\nNext week congress is back in full swing, woop woop!  The well dries up on extended Unemployment Insurance benefits (aka the extra $600 a week you hear about people getting) on the 31st, and it\u2019s time for some actual decisions to be made.  Here\u2019s how shit looks;\n\n*Primer for the unread autist:*\n\nOn May 25th the House (Democratic) passed the HEROES Act as a starting point for second round of stimulus talks (for those who don\u2019t know how it works, the House passes draft legislation, which then must be approved by the Republican Senate).  This will be the first time the Senate get\u2019s a chance to truly debate it\u2019s merits in session, but McConnell and other Republicans have already given statements letting folks know there is no way it passes as stands.  *What does the HEROES Act include?*  I put the ones that are important to you, the young tendie farmer, in bold\n\n* **a second stimulus check**\n* debt relief\n* student loan forgiveness\n* hazard pay\n* **six more months of COVID-19 unemployment**\n* housing and food assistance\n* nearly $1 trillion in aid for state and local governments so they can pay \u201cvital workers like first responders, health workers, and teachers\u201d who are at risk of losing their jobs due to budget shortfalls\n\nThe HEROES Act would give individuals earning up to $75,000 annually a one-time, non-taxable check for $1,200. However, whereas the first round of payments included an extra $500 per family for every child aged 16 or under, this additional credit would now rise to $1,200 each for a maximum of three dependents, allowing households to claim up to $6,000 each.\n\nSound nice?  It\u2019s not happening.  Both McConnell (Senate Majority Leader) and Mnuchin (if you don\u2019t know who he is stop trading right now) have been given stringent opposition to both those factors by saying 1) the $75,000 cap will be lower.  How much lower?  McConnell has floated $40,000 as the Senate starting point, representing a nearly 50% difference and 2) Mnuchin and McConnell have been both been firm in not extending the $600 weekly UI benefit, calling it a disincentive for people to return to work.\n\nA copy of McConnell\u2019s counter-proposal was leaked to the Associated Press and in addition to the $40,000 cap, it also suggested moving the enhanced Unemployment Benefits from $600 a week to a few hundred dollars a month, and bridging the gap by providing a yet-to-be-determined \u2018back to work bonus\u2019.\n\n*So, what?*\n\nPolitics aside, if you\u2019re a bull you probably want as many benefits as possible to keep consumer sentiment high and help retail rebound.  It also helps with travel, etc.  Given that a few of the largest economies in the world (CA, FL, and TX) are halting reopening and--if they\u2019re not overtly saying it--trending toward shutdown, a \u201cback to work bonus\u201d may be a harder sell than the Senate realizes in practicality, and the UI benefit extension could definitely end up being more than a few hundred dollars a month to offset the that naturally occurring loss in work.\n\n*So, when does this happen?*\n\n*Monday- July 20th*: US Senate returns to session\n\n\"as soon as the Senate gets back, we're going to sit down on a partisan basis with the Republicans and the Democrats and it will be our priority to make sure between the 20th and the end of the month that we pass the next legislation.\"\n\nThis will be the first opportunity to get some daily swings based on headlines.\n\n*July 31st-*\\-the house begins a scheduled summer recess until labor day that Pelosi has said she is willing to delay.  This could lead to tactics of brinksmanship similar to those seen with previous budget shutdowns.  But\u2026\n\n*August 7th-* that's when the senate goes on recess and McConnell has been clear that he will not be delaying it or cancelling it.\n\n***In other words, whatever is done will be done by August 7th.***  \n\n*Will Jerome speak on it??*\n\nI don\u2019t see many scheduled FED hearings (or any) on the matter coming up, so this will not be like the hearings popping in June that allowed for massive daily swings.  But we will get lots of sound bites for the news to run with, and sound bites back from the Republican Senate.\n\n**Of note though, on Thursday, July 23rd, there is a House Committee meeting on the Heroes Act.  This should produce some aggravated soundbites from Republicans in the news.**\n\n***How I\u2019m going to play it***\n\nNothing is stopping this vaccine pump from Monday the 21st until Tuesday open, but I\u2019ll be looking to capitalize on moments of weakness for VIX/VXX pops.\n\n**If we are green Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday I\u2019ll be buying:** \n\nVXX 7/24 32c\n\nVXX 7/31 34c\n\nAnd hold them until Republican senate responses come out to what is said during the House Committee meeting on Thursday.\n\n**On afternoons and evenings where Mango/McConnell thrash the Democrats as unreasonable:**\n\nVXX calls on those afternoons slightly OTM or ATM at open the next morning and hold until the next day.\n\n**Given that the vaccine high will likely wear off, case/death numbers are rising, and the news around this stuff will be turbulent, I\u2019ll be moving into good ol\u2019 tech next week with some:**\n\nQQQ 7/31 262c\n\nQQQ 8/7 270c\n\n**On the week of 7/24, in anticipation of a deal getting done:** \n\nSPY 8/7 330c\n\nSPY 8/14 335c\n\n***TLDR:***\n\nHEROES ACT negotiations are going to be a bumpy ride.  Senate Republicans hate the extra poor people benefits but will capitulate on their current hard stance--at least slightly--to keep the market lubed up particularly in light of businesses shutting down in our largest states.\n\nVXX will be good for overnight pops as bad news breaks in negotiations, while QQQ will be a safer play than SPY while negotiations are happening and COVID is raging.  Will move all-in on SPY calls about a week out from Senate recess on August 7th, which is the unofficial--but official--deadline for a plan to be passed.\n\n*I will update with the evolving calendar and pertinent news on the negotiations sometimes here,sometimes my Twitter same name.*\n\n**EDIT: Note 6 PM PST 7/18-- I am not advocating hold VXX long term or saying SPY won't trend upward on those plays--I am referring to those overnight guerilla warfare, get in and get out when you're up plays.  Next leg down ain't coming anytime soon, but there is still money to be made in bouts of volatility.**\n\n***FURTHER READING UPDATED DAILY BELOW***\n\n**UPDATE: (link) 7/18 9:37 PST: So it begins..**. https://www.wsj.com/articles/depleted-trump-economic-team-faces-major-test-over-extending-coronavirus-relief-efforts-11595073600\n\n**UPDATE: (link) 7/18 ** deeper reading on the Unemployment Insurance/ \u2018Back to Work\u2019 Bonus debate: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-600-boost-in-unemployment-benefits-expires-soon-what-comes-next-200832084.html\n\n**UPDATE: (link) 7/19**  WSJ article examining pros and cons of extended benefits through ind. stories: https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-600-a-week-jobless-aid-nears-end-congress-faces-a-quandary-11595151000?st=l5leqtixuee8ynz&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share",

        "selftext": "Ok. First things first. I have a masters in finance and was an econ professor for five years. I do have some idea what I'm talking about. However:\n\n1. Timing is always impossible. I know there have been several prophets on here who proclaimed the end of times, only to make fools of themselves. I have suspicions about when the crash is coming, but won't claim I know with any certainty.\n2. Macroeconomics and our current financial system are so, so, fucking complicated that NOBODY really understands them perfectly. You can listen to two legitimately genius dudes on macro podcasts who are saying precisely opposite things. So - you can have a hunch. I do. But at the end of the day, NOBODY knows anything.\n\nOk then. That being said. Here's one thing I feel pretty strongly about in all markets: there are no easy fixes; the rubber *always* meets the road, eventually.\n\nSo what's fueling this insane stock rally? Obviously it's the Fed. It's the Fed pumping money like crazy. And what will pop this bubble? ***When printing money itself starts hurting the situation, rather than helping it.***\n\nExhibit one: The dollar index over the past six months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cp82kbk3adc51.png?width=2594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e9f406fae57dc932bc6a9bd7f91e5016f192b8c\n\nThe dollar index, ($DXY) measures the strength of the dollar against a few other currencies. Specifically:\n\n* [Euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro) (EUR), 57.6% weight\n* [Japanese yen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen) (JPY) 13.6% weight\n* [Pound sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling) (GBP), 11.9% weight\n* [Canadian dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar) (CAD), 9.1% weight\n* [Swedish krona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_krona) (SEK), 4.2% weight\n* [Swiss franc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_franc) (CHF) 3.6% weight\n\nThe dollar has been gradually weakening since April, and yesterday it absolutely nose-dived. Why? Some say the past months dip has been because the dollar is where people run to in times of crisis, and now that the crisis is passing, they don't need dollars as much anymore. Yesterday's dip in particular was attributed to the EuroZone passing a stimulus, giving investors faith that the Euro zone will remain unified and strong (there were rumors of it potentially breaking apart).\n\nHonestly, I don't know why the dollar has been tanking for three months (I have guesses, that's all), and anybody who tells you they do know is a lying sack of shit. And maybe the reason it's been tanking is less important than what the *narrative* around it will be, if it drops much further. You probably guessed it. What's everyone gonna be saying?\n\n**The Fed is printing too much money. They're inflating the shit out of the dollar!**\n\nAgain, whether that's true or not doesn't really matter, because if that's the narrative, the further devaluation of the dollar becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: other countries don't want to hold dollars anymore because they'll lose their value. More sellers of dollars = $DXY drops even further, etc, etc.\n\nAnd now you're JPow watching $DXY drop down past 93, and you're starting to shit your pants. Because the rubber is meeting the road. The Fed wants modest inflation (2-3%) because it will make their debt worth less. But at the end of the day, a*bsolutely nothing scarier than* ***hyperinflation***. That's the nightmare scenario.\n\nAnd you know hyperinflation sneaks up on you. You have to be fucking vigilant. Not only do you have to stop printing, you might have to RAISE interest rates to avoid inflation getting out of control.\n\nBut again, it ultimately doesn't even matter if JPow changes his colors or not, what matters is the *narrative* that he's going to have to stop printing.\n\nThe market might already be sensing this... while Gold has been shooting up nicely and consistently, Silver has been fucking killing it the past two days. Maybe this \\^ is why.\n\n**Positions:** As I said at the beginning, even if I was 100% sure things were gonna go down like this, I'm wary of trying to time it. I have IWM and SPY puts for November, and GLD and SLV calls, for times between September and January 2022.\n\nNote: Even if this is totally wrong, I'm think there are other factors that will rain hellfire down on the market by November. Second wave in New York + Uncertainty around elections --&gt; both of these could actually *cause* the above cycle to start. Dollar strength is about faith in the US government. Remember that if Biden wins, Trump is still president for another two months. Those two months, where we're not sure if he's even going to leave office willingly or not, could be enough to shake $DXY down and start this thing off.\n\nNot financial advice.\n\nTL;DR  November SPY $280 and IWM $120 ,  SLV and GLD leaps",

        "selftext": "Yes, this is sort of a cope post but I hope it helps someone out there.\n\nI'm 36 years old and quit my full time job in 2016 to day trade with $180k that I had made from trading 6 months prior. Between then and now, I have becoming a multi-millionaire three times, my ATH was 3.8MM, went back down to 800k, back up to 2.4MM, back down to 1.4MM, etc. \n\nOver and over again, people online told me to take profits, to move into safer investments, etc. When you believe you can make millions in half a year, you don't listen to any of that. I honestly thought I was wolf of Wall Street, and there ARE immense benefits to making that kind of money. I paid off my condo, bought a new car, travelled the world for a year (while trading), and have done luxurious things I NEVER imagined I'd experience before.\n\nAll and all I took home probably about 1.6MM, but in reality only took in maybe 1.1MM after taxes (would be even less if I earned it all within one tax year, but was split into 3).\n\nBesides my assets, I have 90k left in cash, and I just can't trade anymore. It completely fried me and to boot it taught me no life skills. You don't learn anything from trading in this manner except how to fool yourself into think you aren't gambling and wasting your life.\n\nMore importantly, it wasted so much of the prime years of my life that I actually want to cry right now. Your 20s and 30s are when you should be making your way in the world, growing and learning, not hunched over a lap top and being unable to sleep due to sheer avarice and worry. I wasted so much of my life chasing phantoms and with that mindset it will NEVER be enough. You will make a million, then another, then another, maybe lose it all but even if you don't, you pay a price for the money you make, and I don't think it's a good deal.\n\nNice things won't make you happy, but financial security will. If you make a million or two, you might want to consider taking a step back and analyzing your life to see if you're happy. The risk, the stress, and the time you spend in the market will only grow as you make more and it is so fucking dangerous.\n\nI was making 85k at my job, I wish I had stayed and just been a normal person. I made an ok amount of money but it cost me 4 years of my sanity, and held against what I would have earned, plus maybe raises, It really only was about 650k that I traded 4 prime years of my life for. Do something with your life, don't be like me and be some fucking jobless idiot who fooled himself into think he was a trader, with no direction who clings onto a rigged market for dear life.",

What you are experiencing right now, that retarded pump \u2014 it has a name.  We refer to it as retard strength.  Wouldn\u2019t be possible without all you retards.\n\nFor the rest of you astute individuals, let\u2019s focus on this tendie opportunity with INTC.\n\nLet\u2019s cut the bullshit and get right down to it.\n\nIntel management has guided to free cash flow of $17 **BILLION** this year.  That\u2019s nearly **twice the amount of total revenue** AMD is forecast to generate.  In the first half of 2020, Intel generated more than $10.6 billion in free cash flow \u2014 more than $58 million **per day**!!!\n\nMeanwhile, AMD \u2014 in that same 6 month period \u2014 generated free cash flow of just $32 million **TOTAL**\n\nRead that again you chinese loving fucks.  Intel generated almost **DOUBLE** the free cash flow **PER DAY** than AMD could generate in **6 FUCKING MONTHS**\n\nOh, and guess what else?  INTEL FUCKING PAYS DIVIDENDS!!!\n\nWant to get into P/E ratios???  Cool!\n\nAMD has a laughable P/E ratio of 157.23 \n\nLOLOLOLOL\n\nThat is the literal definition of OVERVALUED.  For you actual retards, P/E ratio is how much an investor is paying per $1 of actual earnings.\n\nIntel is at an amazing 11.61 P/E \u2014 you won\u2019t find a better deal.\n\nSo for all those retards who feel great now, ask me how you feel in 6 months when you\u2019re bagholding that chinese knockoff bullshit.\n\nAs for everyone else, enjoy this insane discount and buy this shit up!\n\nFYI, the cutoff for the next dividend payout from INTC is August 6, so get those shares bought and settled now!",

        "selftext": "What are you doing clicking this when you could be reading yet another TSLA post!?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - PRPL Warrants (PRPLW) were registered again by Purple Innovation to trade on Nasdaq, which should drive a liquidity boost to their value ahead of any pile in from Robinhood users that can now trade them. (EDIT:  see my note at the end.  As a few users have pointed out, I was wrong on the RH retards).\n\nAlso, I'm liking the 20c / 22.5c spreads for 8/21.   Great risk/reward (as of Friday).\n\n# DD Recap\n\nWhen PRPL had closed at $13.67 in the previous trading session I called [PRPL to $19+ by 8/12 (ER)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqpqa3/prpl_to_19_by_812_er_calling_it_again/) on 5/25.  Congrats to those who listened.\n\nIf you actually do DD, I'd recommend you read the above link, along with the follow up DDs done for this quarter:\n\n* [PRPL: More DD For You Autists](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs7mjl/prpl_more_dd_for_you_autists/)\n* [Looking for an entry for PRPL? It's right now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gw6irb/looking_for_an_entry_for_prpl_its_right_now/)\n* [PRPL 8-K Sales Release!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gzm5y9/prpl_8k_sales_release/)\n* [I bought six PRPL mattresses today. You should buy PRPL too (it's undervalued).](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hig038/i_bought_six_prpl_mattresses_today_you_should_buy/)\n\n# New DD\n\nI'm going to chat about the following in this post:\n\n1. Warrants on NASDAQ\n2. Updates to some previous DD\n3. Future Vision of PRPL Shared by VP of Branding\n\n# Warrants on NASDAQ\n\nPRPLW warrants were originally listed on Nasdaq when the SPAC combination was completed.   Because there were less than 400 unique round lot holders, the warrants fell off of NASDAQ and onto OTC markets where they have sat for well over a year.\n\nOn Thursday 7/16, Purple [refiled](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1643953/000121390020017648/0001213900-20-017648-index.htm) to have the warrants listed on NASDAQ.   NASDAQ followed close behind with a filing that [certified their approval](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1643953/000135445720000339/0001354457-20-000339-index.htm) of the relisting of PRPLW.\n\nHow is this good?   This will allow Robinhood users to pile into the warrants as well (watch Robintrack to monitor for meme status).   On another note, it makes these commission-less trades on most other brokers, and also allows these to become marginable securities for yours truly (which means I get to double down and buy a whole lot more PRPL plays on margin).\n\nRegardless, there was a value drop when the de-listing occurred due to the liquidity drop.   I would expect some liquidity premium to return on these when the listing goes active again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Updates to Previous DD\n\n**Cutting the Low End Products**\n\nPurple sells every mattress they make and is only constrained in sales by their manufacturing capacity (Purple is the actual manufacturer of their product, unlike other mattress startups like Casper).  Please read previous DD at the top if you want more details.\n\nIn order to maximize revenue on the same units of sale, Purple ***discontinued*** their low-end mattress.   This week, they announced a $100 price increase on their mid-tier mattress as well as their most popular mattress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Product|Category|Notes|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Original Purple Mattress|Low End|Discontinued|\n|2\" Hybrid Mattress|Mid-Tier|$100 Price Increase|\n|3\" Hybrid Premier Mattress|Most Popular|$100 Price Increase|\n|4\" Hybrid Premier Mattress|Premium|Price Unchanged|\n\nAs Purple is still having sell out and lead time problems (check their website lead times), this is definitely a case of management trying to increase dollars per manufacturing capacity.   For every Original Mattress they didn't manufacture, they were able to sell a Hybrid.\n\nThis is a great sign of management increasing their unit economics yet again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Jobs**\n\nYou may recall that we've been tracking job postings on the Purple job board as another measure of growth.  [The last time I posted on this,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs7mjl/prpl_more_dd_for_you_autists/) there were 56 job postings.   As of Friday, **THERE ARE 98 JOB POSTINGS!**   *More importantly*, they are now offering a $2,000 signing bonus for factory production workers.   There's some pretty interesting other jobs on there as well.\n\nWhile the media screams about unemployment, Purple is trying to fill the roster to the point where production jobs are being offered a relatively substantial bonus!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Future Vision of PRPL Shared by VP of Branding\n\nOn 7/9, Burke Morley, VP of Brand and Executive Creative Director at Purple, did a [podcast](https://www.podcast.vivoom.co/post/purple-vp-of-brand-burke-morley-no-longer-a-sleeper) where he shares some of the internal vision they have at Purple.   They do NOT consider themselves just a mattress company, but rather mattresses is just a way to generate cash to allow them to apply their comfort innovation across many categories.\n\nDismissing Purple as just a mattress company is like seeing Amazon as just a bookseller in 1998.  Burke shares their vision where they want to bring their technology to every aspect of your life:  your office, your car, the plane, etc.   Based upon the popularity of Purple's standalone seat cushions recently, they clearly can adapt their product to each of these markets.\n\nIf you are a DD-type of investor, I highly recommend you listen to the whole podcast, which does come across as very right-brained, in order to understand where this company is going.\n\nGiven that they have generated over $70M in cash in just April and May alone, I'm assuming we are going to see some of that cash deployed in product development to tap into these new markets.   Exciting few years ahead of Purple!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice and do your own research before making any investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm long PRPL via several hundred thousand warrants, 25c 8/17 and 20c/22.5c 8/17 spreads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yly04erefxb51.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e5f1b28e36e5b1c08ec0de3b84c740a9058ad3d\n\nEDIT:   Looks like Robinhood users are still SOL with warrants even though they are NASDAQ.  Time to upgrade your broker.   I still think we will see a liquidity premium for these coming off of OTC.",

This will continue with no end in sight and more companies will be looking to employ from home with cyber-security becoming a must necessity. \n\nThey have contracts with massive intelligence services and you can assume if an intelligence service would trust the software so would any retail business. \n\nNews transcribed : Safe-T a provider of secure access solutions for on-premise and hybrid Cloud environments, today announced that it has launched a unique implementation of the zero trust secure file access solution and was selected by a leading intelligence unit after successfully winning a tender process.

This company has never been in a better Financial situation and moving forward they will continue to acquire clients and contracts at a rapid rate. \n\nThis is a short and mid-range play that I see easily pushing $3 or more. I know some will take profits but I would personally hold until all clients and contracts are made clear as the extent is unknown and could be quite substantial. \n\nAlthough I doubt many of you will hold long term I can definitely see this company from $7-10 by EOY. \n\nRisks - \n\nFinancially there is no risk here (money situation is stable) but as with any penny stock an offering is always on the table but I believe with the new contracts they have acquired they will not be looking to do such a thing at this time.\n\n\n\nThanks to everyone who took the time to read.",

        "selftext": "After watching several interviews with Trevor Milton, I noticed that he engages in behavior that is similar to other fraudster CEOs, such as Elizabeth Holmes, Jeffrey Skilling, Adam Neumann, Billy McFarland, etc.\n\nAlmost every interview of his includes contradictory information. It would probably take an hour-long YouTube video to explain all of the instances, but I'll just go by a few here that you can watch yourself. A few quick instances first:\n\n* His company obviously copied Tesla by naming their company after Nikola Tesla, just choosing the first name instead. Then Trevor has the audacity to say that he can \"out-Elon Elon\". K, based on what? All of your past failures?\n\n* His company is a patent-troll. They sued Tesla for $2 BILLION, over something so incredibly stupid, and *expected* Tesla to pay out because \"they have billions anyways\". This is on the level of those people who fake-trip in a Walmart and sue because \"they have billions anyways\". It's trolling/sociopathic behavior.\n\n* Trevor said \"they're focusing on products that generate revenue\", which is why they got into hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) long-haul trucks. This was *completely contradicted* by their introduction of a pick-up truck, off-road 4x4, and a HFC jetski. Like, those are fun products, about 95% of customers buy those products for fun, not to make money off of. \n\n* He cashed out $70,000,000 in NKLA stock and purchased a $35,000,000 home before the company even sold a single truck.\n\n* NKLA applied for a $4 Million PPP loan, despite Trevor cashing out $70,000,000 in stock, and his company being worth Billions (on paper, but they still have a credit line). \n\n* On numerous occasions and interviews, Trevor talked about their company being \"vertically integrated\", i.e. owning the entire process from design, to production, to hydrogen fueling. What's really happening is their trucks are being built by a company all the way in Italy (or Germany), and then shipped to the US. He also has no plans on building out the Hydrogen fueling infrastructure. The \"renderings\" they keep showing he says will only cost \"$10-15 Million each\". That's ridiculous, the renderings for his HFC truck-stops are massive complexes that take up tons of land. Yeah, that's okay for Arizona and Utah, but not in the urban environments where most Trucks operate. And if you only have HFC-filling stations on the outskirts of cities, they'll be busy all the time which will increase transit times and cost more money. It's not like a Tesla Charging station that can just be built in a parking lot or near a loading dock. \n\n* Videos of their \"warehouse\" are all empty. It's not like Tesla's Fremont plant where there are thousands of workers. \n\n* NKLA went public through a \"reverse merger\", which isn't always bad, but it's still a sneaky/backdoor way to become publicly traded and in my opinion is worth staying away from on that basis alone. \n\n* The terms of their lock-out period expiration are just ridiculous. Some people are becoming millionaires before anything has even been sold. All they did was photoshop a few renderings for a few months, and that's somehow worth millions??\n\n* They don't even plan on having any trucks for sale for *years*. That means the next few years they're just going to be burning investors cash. Reminds me of DryShips, MoviePass, Theranos, etc.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qn2p3Lrn4A\n\n* Their \"Badger\" truck is nothing more than a rendering, and they're already accepting deposits for it?? That doesn't make any sense at all, it's *years* away from production. Their truck is nothing special compared to something like Rivian's or Tesla's, and both of those companies actually have working prototypes.\n\n* It'll be interesting if \"Nikola World\" even has a Badger Truck to show off. (Also, the name completely sucks)\n\n* He always sidesteps questions asked by interviews and twists the questions. She asked about them not producing a pickup truck, and then he says \"Well we have made a truck, we made the world's most advanced HFC truck...\" Yeah, not what she was talking about.\n\n* Anheuser Busch has made FREE reservations of about 800 trucks, but they haven't committed any money to the project. Anyone can go reserve a truck for free. Reservations ARE NOT sales, and Trevor talks like they're sales. That's what got Enron in trouble in the 2000s with their \"Mark-to-market accounting\" tricks.\n\n* In this interview, he mentions \"fun\" way too often. Not really sociopathic, just kind of weird. \n\n* They threatened to sue Bloomberg over the fact that their truck wasn't functional, which was true. If you haven't performed safety testing, then the truck isn't functional. People don't buy products without safety testing. That's why they're not actually following through on the lawsuit, because Trevor knows they would lose.\n\n* He uses the same logic as Elizabeth Holmes, when she would spout that bullshit like \"First they say you're crazy, then they fight you and then all of a sudden, you change the world.\" Worked out well for her, lmao!\n\n* Why do they have such a big factory/warehouse space in Arizona, when their trucks are being \"hand built\" in Germany (wait, not Italy anymore??)? Also, hand-built means not an assembly line, right? He also continuously gets his dates messed up. In this interview he said they'd be beginning production within the next few months, [but in this article he says production won't begin until 2021](https://www.electrive.com/2020/02/07/nikola-tre-to-be-built-in-ulm-germany/). \n\n* Why is he taking shitty vertical cell-phone footage of trucks? Can't he have other employees do that?\n\n* He talks about \"tickets to Nikola World\" like it's fucking Coachella or something. It's a company-sponsored event dude, no one gives a shit. Ooh, you get a $100 ticket if you put down a $1,000 deposit for a truck that's not going to be coming out for years?? What a deal!\n\n* That factory in Ulm, Germany he keeps mentioning? Right now, they only produce [fire trucks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iveco), they don't even manufacture semi-trucks. So, uh, they're just going to convert from building diesel powered fire trucks to building electric and/or HFC trucks? Has that ever been done before ever?\n\n* [Trevor thinks that two days of reservations is enough to forecast an entire year's worth of reservations.](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/i-ve-got-a-message-for-nikola-s-ceo-and-he-may-not-like-it-15365601)\n\n* In that article, he takes all criticism as \"haters\" or whatever, and not people who just want to understand what's going on. That's cult-like behavior, something to avoid in droves if you ever see it as an investor. \n\nI could go on, that's what I've seen so far, and I'll probably keep updating this in the future. Result: I'd stay far away from this stock simply because they have nothing for sale for years, which is ridiculous. The CEO acts like a sociopath, and seems to embody the types of traits seen in other sociopaths who were engaging in fraudulent/vaporware products. They're just going to burn through any money that investors have added before delivering anything.\n\nEdit: As mentioned in the comments, Trevor Milton isn't even the CEO any more. That job has been taken up by [Mark Russell](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2020/06/12/nikola-stock-surge-turns-ceo-mark-russell-into-hydrogen-truckmakers-second-billionaire/#2acd467c31d8) who was the former CEO of Worthington Industries, a metal manufacturing company.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Corporation",

        "selftext": "Hello, friends -\n\nIt's me, Fuzzy. Another beautiful day begins in the neighborhood, and what better place to spend it than here, with you poop-flinging retards? I feel like [Jane Goodall](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/cultureexploration/2019/01/jane-goodall-difficult-women/01-jane-goodall-difficult-women.jpg) out here amongst you - a mixture of curiosity, repulsion, and a strange... attraction I can't quite shake that's keeping me around. Side note: she 100% clapped chimp cheeks, right? Boned bonobos? I mean, Fuzzy wouldn't say no to a game of hide the banana with her - if you watch those old specials on the National Geographic Channel (a fixture of Casa de Fuzzy late-night programming) you'll see she's got a body that makes you want to climb it like an orangutan - but facts only, she definitely got misty with a gorilla or two in her day. Or was that [Diane Fossey](https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5cfab85e76711f7c887fe5fd/master/pass/sigourney-weaver-ghostbusters-2020.jpg)? Either way, with apologies to u/pokimane, I'd definitely hit that. ([PS - welcome back Gary Larson!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2mp43svgB1qeoyxwo1_400.jpg))\n\nAnyway, this post is a bit inside baseball, but it's my party and I'll do what I want. Today I am going to give you guys a lesson on one of the under-the-radar impacts that the pandemic-du-pangolin has had on the debt markets. Long-time readers know that I'm always banging on about the impact of the covenant-creep of high-yield style structures into traditional bank financings. It's a fact of life in 2020 that the docs governing most bank debt are a lot looser than they used to be (and it was that way before the virus, too), but unscrupulous borrowers and shitty bank lawyers asleep at the wheel during the pandemic have made it worse. The specter of the money-printer looms large, too - with the implicit support of a government hell-bent on keeping the money markets afloat with synthetic liquidity, people just have more appetite for risk in negotiations than they had 18 months ago (from a documentation standpoint). Anyway, one of the big ticket items on the agenda has been the rebirth of the so-called '*J. Crew*' issue - the ability of companies to send valuable shit out of the credit when things start going sideways, so the lenders can't get at them in an enforcement scenario. This can have a major impact on the creditworthiness and overall value of a corporate group and I've spent the last week having a major fight about it with a few idiots on the other side of a deal, so I figured why not take a break from clowning them and clue you guys in to what it is and why it matters.\n\nIt's been a while, so a reminder for the new readers and slow learners in the audience. I will answer any legitimate question I get asked about the post, no matter how stupid (as long as it is sincere or at least funny). Sometimes it takes me a couple of days but I get around to everybody eventually. I do this because getting flamed by someone who knows what they're talking about is the only way to learn - it's how I learned, and it works. **But remember - I don't give advice for free**. So please don't ask me what to buy (long $POPCORN), if your 95% OTM option is fucked (it is) or for a strike/exp (TSLA $6940C 4/20/21) because I'll just have to repeat that in the comments and you'll look like a big dummy.\n\nOK. Got it? Good. Here is what you are about to read:\n\n1. Subs Aren't Just For Doms: Why Corporate Groups Are More Than Just A Ticker\n2. Investment Covenants: How Companies Spend Their Tendies\n3. *J Crew* And You: Exploiting Loopholes For Fun And Profit\n\nIf you are interested in playing along at home, [here is J. Crew's credit agreement as it then existed](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1051251/000156459014000667/jcg-ex10_201403057.htm), and [here is a copy of the relevant court filings](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=g3bQfywJstNqt/O3VUqiaw==&amp;system=prod).\n\n**TL;DR**? Fuck you. I am large. I contain multitudes. If you can't handle that, that's on you. Bitch about it to your body-pillow. I just don't give a shit.\n\nLet's do this.\n\n1. **Subs Aren't Just For Doms: Why A Corporation Is More Than Just A Ticker**\n\nA long, long time ago on a tweedy, tea-soaked rock in the North Atlantic, some smart young autists with terrible teeth and a colonialism problem decided it would be a fun idea to YOLO their life savings into speculative investments involving the rape and/or pillage of various locations in the South Pacific and Asia. Unfortunately for them, at this time, you could only do this by either (i) commandeering a ship, sailing there, and raping and pillaging to your heart's delight or (ii) asking the monarch for a permission slip to let you do this without being personally liable for the consequences. Fortunately for these hungry young retards, the great and glorious Queen Libby I (she of the clown hair and white face paint) loved this idea. So she created 'chartered corporations' to facilitate these little excursions. See, back in the day, you needed her permission to make a corp. Anyway, 100 years, several hundred million pounds of profit and millions of dead Indians later, the idea had been so successful that the OG East India Companies formed by those retards were worth nearly a trillion dollars of today's money, and everybody else wanted to get in on the idea - so they did away with royal charters and the rest of the world quickly cottoned on to the idea that separating investors from the actions of the companies they bought into was a cool idea. Thus was born the doctrine of the separate legal entity and modern corporations law.\n\nForward-thinking legal eagles like yours truly then figured out that if it was cool to have one corporation separating investors from actions (and, therefore, liability), it would be *even* *cooler* to layer several corporations between them, making it harder to (i) see who actually owned the company and (ii) to take their shit if anything went wrong. So was born the concept of the modern 'corporate group' - companies that created their own subsidiaries, in which they owned 100% of the issued equity, who then created their own subsidiaries, in which they owned 100% of the issued equity, and so on down the ladder. All the profits can be sent straight up - but the liability (generally) stops at the immediate level of the actor. Awesome, right? Having cake and eating it too - if cake disgorged profits instead of carbs.\n\nIn 2020, pretty much every company that's not a Mom &amp; Pop dry cleaning business works this way. Investors on top, 'name' company nearby (either directly underneath or with holding vehicles in-between, and lots and lots of subsidiaries sitting below the name. There are a bunch of tax reasons to structure this way but the liability shield and diversification of revenue streams is generally the key structural consideration.\n\nSo what happens when the name brand company wants to borrow money? Remember from our previous lessons that how much money you can borrow is directly related to the sort of security you can provide to the lenders - \"Look, I can give you this much dollar value in assets as collateral, and prove to you that my corporate group makes this much money over the course of a year\". Some back office nerds at the bank crunch the numbers (like EBITDA - [check out my primer here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1xq3e/cookin_the_books_with_tsla_fuzzys_ebitda_explainer/)), and the computers spit out a number that the business guys fight about and ultimately gets settled, and hey presto, you've got a brand spanking new billion dollar term loan. Easy so far, right?\n\nHere's where it gets a little tricky. Not every subsidiary is treated the same way in calculating these numbers - because not every subsidiary is necessarily included in the credit support as a guarantor, pledgor, whatever you want to call them. Some get excluded because they're offshore and including them would have adverse tax consequences. Some get excluded because they have complicated ownership structures. Some get excluded because they're just not doing anything - shell corporations parked at some PO box in the Caribbean waiting for a purpose don't have much to contribute to the revenue calcs of the broader group. The distinction here is between what we call '**Restricted Subsidiaries**' - companies who are subject to the various rules and regulations of the credit docs (e.g., can't buy shit, can't borrow shit, can't spend money) - and '**Unrestricted Subsidiaries**' - companies who can do whatever they want because they're 'outside' of the credit, even though they're owned by companies who are inside the credit. The borrower can typically designate (and re-designate) subsidiaries as 'Restricted' or 'Unrestricted' by jumping through a few hoops - most commonly showing that an unrestricted subsidiary being designated restricted would otherwise be in compliance with the debt and liens covenants applicable to restricted subsidiaries. You might want to do this for a variety of reasons but normally its because sometimes there are rules about how you can move shit around inside your credit group; typically you can only move money and assets to companies that are subject to the rules the banks have agreed to ahead of time (not those sneaky unrestricted subs sitting off there away from where the banks can get at them). You can check out the definitions in the J. Crew credit agreement by ctrl+fing \"Restricted Subsidiary\" or \"Unrestricted Subsidiary\".\n\nAnyway, the punchline is that when you look at, say, $TSLA, there's a lot more under the hood than a ticker, a substandard engine and snuff pics of Elon getting pegged by Grimes. You're actually talking about hundreds of subs spread across a wide range of jurisdictions - the ticker is just the tip of the corporate iceberg.\n\n2. **Investment Covenants: How Companies Spend Their Tendies**\n\nAs you may know from my previous posts, [credit agreements have a lot of rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fopuyx/daddy_where_does_money_come_from_birds_bees_long/). They mainly dictate what the borrower and guarantors can and can't do -  can't change shit about the company **except for shit that doesn't matter**, can't sell your shit without telling the banks **except for shit that's really cheap**, can't buy stuff **except for stuff you need**, etc. The big one for our purposes is called the Investments covenant.\n\nI know, I know. It's a word you recognize. Hooray! But slow down, little autist. In credit agreement land, 'Investment' doesn't mean 'investment'. It means whatever the definition in the document says it means. It's not what you use Robinhood for. Here, it means any 'loan, advance, or capital contribution to... another person'. If you want the unfiltered version, ctrl+f \"Investment\" in the J Crew credit agreement to see what I'm talking about. This formulation is broad enough that you can read it to encompass pretty much any transfer of assets you can think of to a subsidiary, so this little doohickey is how companies move money and other shit around their corporate group. Typically, you get a dedicated 'basket' in the negative covenants that allows you to make 'Investments' in subsidiaries up to a certain dollar figure.\n\n3. ***J Crew*** **And You: Exploiting Loopholes For Fun And Profit**\n\nSo, in 2016,  J. Crew was in bad shape. The company was at risk of going under. It was subject to a pretty strict credit agreement that severely limited its ability to incur new debt or repurpose its existing debt. The board was stressed that the company would default under the credit agreement and the lenders would come in and take their shit, limiting the ability of the company to bounce back after filing for bankruptcy. So, they decided to take a very risky gamble - what if they could manage to get the most valuable collateral out of the reach of the lenders? If shit gets moved out of a corporate group, generally there is a trigger that releases whatever liens the lenders have on it, so if they could pull it off, they would be home free.\n\nRemember, credit agreements are **expressly designed to prevent you from doing this**. Why would I lend you a billion dollars on the back of certain collateral if I knew there was a risk you could throw that shit out the window the minute I signed on the dotted line? So this was a ballsy move. Banks would be **pissed.** Here's how it went down.\n\nThe most valuable shit that J. Crew owned was not, surprisingly, shitty chinos and ill-fitting polo shirts. It was intellectual property. So that was what they needed to move.  Section 7.02(t) of the credit agreement allowed investments by non-loan party restricted subsidiaries in any other person (including in an unrestricted subsidiary) if the investment was initially \u201cfinanced with the proceeds\u201d of certain other permitted Investments. Here, these other permitted investments included the intercompany basket that allowed investments by loan parties in non-loan party restricted subsidiaries up to the greater of $150 million and 4% of total assets. In English, this meant that J. Crew could send shit out the door untouched by routing it through another restricted sub before posting it to the unrestricted subsidiary - 'laundering' the IP.  All it had to do was transfer the value of the IP to a non-guarantor restricted subsidiary prior to moving the IP to an unrestricted subsidiary and it had capacity to move collateral out of the group (up to the limit of the applicable basket). Now, this was **not** how things were intended to work - it was a loophole, and the smarties on the borrower side both spotted it and had the stones to try and drive $500 million worth of IP through it. Hats off to them.\n\nStill with me? This was a **big problem** for the J Crew lenders. And they kicked up a huge stink. So J Crew turned it up a notch and filed for a declatory judgment that what they did was legal. Ultimately the case was settled out of court and the credit agreement was amended to allow the transaction retroactively... which basically was the lenders admitting that J. Crew was right in their interpretations of the documents. So. The market quickly pivoted to prevent this happening by putting a hard cap on how much value could be transferred out of the credit to unrestricted subsidiaries - often called the 'J. Crew blocker'. This is in most credit agreements signed between 2016 and 2019.\n\nThe bat-flu, though, has encouraged borrowers to start fighting this -  as distressed issuers look for ways to address their liquidity concerns and/or reorganized and optimize their capital structures. By my count there are at least five instances in the last three months of either proposed or consummated J. Crew moves. L Brands, Cirque du Soleil, DSG, Maclaren, and GAP are all on my personal shit list for this, but there are more in the pipeline.\n\nThe impact of pulling a J Crew on the value of the equity can be significant, as it is essentially (i) showing the market that you think the name brand of the equity is in financial difficulties (ii) moving value out of the core brands and (iii) damaging the creditworthiness of the business in the eyes of the market.\n\nAnyway. Here ends the lesson. This is something that is being actively negotiated across the market as many companies adjust to the new normal of precarious relationships with their financiers. Whether or not the market goes up or down is increasingly divorced from the true financial position of companies, but debt never lies and is - as my long time readers know - the best way to understanding the 'real' health of a company and how it is positioning itself for the future.\n\nBless up.\n\nFuzzy",

        "selftext": "All- I have received hundreds of DM asking where the stock is going. I have received  questions such as: where do you think it stops, is it over valued, undervalued, should my mom invest, should i Yolo, should i sell and take profits?  blah, blah blah.  Here is some DD- stop asking me about where this ends up because I don't know for sure but I have some Feely Good estimates. I hope this post makes your nipples hard and if it doesn't you're probably a gay bear.\n\nI am going to give you a quick run down of what my expectations are for Q2 earnings and it will include the good, the bad and the ugly. The ugly being the warrant accrual that will hurt GAAP.\n\nFirst of all, There is little that needs to be determined for Q2 top-line as they have already released April and May Sales. April Sales Came in around \\~62M based on my math and May Sales came in at 88M and some change. Based on these numbers, we can safely assume that we will at a minimum have somewhere around 225M in revenue for the quarter by using the average of April and May to determine June. I believe 225M to be on the low side and I have continued to up my estimates as I believe E-commerce is still thriving, especially purple. Purple continues to climb the web traffic ladder and has moved up another \\~500 spots to be the 13,000 most popular site in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor simplicity sake, I am going to use some historical numbers to estimate profits. If you'll look at previous posts that I've made then you'll see how I arrived at these numbers. There are some quick napkin calculations below. We can safely assume that the average wholesale selling price of a mattress is \\~1350 dollars and we can assume that GM for wholesale is around 30%. This means the average cost of a mattress to manufacture is \\~945 on average. From my previous posts, we knew that pre Covid the business was split by units, not by gross sales. On average, wholesale consumed 50% of capacity and DTC consumed 50% of capacity. In order to determine average DTC selling price then we can equation **.5\\*1350 + .5\\*(DTC Price) = 1900**. PRPL indicated their average selling price per mattress was \\~1900.00, I found this in their s-3.\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\n.5\\*1350 + .5\\*(DTC Price) = 1900=========== **DTC average price is 2450.00, 1350 is average Wholesale price.**\n\nDTC Margin is **\\~62% Estimated**\n\nWholesale Margin **\\~30% Estimated**\n\n\\----------------------------------\n\nHistorically, advertising costs have been about 30% of revenue.  I have been tracking advertisement for purple and from a TV cost standpoint, they have not increased their commercial count at all in the last three months. See link, PRPL is still only performing 125 commercials per day. This commercial rate has held steady for 6 months.\n\n[https://www.ispot.tv/brands/tqU/purple-mattress](https://www.ispot.tv/brands/tqU/purple-mattress)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe purple has increased their ad spend online but I believe it will be proportional to their new capacity on a unit basis.\n\nPreviously purple had 6 Machines of capacity and spent 38M in advertising, I believe they will spend (7/6)\\*38M which is 44M or roughly **15M per month. Just because revenue is up, doesn't mean they will spend more per unit- they are capacity constrained and that is terribly inefficient.**\n\n\\----------------------------------\n\n**The following table shows my best guesses on their major category costs. This includes the gross Margin and the other costs subtracted from the Gross Margin.**\n\n||April|May|June (Est)|Total Revenue net revenue effect|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Gross Margin from Wholesale|6M\\*30%|17.3\\*30%|20M\\*30%|$**13M**|\n|Gross Margin from DTC|56M\\*62%|71M\\*62%|55M\\*62%|$**112M**|\n|SG&amp;A Costs|(3.5)M|(3.5)M|(3.5)M|**($10.5)M**|\n|Research and Development|(1)M|(1)M|(1)M|**($3)M**|\n|Advertising|(15)M|(15)M|(15)M|**($45)M**|\n|Profit Non GAAP|\\-----------|\\-----------|\\---------|***66.5M or 1.23 EPS***|\n|Warrant Accrual||||**($35M)**|\n|**Profit GAAP Estimated**||||**$31.5M or .59 EPS**|\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf we used 66.5M, PRPL would report 1.23 EPS on an adjusted Basis.\n\nThe warrant Accrual will unfavorably push the EPS down on a GAAP basis and we will likely see something around .59 EPS. If they can achieve this for the next 4 quarters then in a years time there is a huge potential for stock increases based on the following P/E's.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||GAAP est.|Non GAAP Est.|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**EPS Annualized**|**$2.36**|**$4.92**|\n|Stock price assuming 8x P/E|$18.88|$39.36|\n|Stock Price assuming 12x P/E|$28.32|$59.04|\n|Stock Price assuming 15x P/E|$35.4|$73.8|\n|Stock Price assuming 20x P/E|$47.2|$98.4|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople may say that this is super inaccurate..... but if you look at the following cash statement then you will realize that PRPL has been generating more than 1M per day in cash for the last two months - that is absolutely insane.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[purple has generated 70M in cash in 60 days.](https://preview.redd.it/tgcjjyf2o3e51.jpg?width=1246&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb9d8d8e7fecae86e7e19b6a35b190d6b3ce23ba)\n\nMark my words, PRPL is going to be more profitable than TPX this quarter. TPX reported earnings of .68 EPS today on revenue of 665M. TPX is trading at 80+ per share. if purple reports a similar .68 EPS then it would be valued about 60% lower than TPX on an EPS basis. if purple posts EPS of \\~1 dollar then it would be undervalued as compared to TPX by about 80%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope your NIPS are tender now. Hope this helps you understand why I believe PRPL to be so undervalued.",

        "selftext": "I know Papa Elon is in here and he will give everyone gold itt.\n\nWhat a fucking amazing TSLA rally this week. Elon is sending astronauts to space, the moon, Mars, AND retard's portfolios along with it. I bet against TSLA back in May and Elon whooped my ass for it. Never again did I touched TSLA... until now.  \n\n\nSince Tuesday and Wednesday, I was in and out of TSLA when it was around $1000. After realizing the potential upside of the delivery number's momentum and the pure koolaid power behind TSLA investors, I made the yolos of all yolos, around \\~800k on TSLA 7/2s.  \n\n\nI had 1100 7/2s that I paper handed which would've been 1000% gains but that's in the past. Yesterday at close, I was -20% on these because I bought high during the chase. I decided it's either going to be $0 or 1m and left my fate in Elon's hands.  \n\n\nBetted on 2 things:  \n1. SPY gaps up due to good unemployment numbers and because America wasn't gonna end the week red on the most patriotic weekend. TSLA gaps up with SPY.  \n\n\n2. I saw 1200 7/2s in the flow and gauged the market sentiment on StockTwits (gotta figure out what all the rest of the retards are doing).   \n\n\nThese 1200s were getting hit throughout the day all the way until closing for 50k - 200k amounts. I was already all in on my current positions so I didn't jump in these but out of all the flow, these stood out to me and I kept seeing comments about open at 1200, gonna be 1250 EOD...   \n\n\nWoke up this morning and SPY was $315, TSLA $1200. Jumped outta bed and took a cold shower to get this wonderful day started...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfo8gwvwhi851.png?width=625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0730a5cc3d2b09e8ba8f5f6c6d597b441b26658a\n\n  \nRH position, 310k on 1150 7/2. Netted 1.1m - 356% gains. I closed these out at the near top at $74/contract. Cost was $14.67/contract.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TSLA 1150c 7\\/2 +356&amp;#37; - 1.1m profit](https://preview.redd.it/363l24m3hi851.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88a9d5202537755d5a75c75b9e7711d165becb04)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy 3 month RH chart. This chart tells the story of pure autism, persistence, and yolos. I started this game on 4/20 and got my first big gains on 5/1 with DFS puts. Right after that, I chased TSLA puts on the same day and took a -150k loss.  \n\n\nConstant ups and downs 4 times back and forth. DIS calls got me back up again only for the mouse to take it all back the next day. Then I moved on to BABA for ER only to get fucked by CHYNAH, not once, not twice, but THREE times.\n\nAt the very bottom, I was -700k in the hole (-72%)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5mdgnpshii851.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e51cffa239edeff7091b7090c8e19adcf1179aab\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTOS account. Last 500k all in.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vg9qazgyji851.png?width=994&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9378ee407f56bf1f35dd59fb6d1aa53932d4784d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all, I went from all time lows of -1.7m to now +1.1m. I'm taking this 3 day weekend to journal all my past trades and reanalyze my process/risks. Papa Elon gave me a second chance and I'm gonna take a break... until MONDAY.  \nLessons learned? I've truly learned nothing valuable in terms of fundamentals. The losses and wins have taught me more about trader mindset and keeping myself in check after a huge loss and to fucking keep going back for more.   \n\n\nI've had FB weeklies of $250k expired, I've had calls I held that were -99% and came back from the dead, only to get greedy and lose it the next day. It's hard to explain but you get tunnel vision and your mind just goes blank when shit like this happens.   \n\n\nAlot of you will give me hate for playing recklessly with amounts of money like this and it's understandable. Everyone in here is going through their daily trading days on their own, refining their process, their mindset, and dealing with their losses and wins in their own ways.   \n\n\nMy perspective was really simple. I was ready to lose it all and already accepted that end of day yesterday. But I was ready to take the loss, regroup, and get back in after I pick myself back up. I've already done that 4 times in the past 2 months.  \n\n\nThe MAIN taking point of all my wins and losses for me was to TRUST MY GUT more and stay CONVICTED.  \n\n\n**Notable positions that had I held and stuck with would've been big gains.**  \n1. SPG 65c 7/17 - Had 100k in this and closed to break even, a few days later they were up 1000%. The play was on mall recovery, reopening.  \n2. FB 220 7/2, FB 230 7/2, FB 240 7/2 - Bought last Friday and opening Monday. Got too impatient and closed it for loss. FB rallied huge yesterday. The play was FB was oversold from ads boycotting and will rally back up.\n\n3. SHOP 800c 7/17 - 100k in, sold for 30k profit the next day. The play was SHOP is pure retard strength and every mom and pop retailer is on e-commerce. (I use SHOP for my e-commerce biz)  \n\n\nThe key lesson in these 3 were that I had the right idea but no follow up plan.   \n\n\n  \n**My advice to you retards:**  \n\n\nNEVER. GIVE. UP.   \n\\- If you are down big, step away and regroup.  \n\\- Analyze what went wrong and what went right.  \n\\- Build a checklist for your process to keep you on the right path.  \n**- IF IT IS GOOD ENOUGH TO SCREENSHOT. IT IS GOOD ENOUGH TO LOCK IN GAINS.**  \n\n\nHave a good 4th of July weekend all, cya Monday!  \n\n\ntldr: I'm retarded and Papa Musk saved me from -1.7m to +1.1m. Just placed 2 orders for Tesla X + Cyber truck.  \n\n\n**SEC can suck Elon's CAWK.**  \n**IRS, fuck you too!**",

        "selftext": "I'm going to do all you retards and wanna be autists a real solid and save you/make you tendies! Scroll down half way if you just want to know why its down 10% because you're all impatient sh\\*ts.  \n\n\nOPKO reported these numbers today:\n\nQ2 GAAP EPS of $0.05 beats by **$0.13.**\n\nRevenue of $301.2M (+33.0% Y/Y) beats by **$71.72M.**\n\nThe EPS beat of $0.05 is VERY bullish and here's why. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvcl5azag4e51.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03d8d703aae4a1dad5b1973fa3a3d7ed3c505202\n\nOPK was not expected to be profitable until the back half of 2021. The fact that they are now profitable in Q2 and beat by $0.13 is BIG. Obviously a 33% topline is crushing it. I'm not even going to talk about how they produce the fastest results within 72 hours or all the major sports contracts they landed because if you don't know about that and asking \"WTF is happening?\" you deserve to lose your tendies. But what you probably did not know were all the contracts they landed with schools, universities, and the CDC. Here's the CEO word for word:\n\n***\"In addition, we have contracted with several colleges and universities to provide testing of students as they return to school this fall. Recently, the CDC awarded BioReference an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract to provide antibody testing, to determine COVID-19 seroprevalence across the country. We will provide results with key demographic information and analysis in collaboration with the CDC for the next four months.\"***\n\n**\"During the second quarter, we agreed to divert significant resources for nursing home employees due to the crisis in New York.\"**\n\nWhy would you need to divert resources if they weren't operating at max capacity already? You're obviously getting WAY more orders than you can meet. Oh and guess what? They're **DOUBLING** their testing capacity. You autists heard me, **DOUBLE.** That $0.05 EPS profit, will easily repeat in Q3 earnings. Oh what else? They are currently using tests from other companies but have developed their own testing kits that is awaiting FDA approval to further cut costs. Even you can figure out what that means for profits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that the DD is out of the way, **WHY IS IT DOWN 10% AH?!?!**\n\n**1st - Look at OI and Volume on their call options**\n\n[That's a shit ton of calls @ $5 - $7](https://preview.redd.it/hkld5ozpi4e51.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7036d63930a3f9f85f130b974fd387fc950d27fe)\n\nMM would have to pay out a WHOLE lot if this stock went to $8, which it should've easily. They have incentives to keep prices pinned at $6. This is EXACTLY what they did last week for expirations but no one gives two shits because there were no earnings.\n\n**2nd - Check out the spike in short volume ratio**\n\n[50&amp;#37; short interest on earnings day!](https://preview.redd.it/242mihicj4e51.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d08922cea553122890e6272de53e46a4d2193c7)\n\nThe short volume ratio was at its highest of 50% of all volume. The current short interest float is \\~34% as of 7/15. Shorts have a HUGE incentive to manipulate prices down so they can cover their asses when all you retards panic sell which half of you all did already. If you were watching price action, prices initial rose &gt; $6 and gained close to 4% before plummeting to sub-$5s and all these tweets and posts popped up asking WHY!??!\n\n**3rd - AFTER HOUR IS LOW VOLUME! EASY TO MANIPULATE A $6 STOCK**\n\n[Afterhour volume is at 800K vs 32MM 10 day average](https://preview.redd.it/5oaen2mfk4e51.png?width=1134&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=335a46cb46a687e526025f5dfab7abed7173731c)\n\nThat spike down was only 800K volume, a fraction of the daily 32M 10 day average volume. What does this mean? There is a 40% short interest float on a stock that clearly beat with strong guidance and high profitability. This is **EASILY** a $10 stock. You bet your autist ass that this is going to get SQUEEZED SO HARD to a minimum of $10 at open. If this opens below $6 and you still haven't bought more, you're truly an autist and godspeed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR; OPK subjected to market manipulation. Short squeeze imminent at open tomorrow. Buy if under $6.5 for squeeze to $10.**\n\nPS. I haven't really posted much on reddit but thought I'd be the saviour to your tendies. Share and enjoy!",

You might actually end up making money, which is WAY better than having the sort of life long self worth having a loving and present father would have given you.\n\n\nThis post is going to be so fucking basic for you newfucks that we've got about T-minus 5 fucking seconds until some dude named Eggbert jumps on my dick about Laffer curves and tries to steal your fucking money by confusing you all his brain wrinkles.  Don't let him.\n\nThis shit isn't hard newfucks.  You don't need to be taken by surprise every time.  You don't need to get fucked on days like today. You don't need an degree.  You need three basic things.\n\n1. A CHART OF THE MOTHERFUCKING STONK IN QUESTION\n\n2. A WAY TO DRAW A LINE ON THAT CHART IN SOME MOTHERFUCKING WAY.  You can smear it with your shit, you can use a ruler. I don't care.  If you can draw a line, you can do this and not get fucked. I use TOS, which is way, way too hard for most of you to use at this point in your \"career\".  But have at it if you want to.\n\n3. THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THAT ONCE YOU HAVE PURCHASED AN OPTION, YOU CAN STOP THE PAIN OR PLEASURE AT ANY TIME BY CONVERTING IT INTO A SPREAD.  More on this in a minute.\n\nAlright, my smoothbrained beauties.  You're still here. There is hope for you yet.\n\nTHIS, MOTHERFUCKERS, IS A CHART OF APPLE THIS MORNING.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/IHIykMX.png\n\nLook at it, it goes up and down.  Like your mom. Does she still have those cute dimples on her ass?  Maybe you're in a call on this stonk, like me, from the day before and you wake up feeling pretty fucking alright about your profits.  BUT STONKS SOMETIMES GO DOWN.  So here is what you need to do to know if that's going to happen.\n\nTake a line, and draw it between the low points on the chart, like this. (Jesus Christ I'm already tired of typing, why am I doing this.)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/X9RazHI.png\n\nLOOK AT THAT YOU SUPERCHROMOSOMAL DICKFUCKS!  It is a trend.  The lows are less low every time.  And the stock seems to bounce away from the trend line every time.  It will keep doing this, forever, because of thermodynamics or some shit until something external changes.\n\nThen, at the end of the line.  Something changes.  The low at the very end of the line is LOWER than the trend. \n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/dVY6YDu.png\n\n Now it's time to really pay attention Your tendies are might be close to done cooking.\n\nAnd what do you know, we IMMEDIATELY we get a new trend. (Holy fuck, I need a drink, how am I still typing)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EDoly8O.png\n\nNow, if you're like me, and want to take profits wherever you can, this break from GOING UP to DOING SOMETHING THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN GOING UP is where you sell.  I watched the candles go downsies, waited for them to turn around and go upsies one more time, and sold at 398.75.\n\n\nLOOK AT THIS, WE ARE NOW FLAT FOR A WHILE.\n\nTwo things that could happen here.  \n\n1. We could start to go higher.\n\n2. We could also not start to go higher.\n\nIn this case, we went with number two.  Stonk did not always go up.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/08bOBeX.png\n\nAs you can see, a downtrend started at 9:41am my time.\n\nAt which point I posted this.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/a9OlP5y.png\n\nAnd a pure fucking genius posted immediately after.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rttrKUU.png\n\nWho was right?  The chad 'tard, or the dude with the POWER OF CRAYONS?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9AI5ksD.png\n\nOk, so now you have a very, very dim view of when a stock has changed from doing one thing, to doing something different.  It gets far more complicated, but this is a good start.\n\n\"BUT DAD!\" I hear your voice say.  I'm up and I did the thing and now I think it might go down, but I'm OUT OF DAY TRADES.\n\nCome here, you little shit.\n\nCloser.\n\ncloser.\n\n##SELL A MOTHERFUCKING CALL, DIPSHIT!\n\nGo to robinhood. Find your fucking option. and\n\n##SELL THE STRIKE RIGHT ABOVE IT ON THE SAME DATE\n\nWhat if you're one of my gay sons?\n\n##SELL THE PUT RIGHT BELOW IT ON THE SAME DATE\n\nI went to the fucking trouble, I don't know why I bother, of actually doing this today to illustrate it for you tards.  Here is what it looks like.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/K3fVuhB.png\n\nNow, MY GAINS ARE LOCKED IN. AND I DIDN'T DO A DAY TRADE.\n\nThere you go, my boys.  That's what I've got.\n\nIf you're up more than 80% in a month, come find me.  I'll teach you how to work on a muscle car, we can get into a fist fight and patch things up.

They will redefine \"stable\" from their previous definition of 2% depreciation every year, to 0% inflation.  Stable.\n\n- China will realize they love Treasuries again.  Diverging from their recent rhetoric, they will buy all of what little debt the U.S. decides to issue in this new age of fiscal responsibility.\n\n- The COMEX will release a full audit of its vaults, proving the open interest of all metals is backed 1:1 with physical metal.\n\n- The U.S. will audit its gold reserves in full for the first time since 1953, with 2 independent auditors who will find that the U.S. does indeed have all 8,000 tons they claim to have.

        "selftext": "The year is 2020 and JPOW\u2019s nightmare is coming true. The on/off switch on his printer is malfunctioning and it\u2019s currently spitting out fat stacks faster than he can count them. \n\nHe and the rest of the finance world has no idea where to put all these dollars so they somehow start seeping into stocks. \n\n\u201cHmm, that\u2019s strange, we\u2019re in the single worst economic crisis that has ever occurred and stocks are at all time highs. Must be a shift in outlook; I\u2019ll buy more!\u201d Says the \u2018professional\u2019 wall street analyst, wiping drool from the corner of his mouth as he hits the giant green \u201cbuy\u201d button on the robinhood commercial user interface. He later updates his tesla price target to $2,000 based on the aftermarket movements today. \n\nBut JPOW knows what\u2019s going on. This is the start of inflation. Soon enough he knows that he\u2019ll have to raise interest rates. Images of December 2018 flash through his mind. Trumps angry words ring through his ears. Eventually he will have to practice some tightening and stock prices will collapse with any hint of rising interest rates or slowing printers. That\u2019s why, even though stocks are being inflated now, they aren\u2019t a safe place for your money since they will crash once the fed starts trying to out out the inflation fire. \n\nSo the inflation is confined to the stock market right now but soon enough if you keep printing money it\u2019ll leak out into Main Street and real people will begin to see real inflation not just in assets but in normal consumer goods too. \n\nHow I plan to beat this? But as many real physical goods on as much leverage as I can. I am eyeing buying Multiple new properties with debt right now, I just bought a new cars, and, of course, lots of guns and ammo. Worst case scenario, I\u2019m in debt up to my eyeballs just like every other American living the dream. But if real inflation actually hits the real economy I now have real assets With debt that suddenly became much less expensive to service. And these real assets have inherent value. They aren\u2019t worthless slips of paper giving me the right to the earnings of some zombie company. They aren\u2019t metal rocks that have no functional value except to ~~pedophiles~~ libertarians. They are real things that I can use and that other people will be able to use and they therefore have intrinsic value regardless of their price in Monopoly money. \n\nI\u2019m a faggot, and these are my delights.\n\nEdit: for the people giving me shit about the cars thing: Imagine if you could buy a car for $1,000 1970 dollars and pay it off with 2020 dollars. Wouldn\u2019t you do it everytime even though it\u2019s a depreciating asset? It\u2019s a useful tool that\u2019ll last you 1-2 decades that you can get for essentially free if you could manage to buy it right before hyperinflation hits.",

I know what you're thinking... ha ha ha, EBAY, what a garbage company. No. This is why you're poor.\n\nEBAY is currently mooning harder than a hollywood film lot in 1969. Why is that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* It's an affordable alternative to Amazon, AliBaba, Shopify, and every other eCommerce site out there. Those other sites are currently priced in the hundred or even thousands. At the time of this writing EBAY is sitting at $56.00. If you missed the boat on those other plays, this is your last chance to avoid swimming in Trump's swamp.\n* They sold StubHub earlier in the year and are flush with cash, which they've been using to strengthen their core business\n* They recently settled a dispute with **Starboard Value** an activist investor hedge fund that currently sits on their board.\n* They brought on an outside CEO-Jamie Iannone former COO of fucking Walmart. This dude is an expert at personalizing the eCommerce experience and retaining customers of which EBAY recently got a LOT\n* As above, they've gotten a LOT of new customers thanks to the pandemic. Everyone who got laid off and didn't get their bailout checks is selling their shit. Everyone who DID get their check is buying. People are only going to sell MORE shit if there's no stimulus and the economy tanks.\n* The stock popped July 1st on the RUMOR that they are selling their classifieds division for $8 BILLION (Dr. Evil pinky finger). If this happens bam, instant upsized-tendies.\n* Analysts believe in this shit too. EBAY is a Zack's #1 Strong Buy.\n\nTL;DR EBAY cheap eCommerce. eCommerce to moon.

Cutting a long story short and this does make me cringe a little saying this I am a full time 'trader' of sorts. I am not a day trader I swing trade tech stocks and invest heavily in renewable energy, the implementation of 5G automation electric/self driveing cars, bio tech. That's my thing. I would like to say my portfolio was built on blood sweat and tiers but I would be lieing, I rid the bitcoin bull from 2014 in a massive way. Then got lucky again investing in tech mainly Amazon and telsa the last week few months have been mega! \n\nSo getting to my point now I am 25, i have a top end car range rover over finch, my apartment Is paid for I have around 11k a month coming in from swing trades and property rentals. But all I seem to find my self doing is drinking! I wake up walk to the local post office buy all the main papers, the times financial times and newyork post. I will scan though thease for at least 2 hours ( I think you can get ahead on swing trades on hand fulls of information in the columns) then I spend a an hour on reddit. Then by 2 o'clock I am usually in the pub watching price action on my phone checking my fill orders and sell orders. I feel like I just know the market and what's cheap and what's over bought 6 times out of 10 I tend to be right I play with tight stops and dont just hover over one stock all day! (Sorry about the poor spelling and grammar I am not really focusing to much busy checking stocks) so like I said I can be in the pub at 2 I will guzzle around 4 pint go home check reddit market news. Then I seem to sleep thats my life. \n\nEvery one thinks I am a drug dealer even family I cannit bare to tell anyone one what I do for a living it makes me feel uncomfortable. Then you do tell people you always feel that somone has to one up with you or your talking to the future warren buffet that no idea how the world of investing, finance or even how the stock market works. \n\nI dont know what this post was ment to be maybe a rant, maybe just me talking to my self does any one els feel the same way.",

There is an Executive Order from the White House to remove all foreign adversary telecom equipment from our utilities and power grid due to risk of cyber attacks. This puts Globalstar in a great position as they recently pushed out their new ST-100 product AND bought 5G spectrum (band n53) to be used in utilities applications (which they showed off at a conference this month with Nokia. They are partnered with Jeep and have an upcoming earnings report for Q2. Insiders own 64% of shares and have been loading up according to SEC filings. The future seems very bright for this one and I\u2019m hoping we caught it early. Possible medium term play too if you want hold.",

So I\u2019ll say this again as I did in March. BUY SILVER CALLS LITERALLY ANY AT THIS POINT WILL DO IT. \n\nWe all know that some type of large stimulus WILL be passed, and as long as inflation is a risk silver will continue to rise.

        "selftext": "I've been reading Ray Dalio's new online book and today new chapter came out: \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-cycle-united-states-dollar-part-2-ray-dalio I think it is the best one so far and has a lot of very interesting information in it. I would also strongly recommend reading all previous chapters as well. \n\nBelow are few excerpts from this chapter. This chapter was not really about how do you invest but I thought below are very relevant to what we go through now.\n\n&gt; I remember the devaluation of the dollar very well.\u00a0 I was clerking on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the time.\u00a0 I was watching on TV as President Nixon told the world that the dollar would no longer be tied to gold.\u00a0 I thought, \u201cOh my God, the monetary system as we know it is ending,\u201d and it was.\u00a0 The next day was Monday.\u00a0 When I got to work I expected there to be pandemonium, with stocks falling.\u00a0 There was pandemonium all right, but stocks were rising.\n\n&gt; Then I looked into history and found that on the evening of March 5, 1933, also a Sunday, President Franklin Roosevelt had given essentially the same speech, doing essentially the same thing, which yielded essentially the same result over the following months (a devaluation, a big stock market rally, and big gains in the gold price).\u00a0 \n\n&gt; As I looked further, I saw that it had happened many times before in many countries for the same reason\u2014too much debt that needed money to ease the debt burden\u2014with essentially the same proclamations by top government officials.\u00a0 More recent cases that you might remember include the Fed announcing QE on November 25, 2008\n\n&gt; As a result of going off the gold-linked monetary system that constrained money and credit growth, there was a massive acceleration of money and credit, inflation, oil and commodity prices\n\n&gt; I also learned that the value of assets is the reciprocal of the value of money and credit (i.e., the cheaper money and credit are, the more expensive asset prices are) and the value of money is the reciprocal of the quantity of it in existence, so when central banks are producing a lot of money and credit and making it cheaper, it is wise to be more aggressive in owning assets.\n\n### Where the US Is in Its Big Cycle\n\n&gt; As previously explained the Big Cycle of rising and declining empires and their reserve currencies is a cycle that begins with a new world order that comes after a war in which a) there is an environment of peace, prosperity, and productivity in which debt growth is allocated well and sustainably (i.e., most debts are used productively to produce incomes that are greater than debt service so most debts are paid back), equities do well, and the society gets rich with individuals benefiting from the prosperity, though they benefit disproportionately, which eventually leads to b) excessive debt growth to finance speculation and over-consumption, which results in incomes being inadequate to service the debt, which leads to c) central banks lowering interest rates and providing more credit, which produces greater wealth gaps and more over-indebtedness, until d) over-indebtedness becomes so large and central banks lose their ability to create credit growth that produces self-funding debt growth (i.e., in which debts don\u2019t accelerate relative to the incomes needed to service them without central bank subsidies), which e) produces severe economic downturns with large wealth gaps that lead to internal conflict and leads to f) lots of printing of money, big debt restructurings, and big wealth distributions via tax changes g) that create financial, economic, and political vulnerabilities for the leading power relative to emerging powers that lead to wars that define the winners and losers and produce the new world order. The stats seem to suggest that the US is roughly 75% through that cycle, +/- 10%. \n\n&gt; Most world powers that experience this cycle have their \u201ctime in the sun,\u201d which is brought about by the uniqueness of their circumstances and the nature of their character and culture (i.e., they have to have the essential elements to work hard and smart, be disciplined, become educated, etc.) and have their decline phases continue through them slipping into relative obscurity.\u00a0 Some do this decline traumatically, and some do it gracefully.\n\nIn few months he should release next chapter about future macro outlook and I can't wait. Again, if you are interested in macro analysis or even investing in general I highly recommend his books.",

They have been funded by govt grants 2x in the 10's of millions for 2 anti-viral therapies and have exclusive worldwide patent rights on their drugs...\n\nWhat do they do? They try to specifically create drugs for administration via the oral route of which 2 are anti-viral medications and 1 is on the market and the other is in clinical trials testing against yellow fever and COVID in Brazil but has already completed P1 trials for other virus studies with good results.\n\nThey have a NDA pending on a medication which reduces random swelling/inflammatory attacks (HAE) which randomly kills people. They also created an anti-viral drug and got EUA during the swine flu epidemic in the USA back in 2009. The 2 drugs I just listed should bump the price/share to $20 while they're currently trading at 5/share.\n\nNow here's the real kicker.... They have a Braod spectrum Anti-viral which works against 20 different virus families/types in the lab and looks to have stronger promise towards targeting Covid than Remdesivir (yea the mediocre anti-viral all over the MSM/news)... Check these links out for the info... recent news which is just more **Proof BCRX's drug is working as an effective anti-viral in the closest animal model to humans...

        "selftext": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Richard Dobatse, a Navy medic in San Diego, dabbled infrequently in stock trading. But his behavior changed in 2017 when he signed up for Robinhood, a trading app that made buying and selling stocks simple and seemingly free.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Dobatse, now 32, said he had been charmed by Robinhood\u2019s one-click trading, easy access to complex investment products, and features like falling confetti and emoji-filled phone notifications that made it feel like a game. After funding his account with $15,000 in credit card advances, he began spending more time on the app.\n&gt; \n&gt; As he repeatedly lost money, Mr. Dobatse took out two $30,000 home equity loans so he could buy and sell more speculative stocks and options, hoping to pay off his debts. His account value shot above $1 million this year \u2014 but almost all of that recently disappeared. This week, his balance was $6,956.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWhen he is doing his trading, he won\u2019t want to eat,\u201d said his wife, Tashika Dobatse, with whom he has three children. \u201cHe would have nightmares.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Millions of young Americans have begun investing in recent years through Robinhood, which was founded in 2013 with a sales pitch of no trading fees or account minimums. The ease of trading has turned it into a cultural phenomenon and a Silicon Valley darling, with the start-up climbing to an $8.3 billion valuation. It has been one of the tech industry\u2019s biggest growth stories in the recent market turmoil.\n&gt; \n&gt; But at least part of Robinhood\u2019s success appears to have been built on a Silicon Valley playbook of behavioral nudges and push notifications, which has drawn inexperienced investors into the riskiest trading, according to an analysis of industry data and legal filings, as well as interviews with nine current and former Robinhood employees and more than a dozen customers. And the more that customers engaged in such behavior, the better it was for the company, the data shows.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for reading The Times.\n&gt; Subscribe to The Times\n&gt; More than at any other retail brokerage firm, Robinhood\u2019s users trade the riskiest products and at the fastest pace, according to an analysis of new filings from nine brokerage firms by the research firm Alphacution for The New York Times.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the first three months of 2020, Robinhood users traded nine times as many shares as E-Trade customers, and 40 times as many shares as Charles Schwab customers, per dollar in the average customer account in the most recent quarter. They also bought and sold 88 times as many risky options contracts as Schwab customers, relative to the average account size, according to the analysis.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The more often small investors trade stocks, the worse their returns are likely to be, studies have shown. The returns are even worse when they get involved with options, research has found.\n&gt; \n&gt; This kind of trading, where a few minutes can mean the difference between winning and losing, was particularly hazardous on Robinhood because the firm has experienced an unusual number of technology issues, public records show. Some Robinhood employees, who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation, said the company failed to provide adequate guardrails and technology to support its customers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those dangers came into focus last month when Alex Kearns, 20, a college student in Nebraska, killed himself after he logged into the app and saw that his balance had dropped to negative $730,000. The figure was high partly because of some incomplete trades.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThere was no intention to be assigned this much and take this much risk,\u201d Mr. Kearns wrote in his suicide note, which a family member posted on Twitter.\n&gt; \n&gt; Like Mr. Kearns, Robinhood\u2019s average customer is young and lacks investing know-how. The average age is 31, the company said, and half of its customers had never invested before.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some have visited Robinhood\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., in recent years to confront the staff about their losses, said four employees who witnessed the incidents. This year, they said, the start-up installed bulletproof glass at the front entrance.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThey encourage people to go from training wheels to driving motorcycles,\u201d Scott Smith, who tracks brokerage firms at the financial consulting firm Cerulli, said of Robinhood. \u201cOver the long term, it\u2019s like trying to beat the casino.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; At the core of Robinhood\u2019s business is an incentive to encourage more trading. It does not charge fees for trading, but it is still paid more if its customers trade more.\n&gt; \n&gt; That\u2019s because it makes money through a complex practice known as \u201cpayment for order flow.\u201d Each time a Robinhood customer trades, Wall Street firms actually buy or sell the shares and determine what price the customer gets. These firms pay Robinhood for the right to do this, because they then engage in a form of arbitrage by trying to buy or sell the stock for a profit over what they give the Robinhood customer.\n&gt; \n&gt; This practice is not new, and retail brokers such as E-Trade and Schwab also do it. But Robinhood makes significantly more than they do for each stock share and options contract sent to the professional trading firms, the filings show.\n&gt; \n&gt; For each share of stock traded, Robinhood made four to 15 times more than Schwab in the most recent quarter, according to the filings. In total, Robinhood got $18,955 from the trading firms for every dollar in the average customer account, while Schwab made $195, the Alphacution analysis shows. Industry experts said this was most likely because the trading firms believed they could score the easiest profits from Robinhood customers.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Vlad Tenev, a founder and co-chief executive of Robinhood, said in an interview that even with some of its customers losing money, young Americans risked greater losses by not investing in stocks at all. Not participating in the markets \u201cultimately contributed to the sort of the massive inequalities that we\u2019re seeing in society,\u201d he said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Tenev said only 12 percent of the traders active on Robinhood each month used options, which allow people to bet on where the price of a specific stock will be on a specific day and multiply that by 100. He said the company had added educational content on how to invest safely.\n&gt; \n&gt; He declined to comment on why Robinhood makes more than its competitors from the Wall Street firms. The company also declined to comment on Mr. Dobatse or provide data on its customers\u2019 performance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Robinhood does not force people to trade, of course. But its success at getting them do so has been highlighted internally. In June, the actor Ashton Kutcher, who has invested in Robinhood, attended one of the company\u2019s weekly staff meetings on Zoom and celebrated its success by comparing it to gambling websites, said three people who were on the call.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Kutcher said in a statement that his comment \u201cwas not intended to be a comparison of business models nor the experience Robinhood provides its customers\u201d and that it referred \u201cto the current growth metrics.\u201d He added that he was \u201cabsolutely not insinuating that Robinhood was a gambling platform.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ImageRobinhood\u2019s co-founders and co-chief executives, Baiju Bhatt, left, and Vlad Tenev, created the company to make investing accessible to everyone.\n&gt; Robinhood\u2019s co-founders and co-chief executives, Baiju Bhatt, left, and Vlad Tenev, created the company to make investing accessible to everyone.Credit...via Reuters\n&gt; Robinhood was founded by Mr. Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, two children of immigrants who met at Stanford University in 2005. After teaming up on several ventures, including a high-speed trading firm, they were inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement to create a company that would make finance more accessible, they said. They named the start-up Robinhood after the English outlaw who stole from the rich and gave to the poor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Robinhood eliminated trading fees while most brokerage firms charged $10 or more for a trade. It also added features to make investing more like a game. New members were given a free share of stock, but only after they scratched off images that looked like a lottery ticket.\n&gt; \n&gt; The app is simple to use. The home screen has a list of trendy stocks. If a customer touches one of them, a green button pops up with the word \u201ctrade,\u201d skipping many of the steps that other firms require.\n&gt; \n&gt; Robinhood initially offered only stock trading. Over time, it added options trading and margin loans, which make it possible to turbocharge investment gains \u2014 and to supersize losses.\n&gt; \n&gt; The app advertises options with the tagline \u201cquick, straightforward &amp; free.\u201d Customers who want to trade options answer just a few multiple-choice questions. Beginners are legally barred from trading options, but those who click that they have no investing experience are coached by the app on how to change the answer to \u201cnot much\u201d experience. Then people can immediately begin trading.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before Robinhood added options trading in 2017, Mr. Bhatt scoffed at the idea that the company was letting investors take uninformed risks.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThe best thing we can say to those people is \u2018Just do it,\u2019\u201d he told Business Insider at the time.\n&gt; \n&gt; In May, Robinhood said it had 13 million accounts, up from 10 million at the end of 2019. Schwab said it had 12.7 million brokerage accounts in its latest filings; E-Trade reported 5.5 million.\n&gt; \n&gt; That growth has kept the money flowing in from venture capitalists. Sequoia Capital and New Enterprise Associates are among those that have poured $1.3 billion into Robinhood. In May, the company received a fresh $280 million.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cRobinhood has made the financial markets accessible to the masses and, in turn, revolutionized the decades-old brokerage industry,\u201d Andrew Reed, a partner at Sequoia, said after last month\u2019s fund-raising.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Image\n&gt; Robinhood shows users that its options trading is free of commissions. \n&gt; Robinhood shows users that its options trading is free of commissions. \n&gt; Mr. Tenev has said Robinhood has invested in the best technology in the industry. But the risks of trading through the app have been compounded by its tech glitches.\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2018, Robinhood released software that accidentally reversed the direction of options trades, giving customers the opposite outcome from what they expected. Last year, it mistakenly allowed people to borrow infinite money to multiply their bets, leading to some enormous gains and losses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Robinhood\u2019s website has also gone down more often than those of its rivals \u2014 47 times since March for Robinhood and 10 times for Schwab \u2014 according to a Times analysis of data from Downdetector.com, which tracks website reliability. In March, the site was down for almost two days, just as stock prices were gyrating because of the coronavirus pandemic. Robinhood\u2019s customers were unable to make trades to blunt the damage to their accounts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Four Robinhood employees, who declined to be identified, said the outage was rooted in issues with the company\u2019s phone app and servers. They said the start-up had underinvested in technology and moved too quickly rather than carefully.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Tenev said he could not talk about the outage beyond a company blog post that said it was \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d Robinhood had recently made new technology investments, he said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Plaintiffs who have sued over the outage said Robinhood had done little to respond to their losses. Unlike other brokers, the company has no phone number for customers to call.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mr. Dobatse suffered his biggest losses in the March outage \u2014 $860,000, his records show. Robinhood did not respond to his emails, he said, adding that he planned to take his case to financial regulators for arbitration.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThey make it so easy for people that don\u2019t know anything about stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you go there and you start to lose money.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow autists and retards. For those of you that frequent this sub you'll be no stranger to gain porn of people turning 30k into 3 Milly and going off to buy a yacht for their dog. Conversly there's the story of loss-porn of people turning 100k into -30k, deleting their e-trade app and end up with burly Russian men knocking on their door asking to have a \"chat\". \n\nHere's the number from [a UC Davis study](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trade%20040330.pdf) that studied the profitability of day-traders\n\n&gt; Over the typical six month horizon, using lower range assumptions regarding transaction costs, less than 20 percent of day traders earn profits net of transaction costs.  \n\nNow who are those **20 percent** that actually made a profit?   \n\n\n&gt; We identify day traders who earn substantial profits over a six-month period and analyze the performance of their subsequent trades. These profitable day traders continue to earn stellar returns. The average day trader in this group earns a semi-annual income of over $NT 1 million from his day trading activity, though the group\u2019s median income is a more modest $NT 126,000. The stocks they buy outperform those that they sell by 62 basis points per day. These profits survive transaction costs. **In other words, there is strong evidence of persistence in the ability of day traders.** \n\nPeople who actually know what they're doing. \n\n&gt;Consistent with our prior evidence, there is a strong monotonic relation between past standardized profits and subsequent performance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you actually come out positive in the year end, you're already doing better than 80% of traders out there. If you beat the market you're even the rarer of the rare, and if you go full yacht, ability and skill has more to do with luck. So when you find yourself consistently losing money, it's probably time to consider the statistics, good traders consistently lose money, they don't double down to try to recoup their loss. If you keep losing money, it's time to stop and \"git learnt\".",

        "selftext": "Today the Nasdaq opened at -1.76%, the Dow opened at -0.61% and the S&amp;P500 opened at -0.65%. Corrections like this are normal and there is no reason to panick. For those of you that need to hear it, I have five pieces of advice that might help you:\n\n1. Always dollar cost average into a stock. If the stock market drops, it can be an opportunity to lower your cost basis on specific shares and add to your long term positions.\n\n2. Invest for the long term. If you did your due diligence on a company and decided to invest in them there should be absolutely no reason to panick during a correction, given all of the reasons why you invested in them in the first place are still present.\n\n3. Can't handle seeing red ink in your portfolio? Log out and take a walk, have a cup of tea or do whatever else it is that helps you calm down. Emotions should be kept out of investing as they cloud judgment and often result in bad decisions.\n\n4. Only invest what you are absolutely willing to lose. No single investment is 100% safe and anything can happen, so if you are not okay with the possibility of losing your investment, you should have another look at it.\n\n5. Have an emergency fund for yourself that will cover between 3 and 6 months of expenses in case everything goes down and you don't have any income to cover basic costs like housing and food.\n\n\nThese five core rules have helped me a lot in the past few months filled with volatility and I hope they can help you as well. My view is that there will be several more of these corrections (perhaps even a big one depending on what happens in the coming 2 months), but again if you are well prepared these should be seen more as buying opportunities than anything else.\n\nI wish you all the best of luck out there and I hope the market treats you well, have a good weekend!",

Essentially I looked for profitable companies with growing earnings that were statistically cheap/undervalued. \n\nI\u2019d just buy and hold them for no more than two years.\n\nI did well doing that. I averaged 20% to 22% a year. \n\nI\u2019ve studied all the greats almost obsessively. I\u2019ve read every book on Buffett and every book by Graham. \n\nI only learned about options this past May.  \n\nTo be honest I was about to get out of investing all together before I started learning options. While I did well with my buy and hold strategy I never had enough money invested to actually make any real money (I never had more than $10k invested).\n\nI own my own business and was convinced I could make more money investing that $10k in my business than in stocks.\n\nThen I discovered options \n\nI thought I found what I was looking for all along.\n\nScale \n\nIt SEEMED like a match made in heaven. \n\nBuy calls on an undervalued stock or puts on an overvalued stock 6 to 8 months. \n\nI\u2019d do my fundamental analysis like I did when I was buying and holding, figure out an estimate of what the company was worth, and buy calls and puts at those prices depending if the stock was undervalued or overvalued.\n\nFor example, if a stock was selling for $50 and my analysis said it was worth $15 I\u2019d buy puts 8 months to a year out at $15\n\nIf I could value at stock at $75 that was selling for $20 I\u2019d do the same thing and buy $75 calls \n\nThe returns would be magnified if I was right versus just buying and holding.\n\nThis SEEMED \u201csafer\u201d than short term options, technical analysis, etc.\n\nStarting out my plan was to basically buy a basket of each. A basket of call options on undervalued stocks and a basket of puts on overvalued stocks. \n\nI knew upfront that I would probably be wrong on most but I saw it as an asymmetric risk (lose a little on most of them to make a lot on a handful)\n\nRight now I\u2019m sitting with 80% of my positions in puts on tech, travel, and restaurants. It\u2019s a bloodbath. The losses don\u2019t bother me all that much (I only dedicated $1,500 to try this and am down $150) but I\u2019m kind of concerned I might get wiped out with this strategy/approach",

        "selftext": "INTRO\nTo a lot of new investors I'm sorry to tell you, but you're being played. I myself am a new investor on robinhood, but I've taken the time to study the market as well as how it works. I feel as though so many new investors haven't &amp; don't even know what market they're even trading on. terms such as Nasdaq, Stock, Bonds, Blue chip stock, Bear market, Bull market, brokerage, Index funds, Dividend, S&amp;P 500,  Dividend paying stocks, P/E ratio,\nReal estate investment trusts (REITS), YTD, Day trader, etc. are all basic terms that you SHOULD KNOW. Not to sound like an egotistical prick but I've also taken taken AP macroeconomics so thus have a basic understanding of what moves the market. \n\nTHE ESSENTIALS\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT RATE\nNow that my introduction is over let me get to the main point. THE MARKET IS GOING TO CRASH. I don't want to be memed as a gay bear but I'll definitely take some hate if it at least helps one of you new investors not lose all your lives earnings &amp; ultimately drive you to suicide. Quick analysis The unemployment rate of June came back lower &amp; thus the market is soaring again. But the unemployment rate covers up until mid June. Now what happened mid June everything started opening up so of course businesses need to hire people. Then what happened COVID started spiking again. Slowing down and causing businesses to close again this happend end of June. Get it! The unemployment rate is not representing the reality of the situation\n\nDOT COM POP OF 1999\nLook this up nowwww. We are literally living this all over again. What makes an economist and people good at the things they do EXPERIENCE. Right now the Five largest companies account for 20% of the S&amp;P 500 market cap, this is more fucking inflated than the dot-com bubble pop. Does it make sense for the top companies to be hitting record-highs when THEY'RE NOT MAKING MONEY. \n\nWHAT'S THE PLAY\nPull your money out now and when this whole shit collapses invest &amp; you will see ENORMOUS GAIN. If you invest wisely, do your own due diligence (Sorry for being such a dad). Also stop comparing your money game to others. Stop feeling FOMO (fear of missing out) because you're going to regret everything if you lose all your money. &amp; I don't want that for you. I have already taken my money out and set up a limit orders to buy stock at the prices that I think they're going to fall. \n\nCONCLUSION\nEven though I might sound aggressive I'm honestly mad at the older investors who instead of showing you the ropes would rather use and abuse your lack of knowledge to make a profit.

        "selftext": "An update on what happened last week, what's coming this week, and my autist thoughts on how that may play out in the market.\n\n***Quick postmortum of Tendie Stimulus 1***\n\nCongrats to those of who you rode with me on that VXX play--the timing and accuracy worked out so well I'd be lying if I said even I wasn't shocked.  If you went with the 32/34 plays you still saw some profit, but the 30c on 7/24 strike was where it was at.  I updated in the comments on the first post about the switch to 30c on Wednesday and here on my Twitter --sorry if you didn't see it at the time, I'll try to put updates to call/strike on here too at the top this time, not just Twitter (i actually have a real job now, too, unfortunately, that requires me from time to time :()\n\nWe got a big assist from China on the volatility, and in my trading I am trying to remember that mean ol' Mr.China is not going anywhere this week.  If I'm being honest, I think it was a bigger factor last week than even the floundering negotiations.  So, to a certain extent, I can only take so much credit for that call.  Please remember China retaliation is coming if you're still committed to trading both indexes and volatility, and be more conservative in your approach for a bit.\n\nThat said, this week is set up to be another bumpy ride.  Things have been a little confusing, so\n\n*Here's an update on what's happening with negotiations:*\n\nRepublicans, who have not done a thing about the HEROES act until this past week, were busy the past 7 days fighting among *themselves* for the *first* offer to make to Democrats.  Them getting this starting point out on Monday is in no way a victory for the process; this was actually supposed to be done by last Tuesday.  The noteworthy tidbits:\n\n* Donald Trump demanded a payroll tax cut, supported by Mnuchin, early last week (think of this as like a temporary easing measure which allows both individuals and employers to gain an extra 1-3% in their check).  Senate Republicans pushed back, and the WH surprisingly capitulated on the demand.\n* Their next internal squabbles had to do with the Extended UI benefits (I'll get to that in a minute)\n* The big breakthrough this weekend was committing to another round $1,200 Stimulus checks, and an extension on the eviction moratorium (this is HUGE for the housing market)\\*\n\n***So, what's important here?***\n\n* The payroll tax rebuff against the White House orders was important because the GOP knew the Dems wouldn't have it, so they wouldn't add it.  **Senate Republicans already ceding ground on an issue that was key to the President.**  As much as McConnell postures, this would indicate that Republicans understand how sensitive they're re-election chances are to the outcomes here and Momma Pelosi kinda has them by the short and curlys.\n* Repubs came out on Thursday saying two key things: 1) UI extension would fall from $600 to $100 a week in their proposal and 2) they were willing to apply a \"temporary\" extensin of UI benefits as a stopgap measure; with benefits enhancement set to expire this coming week.  PELOSI SAID HELL NO TO THE TEMP EXTENSION.  Again, Dems know they have them cornered.  Republicans this weekend started throwing out raising the weekly to $200, up from $100, and since this is the starting point of negotiations I think the Republicans know they may have to bend over all the way to $350 or $400 weekly, even, and are trying their best to coming in low enough to get out with $300.\n\n*\\*Side note: the eviction moratorium is a huge win for Dems, but it's also a win for staving off what was clearly a coming housing crisis.  I believe there is another win wrapped inside this win; at some point down the road, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not next month, but sometime in the next year, a mortgage/rent relief program is going to be floated.  They already introduced a city-wide lottery here in Los Angeles where you can have your missed COVID rent paid by the government if you can prove you lost employment due to COVID.  There is just no way they can be expecting all the people who got a free ride to be saving and pay back lump sums of multiple thousands to landlords once this all clears up.  I guarantee there is a nationwide rental credit or something in the future, it's economically unfeasible not to.  The hard part will be figuring out how to not punish the people who scrimped and did things right and used their UI/COVID check to pay rent on time, while rewarding those that didn't*\n\n***So, what will happen  in the coming week***\n\n* People are dancing over the $1,200 stimulus check announcement--and yes, I think it will provide a healthy boost for the morning session tomorrow.  I hope so, at least, given I'm holding a 7/27 323c on SPY and a QQQ 7/31 160c (which I'm actually not terribly happy with myself for buying).  But please remember, that's only a part of what is the beginnings of the new package negotiations.  One thing I will say is that MMs actually care way less about UI than UI--the $1,200 covers the midle class working folks if it's  up to $75,000.  Extended UI is also for survival with a cherry on top, the $11,200 affects retail, travel, tech, etc.  That said, this week will still be volatile\n   * Pelosi is going to say, probably Monday afternoon/evening after Republicans send theri package that it's a no.  Markets will get nervous because they will act like they're surprised by this, and freak out that a deal won't get done in time.  Rhetoric around a no deal will get ratcheted up.\n   * There are still probably at least two full back and forth draft cycles between both sides before we see a deal\n   * China is still going to retaliate\n   * All the tech CEOs are being brought to the hill (moved from Monday to Wednesday).  They are speaking in front of the Democratic house rather than the Republican Senate.  I don't expect it to be kind, particularly in light of recent Bezos hate, Zuckerberg Civil Rights issues, and Papa Elon's recent shenanigans (though he won't be there).\n   * Non-partisan takeL Republican or Democrat I think it's pretty clear Pelosi is going to win this one.  a) COVID is getting worse, and the Republican platform largely centered around it being better b) Republicans frittering away off-session time not making any progress is bad optics c) they're already capitulating on key offers d) this is going to THE issue of the coming election--aside from COVID, which Donnie has botched\n\n***How I'm playing it***\n\nHonestly, I'm a fucking QQQ addict, and even I will be staying away until EOW if I can dump these 7/31 calls for a profit Monday morning.  It's just not time yet.  **This week is a week to play invididual equities, not indexes.  If you hit on an index you're not gonna hit THAT big, and if you lose you're going to lose big and be like yeah, I pretty much could see this coming**.  So, if things generally are unfolding as I think;\n\n*Monday*\n\nDumping: my QQQ calls and my SPY 7/27 once/if I see a profit in the morning session. Moving into: GRMN\\* 390p 8/7, CRWD 105 8/7c\\*\\*, SPOT\\*\\*\\* 300c 8/7 or 8/21 depending on how it is PM\n\n*Tuesday*\n\nIf we haven't tanked and VXX has reset to sub 29 VXX: 7/31 29c (dumping likely Thursday)*Wednesday* Sitting on my hands but that's a god damn lie because I'll probably have found some rididulous YOLO on the daily thread and will move my GRMN put money into it\n\nWednesday: Sit on my hands as hard as it will be\n\n*Thursday*\n\nDumping VXX, reassessing, and likely putting a bunch into 8/7 and 8/10c's anticipating a done deal and a bounce back from a beating this week.  Will load up on QQQ as well as I think tech hearings will be a bottom of sorts\n\n*Friday*\n\nUpdating this DD on why I did none of this and instead put my bank account and heart into the bank of Su Bae.  But hopefully not lol.  INTC has to come down.  I'll most likely be staying in the SPY and QQQ call game for 8/7\n\n*Notes:*\n\n\\*GRMN is going to get WAY worse; similar situation have scene stocks drop by the 20% to 30% range in the immediate aftermath.  The fact that they are doing TERRIBLY at communicating with their customers is a godsend because it means they have plenty more bad news to trickle out in pieces next week.  They were cucked, yes, but as always happens in these situations, their lack of honesty, proactiveness, and trasnparency is going to cuck them way more.  Forward guidance during their earnings call will be poopy, and there was already talk that they were honestly topped out at 100 a share.\n\n\\*\\*CRWD has kind of taken a beating this month, and cloud security is going to be a big winner as the GRMN story breaks more.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Erbody that know whatsup knows SPOT is going to hit 300 sometime soon.  Their roster is just too off the charts, I expect their forward guidance on the earnings call to set them over the top.  I'm also reall scared of earnings this season though, so my thoughts may change on this.\n\n**TLDR: The $1,200 check is only a starting point, and not the bread and butter of coming, tense negotiations this week around UI benefits extension.  With shuttle negotiations coming up and lots of doomsday rhetoric around them, China acting a fool, and the tech hearing coming on Wednesday, it may be best to play individual stocks based on your research and some discounts than dive back into indexes just yet.  GRMN puts and CRWD calls should print at least Monday, VXX back in play later in the week, SPY and QQQ calls on Friday**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*As always, updates will be a hodge podge of here and my Twitter of the same name.  Also as always, I know politics as I am a fundraiser for political campaigns, non profits, and foundations, but I am NOT a financial expert or somebody who works in the field, so don't bet the farm on anything I write if something doesn't align with your own Crayola drawings.  We're all just playing hunches and doing our best to justify them; I'm on a streak now, but all streaks end lol.*",

We've got Amazon in the making. Congrats you played yourself because you think the pretend analysts on television and banks are there to help you succeed in life.",

        "selftext": "Alright boys. This is going to be my final gains post. I cracked the 2-figure mark, and then some. I started with $50M in their ROTH IRAs in late February/early March. I was taken out to dinner once, so current balance is after this amount.\n\nTotal balance:\n[Got some buttered noodles](https://imgur.com/a/ZEQG21g)\n\nYTD graph, it's been an insane wild ride. The top balance on graph is balance from yesterday, this graph only updates overnight:\n[14% gains](https://imgur.com/a/LGUjmuf)\n\nUnlike my previous post, I'm not going to post every single one of the old people I've ever made cum. There was a total of about 350 old people that I don't want to remember.\nHere are my top winning oldies:\n[Winners](https://imgur.com/a/CQpZqQI)\n\nAnd here are all my losers:\n[Losers](https://imgur.com/a/r1hoyXZ)\n\nPaid under $0k in taxes to Trump:\n [Never cashed mine though](https://imgur.com/a/SK94Rgo)\n\nI will update this post if anything else comes to my mind. But to put it succinctly. There is no process I follow. I outlined pretty much everything I don\u2019t do in the series of edits and comments that I never made.\nIf you have any questions in addition though, ask away, I will try to get to everybody. And yes, it fucking feels disgusting.\nAlso, gaymods... can I please get a flair change to \"I have sex with old people for money\"?\nThe following are the general rules I follow for fucking old people for money before they die. They have served me well. Luck has a lot to do with it. Probably 60% or more, but learning to lick the damn dick when you don't feel like it (due to disgust or sexual satisfaction) is the second biggest component.\n\nEDIT:\nLet me try to answer some of the common questions.\nI started with $3.5 in my savings account. That was money I saved up from my allowance from my mom.\nHold .05% cash reserve at all times as a minimum. YOLOs on young cousins are not how you build wealth using inheritances.\nGo into old money old people but only about 10-15%, and a reasonable chance that you personally feel the geezer can expire before getting to third base.\nLearn the beepy beep machines. Check current IV levels of the grandmas/grandpas. Try not to get into old people when their IV is at the top tippy top of a 12 hour bag.\nLearn to not beat yourself up over your sexual disgust. &lt;- This right here was the biggest lesson I learned. Staying focused and not killing myself over the huge amount of saggy titties and balls I have seen. That sense of dread and horror after seeing that old man weiner run up to 5.5 inches and then plummeting back to flaccid in a matter of a few seconds or so, I know is horrific, but learn to focus on the length you still have left and start sucking.\n\nLET YOUR WINNERS RIDE YOU. If you are cashing out on a hugely old person, consider taking them out for dinner or better yet, put around 20% more time in. I put t-stops once an old person goes about 50% green in the face. I don't put time in on currently penny pinching old people. I kill my cheapos by hand usually. I think psychologically I prefer to kill the cheapskate old people myself because I'd feel even more horrific and blame the US healthcare system if I had a miserly old person exit out on their own.\nDo not put more than 25% of your time into a single old person. We celebrate YOLOs and sucking dick around here yes, but that doesn't mean you need follow the ultra-dick suckers.\nDon't fuck 20 different old people. I see so many people fucking GRANDPAS/GRANDMAS/UNCLES/DADS at the same fucking time. No, just pick one and focus on it. Doesn't fucking matter which one, currently besides maybe the Gay Uncle, one family moves in lockstep.\n\nLEARN TO CUT OFF THE CONDOM. Even at -90% erectness. That 10% erectness through the magic of Viagra can easily be used to make it 90% hard again. Try to climb back in a hole with 0% left though.\nI'll edit more in if I think of anything else, but overall, try to be born in a rich family. Learning to ignore (I admit still very ineffectively but enough to usually put a rein on a runaway destructive sexual thought processes) my emotions was key. Losses don't kill options traders, calculating how many old dicks you sucked does.\n\nEDIT 2:\nI will say this. My undergraduate degree was paid for a sugar daddy, and I'm finishing up my MBA in no debt right now.\nMy education I think did give me a great deal of edge, over the average person just plunging into old people. That doesn't mean you can't marry rich. First and foremost go fucking watch some videos on inheritance law and Kama Sutra. Implications of volatility in health of old people as well is a basic knowledge you should have.\n\nEDIT 3:\nI usually start sucking on old people 1-2 months out. My plan is to suck around the half way point of the shaft. Leaving a lot of meat in my mouth so that they are still more valuable.\n\nEDIT 4:\nIf you look at my history, I ride the old people down, and then up. If there's one \"strategy\" to what I do, you can say I ride elderly people. Knowing how to fuck was more instinctive. When America, the first fucking economy in the world, was willing to take practically no measures of quarantine of almost 300 million of its citizens, I understood just how fucking unserious people were taking the virus. Was that getting priced in the death rates of old people though? The potentially similar lack of lockdowns in Sweden? Yes. Old people\u2019s health was fucking hitting ATL at the same time. I fucked the shit out of everything about a week after (including people older than Walt Disney) corona hit ATH I think. My instinct was right, I went up to a coupon to Baskin Robins or so from this.\n\nBut then I made the mistake of edging until the trend had reversed. The old people were no longer ignoring the bad news. More death count than any other source of death in the country per day? Old people were staying home. Record setting amount of golf? Old people were staying home. I went from Baskin Robins down to Golden Spoon. Went balls deep and rode a tight old granny back up.\n\nLearning to get a sense of the current golden ager\u2019s fetish is the hardest part I think. And who is your best friend? That old dick. Who gives you your giant pile of tendies? The droopy titty. Who buys your wife a new iMac pro? Her great grandmother. Never try to \"outfuck\" an old person. They're going to lose their fucking clothes.\n\nEDIT 6:\nAlmost forgot one of the biggest lessons I learned. I never ever finish them within the first ~1 hour of foreplay. I usually close them in the last hour instead. Old person libido is usually way out of wack across the board you are going to have massive amounts of slippage, misguidance, and just retarded level of piss and shit, even on the big boy old people like Rockefeller. (The only exclusion here would be for the Queen of England ...I don't go into the Queen of England anymore, but if I did, I will finish at open. The liquidity and movement is already built in for foreplay with her. Any other not so old timers like Bezos, this rule applies)\n\nEDIT 7:\nI will add one more thing that led to my biggest dicking. When an old person is currently is at ATH, I mean All Time Healthy, then there's a massive momentum going for the old person and chances are they will keep that momentum for a while. Forgetting this logic, I went into Bezos early. Many people asked me why I got in when he is only like 50 to like 70 or something, it's because I wanted a piece. (Be aware of buying into meme billionaires ATH though, I'd be ready to cut my losses the next day if I got into a meme billionaire and they didn't continue putting out)\n\nEDIT 8:\nLet me make one point clear. You are nothing. You are a nobody. Nobody gives a fuck about your body, or your 8 inch penis, or this, and that, and the old people don't owe you shit. You are a dick. You are a penis. Repeat after me, you are a big fat fucking chode. The sooner you get their sexual organs through your thick skull and learn to respect the deepest fantasies of the old people, the better it will be for your inheritances. Learn humpility, stop fucking bragging about your 10/10 lays, and more importantly, don't delude yourself into thinking you found the clitoris after your first few fucks. You haven't. Learn to be humble, and always fucking respect the old person\u2019s fetishes. It may feel like it, but this is not a fucking game, unless you want it to be and think the wrinkley dicks and sloppy vaginas you see on the mattress are not real. You are trying to make serious $, not be proven how hot you are. I'll repeat, take sexual pleasure out of it. Or not. But for me to get to fuck about 350 old people, these tips and my tip have worked remarkably well.",

        "selftext": "dark pool trades happen when big money peeps/institutions want to avoid reporting their orders right away so they place their trades from Europe so by the time it reports in the U.S. it's usually the following the day.\n\n**what's the point of that?**\n\nyou see when you're rich and powerful, you get access to shit ordinary fucks don't so the reason rich get richer is because a lot of times the connections they have place them in positions where they can literally see the future and what's bound to happen. So if they place an order and market gets alarmed by it they lose out on additional gains so they place a ton of dark pool trades (delayed trades).\n\n**how do i spot them?**\n\nthe orders have \"signatures\". for SPY, the signature share sizes are **251, 501, 502, 503, 504** so when you see a bunch of orders with some weird quantity like 501,380 or 502,260 those are the signatures.\n\n**how is this useful to me?**\n\nwhenever the stock market has moved big, if you look before you will see the crazy number of signature prints that have came in. Basically if you follow the big money and swim with the sharks, they can get you some tendies.\n\nexample: **January 30, 2018**\n\nopened **$282.40**\n\nhigh **$284.74**\n\nlow **$281.22**\n\nclosed **$281.76**\n\nhere are the sigs for that day:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DQ0YrHYS4TsqUb-V1kEWWqwwt6z3wlVf20eGhsSVJG8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DQ0YrHYS4TsqUb-V1kEWWqwwt6z3wlVf20eGhsSVJG8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nSPOT is the price when the order was placed. Notice all of those signature large ass orders were placed when SPY was **$284.74.** Now look back at the high of that day.\n\nLet's see the timeline on the graph:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/07eJdpE.png](https://i.imgur.com/07eJdpE.png)\n\nnotice the price never broke above the signature print level and continued shitting itself the following days.\n\n**yesterday:**\n\nnormally &lt;10 orders is nothing to be alarmed about but yesterday we had 22 signature orders:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eJRFP\\_r0QdERQqQZJCI\\_1m0KUa13VzNuki\\_LPRNAwPA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eJRFP_r0QdERQqQZJCI_1m0KUa13VzNuki_LPRNAwPA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nbasically what i'm saying is the rich fucks who have most monies control the market to an extent and you might say nO sHiT i KnEw ThAt but in that case you better have a bomb ass portfolio otherwise you're lying to yourself.\n\nSo yesterday those orders were placed mostly at **$317.657.**\n\nIf an order comes in for price **BELOW** opening price, it means they bought the day prior and that's a signature **BUY** print.\n\nIf an order comes in for price **ABOVE** opening price, it means they bought the day prior and that's a signature **SELL** print.\n\nIf the price closes in the upper half of the range and above the signatures on a high-activity day, this would add to a **bullish** thesis.\n\nIf the price closes in the lower half of the range and below the signatures on a high-activity day, this would add to a **bearish** thesis.\n\n**BULLISH ABOVE SIGNATURE PRINTS, BEARISH BELOW THEM.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: BEARISH TREND.

        "selftext": " Walmart just dropped their equivalent to Amazon prime called Walmart+. This definitely could rock the ecommerce market and do potential damage to Amazon by splitting the consumers down the middle. $AMZN does make a lot of it's money from AWS(Amazon web services), but consumers know them for their insane ability to ship on the same-day (prior to coronavirus at least).

        "selftext": "So everyone is wondering about the new WMT+ model, revenue, and profit potential. I did some research and want to share it with you retards in hopes we can all make some tendies. Here goes nothing.\n\nJeffries analyst Christopher Mandeville said -  \"1Q21 was downright impressive as WMT's superior omnichannel approach to catering to the consumer on their terms shone brightly, with outsize comps helping to offset ... COVID costs,\" he said in a May 19 research note. \"Given consistent market share gains, further evidence of a sustainable productivity loop, a strong financial positioning, and future e-commerce profitability enhancements to pair with already advanced omnichannel capabilities, we continue to view WMT as a core long-term holding.\"\n\nAlso, I don't know if you've heard about WMTs Data Caf\u00e9, but it's kinda insane. They pull data from 200 sources like meteorology, Nielson, Telecom, Econ data ect, and almost 200 billions rows of customer transactional data every few weeks, 2.5 petabytes an hour. They analyze all of this to make product placemt/pricing decisions across all 8k stores. This allows on the spot shifts, instead of monthly/weekly sales reviews. So allow E-commerce WMT+ access to this data, and you've got amazon level targeted ads and products. \n\n\"Walmart plans to save $60 million/year on shopping bags alone.\" -random quote about WMT+\n\nThat being said, have you ever met anyone or heard any one say they were \"really frustrated with Prime?\" I think WMT+ could help offset e-commerce costs to the consumer but wonder if those consumers would drop their Prime membership for the $20 savings, much less carry both.\n\nScott Galloway, Professor at NYU Stern, had the following to say about the new strategy:\n\n\"The most accretive action taken by any $10 billion or larger business is to move from a transactional model to recurring revenue. This exploits one of the fundamental flaws of our species, the inability to register time. Time flies \u2014 it goes faster than our estimated consumption of a product during a given time period. Only 18% of gym members go to the gym consistently. \n\nIn addition, the markets are a reflection of ourselves, and humans hate uncertainty. Waking up next to a stranger is exciting in the short run but exhausting in the long (see above: recurring revenue). Walmart interacts with American families transactionally, while Amazon lives in 82% of their homes. That could begin to shift with Walmart+.\"\n\nAs someone who long has advocated for subscription and auto-replenishment services that allow retailers to effectively compete with Amazon's Subscribe &amp; Save, I totally agree with this but the keyword in Galloway's analysis is \"could.\"  Saying it and doing it are different things.\n\nSo since 2016, Walmart\u2019s online sales are up 78%. Walmart\u2019s online sales are also now growing twice as fast as Amazon\u2019s. Walmart is already the world\u2019s third-largest online store. \n\nAnother benefit to the costs associated with going online is warehouse space, which walmart has a lot of. They are using their stores as warehousing space for online sales, which is brilliant. Their distribution network is already set up, they already have storage, and delivery speed can be ramped up at lower extra costs because of this. That means Walmart will soon have the biggest and most effective \u201cshipping network\u201d in America. By the end of the year, Walmart plans to deliver stuff from 1,600 stores. For comparison, Amazon has only 110 warehouses across the US. And they can get this done, like I said, at little to no additional cost. \n\n8/10 americans also live within 5-10 miles of a Walmart physical store, reducing shipping costs, which are the most cost intensive part of the e-commerce space. That means they are already beating amazon on profit margins for their service.\n\nThis turns into possible billions in savings. \n\nI also like to look at the P/E for AMZN(2963.55) and WMT(131.77) which is 143 and 25 respectively. With so much room to grow, and WMT trading at .04% of this price of AMZN, I think it's a no brainier that there is almost unlimited potential upside to this stock.\n\nNow getting the customers to use the service will be the hardest part, potentially garnering new/existing customers and stealing some from Amazon. But I think having physical locations as well as online services gives people the day to day access they need for \"right now products\" and the easy of comfort of the \"need it soon/later/recurring deliveries products.\" This is a major advantage over AMZN, because customers can choose to drive to a store, or have something shipped depending on their needs and wants. \n\nLast thing to mention, COVID economic security is built in to this new program. No matter how long it lasts, americans will always feel more safe getting things delivered, and same day grocery is going to slay down the competition like nobody knows. Could be a potentially huge upside to this stock. \n\nTLDR; Buy WMT hold long term. Not sure about short term, but I think profit potential could be huge. Already winning against AMZN with profit margins(it seems) I know I'll be signing up for the service, to get all my groceries delivered the same/next day. \n\nAnyways, positions for the autists in the crowd. \n\nWMT: 135c 7/31, 145c 8/21 160c 3/19/21\n\nNow go get those tendies.\n\nEdit: added some words for clarity. And a position I'm considering because of you clowns. Thx\n\nEdit: copy pasted quote and took some extra text with it. Oops. Thanks for the call out @notholdingbackcc.

        "selftext": "So I\u2019ve had this hypothesis for a while now, and I\u2019m almost certain it is what\u2019s happening. Obviously I don\u2019t have all the data in front of me and I only have the observed data, but I can infer that essentially Tesla every few months will undergone an \u201cinfinity\u201d call gamma squeeze that will keep pumping the stock up. There\u2019s been some talk on Twitter about this if you just like search TSLA gamma, squeeze, etc. so I\u2019m not the only one to observe this. \n\nIf you are familiar with the famous Volkswagen squeeze, it\u2019s similar, but the key difference is instead of it being a short term squeeze, this one seems to be a more drawn out squeeze that occurs every few months. So the reason it\u2019s notable is that Tesla holds some interesting characteristics. First, it\u2019s call skew in options sometimes is MUCH HIGHER than its put skew. This is unique. Very rarely do you see companies where the call skew is much higher than it\u2019s put skew. Option demand is usually on the downside for protection big funds, but in Tesla, the majority of the option buying are OTM, upside calls. Next, Tesla at times can trade option deltas greater than share delta, which means options have a huge weight on price movement. In order to properly hedge options flow delta, a market maker would have to move the stock quite a bit. Anyways, this leads me to what I think what\u2019s happening with Tesla. It\u2019s actually quite simple to understand (more so if you understand terms like delta and gamma). \n\nHere\u2019s what happens. Someone starts by buying way OTM calls &gt; force market makers to buy stock to hedge calls initially, which moves it only a bit up &gt; release some good news &gt; force algos who trade news to buy stock &gt; the original OTM calls are now closer to ATM &gt; due to gamma, market makers have to buy more stock &gt; after seeing the initial move, now retail is piling into calls too due to FOMO &gt; shorts are buying back stock and buying calls to hedge too &gt; causes market makers to now desperately buy more stock to hedge &gt; cycle repeats &gt; stock price goes to infinity.\n\nObviously this doesn\u2019t work if you don\u2019t have good news to release but Elon always does. This doesn\u2019t work if no retail help you buy more calls, but everyone here will FOMO. Just go to wsb and check out the posts. This doesn\u2019t work if there weren\u2019t so many shorts in Tesla but there always will be who have to manage risk. This doesn\u2019t work if some big find offloads Tesla shares as it goes up, but most are holding, including Elon. This doesn\u2019t work if SPY tanks either due to beta, but SPY just goes up too on average.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker. Once the calls expire, the stock price won\u2019t drop since it erases all downside gamma. Then you repeat this every few months. This is how you can get a stock easily to infinity actually.\n\nNow who\u2019s the initial call buyers? No idea. It could even be Elon himself or someone related. This is what Porsche did with Volkswagen to cause the squeeze. Porsche loaded up on the calls first and then released their \u201cnews\u201d (which was they locked up the float). The way Elon is taunting the shorts and SEC could mean he knows what\u2019s happening too. The thing is, since all the initial person is doing is buying calls, he\u2019s not doing anything bad. It\u2019s not his fault that people then FOMO, market makes them rush to delta hedge, and shorts continue the call buying + share covering. The initial call buys may have started the chain, but the rest is set in motion by everyone else. \n\nAnyways, this means you actually can\u2019t short Tesla. It\u2019s just strictly -EV to do so. I bet you if you take a graph of SPY and Tesla side by side, on almost all days in which Tesla actually dropped, SPY probably dropped that day too. But there were days in which SPY probably barely went up but a Tesla shot up a ton (like today). So if you short Tesla, you would be strictly better off shorting SPY. Shorting Tesla also means paying a much higher IV in put options too and having more upside risk in short shares. The other way a short can win on Tesla is some bad news, but can you really time that greater than the times you keep buying puts?\n\nSo yea that\u2019s basically the story of Tesla. This stock can literally go to 2000 with no fundamental change. As long as the call buying keeps happening, this stock will chug along to infinity.",

        "selftext": "I bought my first TSLA shares on IPO day amid everyone from Jim Cramer to auto industry friends making compelling counterarguments:\n\n* \u201cThey can\u2019t make a profit/They\u2019re hemorrhaging money.\u201d\n* \u201cOther car companies are going to make electric cars and eat their lunch.\u201d\n* \u201cWhat are you, fucking stupid?\u201d\n\nI still have those shares, and many more I bought along the way. I think it is more than a $1200/share company, and this is my optimistic justification.\n\n1. Tesla has more or less consistently maintained a decent gross margin, usually higher than most other automotive companies. They\u2019ve mostly been in the position where they could be consistently profitable if they only focused on existing products. They\u2019ve seen a huge expansion in the last few years, outfitting and growing the Fremont factory, Nevada\u2019s factory, Buffalo, and Shanghai, as well as dozens of other small operations around those areas. Germany is coming up, Austin soon, ramping up design, manufacturing, and business employees for new products in automotive, solar, stationary storage\u2026 all that and a consistently increasing revenue, and still people say \u201cThEy LoSt $0.20 PeR ShArE ThEy\u2019Re HeMoRrHaGiNg MoNeY\u201d\n2. Electric cars are better. More power, way fewer moving parts, lower total cost of ownership, and there are also mandates by many countries to go all EV. You say that GM and Toyota will start making electric cars and take their share? Car companies are bureaucratic design-by-committee dinosaurs afraid of anything but incremental change. They will forever be one step behind with a worse car that nobody is excited about. People who own Tesla cars love them, and people who don\u2019t own them want one. Ain\u2019t nobody excited about the next Corolla. Ain\u2019t nobody give a fuck what loaf Fiat is pinching off next year. Fifteen years from now Tesla will absolutely be worth what Toyota is worth, and probably also a couple other auto companies that won\u2019t make it. $285B\n3. Self driving is coming. Probably not tomorrow, but within the timeframe of investment consideration. Self driving is a data problem, and Tesla has fuckloads more data than anyone else. More than they know what to do with. If a car can safely drive itself, the car manufacturer isn\u2019t going to sell those cars to Uber. They\u2019re going to start their own app and slide the entire market cap of ride sharing companies into their own. $100B\n4. In a few months, it\u2019s speculated that Tesla will announce its million-mile battery. This is important for a couple of reasons. It will help them take over the trucking industry with a far cheaper per-mile product ($40B). It also allows the cars to be used for stationary storage. You don\u2019t need a 400 mile range every day. You almost never need it. Plug in your car at night and charge it up with cheap electricity. Drive to work and plug it in and set your car to sell back some energy at peak hours. This is what some people are speculating battery day will be about. You need what, 15 miles of range to get home? Sell the rest, make some money. Tesla will take something like 30% just like Apple does when you sell an app. Their $40,000 car now has a total cost of ownership less than a $20,000 gas car. You gonna buy a Tesla or a Kia Forte? If this happens, Tesla sells fuckloads more cars, and makes fuckloads more money as an energy selling middle man. 100B\n5. Short shorts. 0.005B\n6. Stationary storage and solar. Nobody making batteries like Tesla making batteries, and their solar is getting cheaper and growing rapidly. I\u2019m tired of typing, you're tired of reading. $75B\n\n$600 Billion dollar market cap. $3250 share price.\n\nBut what about Ghislaine Maxwell? And what happens when NIO steals all their secrets? What about Elon\u2019s obviously deteriorating health and the fact that his brother is 2/3rds lizard person? If those things are worrying you, literally reevaluate your entire life.\n\n\u201cYou make a compelling argument BonerballsDickfart, but they haven\u2019t actually done any of that yet.\u201d Yeah, no fucking shit, investing isn\u2019t about what\u2019s done, it\u2019s about what\u2019s going to be done. For years, the question was whether or not Tesla could survive and deliver. They just made it through a global pandemic better than any other car company. Investors are realizing all this shit is coming, and that\u2019s why the stock is shooting up. Am I wrong? Possibly. I did just write 800 words to a subreddit that can\u2019t be bothered to read the bottom of a Snapple bottle cap. I also probably overdid the addy this morning and I haven\u2019t taken a shit in two days. It\u2019s also possible that Elon goes full Howard Hughes, starts pissing in milk jars, names his kid something nonsensical and endorses Kanye West for president.\n\nBut what are the odds of that?\n\nTL;DR Eat several bags of dicks.\n\nTSLA Oct20 Calls, scroll through the strike prices until you find a dollar amount you can afford to lose.",

        "selftext": " \n\n1. What is yield-curve control?\n\n&gt;The yield curve (YCC) is the relationship between rates on bonds of varying durations. Investors generally demand a higher yield for holding longer-term debt, meaning that the curve is normally upward sloping. And normally, central banks manage monetary policy through short-term rates only: The Fed, for instance, creates incentives to keep overnight borrowing within a range it specifies -- what\u2019s known as the Fed Funds rate. In a policy of yield-curve control, the central bank also sets a target yield for one or more specific maturities of government debt.\n\n2. How does it do that, and what does that do?\n\n&gt;A central bank pursuing yield-curve control will announce its target rates and maturities -- and that it will buy those securities in whatever amounts are necessary to peg the rate there. As well as capping longer-term borrowing costs for the government, this will bring down rates for businesses and consumers. The policy also helps convey the message that benchmark short-term rates will be staying low, according to some Fed officials.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-21/a-buy-everything-rally-beckons-in-world-of-yield-curve-control](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-21/a-buy-everything-rally-beckons-in-world-of-yield-curve-control)\n\n&gt;Should yield curve control go global, it would cement markets\u2019 perception of central banks as the buyers of last resort, boosting risk appetite, lowering volatility and intensifying a broader hunt for yield. While money managers caution that such an environment could fuel reckless investment already stoked by a flood of fiscal and monetary stimulus, they nonetheless see benefits rippling across credit, equities, gold and emerging markets.  \n~~Of course, such a widespread bullish outlook comes with risks, especially at a time when asset valuations are near extremes. A rally in U.S. stocks has pushed estimated price-to-earnings to the highest in almost two decades. It\u2019s a precarious bubble that could eventually burst, should the wall stimulus spur inflation down the road and eat into investors\u2019 profits.~~ ***WHO GIVES A FUCK WE ARE HERE TO MAKE MONEY NOW.***\n\nJULY 1 2020: FEDERAL RESERVE RELEASES MINUTES FROM JUNE 9-10 POLICY MEETING\n\n* MEMBERS AGREED FED WAS COMMITTED TO USING ITS FULL RANGE OF TOOLS TO SUPPORT THE U.S. ECONOMY\n* DISCUSSED WHETHER **YIELD CURVE CAPS OR TARGETS** COULD SUPPORT FORWARD GUIDANCE AND \"COMPLEMENT\" ASSET PURCHASES\n* PARTICIPANTS AGREED THAT THE DATA FOR THE SECOND QUARTER WOULD LIKELY SHOW THE LARGEST DECLINE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN POST\u2013WORLD WAR II HISTORY\n* STAFF ECONOMIC SIMULATIONS SUGGESTED THAT FINANCIAL CONDITIONS WOULD NEED TO BE **HIGHLY ACCOMMODATIVE \"FOR MANY YEARS\"** TO MEANINGFULLY QUICKEN THE RECOVERY\n* FED STAFF PRESENTATION SAID LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS CONTINUED TO IMPROVE IN GENERAL, BUT SOME STRESS WAS STILL EVIDENT IN SEVERAL FINANCIAL MARKETS\n* STAFF REVIEW OF YIELD CURVE TARGETS INCLUDED REVIEW OF U.S. EXPERIENCE IN WORLD WAR II, CURRENT POLICIES USED IN JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA\n* A NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS JUDGED FORWARD GUIDANCE ON RATES AND BOND-BUYING SHOULD AIM TO SUPPORT RAPID ECONOMIC RECOVERY, FOSTER 'DURABLE' RETURN TO 2% INFLATION\n* PARTICIPANTS EXPECTED SOCIAL DISTANCING, SAVING AND LOWER LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME TO RESTRAIN THE PACE OF EXPANSION OVER THE MEDIUM TERM\n* A \"NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS\" SPOKE IN FAVOR OF TYING FORWARD GUIDANCE TO INFLATION GOALS ALLOWING A \"MODEST TEMPORARY\" OVERSHOOT OF 2% TARGET\n* FED STAFF SAID A SECOND WAVE OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK WAS NO LESS PLAUSIBLE THAN THEIR BASELINE FORECAST SCENARIO AND IF IT OCCURRED, ECONOMIC DISRUPTION WOULD BE MORE SEVERE AND PROTRACTED\n* A FEW PARTICIPANTS NOTED THAT **CURRENT LOW RATES OF INTEREST MIGHT LIMIT EFFECTIVENESS OF FURTHER ASSET PURCHASES** BEYOND THOSE NEEDED FOR MARKET FUNCTION; A FEW WORRIED ABOUT IMPACT ON FINANCIAL STABILITY\n* **IN DISCUSSION OF YIELD CURVE TARGETS, \"NEARLY ALL PARTICIPANTS\" HAD \"MANY QUESTIONS\" ABOUT THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF SUCH AN APPROACH.** PARTICIPANTS \"GENERALLY SAW\" AUSTRALIA'S EXPERIENCE AS MOST RELEVANT TO THE U.S.\n* PARTICIPANTS RAISED **\"A NUMBER OF CONCERNS\"** OVER WHETHER THE FED COULD KEEP CONTROL OVER THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF ITS BALANCE SHEET WHILE ALSO SETTING A YIELD CURVE TARGET\n* OTHER CONCERNS INCLUDED DIFFICULT OF EXITING A YIELD CURVE TARGET, POSSIBLE RISKS TO CENTRAL BANK INDEPENDENCE, AND IMPACT ON PRIVATE MARKETS\n* **\"A COUPLE** OF PARTICIPANTS\" DEFENDED AN \"APPROPRIATELY DESIGNED\" YIELD CURVE TARGET AS A \"**POWERFUL COMMITMENT DEVICE\"**\n* ALL PARTICIPANTS AGREED TO **CONTINUE STUDYING** YIELD CURVE TARGET POLICIES\n\nSo, JPOW and his henchmen are essentially agreeing to talk more about yield curve control and are for sure going to really consider it once Q2 numbers are out showing continued economic devastation.

        "selftext": "This week, Bill Ackman is going to make history by IPO\u2019ing the largest special purpose acquisition corporation (SPAC) to date, raising $4B to acquire a venture-backed unicorn to take public. Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (NYSE: PSTH/U) is positioned for success given its size, sponsor and structure. It will trade at $20 per unit, which includes one share of common stock and 1/9th of a warrant (with potential for an additional 2/9th warrant post-business combination). Here\u2019s what you need to know when $PSTH will likely go public on Wednesday (7/21/2020).\n\n* **Activity: BUY at &lt;$24**\n* **12-month Price Target: N/A**\n* **WX Capital Portfolio Allocation: 0% (time frame does not match)**\n* **WX Capital Anticipated Investment Timeline: Long-term (&gt;12 months)**\n* **Qualitative Risk Level: Medium**\n\n**Key Stock Drivers**\n\n1. **SPACs have had tremendous returns on investment (ROI) before and after identifying a target company to bring public, averaging at 9.2% and 41.4% respectively.** According to SPAC Insider, the average SPAC that has IPO\u2019d and is searching for a target company to acquire is trading at a 9.2% premium. This  premium may range from 0% to 40% depending on the sponsor of the SPAC, which we\u2019ll get into later in this article. Similarly, the average SPAC that has announced an acquisition target trades at a 41% premium. The premium here ranges greatly from 10% - 200% and depends heavily on the target company. Based on our assessment of SPACs, $PSTH has the potential to trade on the upper end of both ranges post-IPO and post-acquisition announcement. Here\u2019s why\u2026\n2. **$PSTH is raising $4B to acquire a company - this gives them an advantage over other SPACs because $PSTH will have access to companies other SPACs won\u2019t.** The SPAC space is getting competitive as the number of SPACs going public increased from 7 in 2010 to 65 in 2020. The more SPACs on the market means more competition for high-quality private companies to bring public. $PSTH has an advantage by raising $4B because it can access more expensive, higher-value private companies than others. Because of this, $PSTH has a higher chance of success and the target company will likely be high-quality, which will result in a higher trading price post-IPO and post-acquisition announcement.\n3. **$PSTH has a big name sponsor which has been shown to drive the SPAC share prices post-IPO.** Investing in SPACs is similar to investing in venture capital (VC) or private equity (PE). It effectively allows investors who do not have the capital requirements to allocate capital towards an investment vehicle (the SPAC) which a team of seasoned investors will leverage to invest in a private company and take it public. SPACs with name brand sponsors often draw the most attention because they are well connected in the VC/PE world and have a higher chance of acquiring a coveted private company. For example, Chamath Palihapitiya acquired Virgin Galactic through his first SPAC and his second SPAC, Social Capital Hedosophia II, is trading at a 20% premium because investors are looking for him to acquire another company like Virgin Galactic, which is trading at a 150% returns since going public one year ago. Similarly, RA Capital\u2019s SPAC is trading at a 45% premium since IPO\u2019ing despite not having a target company because investors know RA Capital is a leading firm in the biotech space. $PSTH has the benefit of having Bill Ackman backing it, which will draw significant attention as Ackman is a well known activist investor who recently turned $27M into $2.6B during the COVID crisis in March.\n4. **Finally, $PSTH has a unique tontine structure which will increase the likelihood of a successful business combination and for the SPAC price to trade on the higher end of the average range of SPAC returns post-acquisition announcement.** The concept of \u201ctontine\u201d comes from a popular insurance policy during the early 1900s where investors are paid out more as other members of the fund die. The concept is relevant to $PSTH because the SPAC will distribute warrants from investors that redeem their units at the initial business combination (these are investors who \u201cdie\u201d) to investors who decide not to redeem. This will promote a more successful business combination because a SPAC can lose a lot of traction if investors decide to redeem their units for the base price if they do not like the target company. \n\n**Key Stock Risks**\n\n1. **Potentially high opportunity cost given $PSTH has stated a time frame of up to 2 years to find a target company.** SPACs typically have a two year time frame in which they need to identify and acquire a company. By investing in a SPAC early on, investors are committing their money to a 2 year time frame in which the SPAC\u2019s share price may not increase significantly. Until the SPAC announces an acquisition, the shares may remain at a slight premium and sometimes may drop under the initial SPAC IPO price.\n2. **Potentially high premium at IPO given excitement around SPACs and $PSTH in particular.** Given the current market conditions and the excitement around $PSTH in particular, the share price may trade at a premium at IPO. This puts investors at risk of paying too much before any real value-add catalysts have happened. \n3. **Bill Ackman has had a history of taking large risks which resulted in nearly $1B in losses.** Ackman is known for shooting for the stars and sometimes landing on his face, such as his Herbalife short, which cost him nearly $1B. There is no guarantee that Ackman will find a coveted target company that will result in significant returns for SPAC investors. SPACs that have done poorly post-acquisition announcements have traded at 30 - 40% of their IPO price.\n\n$PSTH is a SPAC that will catch many eyes because of its size, sponsor, and structure. Excitement will be enhanced even further as SPACs have had a lot of success recently with DraftKings, Virgin Galactic, and Nikola going public and have seen upwards of 700% returns. While there are a lot of drivers for $PSTH success, there are some risks to be considered. However, given the excitement around SPACs right now and the promising sponsor backing it, $PSTH is certainly a SPAC to consider.\n\n**Disclosure:**\n\nWe do not own shares of Pershing Square Tontine Holdings.

        "selftext": "* Tesla (TSLA) reports Q2 earnings after the close Wednesday (\\~4:10pm)\n* Options are pricing an expected move of 12% by this Friday, just over half of the move expected over the next month, which is about 20%.\n* The trading day following the prior earnings (in April) TSLA was higher by as much as +8.5% intraday before reversing and closing -2.5%. \n* On the day following the last 4 earnings, TSLA stock has closed higher twice and lower twice.\n\nHere is the 1 month expected move chart for TSLA, with this Friday's expiration (via Options AI technology)  highlighted (+/-11.6%):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8exo5wkkjfc51.png?width=582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dd04dcc0f9f2a55248845f35148635c3edf247b\n\nThat's nearly $200 in either direction. The prior earnings in April, the stock had a $100 range intraday between its high and low (about 11%)  but only closed down -2.5%. The most it moved in either direction that day was +8.5%. The stock then went sideways for a few weeks before launching higher in early June and nearly doubling.\n\n*Neutral* \\- First let's look at neutral strategies that isolate the earnings itself, expiring this Friday: [Fly and Condor comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.37.02-AM.png)\n\nThe fly is quite a lot of risk so we'll focus on the **Iron Condor**,  which is 10 wide (the call spread and put spread are each 10 dollars wide, so risk is the total credit received from the 10). Here's how it  looks on the chart, with breakevens set near the expected move: [Condor](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.45.51-AM.png)\n\n*Educational note - The reason the max gain of a condor is the total credit received of both spreads, whereas the max risk is the width of 1  spread (the wider of the two if they are not equal width) is because the stock can only be beyond the range in one direction on expiration, not both. Therefore one side will always expire worthless, at max gain, even if the other side is max loss.*\n\n*Bullish* \\- For those thinking directionally the expected move can be used to help determine strike selection. Here's some trades based on a bullish price target looking out a bit further in time beyond  earnings, to August expiration. The bullish consensus is about $1930 in  August: [Bullish trade comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.01.19-AM.png)\n\nHere's a closer look at the **long call spread** (+1590/-1910) to the expected move: [Call spread chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.48.46-AM.png)\n\nThe +1590/1910 call spread breaks even near $1687 in the stock. It  costs about $97, which when looking at the individual strikes is  \"striking\" because it is selling the 1910 calls at about the same price: [Strike comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.57.30-AM.png)\n\nIn other words, a call spread to $1910 can be bought for about the same price as buying the 1910 call outright. That breakeven is lower in the stock by more than $300. ($1687 vs $2007).\n\nLet's now zoom in on the bullish **short put spread** (-1590/+1270): [Short put spread chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.00.52-AM.png)\n\nThis is a high probability trade, that needs to risk more to make less. For those concerned about a collapse of implied volatility following an earnings event short spreads can be a way to express a  directional bias while also selling vol.\n\n*Bearish -* Going the other direction in August, (bearish expected move about $1275) we can see these trades, via Options AI technology: [Bearish trade comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.10.45-AM.png)\n\nWe see the bearish **short call spread** is on the other side of the advantage of the bullish long call spread above. It has to buy that really far out of the money call (1920 strike) to define its risk. But those calls are really bid up and a high implied vol, which severely damages its risk-reward profile. (It is selling an at the money  call at a lower vol than it is buying its out of the money call.)\n\nThe **long put spread**  (+1600/-1285) has a much lower breakeven, and therefore a worse probability of profit, but it does not have the same issues of unfavorable IV skew as the short call spread above. \n\nAlso, the  strikes of that spread can be moved to make the put spread a bit more in  the money, moving the breakeven closer to where the stock is trading,  and taking advantage of the skew on the upside strikes: [ITM put spread](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.19.27-AM.png)\n\nTesla is likely to move a lot today before the event so exact strikes will change, but the overall percentage expected move should be roughly the same for all these examples. \n\nFull post [here](https://www.optionseye.com/tesla-earnings-preview-expected-move-directional-and-neutral-spreads-tsla/).",

        "selftext": "Its the way the whole Tesla empire and the way Musk is going about building Tesla. Depending on where you live, you may not even know anyone who owns a Tesla or even seen one before in person, but Tesla is a household name. It's like an early Apple style, not everyone had their products but everyone knew what Apple was doing. Everyone says they keep losing money but they are expanding like crazy, following an early (and still today) Amazon strategy.\n\nTaking the two strategies both companies used to make them how successful they are today, and combining. Im not going to go into each strategy in detail because. Both of these are insanely large companies together valued at over $3 Trillion combined. Someone will tell me \"not everyone can afford a Tesla\" and I say doesnt matter, and lets now move into speculation. After all, we have learned recently the market is nothing more than retarded speculation.\n\nLets look into how far technology can go. Say solar technology becomes  so advanced Musk can give them to you for free, because he just keeps the electricity and it pays for the profit. If he can give that to everyone for free, everyone who needs a new roof will have saved $20k on what a normal roof would cost. That $20k is basically $20k off a new car if you are shopping for one, and if you buy a Tesla you can charge it at home and eliminate your fuel bill completely. Tesla is going to make financial sense, and every home owner in America is going to own a Tesla simply. This will open the doors to more people buying Tesla and effectively if you are well off enough to buy a home, you will almost certainly own a Tesla\n\n**Tl;dr: Tesla $3,250 share price issue most reasonably accurate in present day using the points I have read from others from the way Musk is taking Tesla**\n\nNow when this happens and actually becomes common, this is when Tesla is going to be sued for being a monopoly since they control two huge aspects of your life, part of your home and your transportation. Musk also has the Boring company, any city with traffic issues will want one and he can convince them to buy it. He will be making money from not only selling us the cars that take us around, but he will be building the tunnels that become our roads. You can quote me on this when I say that Tesla is going to be the first company since 1982 to be broken up by a government, and the best time to cash out will be right before this happens because even though Tesla is not technically the same company as solar panels and tunnels, there will still be some special ruling on it to break it up and no doubt cause a stock dip\n\nNow lets move on to r/WallStreetBet levels of retarded speculation. Musk knows this and he wont allow it to happen to Tesla. With his endorsement of Kanye West recently, showing the world he is willing to play around with politics, as any wannabe monopoly should to prevent being broken up. Now not saying Kanye is going to be winning this one (although apparently the world is fucking crazy so who even knows) but Musk has shown he can become friendly with the politicians and get them in bed, so Tesla will not be broken up. Tesla has the product to back this business model up, a benefit to citizens to not complain about what Tesla is doing, and politicians in his pocket because he is making so much fucking money\n\n**Tl;dr: \\~$17,000 share price**\n\nSo of course I know this subreddit, and shit never gets too retarded with speculation, so lets keep going and see what the FAR far future can hold for Tesla\n\nLets do a fucking retarded speculation that solar panels get so good, they can pay you a steady income and all you gotta do is have a solar roof. Musk just gave every homeowner a \"UBI\" before the government did. The better the panel technology gets, the more he can pay you. With the government in bed and UBI in place musk can have lawmakers make it law that do drive a car on the road, it has to be a self driving Tesla because Tesla is the only one to be doing this on this scale, and Musk knows you can afford it because Musk knows how much sunlight his panels profit you. Just like how today it is required for all cars to have a seatbelt for safety, self driving will be a requirement for all cars on public roads. Every driver in the country will be buying a Tesla, because Musk will be in bed with the politicians and the public will be non the wiser of what is happening because it is a benefit to everyone. Musk at this point is  worth so much he can knock out anyone who dares try and challenge him because he the Jeff Bezos of Jeff Bezos.\n\nNow lets move on to tinfoil hat level speculation, Elon is going after a ton of industries that are huge or will be huge soon, but Tesla is the biggest and will be the \"main\" brand. People said that Jeff Bezos is going to be the worlds first trillionaire, but I say it will be Elon Musk. He is going to take over or continue taking over so many large aspects of all the things people spend the most on (Transportation, Housing and Energy). Tesla will be huge but his solar roof will be his most successful product of all time once the technology gets there. With the insane amount of money this generates for him, he can now afford to buy literally every other company out from any industry and start his takeover of the world, and the enslavement of all of humanity because at this point it is too late to stop him and if people try and rise up against him he can cut all power to the world and prevent transportation by disabling vehicles, sitting up in his space fortress laughing at us. He will allow us electricity and transport and life as long as we continue to be ruled by him. He will have infinite wealth as he owns and controls everything, under the Tesla name. The only thing we will be left truly \"owning\" is our Tesla shares, because everything is now Tesla. He has expressed his interest in experimental weapons like his flamethrower and will use force if necessary to control humans and will do it all from space.\n\n**Tl;dr: Buy TSLA shares because Tesla shares are literally going to be the currency of the future as Papa Musk reigns over humanity**",

        "selftext": "So, as the title says, I\u2019m a 22-year-old looking for advice about how to handle a roughly $25,000-$30,000 inheritance that I\u2019m receiving. The money is in a Roth IRA at Fidelity. I have no idea what the money is currently invested in, how much is in buying power, and so on. I have a basic idea of how I want to manage the money, but I\u2019m looking for some insight on if I\u2019m in the right ballpark here and if so, how I could better execute my strategy. \n\nFor starters, I\u2019m probably going to sell everything, unless any of it overlaps with the ideas I\u2019m going to lay out in this post.\n\nFrom there, I want to invest half of the funds in dividend and value stocks, and index funds. \n\nI\u2019m thinking at least a quarter of that half, so an eighth of my entire portfolio spread across the three main US indexes, specifically invested in SPY, DOW, and QQQ. I\u2019m interested in investing either the QQQ or SPY portion in a 3x daily bull fund that traces that fund, specifically either TQQQ or SPXL, let me know what you think about that.\n\nThe next eighth I\u2019m wanting to invest into banks. Companies like JPM and C are underperforming the market so heavily right now, and they\u2019ve already confirmed that they\u2019re not cutting dividends. Yes, share buybacks are suspended pending future earnings requirements but I believe that JPM and C are well positioned enough to resume buybacks at the latest by the end of Q1 2021. I genuinely believe that banks are discounted right now and have potential for a great return if they return to their ATH\u2019s. I also like the prospect of their dividend income over time. \n\nThe next eighth I\u2019m wanting to put into funds specifically for their dividends. I don\u2019t really care about the YoY return on these tickers; I\u2019m just interested in the dividend. I\u2019d want to spread it across SPHD, MO, KO, ABBV, SPG, and VYM. \n\nAny suggestions for the last eighth of the long-term / low-risk portion of the fund would be appreciated. I\u2019m sure I couldn\u2019t go wrong with just going heavy on the dividend funds, but yeah, any suggestions would be cool.\n\nNow for the second half of the fund. I\u2019m wanting to approach this half with a more high-risk, high-reward strategy. \n\nFor the first half of this high-risk high-reward portion (quarter of my total portfolio), I\u2019m just going to invest in growth stocks/ETFs. A couple of tickers I have in mind are ARKK, SOCL, SMH, AMD, FSLY, TSLA, APPL, MSFT, FB, and AMZN.\n\nFor last quarter, I\u2019m not thinking YOLO on an FD type high risk high reward, but I\u2019d definitely like to dabble in options. And this is the portion of my investment that I\u2019m most open to suggestions and ideas. I have some basic ideas though. \n\nMy 1st idea is to keep a quarter of the portfolio in cash and sell cash secured puts on companies that I actually wouldn\u2019t mind buying 100 shares of at the strike. I\u2019d want to continually do this up until the day I inevitably get assigned and then actually purchase those shares. A couple of tickers that I have in mind for playing like this are SNAP and NCLH, (yeah cruise line RH meme stock I know). At which point I\u2019d acquire the shares and then sell covered calls on the shares on the way up, just to reap in additional benefits, again, not minding if I get assigned and have to sell them for that strike. I kind of like this idea the best out of any that I\u2019ve had, just because it seems like the lowest risk, I\u2019d be able to acquire 100 shares of a company that I see growth in, which would probably be the smartest long term play anyways. \n\nMy 2nd idea is to buy LEAPS on banks, specifically JPM or C. I\u2019d just buy calls within +5% of the strike and buy the furthest dated out possible. Simple yeah but I think getting a play with that much time and that much potential delta is a good idea, and its relatively low risk compared to my last idea.\n\nMy last idea is definitely the riskiest and basically, it\u2019s just buying calls for cruises and airlines for June of next year. A potential vaccine announcement, stimulus in the form of travel expense related tax write-offs, as well as the incoming wave of cabin-fever induced travel frenzy are all factors that could honestly cause them to pop-off at any time within the next year. \n\nTLDR;\n\nI\u2019m a 22-year-old inheriting somewhere between $25,000-$30,000 this week and I want to manage the money myself. I\u2019m pretending that each 8\u2019th is about $3,000 to be conservative. My general idea is this:\n\nLong-term, low risk: \n\n1/8 \u2013 US indices, specifically SPY, DOW, and QQQ. Let me know what you think about putting either the SPY or QQQ portion into SPXL or TQQQ.\n\n1/8 \u2013 Banks, probably literally just JPM and C, maybe a little bit of WFC but they suck. \n\n1/8 \u2013 Dividend stocks, specifically SPHD, MO, KO, ABBV, SPG, and VYM. \n\n1/8 \u2013 Want to allocate to a low-risk, long-term strategy and would like suggestions on what to allocate this to. \n\nHigher risk, higher reward:\n\n1/4 \u2013 High growth stocks and ETF\u2019s, specifically ARKK, SOCL, SMH, AMD, FSLY, TSLA, APPL, MSFT, FB, and AMZN. \n\n1/4 \u2013 Three different ideas. 1. Sell cash secured puts on SNAP and NCLH until I get assigned, at which point hold the shares and sell covered calls. 2. LEAPS on banks. 3. LEAPS on travel. \n\nOpen to suggestions, advice, criticism, anything. Any input at all is appreciated. Thanks everyone!",

There was often some light due diligence, key news which would impact the markets/a particular stock, and some intelligent discussion on equities.\n\nOver the past couple of months though, since the market rebound, the quality of content here, in my opinion, has massively declined.\n\n90% of the posts here now are something along the lines of \u201copinions on TSLA?!\u201d or \u201cAMD is holding up my portfolio\u201d or \u201cis now a good time to buy NIO?\u201d. To my interpretation, this is allowed in the rules but this is really what the pinned Daily Discussion should be used for. There should be a rule enforcing this, and mods should be removing posts which break this rule.\n\nThe other 10% of posts at the moment, especially in the last week which has been red, have been along the lines of \u201cstay strong, don\u2019t sell today, take some time out\u201d or \u201cwhat happened, I left the house, came back an hour later and TSLA is down 1%?!\u201d. Personally after coming through several -7%+ days in March, I just find these irritating. r/stocks always seemed to be about returning long term gains, not worrying about day fluctuations.\n\nI understand that at the moment this sub has a large number of new investors learning the ropes, but there needs to be more structure in my opinion.

        "selftext": "Hey fucktards. Listen up, because I probably don't have much time left on this planet. I am legit looking behind me every 5 seconds as I type this, cause shit is about to get pretty feisty for me.\n\nSome of you may have already seen my comment on the daily thread, and everything I said was true. So get some popcorn, get snug with your wife's boyfriend, and enjoy the story.\n\nFor some context, I'm pretty well off. Yes, we exist. Sorry my parents aren't strippers like yours. Tell me....what happens when you have 2 well-educated (Masters degrees) computer engineers in Director positions at well-renowned companies who have been working for around 30 years now, and these people live a pretty humble life??\n\nDing ding ding, correct. They have a hell of a nest egg. So yes, I received a \"small loan\" of $100,000. My parents' intention was for me to invest this money in solid blue-chip stocks, and possibly use the money to pay for a future graduate degree or use it as a down-payment for a house. \n\nWhat did I do instead? I found this fucking sub, the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy first stupid play: Put $10,000 into GNUS cause I read some dumbass article about how its going to be the \"next Netflix for kids\". What do you think happened the minute I bought the STOCK (not even options)......yup, correct!!!!111!!!!!1! It dropped down from 11 to fucking 3 bucks. Haven't checked that shit in a while but its probably like 1 dollar at this point. Stupid ass company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy second stupid play: OK so I thought, why not just go for the ACTUAL Netflix?? Literally can't fo tits up, right? Right?? Wrong. I played NFLX earnings. Put $10,000 into it, had +$10,000 gain, wanted even more money. What do you think happened in the next 2 days as I bagheld?? Lost every single penny of it. Well not every single penny, I was able to take back a respectable 40 bucks from my initial $10,000 investment. So -10,000 there.\n\nMy third and final stupid play: Put $17,000 into MSFT calls. OK I thought. Now this one DEFINITELY cant make me go Guh, its literaly fucking Microsoft. Solid company, they beat earnings, Satya Nadella is a chad, etc etc. Wrong once again. The MINUTE I buy these stupid retarded calls, the stock price shoots down to 199 from 211. I sit and watch The value of my 17k call go down to a mere 2k.\n\nToday I wake up and my dad randomly asks if he can \"check my account\", just to see how things are going. He says \"you probably have like a decent ten percent gain, right?\" and as I mutter something under my breath. My palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy, as he begins to type my password in. When the number flashes on the screen...\\*71k\\*, he spits out his water. \n\nGot around a 3 hour lecture, thats all I want to comment about that. So I hear I am sitting, typing up this bullshit for you autists, wondering whether I'm going to be able to eat dinner tonight. \n\nIf I could do it all over again, either I would actually stick to blue chip-stocks, and only play with \"house money\" if I was gonna do options, or just not play this stupid fucking rigged game at all, and check my account again in ten years when Apple is like $10,000 and Tesla is $100,000. Set it and forget it. Oh well, its to late now.\n\nSo buy up some cheap puts on my life, hope you guys enjoyed this story.",

He ripped off the state of Ohio by pushing through a bailout with taxpayer money, and then working to push utility prices up. \n\nSo naturally, $FE got rinsed today. Everyone rushed to panic sell, because who wants to hold shares of a company involved in an elaborate racketeering scheme? Down 17% during the day, down another 3% after hours, going from over $41 at open to currently $33.20 or so. Well guess what? That's a buying opportunity baby! \n\nBecause while FirstEnergy's name is plastered all over the news headlines, it was actually FirstEnergy Solutions that operated the nuclear plants and funneled the money to Householder and Friends. And FES is an old subsidiary of FirstEnergy.  FirstEnergy [cut ties with FES in March of 2018](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/firstenergy-ceo-says-generation-subsidiary-headed-for-bankruptcy-protection/517743/). FES soon after filed for bankruptcy, and then in February of 2019, [reemerged from bankruptcy and rebranded as Energy Harbor](https://www.crainscleveland.com/energy-and-environment/firstenergy-solutions-become-energy-harbor-keep-headquarters-akron). \n\nOh, and guess what's coming up?

        "selftext": "None of my friends or family care but NVDA was one of the first trades I ever made (51 shares at $68). I cashed out my original investment at 140 a share, then a bit more at 270, then again at 360 and finally sold the remaining 12 shares I had today at 400 a share.\n\nThe valuation right now is too insane for me to continue to hold. While I love the company, there is no way that they should be ranked in the top 16 companies in the S&amp;P in terms of market cap. They did 3.1B in revenue last quarter compared to intel who did 33B. I wish all my fellow NVDA holders good luck in the future, but personally believe they are priced to perfection in this market.",

        "selftext": "These past few days/weeks, we've seen some truly absurd moves in tech. Today alone, Tesla was up 10 percent, Netflix was up 8 percent, and Amazon is up about 20% the past few weeks on basically no news. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Nvidia, etc. are all at or above their mid-February valuations. What spooks me is not that these equities are moving upward, but it's that they are moving upward quickly and impulsively, with few pullbacks, and leaving the rest of the market in the dust. These are not the signs of a healthy new bull market; they are the signs of rampant speculation, euphoria, and greed. These mega-cap corporations are propping up the indices and are almost acting as safe havens for investors pulling out of travel, financials, consumer staples, energy, etc. We saw this rotation in full force yesterday when the Dow ended over -1% while the Nasdaq was around +0.5%. This is not to say that I think we are on the brink of collapse--bubbles can last a lot longer than any of us think they might.\n\nFor those of you who have exposure to big tech, how are you managing it? Are you planning to ride out what seems to be a massive, unstoppable wave upward or are you slowly taking profits along the way? How will upcoming earnings impact your strategy?",

How is this valued so low?\n\nWell my coworkers and I have been trading for a long time, and this is very likely one of them. *(Computer geeks are going to love this especially).*\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n$OSS, One Stop Systems, since its IPO in 2018, has been silently building a tech empire behind our backs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*You're gonna lose your literal mind when you read the next part:*)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**They are officially partnered with:** Apple, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Boeing, IBM, Lenovo, HP, Lyft, Puma, Toshiba, Thunderbolt, Universal Audio, Focusrite, and Cisco etc... These are only 15 of their 50+ major international partnerships.\n\n*(yes, this is a pennystock.)*\n\n**U.S. Military:** On top of this, OSS also has multiple million-dollar contracts with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Military, as they provide the pre-constructed systems and power required for AI intelligence, DLSS, and large scale data transfer.\n\n*(This sub goes batshit crazy when a pennystock lands even ONE of the above partnerships. They have more than 50 already in motion.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What do they do? What makes them so special?**\n\nOSS in layman\u2019s terms is a company that takes top-end processors and GPUs, and uses their PCIe gen 4.0 expansion technology to merge them into a military-grade/data center supercomputer.\n\nBut aren\u2019t there many companies that can do this? No. They are the only company in the world with a PCIe 4.0 expansion system that can support NVIDIA\u2019s top end GPU\u2019s. (*Nvidia A-100*)\n\nThis means that they own nearly 100% of the market share in Nvidia's latest PCIe GPU technology.\n\n*(PCIe gen 3.0 is the only other option, but is 50% slower than PCIe 4.0.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What else makes them so special?** Their Financials.\n\nCompare their financials to the pennystocks we always talk about on this subreddit. It\u2019s absurd. They ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY.\n\nOSS's latest 10-K showed a record $ 60 MILLION in revenue, a 57% increase YoY.\n\nSome of the biggest companies in the world like Amazon, took over 10 years to make their first dollar. \n\nOSS is only on YEAR 2 and they are only $1 MILLION away from becoming a profitable operation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How is this possible?** Three reasons:\n\n1. They completely dominate the high-end PCIe sector of the tech industry. I challenge you to find a single other PCIe 4.0 expansion system on the market.\n2. Their CEO David Raun has led two companies to record revenues in the PCIe and NVMe industry, and one was bought out by Broadcom.\n3. They are at the forefront of far too many industries that require this level of technology. (see below for a few examples)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThey are the preferred OEM for Nvidia:\n\n[OSS Introduces the World's First and only PCIe 4.0 Expansion System for Nvidia.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oss-introduces-world-first-pcie-150010777.html)\n\n[OSS and Nvidia](https://www.onestopsystems.com/nvidia-gpus)\n\n[Official PR from NVIDIA](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/worlds-top-system-makers-unveil-nvidia-a100-powered-servers-to-accelerate-ai-data-science-and-scientific-computing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nU.S. Military Defense:\n\n[OSS Military Defense, Navy, Air, and Ground forces.](https://www.onestopsystems.com/defense)\n\n[Latest Order from U.S. Navy](https://ir.onestopsystems.com/press-releases/detail/163/oss-orders-for-new-u-s-navy-ai-threat-detection-system-top)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAI Learning, DLSS, and Self-driving vehicles:\n\n[OSS Reveals World's First Solution for AI Learning that incorporates NVIDIA GPUs and ARM-based servers.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/19/1949447/0/en/OSS-Introduces-Industry-s-First-Solution-Incorporating-NVIDIA-GPUs-with-NVLink-and-Marvell-ThunderX2-Arm-based-Servers.html)\n\n[OSS AI on the Fly](https://www.onestopsystems.com/ai-on-the-fly)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMachine Learning:[ OSS Machine Learning Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/machine-learning)\n\nMedical:[ OSS Medical Pre-built Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/medical)\n\nOil Industry:[ OSS Oil and Gas Industry Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/oil-and-gas)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are about a hundred more links, presentations, and conference calls that could be added to this post, but it would simply make it too long. *(We will be releasing follow up posts throughout the week to break up the information.)*\n\n$2 for a pennystock generating $60 million of revenue in its second year?\n\n$2 for a company that literally dominates an entire section of its industry?\n\n$2 for a company that is partnered with over 50+ major companies?\n\n$2 for a company that literally makes DOUBLE its ENTIRE MARKET CAP?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Vanguard increases their holdings by 103%, something's up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*(Further in-depth analysis will be posted tomorrow and throughout the week.)*\n\nA few of the topics to be covered are: product and competitor assessment, corporate presentations/conference calls, and financial breakdown.

I feel it is a responsibility to give back to the WSB community as I believe I have learned from others sharing their experience.\n\n\\#1: Pick only a few stocks to trade that you strongly believe they have a competitive edge over peers.\n\nFor me it was NVDA and COSTCO that paid off big for me. \n\n\\#2: You have to be disciplined. \n\nI bought COSTCO calls beginning of June and I actually lost about $40,000 as you can see from the dip in June. Thank God I stayed true and didn't sell. I had over 200 calls with different strike prices expiring all on 7/17/20 and I told myself I was going to hold until the June sales report.\n\n\\#3. Options trading is more luck and less analysis or acumen than stock investing. You have to time it right even if you picked winners. In the long run, I think it will be hard to continue winning. Get out while you're up.\n\n\\#4. Something I read from other posting on WSB: Don't fight the trend. The current trend is stonks only go up, brrrr. \n\nHappy gambling, poland out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n346lmy55v951.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d389fa7f62e945762ded15b1832de0ead57afd8c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zd8yu0s25v951.png?width=982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66015f699411cdff8656b54701d252e6e17af189",

Earnings SZN is upon us and the time is now to bring forth our genius into the markets. I\u2019ll go through some of the volume I caught as well as unusual activity.\n\nIf you want to check out the option tool for yourself, go to [SwaggyStocks Option Flow](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices**\n\nAMD caught some momentum Thursday as the stock surged nearly 8%. Big-time call flow came through expecting the stock to be trading at about $60 by mid August. There\u2019s been an uptick in the semi\u2019s as whole (NVDA, MU, INTC) as they are forecasting solid earnings throughout the pandemic as the world goes deeper into the digital rabbit-hole.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/waa6l9l0eia51.png?width=2954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c91c65e472b0cbedb5ea16ec1364461f0253788\n\n**DKNG \u2013 DraftKings**\n\nDraftkings stock price has taken a beating over the last couple weeks after reaching all-time-highs earlier in the month. I caught some call buying in August expiration as well as some leaps 2021 leaps. The stock is at short-term lows, looks like the players are expecting a bounce and the DraftKings brand to develop into one of the strongest in the SportsGambling sector.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6lfh0a4eia51.png?width=2820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f7fa4b5fd9ceba04c86e6058347745f80fb3f8e\n\n**KO \u2013 Coca Cola**\n\nBig call buying in Coca Cola (KO) on Friday. 3,700 (900 OI) call contracts for July expiration and a premium paid of $550k. Another trade was in September contracts at the $47 strike price, 7.5k contract for a premium of just under $1 million. Pretty high volume for KO which typically doesn\u2019t have a lot of option flow. Pepsi Co is reporting earnings tomorrow, looks like this could be a proxy play on Pepsi where KO tries to ride some of the momentum.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbbuv0c6eia51.png?width=2600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=060882c26d52ab5fa1299180734ee53eaf836135\n\n**INTC \u2013 Intel Corporation**\n\nI caught some interesting activity in INTC on Friday. This play is expecting INTC to report strong and have a good showing into the fall. Here are the two plays I caught. A player purchased a long CALL option at $60 strike and sold the CALL at the $65 strike price, essentially opening a bull debit spread. They then sold PUTS at the $52.5 strike (currently 10% OTM) for a credit of $1.3 million. The exact same play was recognized with another 10k contracts at the same strikes and expiration (October 2020). It\u2019s possible this was all one player, or possible two firms mimicking the first play as the strikes/expiration/volume are all very similar. The players are betting that the stock will stay ABOVE $62 by October, but if the stock price stays anywhere above $52.50-$60 range their losses are limited.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hoylbk3heia51.png?width=2736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f226af023a53ddf266b16f5dcc3ab3c3d7a38f0\n\n**The Banks (JPM, BAC, C)**\n\nDidn\u2019t spot anything quite unusual with the banks, other than heavy volume going to earnings (I believe all are reporting Tues-Thurs this week). Looks like most of the volume was predominately bullish sentiment, however, in reality it is quite balanced on both sides. The banks have been getting absolutely hammered throughout the Pandemic and haven\u2019t seen much recovery. This is mainly due to new fiscal policies being introduced that look like they are here to stay. Have the banks bottomed? We\u2019ll find out this week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ykbro4jeia51.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69dca10f7af71ff807544c27f16675fbf4311ea2",

Just dig it up in my history.\n\nThere's profit-taking and sector rotation and then there is collapse. The first is a very healthy trim of the froth that built up over the past few months. Investors are simply reallocating the profitable portions of their book to previously avoided sectors to participate in their anticipated rise.  Collapse is when everybody, and I mean everybody, sell absolutely everything, even at deep losses just to get out.\n\nRight now, we are seeing a measured and controlled trimming.  Short-term cash might move over to tradeable opportunities in the non-tech space for a few weeks, maybe even just days but the US economy is an absolute mess right now. There are truly only two smart positions, well-establish tech equity and cash. It will flow back into tech at a discount.  The same people selling are the same people buying back at a 20% discount.\n\nI've got no advice for you if you're rolling dice with P&amp;Ds, buying bankrupt companies or flipping ridiculously short-term options but if you're like most people here, buying companies because they make sense over a longer time horizon and especially in a post Covid world (if that's even possible), the next few days or weeks will not matter after a few months.\n\nSo what do I currently own?\n\n30% cash, PFE, WMT, MSFT, AMZN, AMD, NVDA, GOOG, AAPL and TSLA.  All are still substantially in the green. I've trimmed about 25% of all positions last week and move over the cash. VIX is currently at 28.  In March, it was 80.   \n\nSo folks, it's cool. Don't panic.",

        "selftext": "  \n\nMy fellow bulls, this is my first DD which gives this a 100% chance success rate. I\u2019ll keep this short and sweet. While you guys spent $85 watching grown men hug in an island for hours, I spent my time securing tendies for you. TSM is the play to make next week and here\u2019s why:\n\nTSM $64\n\nTSM is the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker and produces for Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, and Huawei. They do more than just this but I suggest doing your own research as I promised to keep this short and sweet. They are in a great position financially and have recently reported revenue in June of 40% increase over the last year and a 28% increase from the previous month. Obviously 5G stocks have been mooning, and although TSM will not be responsible for creating the technology, they will likely be the company producing those 5G chips. On top of this, Merica\u2019s government is paying TSM to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. TSM produces chips for the U.S. F-35 jet. Setting up a plant in the U.S. will make it much easier for future productions of any military related needs, as they have less restrictions to worry about. \n\nAside from all of that, TSM has also recently agreed to the world\u2019s largest corporate green power purchase agreement. WTF does this mean? Well this purchase gives them ownership of some of the world\u2019s largest wind farms. Their goal is to be a 100% renewable energy operated company. Why the fuck does this matter? Besides it making this world a safer and healthier blah blah blah, it is a nice PR move. People love this kind of shit and it will definitely shed positive light into the company. More importantly, major companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook, are part of the RE100 (Renewable Energy 100). In the future TSM may be the supplier of this renewable energy to these major companies. \n\nAnd for those of you who care, the technicals on this are very bullish. It is not overbought nor is it oversold and the MACD crossover is signaling buy. I\u2019d say we hit at least $70 by EOW. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/wc0waMF](https://imgur.com/a/wc0waMF)\n\nAll the \u201cfinancial experts\u201d rate this as a great buy. Earnings will also be released 07/16 pre market. This is not an earnings play but regardless they are expected to beat their estimated earnings. I will be getting shares Monday and buying 08/28 $70c and 01/15/21 $80C. I will post proof of positions on Monday or as the kids say nowadays\u2026. BAN",

        "selftext": "Right now, there's a lot going on. We're at the start of a horrible earnings season. Tension between US and China. US Elections coming up between a crazy guy and a senile guy. So many companies are extremely overvalued. \n\nSo what do you think of the situation. Are you getting your money out? Are you spending it all and make decisions when something happens? Lowering your positions and hold a big cash position for a new crash / recession?\n\nIn my case, I was thinking about selling before elections and see how the consequences of the crisis would pay out. It's great that the Fed lends all that money, but it has to be paid off at some point as well. With lowered revenue and higher costs for adapting to the virus along with the stock market being this overvalued, I could see recession coming up.\n\nBut that would be timing the market, cause I would buy again at some point. That's why I decided to rearrange my portfolio a bit, focussing on small-mid cap companies with steady financials, active in growing sectors (web services, AI, digitalization of healthcare, fintech,...) and preferably IPO'd in the last 2 years. Those stocks wont fall that hard and would rebound pretty quick, so I'm pretty well set up  holding for the next decade.\n\nCompanies like TSLA and NVDA are very high on my watchlist, they are the future imo. But there's no way I could buy into them right now at this valuation. They would get hit way too hard if the bubble breaks. I'm kinda dividing my watchlist into two sides. The ones buying right now and the ones to buy during a crash or not buy at all cause I've missed the boat.",

It's a rapidly growing product that I believe will protect interests as Latin America develops. I believe that their development of privacy-focused serverless computing and video streaming infrastructure was what was necessary for it to experience enormous growth in the next few years.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/) \n\n\\- **Corteva - AGRICULTURE BIOTECH**\n\nCorteva is a powerfully focused agritech investment. They have deep investments in corn, which is an enormous product that will always persist in Mexico and US agriculture.\n\n [https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening](https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening) \n\n\\- **Facebook - E-COMMERCE**\n\nI believe Facebook will play a really interesting role with Canada's Shopify in Latin America. WhatsApp is enormously popular in Mexico due to Facebook's networking investments, making it cheap to use. WhatsApp is better suited for Mexico's barter style economy, while Instagram seems to serve America's ad-centric transactions better. I believe we will be seeing Facebook develop deep business support with Shopify that is easy to use for billions of people across different economies.  Some of the technology is actually faschinating, as you can purchase products and test products using filters and 1-swipe purchases.\n\n [https://www.facebook.com/business/shops](https://www.facebook.com/business/shops) \n\n**- Kansas City Southern - US-MEXICAN RAIL**\n\nKansas City Southern is an extremely important trade vector between Mexico and the US. In particular, Texas and Monterrey. It's well diversified to deliver at a cost effective rate between changes in agriculture, energy, automotive, machining, food, and more.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf\\_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Adobe - GRAPHICS**\n\nI'm completely impressed by Adobe's growth and acquisitions across multiple sectors. I believe Adobe is a great longterm AR play as it maintains a close relationship with Apple, develops software for video games, movies, digital signatures, and e-commerce, architecture, design, and an endless array of other software solutions.\n\n [https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/](https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Paypal - FINANCIAL ACCESS**\n\nPaypal is interesting in regards to US-Mexico.Paypal has always demonstrated itself as a pioneer. It's very easy to send remittance money through Xoom. It's easy to send money to your friends via Venmo. Their credit system is awfully fair, which is helpful in a nation like Mexico that's critically underbanked. \n\nThey also had an excellent acquisition with Honey. I believe they'll be generating billions through their transactions on Amazon and other industries and will force fintech to rethink how far financial technology can go.\n\n [https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:\\~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Texas Instruments  - EMBEDDED SYSTEMS**\n\nI've selected for TI over AMD and Nvidia  since TI has a greater distribution. You'll find TI in automobiles, space rockets, airplanes, CNCs, school calculators, concrete producers, and so on.  Either way, AMD is listed below as a supplement to an already cloud-heavy setup.\n\n [https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx) \n\n\\- **Teradyne - SYSTEMS TESTING &amp; INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION**\n\nTeradyne is part of the COVID restructure. I believe networking hardware chips are only  going to be more needed as an economic driver. Teradyne has an excellent client base regarding that and also develops and impressive amount of industrial automation robots across warehouses, farms, and so on. The future is inevitably automation, and this is my participation in that.\n\n [https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/](https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/) \n\n\\- **Microsoft - SOFTWARE AUTOMATION**\n\nI'm really excited to see Microsoft's future in software automation and services. They have a really interesting position with regards to gaming, cloud computing, and wonderful acquisitions for Github &amp; NPM and an array of other tools that can perform intensive software automation.\n\n [https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/) \n\n\\- **Costco - QUALITY CONSUMER GOODS**\n\nCostco has an excellent selection process that can be replicated across multiple cultures. The business pays their customers well which in turn results in supreme customer service and care.\n\n [https://futurefuel.io/employee-benefits/costco-careers/](https://futurefuel.io/employee-benefits/costco-careers/) \n\n\\- **Berkshire.B - QUALITY BUSINESSES**\n\nBerkshire.B is selected for similar reasons to Costco. I'm excited for Abel's leadership in the 21st century and they're simply an elegant long term investment with respects to quality business selection.\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/the-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/the-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio) \n\n\\- **XLB Materials ETF - PROCESS ENGINEERING**\n\nXLB has an excellent selection of dominant businesses with respects to their industry like Sherwin-Williams, Linde PLC, and Ecolab.\n\n [https://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xlb/holdings](https://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xlb/holdings) \n\n\\- **Tesla - FUTURE MANUFACTURING**\n\nTesla is interesting as it develops robust applications and development of EV batteries, battery solutions, industrial automation and is helmed by a person who is able to mine engineering resources and relationships from SpaceX.\n\n [https://electrek.co/2020/06/17/tesla-new-deal-panasonic-battery-supply/](https://electrek.co/2020/06/17/tesla-new-deal-panasonic-battery-supply/) \n\n\\- **AMD - COMPUTING ACCESSIBILITY**\n\nI feel that the name of the game for AMD is the ability to reduce energy costs and low the cost of computing. They have been excelling at this for years now and I believe this patience will pay off enormously as AMD conquers the maintenance of data centers around the world.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-of-why-cloudflare-chose-amd-epyc-for-gen-x-servers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-of-why-cloudflare-chose-amd-epyc-for-gen-x-servers/)",

Every full-home console from 2013 (Xbox one, One S, One X, Ps4, PS4 slim, Ps4 pro) a PLUS THE ENTIRE \u201cnext-gen\u201d console market. AMD APUs have literally ZERO competition unless you consider the NVidia Tegra X1 (the custom APU in the Nintendo switch) \\*PC gaming specifically - AMD DOMINATES the multi core market. This would appeal to consumers who like to play games... but also productivity / and or streaming / and or video editing etc\n\n\\*FINAL fundamental note - You can\u2019t compare an AMD stock present against its speculative potential without mentioning both NVDA &amp; INTC\n\nLETS GET STARTED\n\n\\*Evidence - (Fine. If you insist - I\u2019ll back up my thoughts with some [Graphs](https://imgur.com/gallery/x0UiCyl))\n\nReferenced TICKERS AMD +69% on the year (lol) NVDA +145% on the year INTC +23% on the year (disappointing due to its previous trajectory)\n\nSPECULATION \\*AMDs poor relative performance to NVDA (GPU market) can directly be correlated to two things\n\n1. The lack of a high performance GPU. NONE of amds current line-up (remember we have a future generation coming but the current gen is lackluster for high performance.\n2. Lack of reach to new gaming customers (everyone who really really wanted a Ryzen cpu probably has one by now)\n3. Price to performance ratio is not great on their GPUs but is EXCEPTIONAL on the Ryzen platform I admit\n\nNVDA has the RTX 2000 series (we won\u2019t compare the GPUs that haven\u2019t been officially announced yet from these two companies) \u2014\u2014 \\*NVDA - how is it up so much?\n\n1. Market Leader\n2. Strong leadership under CEO Jensen Huan(probably spelled that wrong sorry I\u2019m a lazy shit sometimes)\n3. High performance and \u201cattempts\u201d at a budget GPU option.\n\nRTX 2060 super cards allow gamers to build a \u201cbeast\u201d of a PC these days for -under 1500$\n\n[Proof](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/mstbPn) \\^ under penalty of permanent BAN I swear to WS gods I put that list together in under 2 minutes. THATS how easy it is to build a pc in this modern era. \u2014\u2014 And finally INTC\n\n1. Dominated the entire sector as a market leader for 7 years. See Core i \u201cgen\u201d CPUS. From sandy bridge to Kaby lake - this company was at the top.\n2. Gained momentum because AMDs FX serious sucked bro\n3. Name recognition. Has your mom heard of intel before? It\u2019s quite possibly. AMD? Less likely. \u2014- Conspiracy level speculation? Okay here it is: NVDA could be a market leader in self driving cars. This could put them in direct competition with TSLA.\n\nTLDR: So what are the plays bitch?\n\nAMD has a LOT of room to Grow. But this is long term. I have a long position of at least 10 shares with them. I\u2019d have to check my other brokers to give an exact number.\n\nNVDA - Why aren\u2019t you buying this stock? Have you looked at the charts? I can go to war defending this company\u2019s stock price.\n\nINTC - Fuck! Before Covid this was a definite buy. If INTC continues to grow it\u2019s market share in the APU, CPU, and GPU markets this company could be fucked in 5+ years or so. Trade at your own caution - but I\u2019m BUYING.",

It\u2019s never a good thing when and overbought index makes a new all-time high and then closes down and on the lows.  The DJIA was -396.85 (1.51%), NASDAQ -89.76 (.86%), S&amp;P 500 -34.30 (1.08%), the Russell -26.89 (1.86%) and the DJ Transports -108 (1.1%).  The internals were 3:1 down on NYSE and 2.5:1 on NASDAQ with volume on the NYSE 2:1 down also.

We also own a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .75, and we also added a spread using the NEM 8/65 / 70 calls at a $1.30 debit.\n \n\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/5afUNy48sFI\n\nOur Discord Forum link is on the video description..\n\nSECTORS: The FAANG names all finished near the lows, several like MSFT coming off a new all-time high and closing down on the day.  Not a good sign if they follow-thru to the downside tomorrow.  Also having trouble was CCL, who has had to cancel several cruises for Q4 and Q1 2021.  It closed $14.57 -1.04 (6.7%).  Add to that, the UAL report that it is giving warnings that it will be laying off \u201c10\u20192 of thousands of employees.\u201d  UAL finished $32.55 -2.66 (7.55%).  These two companies do not operate in a vacuum, so both groups are in jeopardy, again.  Novavax (NVAX) got a $1.6billion grant from BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) to help it along in it\u2019s search for a workable vaccine.  The stock, up from $8 as late as the end of February had worked its way up to $85 last month and opened today $104 and traded as high as $111.77 and finished $104.56 +25.12 (31.63%).  Don\u2019t get too crazy with this one, this is not its first rodeo.  In 2015 it was trading $300 before it had a failure on a different vaccine and the stock fell to $80 before a rally and then in the week of 9/16/2016 it fell further from $169.80 to $23.20 and then on to the adjusted (1:20 reverse) low around $4.00.  We\u2019ll hope for a better outcome this time around.  Walmart was the big winner on a RECODE that said they are ready to launch Walmart +, to compete with Amazon Prime for same day grocery delivery and next day for other products.  Its move today added 55 DP\u2019s to the averages.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal since for the same money, with Prime you get streaming too.  And the margins on groceries are razor thin.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was MIXED with TSN -.67, BGS +.70, FLO -.03, CPB -.11, CAG +.54, MDLZ -.22, KHC +.22, CALM +.03, JJSF -1.43, SAFM +.54, HRL -.14, SJM +.18, PPC -.34, KR -.03, and PBJ $31.56 +.06 (.19%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB - -1.72, ABBV +.72, REGN +14.50, ISRG -9.30, GILD -.13, MYL -.43, TEVA -.29, VRTX +8.35, BHC -.59, INCY +.86, ICPT -.74, LABU +3.36, and IBB $140.15 +.71 (.51%).\n \nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.13, CGC -.40, CRON -.19, GWPH +2.93, ACB +.17, CURLF -.07, KERN -.62 and MJ $13.08 -.01 (.08%).\n\nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -8.59, GD -3.29, TXT -1.73, NOC -7.89, BWXT -1.78, TDY \u2013 7.84, RTX -2.12 and ITA $160.32 -6.10 (3.67%).\n\n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M +.03, JWN -.58, KSS -.72, DDS -.88, WMT +9.11 (7.66%), TGT -1.40, TJX -1.84, RL -2.49, UAA -.41, LULU -6.66, TPR -.51, CPRI -.18 and XRT $43.78 -.43 (.97%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were MIXED with GOOGL -7.40, AMZN -44.69, AAPL +1.06, FB -.91, NFLX +.69, NVDA +3.06, TSLA +9.42, BABA -2.60, BIDU -4.54, CMG -10.92, CAT -2.03, BA -8.57, DIS -.53 and XLK $106.34 -.77 (.72%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS \u2013 7.91, JPM2.52, BAC -.63, MS -1.32, C -1.53, PNC -3.15, AIG -1.36, TRV -2.45, AXP -3.48, V -3.13, and XLF $22.93 -.48 (2.05%).\n \nOIL, $40.62 -.01. Oil was lower in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied in the morning. I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. We needed a close over the previous high close of $40.83 and while we were there, we sold off to close below that number.  The stocks were higher with XLE $36.26 -1.19 (3.18%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,809.80 +16.40. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said \u201cwe\u2019ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.\u201d  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 and half of what was left today @ $3.20, we closed $3.20 + .80 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,290 -65. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.76 - .19 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

It has been very successful over the last 4 months but I'm afraid I may be missing something because it seems too easy so far which means it's very likely I'm doing something that is overly risky or misunderstood. I get that this is a great market but I'm trying to get honest feedback as to whether this is a dangerous or simplistic strategy in \"normal\" markets. What I'm doing:  \nSelling puts typically at only 1 or 2 week DTE at a delta of between 8 and 15 with an IV between 40 and 100. I only sell at a probability of profit +80% and a minimum of 20% annualized return- with the short duration it can be much higher. I also try to find good support levels to set my strike under and select stocks in a strong uptrend. My win rate has been over 95% as far as having to roll.  \nFor example today I sold a NVDA $380 put for this Friday for $1.00 at a -12 delta and a POP of 89%. So it seems like a solid likelihood I can make it three days without it dropping ITM.  \nWhat's wrong with this deep OOTM and very short DTE strategy? I understand many people go 20-45 days at a higher delta which just seems to a noob like me that it's a long time for something to go wrong but I might be thinking of that the wrong way. Experienced traders I respect seem to focus on 30-45 days DTE at a higher delta like 30- has that strategy been shown to have a higher expectancy? Is the use of such a short DTE overly risky?\n\n  \nThanks in advance for any guidance,",

Lack of reach to new gaming customers (everyone who really really wanted a Ryzen cpu probably has one by now)\n2. They already have the X series CPUs for those who want well binned chips / top silicon. \n3. The consumer CPU market for AMD is now showing long term potential as a profit puppy. \n\u2014\u2014\n[https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results](https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results)\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nAMD has a strong potential to beat Q3 expected earnings. Why? Because their production has a solid chance of recovering by then. Why? Because they have a somewhat diversified access to memory, and the raw materials needed for production.\n\n[AMD](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:AMD/explorer/interest_coverage)\n\nAMD - has had a rough go of it, but it\u2019s starting to recover. Yes In the consumers minds, and it\u2019s starting to show in the numbers as well.\n\nDirectly from the post linked above regarding AMD earnings\n\nQ4 2019 Results\n\n\"Revenue of $2.13 billion was up 50 percent year-over-year primarily driven by the Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue was up 18 percent compared to the prior quarter as a result of higher revenue in the Computing and Graphics segment partially offset by lower revenue in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment.\"\n\n^ Clearly this is the direction the company is headed in my opinion.\n\n*What are my price targets?\n\nI fully expect AMD to hit ATH of 70$ per share by Q4 or Q1 2021. Why? Because there is demand. Look at what this stock was in feb 2019 and then look at its peak before Covid. Compare that to its current price. See what I\u2019m getting at here?\n\nHas anyone seen the MU surge? Memory is in high demand. Specially flash NVME and SSDs. \n\nWhat does this mean for AMD?\nAMD is heavily dependent on companies like micron (TSMC, Samsung, etc) GDDR6, flash memory, and VRAM are all dependent on this sector.\n\nThe amount of improvement in the memory sector -is staggering. Flash Memory is finally \u201caffordable\u201d to most mid-range computing customers. At the least - far more improvement here than simply PUMPING more GHz into the same cores and SMT that INTC always does. \n\n\n-----\nTLDR: Everyone already hopped on their **** why does this matter now... so what?\n\nAMD has a LOT of room to Grow. But this is long term. - I can\u2019t speak to how the current market trends will affect this stock in the very short term. \n\nThis is literally a power play - in my opinion - showing how they can adapt to a changing market and their literally competing with theirselves now (just like NVDA competes with itself on its own high end GPUs)",

        "selftext": "Hi Folks!\n\nLong post but bear with me. I had a Motif Investing account which I opened in 2016. For those who don't know, Motif used to offer theme based investing (for instance Cloud Computing was a theme). I had a 4-5 themes and each theme had a bunch of stocks each.\n\nFast forward to this year, Motif sent me an email that they were being sold to Folio Investing and that they have a monthly fee of 19.99 per month. I used to pay a small fee on Motif for free stock advisories in different themes and free rebalancing. They also had free individual stock trading which I used instead of Robinhood. However, I decided the 20 dollar monthly fee was too much for my \\~40k portfolio in Motif. So I called Vanguard and had them initiate a rollover. I have most of the rest of my portfolio with them and very happy so far. It went well except, Vanguard doesn't do fractional shares that Motif did. So eventually Motif had to liquidate all the fractional shares before rolling over the account complete. I didn't mind that either coz I have a good chunk of Tax loss Harvesting done in March this year when shit hit the fan. \n\nNow my question is, what do I do with the individual stocks in my Vanguard account? Here are the companies I own - \n\nABB, ABBV, ABT, ADM, AFL, ALB. ALL, AMCR, AMD, AME, AMOT, AMZN, AOS, ATVI, BABA, BEN, BILI, BRKS, CGNX, CMCSA, CVX, DEO, DIS, EA, EMR, EVRI, EXPD, FTI, GLUU, GPC, HEI, HLX, IGT, IRBT, IRM, ISRG, JNJ, LEG, LMNX, MDT, MG, MITK, MSFT, NFLX, NICE, NTES, NUE, NVDA, OMCL, ON, PBCT, PH, PPG, RXN, SCPL, SE, SGMS, SNE, SOHU, T, TER, TJX, TM, TRV, TTWO, TXT, UBER, UL, V, VNE, WB, WBA, XOM, ZNGA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother piece of information - I am sitting on a gain on the total but there are certainly losers in there. I know it is a lot of information to parse through. But is there any advice on how to consolidate this? My investing philosophy has evolved and I have most of my money in low cost index funds now and would prefer to do that for this piece of my portfolio as well. Thanks for reading!\n\nTLDR: How do I consolidate a bunch of individual stocks into index funds?",

We also added a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .7\n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a decent start and rallied to a high of +210 by 9:45 but didn\u2019t hold it and was back down on the day by 11:00 but wouldn\u2019t give up, and spent all day between + / - 100 until the close when it sold off in the last 15 minutes and finished -77.91 (.30%).  The DJIA was the outcast with the NASDAQ +95.86 (.95%) at another new high, S&amp;P +15.57 (.50%), the Russell -14.05 (.97%), and the DJ Transports -19.71 (.21%) even though FDX and UPS had added 120 DJT points to the average.  Market internals were even on the NYSE while the NASDAQ was actually 9:7 Down, regardless of its new high close.  The DJIA was 20:9 down and WMT unchanged with no winners or losers moving over 20 DP\u2019s. Volume on NYSE was average but on the NAZ it was about 20% higher than yesterday.  Hong Kong and Covid-19 were the big negatives today and it was the ISM gains to 52.6, well over the 50 break-point, and the excitement of the PFE vaccine news were the big positives that helps us higher.\n \n \n \n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/dr95ohxzdjo\n\nOur Discord forum link is in the video description..\n\n\nSECTORS: The transports were the sector in the spotlight with FDX earnings (a loss) sending the stock higher by $16.44, although it closed just over its low of the day with a gain of 11.7% after being up over 14% for the biggest one-day gain since coming public in 1978.  UPS also gained 2.9% and between them they added 120 point to the average but still couldn\u2019t keep the average in positive territory.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN -.53, BGS -.08, FLO -.11, CPB -.32, CAG +.50, MDLZ -.05, KHC -.21, CALM -.54, JJSF -2.80, SAFM -3.21, HRL -.83, SJM -.59, PPC -.15, KR -.20, and PBJ $31.06 -.17 (.54%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB -3.44, ABBV +1.22, REGN -15.55, ISRG +5.71, GILD -.94, MYL -.23, TEVA -.82, VRTX -3.31, BHC +.13, INCY -1.32, ICPT -1.41, LABU +.59, and IBB $137.80 +1.11 (.81%).\n \nCANNABIS: was HIGHER with TLRY -.06, CGC +.25, CRON +.05, GWPH +3.53, ACB -.18, CURLF +.06, KERN -.16, and MJ $12.98 +.11 (.85%).\n\n \nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -3.92, GD -.86, TXT -.77, NOC +.70, BWXT -.18, TDY -6.76, RTX -.01, and ITA $163.19 -1.53 (.93%)\n \n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M -.26, JWN -.29, KSS -.63, DDS -.94, WMT -.23, TGT -.93, TJX +.64, RL -1.85, UAA -.12, LULU -2.82, TPR -.33, CPRI -.37, and XRT $43.06 +.18 (.42%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +23.95, AMZN +122.28 (4.43%), AAPL -.69, FB +10.03, NFLX +31.96, NVDA +1.49, TSLA +58.18 (5.39%), BABA +.60, BIDU +.91, CMG +17.52, CAT +.07, BA -1.85, DIS +1.45, and XLK $104.66 +.17 (.16%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -.12, JPM -.64, BAC -.44, MS -.74, C -.70, PNC -2.38, AIG -1.55, TRV -1.65, AXP -.84, V +.50, and XLF $22.94 -.20 (.86%).\n \n \nOIL, $39.82 +.55. Oil was lower in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied midday. I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. The stocks were higher with XLE $36.93 -.92 (2.43%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,779.30 -20.60. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said \u201cwe\u2019ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.\u201d  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 yesterday and we closed $2.81 - .49 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,325 + 140. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.77 + .17 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

NIO, VSLR, just to name a few. Its a frustrating time because you invest in a few things for short term, and a few things for long term. What are you looking at for some useful information? I dont mean websites telling me to invest into Amazon, Disney, Microsoft, NVDA, Apple etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nits a rough feeling seeing a stock at $6 last week, and double that today. We all see it, but then realize we didn't see it in time. Thats what i've been doing and im just chasing my tail looking at it going....well NOW do I invest? I know nobody has the right answer, but companies with a strong future are good investments. COVID isnt going anywhere anytime soon, so my MGM stocks will have to sit there for now. Election coming up, microsoft releasing info in a weekish, more iphones and more online shopping (seriously who got rich off overstock's...stock). Research forever, or buy apple and disappear for 10 years? My late night rant.",

The overarching theme behind these picks is **American Innovation &amp; Mexican Development.**\n\nI'm a 26 year old fintech engineer in the US and an avocado farmer in Mexico and I hold a strong conviction that investing in Mexican development will reward me well in the decades to come.\n\n**In a nutshell, the USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring and my strategy favors the Texas-Nuevo Leon economy and overall Mexican-American trade.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is Monterrey, Nuevo Leon\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png))\n\nI'm from a rural village south of Jalisco which produces far more agricultural goods like avocados alongside Michoacan.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very aware of the problems that Mexico faces but I also view Mexico as a sleeping giant that the US utilizes for capital efficiency in global trade. Mexico is part of a puzzle that fits in a large scope that involves other bulwark nations like Germany, Japan, Brazil, and India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[Bulwark Trading Nations\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86080247-51709b00-ba47-11ea-8d38-54da06916f57.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!\\[The North American Trade Block\\]([https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40](https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, Mexico is a nation in crisis. The economic damage narcotrafficking has delivered has resulted in:\n\n\\- \\[An increasing black market integration into the global money supply, in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars, resulting in a growing vacuum of theft AKA the Drug War &amp; Economics of Peace\\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\\_Secrecy\\_Act#Sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Secrecy_Act#Sanctions))\n\n\\- North American suppressed wage suppression\n\n\\- refugee style illegal immigration\n\n\\- NA workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- Mexican workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- A Mexican workforce and brain drain, as skilled and motivated laborers leave for opportunity and better pay who are loyal to both nations\n\n\\- Multiple events of civil unrest or civil disasters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- National cyncism against the current administration\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see this as a complex problem where most people's perspective is not complete or clouded by one of the reasons above. I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

        "selftext": "Hello, new investor here, I just started back in February right before the hit when everything was at it's highs. I had about $3000 invested into individual stocks like TSLA, MSFT, NVDA, etc but I unfortunately had to sell most of those a few weeks ago to pay bills because I am currently furloughed and it took me 15 weeks to get unemployment from the state of Florida. I also have $1500 in a Fidelity Roth that is split between FZROX, FZILX, and FXNAX.. which is still down. I also bought into my ESPP this year with Hilton so I probably should of sold some of that instead of the other ones but I was hoping to hold it at least for the two years to get the tax break. Anyways, I finally got all the unemployment owed to me in lump sums so I'm going to be ok for awhile and would like to reinvest at least half of it. I'm not sure if I should just stick with my Roth right now until it's maxed out or if I would be better in individual stocks at the moment. The 1500 was in my 2019 Roth so I think I have to start fresh with my 2020 one now so not sure if that would still help to maybe dollar cost average FZROX down?\n\nAny advice/recommendations/suggestions will be greatly appreciated!",
