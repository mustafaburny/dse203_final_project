        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, March 29, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed as market participants continue to digest the effects of the sudden unwinding in equity markets by large hedge funds. After the best session in three weeks on Friday, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose while the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) pulled back modestly. \n\nBloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management, managed by Bill Hwang, the ex-head of Tiger Management\u2019s family office and a so-called \u201cTiger cub\u201d (the name Wall Street gave to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of legendary fund manager Julian Robertson), was forced to sell more than $20 billion worth of stocks following a margin call. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks and American media conglomerates Discovery (DISC) and ViacomCBS (VIAC).  Nomura (NMR) and Credit Suisse (CS) warned that their earnings might take a \u201csignificant hit\u201d following Archegos Capital\u2019s margin call, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. A margin call happens when a leveraged account drops below an agreed level. The broker will then require the client to add funds to the account. If it can't, the broker will dump the client's shares and liquidate its holdings to make up the shortfall.\n\nDespite the recent choppiness in the market, there are signs the economy is improving. In 2021, cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks - the under-performers of 2020 - have strongly outperformed tech and high growth stocks, underscoring the sector rotation taking place. Moreover, last week\u2019s unemployment report was a pandemic-low, a sign the labor market is improving as the economy gradually reopens and the vaccine continues to be distributed. \n\nThe United States is set to distribute 3 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine each day. California and New York, two of the hardest-hit states, plan to open vaccinations to all residents 16 and older in the next two weeks. On December 8, before he took office, President Biden promised that his team would help administer 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine within his first 100 days in office. The administration has reached that goal, and now set a new goal of 200 million shots administered [in his first 100 days](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/25/president-joe-biden-holds-first-press-conference/6984142002/). Before Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, roughly 20 million doses had been administered (the Pfizer vaccine was approved on December 11, 2021). \n\nIn other news, the Ever Given, the massive container-ship blocking the Suez Canal, a critical artery in global trade, was finally dislodged. The week-long blockade cost roughly $9 billion a day in lost revenue.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* The March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The data are[ expected to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html) \u2014 the most since October 2019 and the best the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n* Comcast (CMCSA) will now offer Disney+ and ESPN+ in its Xfinity platform.\n* DraftKings (DKNG) and the World Wrestling Federation entered into an agreement to make the sports betting company the official gaming partner of the WWE. This follows a deal DKNG made with the UFC recently.\n* United Airlines (UAL). said it is returning to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City after a five-year hiatus. With the resumption of operations out of JFK, the airline now offers service from the three major airports in the NYC area, the company said Monday.\n* **\\*\\*Please note current stock price is written in the morning and does not account for intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) target raised by Bank of America from $140 to $150 at Buy. Stock currently around $128\n* Digital Turbine (APPS) with two target raises. Stock currently around $76\n   * Roth Capital from $100 to $115 at Buy\n   * Craig Hallum from $100 to $105 at Buy\n* BridgeBio (BBIO) target raised by SVB Leerink from $67 to $75 at Outperform.

        "selftext": "**AMKR \u2013 Amkor Technology** \\- is a SUPER undervalued stock in the semi-conductor space. Great financials. The company has a market cap of 5B with revenues of $5B. &lt;---- WHAT??\n\nPositions - (This amounts to 50% of my portfolio)\n\n1. 3/19 - 5x 23C\n2. 3/19 - 24x 27C\n3. 3/19- 30x 26C\n\nAMKR provides testing and packaging services to semi-conductor companies. It provides essential services to companies that deal in semi conductors. The company is based in the USA and works with big names such as NVIDA, Sony, Tesla\n\n***1.*** ***Financials are great***\n\n5B of revenue, 5B Cap, criminally low P/E of 17.7\n\nOkay, but what about other companies in semi-cons. TSM the biggest player in this space is at 62.17.  AMAT, probably the closest to their business 28.79. This alone tells you how  undervalued this company is. Even a P/E ratio of 25, which would put it in the low end of the range, would shoot its price past $30\n\nThe company is constantly reducing it\u2019s debt and increasing operating income and it recently announced it is going to start giving dividends too.\n\nLow volume\n\nGreat financials\n\n***2.*** ***Company is in a hot, growing space.***\n\nSemi-conductors are hot at the moment. There are multiple catalysts, from 5G phones roll out, to the EV wave, to more cloud computing, everything needs processing power. This means more demand for semi-conductors, in fact there is already a significant shortage being seen across the board.Everything in this sector is running at full capacity. More production means more testing and packaging and this shit is not going to slow down anytime soon..\n\n***3. Outlook is great:***\n\nlast earnings call says that everything is going great and growing HUGE -\n\n\u201cOkay. Well, thank you very much. Before closing the call, I would like to recap a few key messages. 2020 was a remarkable year for Amkor. We generated over $5 billion in revenue and $1.40 per share, and initiate cash dividend program for our stockholders. We accomplished this while navigating through a challenging global pandemic. We are expecting the first quarter of 2021 to be another solid quarter with revenue of $1.32 billion at the mid-point of our guidance.\n\n2021 is expected to be another growth year for Amkor. Semiconductor market forecasts predict growth of around 9% for the year. With Amkor\u2019s position in key growth markets, we expect to outgrow the semi-market forecast in 2021\u201d\n\nFinancial highlights:\n\n[https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302](https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302)\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. Great outlook\n2. Best ever quarter and will even pay dividends\n3. Great revenue and P/E\n4. Based on the revenue and ratios alone the company should be valued at least 2X what it is today\n5. Company is in the super hot semi-conductor space\n6.

        "selftext": "# Precursor:  Note I have this flaired as \"discussion\".  It means just that.  This is really more of a ghetto ass megathread to talk about infinite money plays to avoid having to actually work the jobs spending the infinite money.  Add your 2 cents.\n\n# \n\nHello, Vault dweller!  I see you're here because you watched a speech from Sleepy about spending 2 trillion dollars on infrastructure, and you want to turn that into tendies.  I happen to have the flow chart for his plan in front of me, and am happy to walk you through on how you could theoretically play this on the market so you can stop being a cog in the machine and get off the hamster wheel, which is exactly what these types of bills aim to prevent you from doing because they need your blood.  Keep in mind that this discussion is based solely on the odd belief that a bunch of other politicians are going to come together and agree to spend all this money, so this is pretty much theorycraft.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# First, we have 620 billion for transportation, of which 115bln will be for the shit we drive on (freeways, bridges, etc.) and 20,000 miles of road.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Likelihood of passing:  Actually fairly high as a line item.**  It's been proven time and again that there's no better stimulus to a faltering economy (even if it's faltering as a result of us shooting ourselves in the foot then crying about a crime) than a large public works project.  And this is one of those things everybody can get behind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour plays here are going to be industrials like **$CAT**, who will make the bulldozers, **$CMI** (or **$CUM** for you Europoors), who will make the engines, and even **$X**, who will sell a lot of steel.  Also don't sdleep on **$DE**, who doesn't make the construction equipment, but still has products that stand to benefit from large public works projects.  Of these, **$CAT** is by far the strongest play here, and I've been talking them up for a while now.  But don't sleep on plays like **$NUE**, which has a lot of room to run, and **$ETN**, a Boomer stonk that is near its highs, but will not only come to the trough for a lot of integration contracts, but recently bought up an EV charging company.  There's an outfit out there called **$BIPC** that most of you have probably never heard of, but don't be surprised to see this thing touch the triple digits if it looks like there's appetite to pass this spend on infrastructure.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimers:**  I'm long $CAT and $NUE in my fun money account, and $CMI in my managed portfolio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Further within that 620bln is 85bln for public transportation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis one is harder to peg, because Sleepy still thinks horses and carriages are a thing.  But he seems to want to divert most of that money towards rail, and then send what's left to individual metropoli to enhance their public transport sector.  The former is easy - invest in steel, **$CSX**, and for a stealthy Boomer play, **$PCAR**.  The latter is trickier.  Sleepy made much ado about clean energy, but you have to read between the lines to find the companies that stand to benefit from this.  Your surefire winners in this space are going to be **$QS** and **$PLUG**, and **$CHPT**.  **$FCEL** has a seat at this table, as well.  Maybe an argument could be made for **BLDP**, and I'm sure there are a billion others - feel free to discuss below.  A stealth play with a LOT of runway as a result of a recent beatdown will be **$WKHS** and, if you think this is going to pass, you should absolutely buy some.  But, dear reader, I posit to you a better stealth play, courtesy of the Los Angeles public transit authority (and, if you're a longtime reader, you'll know I've been talking this one up for quite some time):  **$CLNE**.  Renewable nat gas to power any system that needs better capabilities than electric can provide and with a lower curve towards adoption.  There are going to be a lot of companies fighting over who gets to make the bus or the battery, but relatively few companies are in the running for who's going to provide the energy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimers:**  Long $PLUG, $WKHS, and $CLNE.  \n\n# 174bln in EV tax credits\n\n**Likelihood of passing:** I'm actually not optimistic.  There are reasons there are limits to the tax credits given out, and it will be easy for fiscal conservatives to state that it's not fair that Joe the Plumber has to subsidize NrdRage's $100,000 sports sedan just because it uses grid energy.  You can get bylines and votes by speaking out against this.  (And, to be fair, I think it's stupid that I can get the taxpayers to help pay for my toys - but I absolutely make you do it if it's allowed).\n\n\\-Aka \"Elon once again has convinced the government to hand him stacks of taxpayer money\".  **$TSLA** is the far and away winner here in the short term.  But if this happens, expect **$VWAGY** and **$F** to race to get their hands on that cash.  And don't sleep on **Lewcid Motors** here.\n\n\\-500,000 charging stations by 2030 is the stated goal.   **$BLNK** and **$CHPT** are your obvious plays here, but there's a little known company called **Beam Global** running around out there (you'll have to find the ticker symbol on your own because reasons) that, if this line item gets passed, you can expect to be able to speak about freely here.  They would be a tricky play, because the moment their shit started going parabolic, they would dilute (don't say I didn't warn you!), but there's money to be made there if this becomes a thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimers:**  At any given point, I can be in almost any of these.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 180bln to upgrade labs and research facilities at colleges and government campuses\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Likelihood of passing:**  Incredibly low, at least at these numbers.  The fact that Sleepy wants to divert some of this money in his INFRASTRUCTURE plan that have nothing to do with INFRASTRUCTURE (including 30 billion dollars to \"address gender and racial inequality\") basically signals this line item is being included as a negotiating chip to give up in order to win a vote or two.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe one (and ONLY) interesting play I see here from this that could get some bipartisan support comes in the form of a stonk I talked about a few weeks ago, and would bigly benefit from any spend in this space to upgrade facilities:  **$BE.**  The research labs at places like Cal Tech have been relying entirely upon **$BE's** servers for years now, thanks to California's bullshit grid, and are basically a proof of function for every other lab and facility in the country that doesn't want to rely on a severely outdated grid to provide reliable power.  Given that one of the only things about this proposal that everybody is going to get behind is the need to update our power infrastructure, don't be surprised to see a fairly good chunk of money get carved out for the purposes of making research facilities grid independent.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  Long $BE and was actually a seed investor for just this reason\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 300bln for manufacturing\n\n**Likelihood of passing:**  For most of it?  Not a fucking chance.   They want to give 50bln to the National Science Foundation, 50bln to the Department of Commerce, and 50bln to studies.  There's no way.  But tucked away in here is something interesting:  50bln in incentives to semiconductor companies to build fab infrastructure.  The lobbyists for everybody from the automakers to the defense industry right to the gaming hardware companies will want to buy votes for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a lot of interesting plays here, and you should absolutely read my DD on commodity semiconductors for a much more in depth talk about that and why only certain ones should be looked at for this play.  What I'll lead with is this:  There are reasons why the smart money has been absolutely PILING IN to commodity chip companies the last week.  Matter of fact**, $MU** just crossed $90 and is now worth more than **$AMD** as of this afternoon.  $ON is still my far-and-away best in breed, and that thing has made a lot of us a ton of money.  **$INTC t**hreatens to build a fab plant in Arizona every couple of years and never does, but if the government gave them cash, that might tip them over the edge.  **$AMAT** is a good sneaky play and, if you can afford it, **$LRCX** is going to get a cut of that.  The TL:DR here is you should definitely have semis in your portfolio, but not Theta Semiconductor **$TSM.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Position Disclaimers:**  Long $AMD, $ON, $NVDA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 120bln for electrical grid improvements\n\n**Likelihood of passing:**  Let's be honest, this will get kicked down the road again.  A lot of this money is actually in the form of tax credits to entice companies to move to renewable energy generation and storage.  If any of this money gets doled out, expect **$TSLA** and **$BE** to receive a large amount of this money, as well as **$ETN** as the leader in how to integrate these various systems.  BUT, if it happens, a great stealth play is going to be **$PWR**.  If by some miracle this money is allocated, don't be surprised to see these dudes in the 120's just off froth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong $TSLA and $BE\n\n# Unknown $$$ to replace lead pipes for clean water\n\n**Likelihood of passing:**  Almost nil.  That's a chopping block item that will get passed down to local municipalities to deal with (or, more accurately, not).  Further, I've got no expertise in the clean water space, so have no companies to recommend other than the requisite heavy machinery needed to dig, trench, and replace (so **$CAT** and, to a lesser extent**, $DE**).  If anybody has expertise here, please speak up and if you make a compelling case, I'll copy-pasta you into this space and give you the credit for the knowledge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 100bln for broadband infrastructure\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Likelihood of passing:**  Oh, you can bet every lobbyist affected from **$LUMN** to **$CSMCA** to **$TMUS** (thanks to buying Sprint's trunks) will be buying those votes.  Getting paid for the privilege to gouge the consumer?  They'll be all about this.  But more importantly, this again talks about the importance of having a semiconductor in your portfolio, because all the 5G rollout as a result of this will fall directly to these guys.  See above for my thoughts on semis.\n\n**Position Disclaimers:**  Pretty sure I'm not in any of the highlighted companies; see above for the semis.\n\n# 300bln to build affordable homes, public housing, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Likelihood of passing:**  Never in a million years.  Not even worth discussing.  Same goes for the 100bln to go to schools and childcare facilities.  And ESPECIALLY the 500bln to pay for disabled/elder care, which is a pure pork item.  If you're going to play this fairy tale, **$URI** and a company called **$TEX** (they make the Genie lifts) would be profitable\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rest of his plan centers around taxes.  He specifically called $AMZN to the mat.  You know what Wall Street thinks about taxes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll my love,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Chad Dickens",

        "selftext": "Finally,  we have a GREAT GREEN day. I hope you did not sell your stock in the  fear of a market crash. I did some panic sell about two weeks ago (I am  happy I did) but bought everything back last Friday, yesterday and today  early morning. Although you may have missed the bottom, I believe given  that the market will go back to its February status in a few months, it  is still a very good time to get in and buy your shares back. I just  hope you did not sell yesterday. The market is not going to skyrocket so  be prepared for some green and red days. As long as we have some mixed  day, we should be fine.\n\nHere is my  portfolio for the disclosure: Appel, JETS, Drive, GNOM, PULM, JNJ, BB,  ACIC, WMT, Fubo, Nio, ARK (all sort of it), Nok, AMAT, ON, ICLN, Roku,  AOSL, PLTR, TSLA, TSM. Yes, I am heavily invested in tech as I am in  this industry and also believe that tech defines our future. I  especially want to highlight my shares in semiconductors including TSM,  ON, AOSL, AMAT. We may still see a huge jump in semi this year.\n\nI use a simple rule of LEAP calls 0.8 Delta one year expiration being 1/3 or cheaper than the share price. so if the share price is $90 then call options with 0.8 FTE should be $30 or less otherwise, will just buy the shares. I may buy options anyway if the shares are too expensive like TESLA. So I have LEAP calls for Apple, JETS, Drive, GNOM, JNJ, BB, WMT, ARKG, Nok, ICLN, PLTR, TSLA, and TSM. The rest are just shares. I have mixed options/shares in both PLTR and Roku. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot a financial advice.",

Small caps higher again after resuming recent bounce yesterday. Growth outperformed value with tech and consumer discretionary the leaders. FAANGs all higher and semis reversed some of the week's declines. Financials, energy, consumer staples among sectors lower. Treasuries little changed to a touch weaker. Dollar stronger vs yen but little changed vs euro. Gold finished up 1.8%. WTI crude settled down 2.3%.\n   * **White House infrastructure** **stimulus plan released** ahead of Biden speech. White House has proposed over $2T of spending over eight-year period focused on traditional road, bridge, airport, water-delivery and utility projects, as well as electrification, high-speed broadband, worker training, supply chain and R&amp;D investments, and home-based care. Partial funding will come from 15 years of higher taxes, including increase in corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, an increase in the global minimum tax from \\~13% to 21%, and other measures. Democrats expected to have to use reconciliation to pass. Demands for SALT relief emerging as a potential stumbling block.\n   * Pretty quiet elsewhere ahead of **nonfarm payrolls on Friday** where market seems to be looking for a print above the \\~650K consensus. However, **ADP private payrolls** growth of 517K only a bit better than 500K consensus. March **Chicago PMI** highest since Jul-18. February **pending home sales** missed on tight inventory. **China manufacturing and services PMIs** **surprised to the upside**, hitting three- and four-month highs, respectively. **Eurozone headline and core inflation came in softer**. Some discussion about **worsening coronavirus trends in the US** with new infections up 20% in past two weeks, though vaccine optimism remains fairly elevated with good news from Pfizer/BioNTech this morning regarding efficacy in adolescents. Multiple reports noted **Biden to let Trump's H1-B visa ban expire**.\n   * **WBA** beat and raised with Street positive on execution given COVID headwinds. **LULU** beat with Street positive on digital sales strength and momentum into Q1 but some disappointment 2021 EPS guidance light on Mirror dilution. **CHWY** a standout after it beat and guided above with takeaways positive on rebound in new customer adds and opportunities in healthcare. **KR** reconfirmed FY21 comps guidance but bar high. **CLF** guided 2021 EBITDA above the Street with takeaways noting the company's leverage to stronger domestic steel prices. **PVH** results mixed with revenue below but EBIT ahead while FY guide below on softer NA outlook but not really a surprise. **BB** revenue missed.\n* **Digest**\n   * **Tech, consumer discretionary best performers as growth extends week's outperformance:**\n      * Growth continued to outperform value factor today. **Tech** the best performer with semis, AAPL (upgrade), internet names stronger. **Consumer discretionary** saw solid gains TSLA and AMZN. **Communication services** in line with interactive media, entertainment better groups but media weaker. **Healthcare** weighed down by hospitals and managed care. **Industrials** lower on weakness across airlines, trucking, machinery. **Consumer staples** an underperformer with grocers (KR update), tobacco weaker. **Materials** down as broader chemicals group traded lower. **Financials** trailed as banks, insurance gave back some of yesterday's gains. **Energy** the worst performer, following WTI crude lower as integrated oil extended week's losses.\n   * **March ADP employment beats ahead of Friday's payrolls report:**\n      * March **ADP employment report** showed a gain of 517K, ahead of estimates for 500K and the highest since September. February was also revised up 59K to 176K. Service-sector jobs were up 437K, led by leisure and hospitality, up 169K. Good-producing jobs were up 80K on a 49K manufacturing and 32K construction gain. Report comes ahead of Friday's **March nonfarm payrolls report**, with expectations for a gain of 614K, up from February's 329K print. Would be highest since October's 680K increase. Private payrolls expected to increase by 525K and government up 89K. Unemployment rate expected to fall 0.2 pp to 6.0%, while average hourly earnings expected to hold at +0.2% (and down to 4.5% y/y from February's +5.3%). Some sell-side previews noted upside risk to payrolls could be driven by strong reopening momentum, with some real-time data showing fastest activity growth since last summer.\n   * **Details of infrastructure stimulus in focus ahead of Biden speech:**\n      * White House release [proposal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/) that includes \\~$2T of spending over eight-year period focused on traditional road, bridge, airport, water-delivery and utility projects, as well as electrification, high-speed broadband, worker training, supply chain and R&amp;D investments, and home-based care ([Washington Post](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/30/biden-infrastructure-plan-jobs/__;!!PBKjc0U4!dileJLwkytaR-wTi5vN_CHFQOO8EvTBeqvFeRXLQKZ3PJRPR9KHfr79w8Q05vFqPAw$), [NY Times](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/business/economy/biden-infrastructure-taxes.html__;!!PBKjc0U4!dileJLwkytaR-wTi5vN_CHFQOO8EvTBeqvFeRXLQKZ3PJRPR9KHfr79w8Q0d-INcDA$), [Politico](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.politico.com/news/2021/03/30/biden-infrastructure-plan-478627__;!!PBKjc0U4!dileJLwkytaR-wTi5vN_CHFQOO8EvTBeqvFeRXLQKZ3PJRPR9KHfr79w8Q2iMz2d3A$), [Bloomberg](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-30/biden-to-lay-out-u-s-economic-renewal-in-rejuvenated-pittsburgh?srnd=premium&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B__;!!PBKjc0U4!dileJLwkytaR-wTi5vN_CHFQOO8EvTBeqvFeRXLQKZ3PJRPR9KHfr79w8Q3IwE9qlg$)) In terms of some of the bigger tranches, reports said \\~$621B will go to traditional infrastructure, \\~$400B to home care for elderly and disabled, $300B to housing infrastructure, $300B to revive US manufacturing, and $174B to vehicle electrification.

Administration officials speaking about this next phase only in broadest strokes, though likely to include family-centered elements such as improved health coverage, expanded child tax benefit, and paid family/medical leave. Structure and timing of this follow-on effort remain unclear, though idea of pairing physical infrastructure with other traditional Democratic priorities plays into notion Biden hopes to engineer a broad overhaul of the economy in the mold of FDR's New Deal or LBJ's Great Society. No rollout date for phase 2 has been announced but commentators see a speech coming sometime before the White House's climate summit on 22-23 April.\n   * **Afternoon headlines:**\n      * **Economic policy/Stimulus:**\n      * **Coronavirus:**\n      * **Corporate:**\n      * **Market:**\n   * **Notable Gainers:**\n      * \\+16.7% **CLF** (Cleveland-Cliffs): Guided Q1 EBITDA \\~27% above the Street based on current contractual business and forecast for hot-rolled coil to average $975/ton for remainder of the year; Q2 and FY21 guidance ahead as well.\n      * \\+13.3% **AYI** (Acuity Brands): FQ2 earnings beat with gross margins also ahead; noted ongoing Covid impact with Direct Network sales holding up best; analysts see last quarter as a trough for activity and sales amidst improving commercial real estate trends including larger contractor backlogs.\n      * \\+6.9% **HOG** (Harley-Davidson): Upgraded to outperform from neutral at RW Baird; positive on strategic direction of Hardwire plan; expects retail to turn positive in 2021 with lean dealer inventory fueling a healthy replenishment cycle (with checks showing signs of shortages).\n      * \\+6.7% **SQ** (Square): Upgraded to outperform from market perform at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods; said platform positioned to be a winner within underserved market with Seller less than 3% penetrated and Cash App less than 2%; also cited additional customer acquisition avenues with TIDAL, Credit Karma's tax business.\n      * \\+5.4% **CHWY** (Chewy, Inc.): Q4 EBITDA and revenue margins beat; margins boosted by hardgoods, proprietary brands, and healthcare; FY21 revenue guidance above the Street; said QTD customer acquisition and spending trends remain strong.\n      * \\+5.4% **AMAT** (Applied Materials): Initiated outperform at Bernstein; cited positive long term industry outlook, expects rapid growth in wafer fab equipment, sees additional upside optionality for the firm along with LRCX.\n      * \\+4.6% **BNTX** (BioNTech): Announced with PFE positive topline results for Covid vaccine study in adolescents 12 to 15 years old; no cases of Covid were observed in the vaccinated group, similar to prior 16-25 year old study, vaccine was well tolerated; plan to request emergency use authorization as soon as possible.\n      * \\+3.6% **WBA** (Walgreens Boots Alliance): FQ2 earnings and revenue beat with FY guidance raised; analysts noted good execution, particularly in US, despite larger than expected Covid headwind; lower tax rate and interest expenses also benefited earnings; International wholesale business sale likely to be completed this year.\n      * \\+1.9% **AAPL** (Apple): Upgraded to buy from neutral at UBS; cited more stable long-term iPhone demand environment and optionality surrounding likely entry to the auto market.\n   * **Notable Decliners:**\n      * \\-19.7% **RMO** (Romeo Power): Preliminary Q4 EPS and revenue missed; FY21 revenue guide \\~78% below the Street; noted near-term production and revenues to be constrained by supply shortage in battery cells; said working with preferred partners to secure allocations.\n      * \\-11% **OLO** (Olo, Inc.): FT reported DoorDash (DASH) accused company of overcharging it for more than three years; paper said DoorDash was Olo's largest delivery partner last year, accounting for 19.3% of revenue.\n      * \\-9.7% **BB** (BlackBerry): Q4 results below expectations with Software and Services a drag; Licensing and other revenues also missed; company has entered into negotiations to sell majority of its patent portfolio; if no sale, company guided license revenue well below consensus in its most conservative scenario; upgraded at Canaccord Genuity.\n      * \\-5.5% **KR** (Kroger): To provide update at today's Investor Day; reconfirmed FY 21 EPS guidance, which brackets Street consensus; also reconfirms comps, OI, capex, FCF guidance; analysts noted high bar into Investor Day, noting optimism around comps, holding market share gains accumulated in FY20.\n      * \\-3.3% **LULU** (lululemon athletica): Q4 EPS and revenue beat; comps beat, but store comp decline worse than expected; OM light on higher SG&amp;A than expected; guided FY22 EPS below Street, but revenue ahead; analysts said expense outlook given MIRROR, digital channel costs likely to weigh on earnings growth.\n   * **S&amp;P 500 Sector Performance**\n      * **Outperformers:** Tech +1.50%, Consumer Disc. +0.83%, Utilities +0.65%, Communication Svcs. +0.40%\n      * **Underperformers:** Energy (0.93%), Financials (0.90%), REITs (0.50%), Materials (0.49%), Consumer Spls.

        "selftext": "Finally, we have a GREAT GREEN day. I hope you did not sell your stock in the fear of a market crash. I did some panic sell about two weeks ago (I am happy I did) but bought everything back last Friday, yesterday and today early morning. Although you may have missed the bottom, I believe given that the market will go back to its February status in a few months, it is still a very good time to get in and buy your shares back. I just hope you did not sell yesterday. The market is not going to skyrocket so be prepared for some green and red days. As long as we have some mixed day, we should be fine. \n\nHere is my portfolio for the disclosure: Appel, JETS, Drive, GNOM, PULM, JNJ, BB, ACIC, WMT, Fubo, Nio, ARK (all sort of it), Nok, AMAT, ON, ICLN, Roku, AOSL, PLTR, TSLA, TSM. Yes, I am heavily invested in tech as I am in this industry and also believe that tech defines our future. I especially want to highlight my shares in semiconductors including TSM, ON, AOSL, AMAT. We may still see a huge jump in semi this year.\n\nNot a financial advice.",

        "selftext": "My fellow autists, degenerates, gambling addicts, and of course, my dear retards: It is I - u/pltr_gang_rise_up and I am here to share with you a true post in the spirits of WallStreetBets and would like to put on your radar - SOXL. \n\n**Backstory:**\n\n**Semiconductors,** as most are aware, are in short supply. There has been some movement by world leaders to improve supply chains in order to get the semiconductors to the place they need to be. Some car manufacturers have had to cut production in vehicles due to this ongoing issue. I believe this issue will be fixed in due time, but probably not in the immediate future. \n\n**What is SOXL?**\n\n**SOXL** is a Leveraged ETF that invests in the biggest semiconductor manufacturers in the world (INTC, AMD, QCOM, TSM, etc). \n\nBe careful, this is a \"Leveraged\" ETF - and therefore it's rather aggressive and aiming for high returns. Do some more research here if you want. Essentially it means, if the sector of semiconductors does well, the fund will do well. \n\n**Breakdown:**\n\nNow, they recently had a 15:1 split on their shares, which were trading at about $636 in February. This brought the public float to **99.40M.**\n\nWhen looking into a company, I like to start with what they own, followed by who owns them.\n\n**What they own:**\n\nHere is a breakdown of the assets that SOXL owns with their 1.46bn market cap:\n\nDreyfus Government Cash Management Institutional Shs\t11.00%\n\nFinancial Square Treasury Instruments Fund FST Shares\t9.39%\n\nBroadcom Inc.\t5.22%\n\nQualcomm Inc.\t4.96%\n\nIntel Corp.\t4.94%\n\nTexas Instruments Inc.\t4.88%\n\nNVIDIA \t4.67%\n\nMicron Technology Inc.\t2.81%\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. ADR\tTSM\t2.69%\n\nAnalog Devices Inc.\t2.54%\n\nApplied Materials Inc.\t2.51%\n\nLam Research Corp.\t2.50%\n\nKLA Corp.\t2.41%\n\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\t2.40%\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc.\t2.37%\n\nASML Holding N.V.\t2.22%\n\nMicrochip Technology Inc.\t2.16%\n\nXilinx Inc.\t2.01%\t\n\nMarvell Technology Group Ltd.\t1.92%\n\nSkyworks Solutions Inc.\t1.53%\n\nTeradyne Inc.\t1.20%\n\nQorvo Inc.\t1.14%\n\nMonolithic Power Systems MPWR\t0.99%\n\nON Semiconductor Corp.\t0.81%\n\nEntegris Inc.\t0.78%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now, I'm not sure what the first two are, but that throws up a potential flag.** These two entities represent nearly 20% of the portfolio owned. It could be nothing more than some type of government investment in such a company, as it is critical right now. \n\n**Who owns them?:**\n\nLooks like mostly hedge funds. No one really of note other than Citadel and Susquehanna. \n\n**Short Interest:**\n\nNot a heavily shorted stock. About 3.4m shares are available to short with a ratio of about 25%.\n\n**Technicals** (got me excited):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7ndly6se1m61.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=698eae9b1d4ff4726eac546d2a6a8f4bb753fbc6\n\nHere we have a bounce just under the (white) 200sma. On this 4h chart, the bottom represents the buy/sell volume over time. the middle represents where we're at in terms of a squeeze. You also can see heavy buy volume at the bottom followed by a potential turn up ahead in the next few days. TONS of buy volume since the beginning of the month. \n\nThe daily was also looking nice:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/id2j5879f1m61.png?width=452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23cbb6a2b7af021cadc9d35a9d2f8413c636cb90\n\nThere is an AIM on the indicator, meaning at this point the next logical step might be a shot to the upside in the next week. There was heavy call and put volume on the $37 strike, which seemed quite coincidental. Why that level? There were more calls than puts. The OI is still over 10k on the option. \n\nMy target is $42 by 3/19. But I encourage you to do your own analysis and come up with your own targets. I happen to think this is a good potential trade. I think in this case, the probability in my belief is to the upside.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, March 29, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed as market participants continue to digest the effects of the sudden unwinding in equity markets by large hedge funds. After the best session in three weeks on Friday, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose while the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) pulled back modestly. \n\nBloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management, managed by Bill Hwang, the ex-head of Tiger Management\u2019s family office and a so-called \u201cTiger cub\u201d (the name Wall Street gave to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of legendary fund manager Julian Robertson), was forced to sell more than $20 billion worth of stocks following a margin call. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks and American media conglomerates Discovery (DISC) and ViacomCBS (VIAC).  Nomura (NMR) and Credit Suisse (CS) warned that their earnings might take a \u201csignificant hit\u201d following Archegos Capital\u2019s margin call, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. A margin call happens when a leveraged account drops below an agreed level. The broker will then require the client to add funds to the account. If it can't, the broker will dump the client's shares and liquidate its holdings to make up the shortfall.\n\nDespite the recent choppiness in the market, there are signs the economy is improving. In 2021, cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks - the under-performers of 2020 - have strongly outperformed tech and high growth stocks, underscoring the sector rotation taking place. Moreover, last week\u2019s unemployment report was a pandemic-low, a sign the labor market is improving as the economy gradually reopens and the vaccine continues to be distributed. \n\nThe United States is set to distribute 3 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine each day. California and New York, two of the hardest-hit states, plan to open vaccinations to all residents 16 and older in the next two weeks. On December 8, before he took office, President Biden promised that his team would help administer 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine within his first 100 days in office. The administration has reached that goal, and now set a new goal of 200 million shots administered [in his first 100 days](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/25/president-joe-biden-holds-first-press-conference/6984142002/). Before Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, roughly 20 million doses had been administered (the Pfizer vaccine was approved on December 11, 2021). \n\nIn other news, the Ever Given, the massive container-ship blocking the Suez Canal, a critical artery in global trade, was finally dislodged. The week-long blockade cost roughly $9 billion a day in lost revenue.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* The March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The data are[ expected to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html) \u2014 the most since October 2019 and the best the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n* Visa Inc said on Monday it will allow the use of the cryptocurrency USD Coin to settle transactions on its payment network, the latest sign of growing acceptance of digital currencies by the mainstream financial industry. USD Coin is a crypto whose value is pegged to the US dollar.\n* Comcast (CMCSA) will now offer Disney+ and ESPN+ in its Xfinity platform.\n* DraftKings (DKNG) and the World Wrestling Federation entered into an agreement to make the sports betting company the official gaming partner of the WWE. This follows a deal DKNG made with the UFC recently.\n* United Airlines (UAL). said it is returning to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City after a five-year hiatus. With the resumption of operations out of JFK, the airline now offers service from the three major airports in the NYC area, the company said Monday.\n* **\\*\\*Please note current stock price is written in the morning and does not account for intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) target raised by Bank of America from $140 to $150 at Buy. Stock currently around $128\n* Digital Turbine (APPS) with two target raises. Stock currently around $76\n   * Roth Capital from $100 to $115 at Buy\n   * Craig Hallum from $100 to $105 at Buy\n* BridgeBio (BBIO) target raised by SVB Leerink from $67 to $75 at Outperform. Stock currently around $61\n* DraftKings (DKNG) target raised by Goldman Sachs from $79 to $87 at Buy.

        "selftext": "\nI get it. We all hate cheaters, and *some* hedgefunds are cheating. That's justified, but WSB isn't your political movement, fuck the system, empowering bullshit. \n\nWSB is about a bunch of degenerates that gamble on the stock market. That is it.  It can be individuals, some could even work at hedgefunds, I don't care. \n\nAll this organizing, fuck the hedgies, hodl, and hold the line shit is what threatens WSB.

I like the stock. But I like the stock because of the fundamentals, not anything else. If something happens to the other side of my buy, woops, not my fault or problem. I have no agenda. \n\nTLDR: I like the stock. I like WSB more. Talking about the short interest and showing us the share ownership is fine.
