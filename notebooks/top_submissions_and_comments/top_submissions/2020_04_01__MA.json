        "selftext": "I just finished my watchlist after evaluating 300+ companies. It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it. \n\nIt's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.\n\n\\- ALPHABET -A-. Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks. \n\n\\- ARISTA NETWORKS. Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.\n\n\\- FACEBOOK. This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy. \n\n\\- GALAPAGOS. To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences. \n\n\\- INCYTE GENOMICS. Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%\n\n\\- LULULEMON ATHLETICA. Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase. \n\n\\- MASTERCARD. Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.\n\n\\- MICROSOFT. No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices. \n\n\\- NVIDIA. Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars. \n\n\\- VEEVA SYSTEMS. One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.\n\nOne last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.\n\nHope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!\n\nTL;DR. Stonks only go up.",

        "selftext": "I've called 3 major reversals and 1 short term one last week (check my post history) and I'm here to tell you we might be in for another major reversal.\n\nPrice has attempted, three times, to break resistance at SPY 264. 264 is a super significant number, and it's very typical for price to get stuck at a significant number and reverse at said super significant number.\n\nFirst, $264 is the 200 Week moving average. The 200 week moving average has been support for this entire bull market - 9 fucking years!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qe68eao0jbr41.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2640b176655d0341604e956532613eed2af27490\n\nSecond, it's the .382 Fib of the entire price decline from the all time high. The two line up perfectly. When a structural support and a major fib line up, it's like wearing two condoms during gay sex - little jimmy has to work way harder to impregnate your boyfriend's sister's husband.\n\n![img](7od46vbjibr41 \"Second, it's the .382 Fib of this entire decline.\n\")\n\nNow look at the price action: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6be97modjbr41.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51ddf004701b380f9f67e8ec6f3797dea975dd4a\n\nIn a bull market, this would be hella bullish price action - price banging on the door, eventually breaking it down. But we're not in a bull market are we? Hellllll no we're not.\n\nIn a bull market, an impulse gap like the one we had this morning above a previous short term trend of the previous move (see the red line drawn from the ATH) would be on high volume.\n\nCheck out this pitiful volume today:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bwkoouzxjbr41.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e55cad6e16a52e32f68c14a581211ce8222f05d0\n\nJust sad, sad volume for a gap impulse.\n\nFinally, factor in where we closed. RIGHT at the 200 weekly MA. Not above it. the final minute saw HUGE sell volumes into the close. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v71xmxsbkbr41.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5a134ebbc82de1050f2cd145df0e8dacb25a577\n\nNow look, I'm not saying price can't continue up further. It absolutely could. There have been enormous short positioned established in the past two weeks which will put upward pressure on prices and could carry price to $270-280 if we break above $264 with high volume.\n\nBUT, if we fail here for the THIRD time. The selling is going to be absolutely vicious. 20 day realized volatility is 100. ONE FUCKING HUNDRED. UNFUCKING PRECEDENTED. The VIX is currently at 43 after a 7% SPY move. These are unfuckingprecedented times people.\n\nLike all TA gays, I'm here to tell you that price could go up, but there's an absolutely beautiful technical setup for a massive implosion.",

Here's my watch list\n\nGap Ups: AAPL, AXSM, CODX, IMMU, LYV, MESO, MU, NUGT, RCL, RDHL, RYAAY, SMPL, TQQQ, W, XBIT\n\nGap Downs: TVIX, ZM\n\nThe SPY is gapping up over 4% at the time I am writing this. Gap days are usually harder to trade. Most large gaps in the market get sold off at open but occasionally they do hold so be aware and stay patient.  As of right now the SPY is holding this temporary support and trying to form a \"W\" pattern but the weekly 200 moving average is still overhead and that's where it got rejected last week. Day to day basis right now until we get out of this range. If market breaks back below last weeks low most likely we will see a retest of the lows, if it breaks above the weekly 200 ma we could see some continuation to the upside as earnings season starts in 2 weeks. Only time will tell.  Almost no stocks moving with individual catalyst. If you are new, this is not the ideal time to trade so don't get fomo, just be patient and only take solid trades with good patterns and have a defined risk to reward before entering trades. If you have any questions, comment below or shoot me a message. Good luck trading!\n\nI made a trading community last week r/Kant_sleep13. Feel free to check it out",

        "selftext": "Alright, here we go:\n\nHasbro is one of the largest toy makers in the world. Everyone is sitting at home just trying to get their kids to leave them alone for five minutes. Go to Target and look at the toy aisle. Hasbro. Go look at board games. If they're not sold out, almost all the big boys are Hasbro (Monopoly, MTG, Clue, Sorry, etc). Too lazy to leave the house? Go on Amazon. Not only does Hasbro own the majority of the first few pages of results for toys and board games, they barely have any inventory left. This is despite their [CEO stating that their supply chain in China was back up and running three weeks ago](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/coronavirus-hasbro-shares-soar-as-ceo-cites-great-demand-for-toys.html) and that they would be fully caught up by April. You'll see similar patterns on Target's website, especially if you try for in-store pickup.\n\nWe saw a [Christmas level spike](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=board%20games) in searches for board games, which are surprisingly a [larger portion of Hasbro's revenue than you'd think](https://hasbro.gcs-web.com/static-files/2e4dbabd-a54f-4253-a80e-f0a60a83bdaf). People are so bored at home they're buying board games they're never even going to play.\n\nObviously, the majority of Hasbro's revenue is from toys, and demand for these is largely driven by the success of their partnerships with movie studios (read: Disney). How many Frozen toys do you think [50 million Disney+ subscribers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/business/disney-plus-50-million-subscribers.html) works out to? Hell they may even make a little bit off that [shitty Trolls movie](https://deadline.com/2020/04/trolls-world-tour-record-digital-weekend-opening-day-1202906947/). Regardless, the #1 driver of demand right now is kids sitting at home with absolutely nothing to do but watch movies and demand the respective toys. Through its partnerships, Hasbro owns that market (although somehow they didn't have [Baby Yoda](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/2/21/21146913/baby-yoda-animatronic-toy-hasbro-release-date-price-mandalorian-star-wars-disney) ready to go the day Mandalorian dropped).\n\nNow let's look at the stock itself. Hasbro had a strong 2019 and appeared to be rebounding from losing Toys R Us before missing Q3 earnings. However, they rebounded from this in Q4 and were back to comfortably trading in the $100-105 area (down from around $120 in Q3) even with concerns about their supply chain due to that weird virus in China. Then the virus came here, and they dropped like everyone else, bottoming out at $41. They've bounced back to some degree, trading at $75 now, but fundamentally, there's no reason they shouldn't be trading at pre-virus numbers. Their supply chain is back up, toys actually [perform relatively well](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/industries-thrive-on-recession.asp) during a recession, and the whole world has more leisure time than at any point in the past century. Also, one could argue that losing Toys R Us was the best thing for Hasbro long term because it [pushed them to actually embrace e-commerce](https://nypost.com/2019/02/20/hasbro-lego-launch-online-services-in-toys-r-us-absence/). They're arguably set up better than just about anyone for this exact scenario, yet they're trading at 21% below their 200 day MA. While similar at-home leisure goods (video games, fucking Peloton, etc) are at or near ATHs, their cheaper and more inelastic peer, Hasbro, is being treated like any other consumer product.\n\nHasbro will report earnings on 4/29, but Mattel, their closest competitor, will report on 4/23. If everything I've laid out here bears any weight, I believe $MAT will crush Q1 expectations and the market will quickly realize that $HAS will benefit from this virus even more (more diversified product line, stronger studio partnerships).\n\nThe biggest concern here is option volume. If you buy all this, you'll have to pay a premium to get in on it. Obviously volume will increase as we get closer to earnings, but I believe getting in before Mattel releases their numbers on 4/23 will be key. Secondary concern is supply chain, but honestly, even if there were a second outbreak in China, do we really believe they're going to let that shut down manufacturing again, and even if so, in the next two weeks? Hard to believe, but if that does happen, none of us will care because all our puts will finally print.\n\nI'm not putting a strike because you're better off finding the right price given low volume. Basically any call after 4/29. Right now I'm thinking $95 by mid-May.",

        "selftext": "I'd like your feedback on two plays. They're basic beginner plays but I've made a mixture of profits and losses the last two weeks despite doing my own DD and making mostly high probability plays. So I'm wondering there is a blind spot in my thinking.\n\n1) USO shares with covered calls. I am still debating the covered calls portion. But it would be easy at this price point to load up on shares and ride what I suspect will be an eventual rise or rip. The only thing is that USO is so politics so any TA (I do basic bar chart pattern reading and using MA, nothing more) is useless. \n\n2) DAL puts for earnings. Warrent Buffet just pulled out. All the airlines are taking a hit. I know DAL has already fallen a lot but Warren buying and selling had a history of creating trends in the same direction. I'm expecting another sell off. I could hedge though with a straddle at it's current price and try to catch options before their premium rockets. One thing I haven't checked is exactly when their earnings will be announced. If it is after market on Thursday, with good friday closed, that won't work. IV will sink by the time markets open.",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot even the best fintech stock in the decade after the Great Recession of 2008 to 2009 could hide from the coronavirus. **Mastercard** (NYSE: MA), the world's second-largest dedicated digital payments platform, has been hit hard by the contagion. At its lowest point last month, the stock was down over 40% from its all-time high, although as of this writing, it has recovered some of those losses.\n\nNevertheless, the coming economic downturn means less movement of money. For a toll-booth business like Mastercard that earns the bulk of its revenue by charging a small fee for processing transactions, that means leaner times lie immediately ahead. \u00a0\n\nThough the world has undeniably changed a great deal because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mastercard is in good shape and should emerge stronger than ever. The short-term outlook isn't great, and shares remain priced at a premium, but the long-term reasons for owning this war-on-cash leader are unchanged.\n\nTear up those 2020 forecasts\n\nEven after toppling from its highs, Mastercard stock still trades at a premium price point: 36 times trailing 12-month free cash flow (what's left after cash operating expenses and capital expenditures are paid out). It's an especially high price considering the company added itself to the large and growing list of businesses downgrading expectations for the coming year. Management pulled its outlook for full-year 2020 revenue (previously pegged at a low-teens percentage increase) and downgraded its first-quarter 2020 revenue guidance to low single-digit percentage growth. Operating expenses should grow in the low- to mid-single-digit range, which includes the $250 million Mastercard pledged to support small businesses impacted by the coronavirus.\n\nThat could imply very little growth in earnings -- or even a bottom-line contraction if operating expenses grow significantly faster than revenue. With the stock priced as if Mastercard will continue growing at a fast but steady clip for the foreseeable future, suffice it to say coronavirus and the disruption it has brought on the world is unwelcome news.\n\nThe war on cash was never going to be won in a year\n\nNevertheless, a bad quarter or even an entire year is no reason to part ways with a long-term winner like Mastercard. Ample profitability means the credit card and payments platform will be able to navigate the crisis without the need to take on new debt. This isn't just a short-term trend either. As digital payments have grown as a percentage of the global transaction pie, profit margins have steadily gone up.\n\nPlus, digital payments are still a high-growth industry. Global revenue generated is expected to climb by high single-digit percentages for the next few years, according to McKinsey and Company. Most of the world still deals primarily in cash, so there's plenty of room for companies like Mastercard to continue making the push toward a more digitally based system of money movement. The company's immediate-term outlook, though lowered significantly, is a testament to that. Many organizations are foreseeing a drop in sales, but Mastercard is still looking at year-over-year growth in the first quarter. Some of that pertains to the acquisitions made in recent years, and more takeovers could be in the making. The outlook could also change in subsequent quarters, but at this point in the crisis, it's so far, so good. \u00a0\n\nAnd then, there's the situation with China. Long walled off to foreign payment platforms, Mastercard got approval in early 2020 from the People's Bank of China to begin setting up operations. Entering the massive country -- home to the world's largest base of digital consumers -- will be an uphill battle against the virtual duopoly on the Chinese digital payments market between **Alibaba**\u00a0and **Tencent**.\u00a0But Mastercard is still generating plenty of growth from other emerging markets. China should thus be a notable addition that could help maintain growth for many more years.\n\nA premium price for a best-in-class company\n\nAs a final consideration, Mastercard ended 2019 with $8.53 billion in debt, not a huge sum considering this payments giant generated $7.46 billion in free cash flow last year. Additionally, cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet totalled $7.68 billion. High-profit margins, plenty of liquidity, and global secular trends favouring the industry it plays in add up to make Mastercard a best-in-class fintech stock.\n\nThe price tag on shares remains high and the immediate outlook uncertain as to the world reels from the effects of the pandemic, but Mastercard is still a staple portfolio holding for the long term.",

Studies are extremely limited but mechanistically, previous studies on convalescent plasma in other similar viruses should apply to SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 given the direct antibody action on the virus. 2,5\n\nUpside to options on these company are driven by low barriers to patient treatment in comparison to antivirals (or other medications) because IVIG is already FDA approved, long term improvement in baseline revenue from companies in this space given long term use of IVIG for recurrent outbreaks, eventual emotional response of having a new treatment for the masses to discuss (piling in phenomenon), limited downside given a long standing growing market for convalescent plasma (*IVIG*) \\[est CAGR 7.6% 2019-2025\\]4 and baseline pharmaceutical markets held by these companies prior to the outbreak.\n\nCaveats: This is still in the initial study phase. This differs a bit from the usual initial studies for drug therapies (like remdisivir) as its not a new drug, has FDA approval, and has been shown previously effective in similar models. Studies are limited at this point given timing so far. This is a speculative play that I hope has high upside with a high floor as well in case COVID-19 specific therapies don\u2019t pan out.\n\nConstraints: The biggest constraint on this is largely due to shortage issues. Plasma is collected from patients, low patient pools or low pools of people not giving plasma means limited treatment. This is countered by the *fun fact* that previous economic downturns are correlated with an excess of plasma as patients in the US are paid for their plasma donations. This can be a helpful source of extra income for those without a job.\n\n**Personal opinions on long term of SARS-CoV2/COVID-19** : This virus will stay around in our natural biome going forward. We will not \u2018get rid of it\u2019 as it has likely spread to all countries at this point. It also seems to infect domestic cats, giving it a secondary reservoir in our homes. This means without a vaccine or herd immunity, we will continue to see small eruptions of SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 infections across the world and the US for years to come. In addition, this virus may be much more infective than we understand so far; though models are fairly variable at this point: [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282\\_article?deliveryName=USCDC\\_333-DM25287](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282_article?deliveryName=USCDC_333-DM25287)\n\n**Vaccination:** Likely farther away than most people are factoring in and will require an intermediate term option that is best filled with IVIG at this point.

(Vaccine efficacy in aged populations can reduce performance)\n\n\\- Heterogeneous group 2b SARS-like CoV pool may vary by as much as 35% (Decreases vaccine effectiveness)\n\n\\- Th2 Immune Pathology after Vaccination in all populations currently seems weak in comparison to other vaccinations, will likely need adjunct that will also need to be evaluated delaying production/distribution.\n\n**Mechanism of action of IVIG**: Blood/plasma is taken from patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV2/COVID-19. Antibodies that target/fought off the virus in the now healthy individual are taken out of their blood. Antibody/blood products are then transfused into a patient currently suffering from SARS-CoV2/COVID-19.

The trials listed below are a launching off point and initial glimpse of effectiveness of treatment and a chance to get ahead of the market before it possibly turns in this direction.\n\nEffectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy in severe COVID-19 patients, published 4/6/20.\n\nOverall: 10 patients with severe symptoms (in ICU) were given convalescent plasma, all recovered within 3 days from a critical health standpoint.\n\nCaveats: Not randomized, small sample size, Chinese study\n\n[https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/04/02/2004168117](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/04/02/2004168117)\n\nTreatment of 5 Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 With Convalescent Plasma, published 3/27/20\n\nOverall: 5 of 5 critically ill patients on ventilators received convalescent plasma, all recovered.\n\nCaveats: Not randomized, very small sample size, Chinese study\n\n[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763983](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763983)\n\nTreatment with convalescent plasma for critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nOverall: 4 critically ill patients received IVIG, all recovered.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32243945](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32243945)\n\nConvalescent Plasma in viral severe acute respiratory infections (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, H1N1, H5N1) (Published 7/16/14)\n\nOverall: Meta-analysis (a review of a number of studies) of 38 studies on SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV found Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality, associated with almost halving of ICU stay length and appears safe. (Could especially help to 'flatten the curve' for ICU over capacity)\n\nCaveats: Studies were commonly of low quality, lacked control groups, and at moderate risk of bias.

(decreases shortage associated limitations on financials)\n\n\\- Already has a collection/deployment model, given companies already have established contracts with hospitals for IVIG (convalescent plasma)\n\n\\- Is easy to use for Doctors (it is a simple IV infusion)\n\n\\- Biochemically makes the most amount of sense to be an effective treatment as it provides direct targeting of the virus by the immune system and shortcuts vaccine therapies.\n\nCaveats: Unproven medical treatment with true \u2018proof\u2019 likely months away. Risk of unexpected negative results in studies contradicting previously done studies.\n\nUpside: Overall seemingly limited risk with high reward potential with organic financial revenue growth compounded by likely emotional piling-in phenomenom as more people learn about the treatment. Downside technically limited by baseline company financials.\n\nConcise list of other COVID-19 treatment options/companies: [https://www.av.co/covid](https://www.av.co/covid)\n\n**Strategies:**\n\n\u201cBuy before the news is out, then sell the news\u201d: Buy short dates calls now, media is starting to shift it\u2019s focus on convalescent plasma as the \u2018next big thing\u2019 in treatment for SARS-CoV2/COVID19 which will drive up associated stock prices in aforementioned companies (TAK, GRFS, CSL, etc) from emotional drive/FOMO. Likely leading to a wild upswing with eventual downward pressure once people realize they\u2019ll have to wait awhile for larger study publications. (Risky high upside, moderate down side from baseline financials and general market pressure)\n\n\u201cWait for the Research\u201d: Long term I am favoring that research will be positive for this as it pans out. This will lead to increased revenue streams for the associated companies long term. Target companies with long dated calls who derive most of their income from convalescent plasma, leading to better long term financial growth as they add this treatment into their portfolio. (High risk high reward on IVIG focused companies \\[GRFS, CSLLY\\], lower reward but smaller risk on diversified companies \\[TAK\\])\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: After writing this article I established bullish positions on BAX, CSLLY, GRFS, and TAK. \n\nSources:\n\n1.

(decreases shortage associated limitations on financials) \n\n\\- Already has a collection/deployment model, given companies already have established contracts with hospitals for IVIG (convalescent plasma)\n\n\\- Is easy to use for Doctors (it is a simple IV infusion)\n\n\\- Biochemically makes the most amount of sense to be an effective treatment as it provides direct targeting of the virus by the immune system and shortcuts vaccine therapies. \n\nCaveats: Unproven medical treatment with true \u2018proof\u2019 likely months away. Risk of unexpected negative results in studies contradicting previously done studies. \n\nUpside: Overall seemingly limited risk with high reward potential with organic financial revenue growth compounded by likely emotional piling-in phenomenom as more people learn about the treatment.

Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 9th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-9-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures were pointing to about a 200-point drop at Thursday\u2019s open ahead of what is expected to be another extraordinary number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits. Later in the morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell talks at a Brookings Institution webinar about the central bank\u2019s coronavirus intervention measures. The stock market is closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 780 points, or 3.4%, after Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic presidential nomination race. It relieved some of Wall Street\u2019s political concerns as daily increases in U.S. and global coronavirus cases have slowed since last Friday. The Dow, as of Wednesday\u2019s close, was still more than 20% off its record high in February. Depressed oil prices were getting a pop early Thursday on expectations that OPEC and its allies would agree to a production cut at a meeting later in the day.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Another 5.25 million workers are expected to have filed for first-time jobless claims last week, reflecting a larger swath of the country now under state stay-at-home orders. Together with the claims filed in the past two weeks, the total could now surpass 15 million. But that number is still probably millions shy of the number of workers who may have already lost their jobs as the economy abruptly shut down due to the coronavirus crisis. The unemployment claims report for last week is issued at 8:30 a.m. ET. It\u2019s all but certain to be the third in a row showing millions of Americans filing claims for the first time. In the last two reports, a total 10 million workers had filed for state unemployment benefits.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates told CNBC he thinks schools will be able to resume in the fall but the U.S. economy won\u2019t magically return to the way it was before. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed up to $100 million to respond to the coronavirus, has been working on global health issues and vaccines for years. Gates, a backer of an at-home coronavirus test, has said he would help pay for factories that can produce vaccines. During the interview, which aired Thursday on \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d the Microsoft co-founder suggested that therapeutic treatments for sick people could begin to roll out in four to six months, but it would take at least 18 months to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent the virus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.5 million with 88,981 deaths and over 300,000 recoveries, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. remains the world\u2019s worst hot spot with more than 432,400 cases. That\u2019s more than the combined infections of Spain, Italy and Germany. Italy still has the most deaths: 17,669. Spain said its deaths surpassed 15,000. Fatalities in the U.S. rose to 14,808. New York state\u2019s over 151,000 cases and 6,269 deaths are the most in the U.S. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at Wednesday\u2019s news conference the outbreak could \u201cstabilize\u201d within weeks if the state maintains its strict social distancing policies.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Disney shares were surging over 5% in Thursday\u2019s premarket trading after the media and theme park giant announced that its new video streaming service Disney+ now has over 50 million paid subscribers. That\u2019s almost double what Disney reported in its first-quarter earnings in February. Disney+, which launched five months ago, was doing well even before of the coronavirus pandemic, which is keeping people stuck at home and spending more time online. Disney+ rolled out in the U.K, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Switzerland in the past two weeks. By comparison, it took Netflix seven years from its 2007 streaming launch to reach 50 million subscribers.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mN5LwJi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/59fI0g5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/qqHptGK.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Z0z9bsy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gCHn266.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ZjD8fCP.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/v8207Ns.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/E4pNsaE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HfScCNv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OFGtiuq.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gWZvGov.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* USO\n* CLVS\n* DIS\n* APA\n* OXY\n* COST\n* PFE\n* SBUX\n* ATRC\n* YELP\n* USO\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-starbucks-costco-disney-anthem-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Starbucks (SBUX)** \u2013 Starbucks said its fiscal second-quarter profit would likely drop by 47% due to the coronavirus impact, and that it was abandoning its full-year forecast.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Happy Thursday to all! Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 9th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-9-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures were pointing to about a 200-point drop at Thursday\u2019s open ahead of what is expected to be another extraordinary number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits. Later in the morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell talks at a Brookings Institution webinar about the central bank\u2019s coronavirus intervention measures. The stock market is closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 780 points, or 3.4%, after Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic presidential nomination race. It relieved some of Wall Street\u2019s political concerns as daily increases in U.S. and global coronavirus cases have slowed since last Friday. The Dow, as of Wednesday\u2019s close, was still more than 20% off its record high in February. Depressed oil prices were getting a pop early Thursday on expectations that OPEC and its allies would agree to a production cut at a meeting later in the day.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Another 5.25 million workers are expected to have filed for first-time jobless claims last week, reflecting a larger swath of the country now under state stay-at-home orders. Together with the claims filed in the past two weeks, the total could now surpass 15 million. But that number is still probably millions shy of the number of workers who may have already lost their jobs as the economy abruptly shut down due to the coronavirus crisis. The unemployment claims report for last week is issued at 8:30 a.m. ET. It\u2019s all but certain to be the third in a row showing millions of Americans filing claims for the first time. In the last two reports, a total 10 million workers had filed for state unemployment benefits.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates told CNBC he thinks schools will be able to resume in the fall but the U.S. economy won\u2019t magically return to the way it was before. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed up to $100 million to respond to the coronavirus, has been working on global health issues and vaccines for years. Gates, a backer of an at-home coronavirus test, has said he would help pay for factories that can produce vaccines. During the interview, which aired Thursday on \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d the Microsoft co-founder suggested that therapeutic treatments for sick people could begin to roll out in four to six months, but it would take at least 18 months to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent the virus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.5 million with 88,981 deaths and over 300,000 recoveries, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. remains the world\u2019s worst hot spot with more than 432,400 cases. That\u2019s more than the combined infections of Spain, Italy and Germany. Italy still has the most deaths: 17,669. Spain said its deaths surpassed 15,000. Fatalities in the U.S. rose to 14,808. New York state\u2019s over 151,000 cases and 6,269 deaths are the most in the U.S. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at Wednesday\u2019s news conference the outbreak could \u201cstabilize\u201d within weeks if the state maintains its strict social distancing policies.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Disney shares were surging over 5% in Thursday\u2019s premarket trading after the media and theme park giant announced that its new video streaming service Disney+ now has over 50 million paid subscribers. That\u2019s almost double what Disney reported in its first-quarter earnings in February. Disney+, which launched five months ago, was doing well even before of the coronavirus pandemic, which is keeping people stuck at home and spending more time online. Disney+ rolled out in the U.K, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Switzerland in the past two weeks. By comparison, it took Netflix seven years from its 2007 streaming launch to reach 50 million subscribers.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mN5LwJi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/59fI0g5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/qqHptGK.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Z0z9bsy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gCHn266.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ZjD8fCP.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/v8207Ns.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/E4pNsaE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HfScCNv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OFGtiuq.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gWZvGov.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* USO\n* CLVS\n* DIS\n* APA\n* OXY\n* COST\n* PFE\n* SBUX\n* ATRC\n* YELP\n* USO\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-starbucks-costco-disney-anthem-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Starbucks (SBUX)** \u2013 Starbucks said its fiscal second-quarter profit would likely drop by 47% due to the coronavirus impact, and that it was abandoning its full-year forecast.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Happy Thursday to all! Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, April 9th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-april-9-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures were pointing to about a 200-point drop at Thursday\u2019s open ahead of what is expected to be another extraordinary number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits. Later in the morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell talks at a Brookings Institution webinar about the central bank\u2019s coronavirus intervention measures. The stock market is closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 780 points, or 3.4%, after Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic presidential nomination race. It relieved some of Wall Street\u2019s political concerns as daily increases in U.S. and global coronavirus cases have slowed since last Friday. The Dow, as of Wednesday\u2019s close, was still more than 20% off its record high in February. Depressed oil prices were getting a pop early Thursday on expectations that OPEC and its allies would agree to a production cut at a meeting later in the day.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Another 5.25 million workers are expected to have filed for first-time jobless claims last week, reflecting a larger swath of the country now under state stay-at-home orders. Together with the claims filed in the past two weeks, the total could now surpass 15 million. But that number is still probably millions shy of the number of workers who may have already lost their jobs as the economy abruptly shut down due to the coronavirus crisis. The unemployment claims report for last week is issued at 8:30 a.m. ET. It\u2019s all but certain to be the third in a row showing millions of Americans filing claims for the first time. In the last two reports, a total 10 million workers had filed for state unemployment benefits.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates told CNBC he thinks schools will be able to resume in the fall but the U.S. economy won\u2019t magically return to the way it was before. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed up to $100 million to respond to the coronavirus, has been working on global health issues and vaccines for years. Gates, a backer of an at-home coronavirus test, has said he would help pay for factories that can produce vaccines. During the interview, which aired Thursday on \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d the Microsoft co-founder suggested that therapeutic treatments for sick people could begin to roll out in four to six months, but it would take at least 18 months to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent the virus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.5 million with 88,981 deaths and over 300,000 recoveries, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. remains the world\u2019s worst hot spot with more than 432,400 cases. That\u2019s more than the combined infections of Spain, Italy and Germany. Italy still has the most deaths: 17,669. Spain said its deaths surpassed 15,000. Fatalities in the U.S. rose to 14,808. New York state\u2019s over 151,000 cases and 6,269 deaths are the most in the U.S. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at Wednesday\u2019s news conference the outbreak could \u201cstabilize\u201d within weeks if the state maintains its strict social distancing policies.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Disney shares were surging over 5% in Thursday\u2019s premarket trading after the media and theme park giant announced that its new video streaming service Disney+ now has over 50 million paid subscribers. That\u2019s almost double what Disney reported in its first-quarter earnings in February. Disney+, which launched five months ago, was doing well even before of the coronavirus pandemic, which is keeping people stuck at home and spending more time online. Disney+ rolled out in the U.K, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Switzerland in the past two weeks. By comparison, it took Netflix seven years from its 2007 streaming launch to reach 50 million subscribers.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mN5LwJi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/59fI0g5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/qqHptGK.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Z0z9bsy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gCHn266.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ZjD8fCP.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/v8207Ns.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/E4pNsaE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HfScCNv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OFGtiuq.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gWZvGov.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* USO\n* CLVS\n* DIS\n* APA\n* OXY\n* COST\n* PFE\n* SBUX\n* ATRC\n* YELP\n* USO\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-starbucks-costco-disney-anthem-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Starbucks (SBUX)** \u2013 Starbucks said its fiscal second-quarter profit would likely drop by 47% due to the coronavirus impact, and that it was abandoning its full-year forecast.

Later in the morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell talks at a Brookings Institution webinar about the central bank\u2019s coronavirus intervention measures. The stock market is closed Friday in observance of Good Friday. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 780 points, or 3.4%, after Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic presidential nomination race. It relieved some of Wall Street\u2019s political concerns as daily increases in U.S. and global coronavirus cases have slowed since last Friday. The Dow, as of Wednesday\u2019s close, was still more than 20% off its record high in February. Depressed oil prices were getting a pop early Thursday on expectations that OPEC and its allies would agree to a production cut at a meeting later in the day.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Another 5.25 million workers are expected to have filed for first-time jobless claims last week, reflecting a larger swath of the country now under state stay-at-home orders. Together with the claims filed in the past two weeks, the total could now surpass 15 million. But that number is still probably millions shy of the number of workers who may have already lost their jobs as the economy abruptly shut down due to the coronavirus crisis. The unemployment claims report for last week is issued at 8:30 a.m. ET. It\u2019s all but certain to be the third in a row showing millions of Americans filing claims for the first time. In the last two reports, a total 10 million workers had filed for state unemployment benefits.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates told CNBC he thinks schools will be able to resume in the fall but the U.S. economy won\u2019t magically return to the way it was before. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed up to $100 million to respond to the coronavirus, has been working on global health issues and vaccines for years. Gates, a backer of an at-home coronavirus test, has said he would help pay for factories that can produce vaccines. During the interview, which aired Thursday on \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d the Microsoft co-founder suggested that therapeutic treatments for sick people could begin to roll out in four to six months, but it would take at least 18 months to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent the virus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.5 million with 88,981 deaths and over 300,000 recoveries, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. remains the world\u2019s worst hot spot with more than 432,400 cases. That\u2019s more than the combined infections of Spain, Italy and Germany. Italy still has the most deaths: 17,669. Spain said its deaths surpassed 15,000. Fatalities in the U.S. rose to 14,808. New York state\u2019s over 151,000 cases and 6,269 deaths are the most in the U.S. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at Wednesday\u2019s news conference the outbreak could \u201cstabilize\u201d within weeks if the state maintains its strict social distancing policies.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Disney shares were surging over 5% in Thursday\u2019s premarket trading after the media and theme park giant announced that its new video streaming service Disney+ now has over 50 million paid subscribers. That\u2019s almost double what Disney reported in its first-quarter earnings in February. Disney+, which launched five months ago, was doing well even before of the coronavirus pandemic, which is keeping people stuck at home and spending more time online. Disney+ rolled out in the U.K, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and Switzerland in the past two weeks. By comparison, it took Netflix seven years from its 2007 streaming launch to reach 50 million subscribers.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mN5LwJi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/59fI0g5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/qqHptGK.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/i6noYAX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Z0z9bsy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gCHn266.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ZjD8fCP.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/v8207Ns.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/E4pNsaE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HfScCNv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OFGtiuq.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gWZvGov.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* USO\n* CLVS\n* DIS\n* APA\n* OXY\n* COST\n* PFE\n* SBUX\n* ATRC\n* YELP\n* USO\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-starbucks-costco-disney-anthem-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Starbucks (SBUX)** \u2013 Starbucks said its fiscal second-quarter profit would likely drop by 47% due to the coronavirus impact, and that it was abandoning its full-year forecast.
