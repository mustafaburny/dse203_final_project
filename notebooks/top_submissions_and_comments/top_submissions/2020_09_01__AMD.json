        "selftext": "Hi, I just want to get some first-hand perspectives from people who've bought $TSLA recently or are considering buying. What are your reasons for buying it? \n\nTesla had been on a stock price hike of 8X compared to a year ago, there aren't any industry-changing events during this time (the kind that AMD/NVDA went through fews year back). I mean if someone buys the stock right now, it's not that far-fetched that it could just drop back to 50% or 25% of what it is (which is still a double of what it was a year ago), while the company wouldn't even have to be doing so much worse for that to happen.\n\nWhat gives you so much confidence in Tesla?",

FAANG, MSFT, TSLA, NIKE, WMT, JPM, PYPL, AXP, BABA, NVDA, AMD, SBUX, CRM.  Or ETF\u2019s like MGK, FNGS, and SOXX if you don\u2019t have the capital to get in on single equity options.\n\n2)\tHold for at least half of the 6 months until expiration.  \n\n3)\tThe long term goal is to buy and hold shares.  This is what rich people do.  Hard assets that can\u2019t quickly evaporate like options can.  Same choice of companies as above.  Just the good shit. Hold assets that slowly grow. Cash gang = chicken coop.\n\n4)\tIn order to protect your winnings, make sure half of your account is shares.  \n\n5)\tUse margin sparingly.  Less than half of what they are offering you.\n\n6)\tIf you need to do a weekly just to have a little casino thrill in your life it should be less than a grand.  Weeklies are not how real wealth is built.  But it\u2019s ok if you see a strong trend but don\u2019t YOLO your whole stack.  That\u2019s just dumb.\n\n7)\tSmoke weed every day.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSee, I got up to six figures buying puts in mid-march. But then I lost like 3/4\u2019s of my stack staying short when the market bottomed on March 23rd.  So I needed to come up with a system to protect my gains.  Hence, the Coda code of conduct.\n\nFor example, I started with $75k but now I have around $162k in shares.  So, no matter what happens I\u2019ll likely be ahead of where I started.  I\u2019m slightly out of balance because I have more options than shares.  $196k in calls vs $162k in shares.  So I\u2019m like $34k out of balance, somewhat breaking my own rule.  So I\u2019m living a little dangerously until 9/18 at which time I\u2019m going to execute 4 apple calls and 2 msft calls.  Which will bring my share total up like $65k.  I might have to sell some options so I have the buying power in my account to get this done.  At that point, I will have more shares than options so I\u2019ll be green lit to buy more calls.  This is how I enforce discipline on myself to not get to overextended.  Leverage, but not too much leverage.  Good luck to us all!",

        "selftext": "I bought 100 shares of $AMD for something like 2.95 probably 7 years ago or so. It was my first time investing and I had never researched the basics of the stock market. I didn\u2019t really know much but many websites said something to the extent that they could be the next big thing.  So being a 22 year old, impulsive, and irresponsible I bought 100 shares for something like 305 with trading fee. I checked it for a few weeks regularly, nothing happens and I essentially forgot about it. I was discouraged that it didn\u2019t explode to the moon right away and I didn\u2019t do anything. I was very busy with work and school at the time and somehow I forgot that $300 dollars of mine was sitting in ameritrade  flash forward to roughly 2 years later or so and my phone updates the ameritrade app. I\u2019m like \u201cwait don\u2019t I have money on here?\u201d  I recover my password and username and log in to see it\u2019s worth roughly 16 a share. I\u2019m like \u201choly fuck I got like 1300 in here\u201d. So now I\u2019m hyped and checking it every day. One day it drops to 12 dollars and I panic and sell it all and felt like like wolf of Wall Street.  Well flash forward to last year and I get back into investing at a somewhat responsible and educated level and see that AMD is worth fuckin 88 a share. I contemplated layin down on the train tracks. AMD was one that got away.  Who knows if I\u2019ll ever find another one. I just have to come to terms with the fact that I made a HUGE financial mistake at a young age. \n\nDon\u2019t panic sell.

        "selftext": "I just finished reading '*The Intelligent Investor*' from Benjamin Graham. Afterwards, I tried my best to put Graham's advice into practice and analysed my portfolio thoroughly. As a sidenote, my portfolio was all US stocks (50% NASDAQ-100 and 50% single tech stocks as AMD, NVID, AMZN, ...). I looked at the balance sheets of the respective companies for the first time, with Graham's words in the back of my mind. After 2 days of analysis, I decided that none of my holdings is worth to hold at its current price. Sure, all of them are really good companies with great future prospects, but they are simply way too overpriced.\n\nOne sentences from Graham sticked to my mind the most:\n\n**The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.**\n\nThat sentence really hit me. It reminded me of the unrealistic optimism among todays \"investors\" that is most embodied in meme sentences like \"stonks only go up\", \"buy the dip\", and so on and so forth. It really made me realize that this whole game is really just nothing but a game anymore, pure speculation from people relying on the FED to keep their gains growing for another couple of month, before eventually everything has to fall apart.\n\nI think selling my positions was the right move as the market seems to be unsustainable and flooded by optimists these days. I know, timing the market is not Graham's advice either, but he certainly does not recommend a \"never sell anything and always try to buy the dip after a 5% correction\" strategy that most people promote on reddit these days. I feel smart and reliefed after selling to optimists.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Did I made a foolish move based on outdated knowledge? Will I get the opportunity to buy from pessimists in the next two years?",

        "selftext": "Hopefully, my name isn't too biased here. But I will reiterate what people talk about any time AMD is mentioned in the past two months.\n\n1: AMD's CPU leaked yesterday. And to say the least, it looks promising. Article below as I will not go into depth on this. In summary, Intel has had a better CPU for years but this looks like its changing. If priced similarly to previous CPU's, AMD will no doubt be the leader in this price range. \n\nhttps://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-7-5800x-leak-shows-a-powerhouse-gaming-cpu-that-could-embarrass-intels-core-i9-10900k\n\n\n\n2: AMD/NVIDIA battle. For a long time, NVIDIA has been the leader in the GPU battle. With the horrid launch of the 30xx series and recent leaks about AMD's GPU price to performance, its looking more and more like AMD will take market share from NVIDIA.\n      -Many retailers report not even getting 3000 series cards\n      -Huge driver issues making games unplayable\n      -Scalpers/bots taking all the available cards and reselling\n\n\n3: AMD is selling both XBOX and PS5 their Zen and RDNA chips. There is no other competition and production numbers are being met. \n\nhttps://www.pocket-lint.com/laptops/news/playstation/153151-amd-chips-xbox-series-x-playstation-5-ps5-schedule\n\n\n4. Lisa Su (AMD CEO). This summary below linked by u/Souskei about how she revived AMD is why I personally have so much faith in the company. \n\n\nhttps://medium.com/@jyjayy94/dr-lisa-su-the-living-legend-of-amd-7e0173d3a4a4\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT DATES**\n\nAMD ZEN 3 reveal October 8th\n\nAMD GPU reveal October 28th\n\nAMD earnings announcement November 3rd (expected $.31 compared to $.14 for last year same quarter)\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-announces-keynote-dates-for-zen-3-and-big-navi\n\n\nThe next month is one of the most important months AMD has had in years. I am fully expecting them to crush it and finally be on Intel/Nvidia's level after years of playing catch up. \n\n*We don't need to bring up previous AMD driver issues* \n\n\n**My recommendations for options**\n\nFull disclaimer. I am in for 20 Nov 90C. Now let's look at Bid/ask spreads, volume, and the greeks below.\n\n\nI will only look at option chains expiring after November due to all the announcements in October. \n\n**6 Nov** is not worth it for reasons below.\n   - the average bid/ask spread is 40 cents for OTM/ITM calls. Personally I usually buy close ITM calls for the delta/theta movement as it is safer. \n   -Theta for closer OTM calls are already at .11\n   -Delta is hovering at about .5 which is okay, but preferably since its a month away, we would want it a little more. No doubt it will move up as AMD increases. But so will Theta for an option expiring a week after the announcements.\n\n\n**20 Nov**\n    -My position of choice due to much smaller bid/ask because I'm not a fan of losing money to MM's. \n    - Theta of .6/.7 right now which buys us more time. \n    -Since I plan on selling the options during early November, I still have adequate time to not get wrecked by theta and let delta move in my favor. \n\n\n**15 Jan 21**\n\n    - Another recommendation of mine. Earnings will be about to be fully reported. VOL will be high and so will the expectations. The play is up to you here. But i recommend anything over $95 at minimum.",

        "selftext": "Every week for the past 8 weeks, I've seen non-stop posts about how people are having great FOMO on TSLA. How they wish they had gotten in at $1000, $1300, $1500, $1750, $2000.\n\nEveryone asking about best price to get in, whether it will go higher, etc.\n\nWell, now TSLA is down almost 40% from its ATH post-split. Pre-split it was at $2200. Then there was a 5:1 split, which drove the price to $440, at which point it rocketed up to $500 (or $3000 pre-split).\n\nNow TSLA has cratered all the way to $340 (or $1700 pre-split). Its back at the price point it was at right after the split was announced. Its still high for some people here, but its trading at a discount from its ATH of $3000.\n\nTo all those TSLA FOMO-er's, its time to step up to their conviction. Do you believe in TSLA as the \"company of the future\" that has a valuation potential that can't be captured (ie. ARKK's perspective, and hence their $7000 pre-split price target potential).\n\nAdded fun: AMD, BA, MSFT, AAPL are all hammered right now. Again, these are all stocks that I've seen people have incredible FOMO about missing the August run up. If you genuinely believe these stocks have a future, and are thinking long term (ie. over 1 year holdings), these price points are good entries for a DCA strategy. Basically, all these stocks gave up ALL their August gains, which means if you missed the boat at the end of July, nows the time to get back in because the train came back to the station.\n\nIf you believe the valuations of these stocks are still too high, then feel free to disregard this entire post.",

        "selftext": " According to Bloomberg, there is a low yield issue with the SOC chip in PS5 (as low as 50% yield). As the result, Sony will have to cut its PS5 production by 26.7%. As we know, AMD provides those SOC chips (custom 8-core AMD Zen 2 CPU and custom GPU based on AMD\u2019s RDNA 2 architecture), and those chips are manufactured with TSMC 7nm process.\n\nSince AMD's upcoming Zen 3 and Big Navi also use TSMC 7nm, will there be yield issue for Zen 3 and Big Navi too? Probably yes.\n\nWill this cause AMD and TSMC stocks to drop? Maybe.\n\nIf we keep seeing news like this coming out in the next few weeks, obviously it's not good for any of these companies. So take this into consideration for your next play - don't just YOLO thinking the market has finally turned around.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-15/sony-is-said-to-cut-ps5-forecast-by-4-million-due-to-chip-woes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-15/sony-is-said-to-cut-ps5-forecast-by-4-million-due-to-chip-woes)\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21183181/sony-ps5-playstation-5-specs-details-hardware-processor-8k-ray-tracing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21183181/sony-ps5-playstation-5-specs-details-hardware-processor-8k-ray-tracing)\n\n[https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/ryzen\\_7/4800u](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/ryzen_7/4800u)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/big-navi-picture-radeon-rx6000](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/big-navi-picture-radeon-rx6000)",

        "selftext": "Not sure when all the casual people will catch on, but Intel's big announcement(which was a shitty window dressed marketing power point presentation) came off as insecure, petty, and scared.  They mentioned AMDs name like 37 times, used the words \"our competitors\" 17 times, and called AMD \"imitators\"\n\nThey claimed to be above benchmarks because \"benchmarks dont show real world application\" and then proceeded to use a bunch of their own benchmarks in a real shady way...a bunch of misleading versions of their own benchmarks vs a rivals laptop they gimped up.\n\nFirst, they kept claiming the AMD they used was their \"top\" one, when there are 4 skus AMD makes better and they used a lower watt version. They cut the ram down by 20% on the AMD they tested just because too.\n\nIntel put this disclaimer on their site\n \n\" Software and workloads used in performance tests may have been optimized for performance only on Intel\u00ae microprocessors.\"\n\nYeah dude, and my PS4 runs a lot faster than Xbox One  I poured beer on, placed a bunch of magnets on, and then hit with a hammer a bunch of times. 3x faster, 2.77 more efficiency, 300% better vs the xbox I measured all the features as a vague 1.0.\n\n\nNVIDIA when they did their announcement never mentioned their rivals once. The benchmarks they showed were comparing their other products to the new one.\n\n Intel is scared. AMD, ARM, NVIDIA, AWS, are coming for big chunks of markets Intel gets its $$$$ from and their idea is to do the equivalent of \"alternate facts\" while coming off like someone obsessed with their ex.\n\nNow no one can predict the exact time all  the common people will see through Intel's bullshit, so I cant give you an exact date for you to do an FD on. Im very bullish and long on AMD.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are a couple things Intel's new thing(they cant even get their name right because all their shit is like the IG48800UX+ or the IS4800UGX or some alien shit) does well...you just have to go out of your way to find those things because Intel is too busy trash talking AMD and running their own sketchy benchmarks (while saying benchmarks are unrealistic in the same breath) instead of promoting these things as much as they should. Maybe also give your stuff names your own people can remember instead of naming it like two Star Wars droids combined into one? Cant wait for the Juno Lake IG88C3PO+ desktop with chips the size of a toaster.",

        "selftext": "I will start off my discsussion using a couple of examples where investors/analysts missed the big picture and the company/stock has proven that they're much more than that.\n\n**Microsoft**\n\n\nIn July 2013, Microsoft stock had the biggest drop of the century after reporting their earnings. The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. \n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/\n\n**Apple**\n\nBack in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple\u2019s stock shouldn\u2019t obsess with near-term iPhone sales. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,\u201d he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html\n\nLook at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.\n\n\n**Intel**\n\nI'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader\u2019s methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely on solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't. Also, the fact that TSMC will be on 5 nm by the time Intel fixes the 10 nm/7 nm node problems. Those are problems I'm well aware of and they have been beaten to death already. There is nothing I can add to that. I will talk about that later on but in the end as not the focal points. What I'd like to talk about and focus on is the data-centric transformation and its MobilEye division.\n\n\n**Data Centric Transformation**\n\nIntel in 2019 pivoted from being a PC centric business to a data centric business. The TAM of this is 250 billion dollars. Revenue in this business group has grown from 42% of revenue in 2015 to 51% of revenue over the TTM. While many business transitions result in periods of low performance, as firms switch focus from declining to new businesses, Intel has managed to grow its revenue by 12% compounded annually over the past four years as it better positions itself for future growth.\n\nhttps://channelbuzz.ca/2019/04/intel-emphasizes-data-centric-transformation-of-company-at-new-xeon-launch-30025/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\n**Self driving business**\n\nIntel purchased MobilEye in 2015. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel . Mobileye has a plan to dominate self-driving. Self driving taxis and cars are a big growth business. MobilEye is in a great position to capitalize on this business. Mobileye says it shipped 17.4 million systems last year. Today, over 40 million cars have Mobileye technology installed, and its products have been selected for implementation in serial production of 313 car models from our 27 OEM partners by 2017 (compared to 36 car models across seven OEMs in 2010). Some of the partners include Volkswagen, BMW, Nissan, Ford. It also has partnered with NIO, a Chinese EV company which people have dubbed the Chinese Tesla.\n\nThe firm\u2019s acquisition of Mobileye strategically positions it to build out its driverless technology business as well. In just three years, Mobileye has experienced rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $210 million in 2017 to $879 million in 2019. Its share of automobile semiconductor sales increased from just 0.5% to 1.9% over the same time. If Mobileye continues taking market share in this fast-growing segment, Mobileye\u2019s could provide a meaningful contribution to Intel\u2019s operations, as it made up just over 1% of revenue in 2019. ResearchAndMarkets.com expects the autonomous/driverless market to grow 18% compounded annually from 2020 to 2025. Intel is positioned to grow with this new market.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/ford-expands-partnership-with-mobileye-intels-autonomous-driving-business/\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18039216/volkswagen-intel-mobileye-self-driving-ride-hailing-israel-2019\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/mobileye-testing-autonomous-cars-germany-104521486.html\n\n\n**PC Business**\n\nThis is the side of Intel most people immediately associate Intel with. Intel\u2019s PC-centric business is not something to write-off. There is still a piece of the PC-centric market where Intel has an opportunity to grow: graphics processing units (GPU). Allied Market Research, expects the GPU market to grow from $19.8 billion in 2019 to nearly $201 billion in 2027 or by 34% compounded annually. For example, Intel is aggressively entering the discreet GPU business, which is about 80% of the current GPU market. The iGPU processors codenamed Tiger Lake just released September 2nd. Intel poached AMD's GPU guy Raja Koduri and nVidia's Tom Peterson. Intel hired engineers and marketing experts from Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA, the market leader in the space, to assemble a team to develop and rollout the firm\u2019s Intel Xe GPU.\n\nIntel is also releasing entry level processors. The entry-level processors will be targeted at budget-tier laptops and fanless mini desktops when they launch in early 2021. \n\nhttps://www.nextplatform.com/2020/09/02/intel-puts-its-xe-gpu-stakes-in-the-ground/\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-jasper-lake-10nm-tremont-atom-cpus-leak-pentium-celeron-skus-2021/\n\n\n**7 nm/10 nm process**\n\nSince I have your attention until here - I'd like to say one final thing about this debacle. Lot of people assume that Intel's problems with this are due to complacency. Its not. Its due to Intel attempting to achieve and do something others have been unable to do, which is the exact opposite of complacency. Intel tried to use GAAFET for 7 nm when TSMC and Samsung warned Intel not to.  Intel was warned by TSMC and Samsung that the GAA-FET technique is too challenging to implement at this point in time, but Intel\u2019s pride and persistence led it to stubbornly try and tackle the GAA-FET problem, until it finally conceded this July.\n\nI agree Intel fucked up here but the point I'm trying to make is that this was not due to complacency as widely believed. Intel has a lot of management problems, hostile work environment etc but complacency is not one of them.  Intel never got complacent about its objectives, but it may have gotten complacent about its approaches, methods, and processes.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/i8qrx4/intel_exemployee_reveals_insider_details_on/\nhttps://www.dvhardware.net/article73530.html\n\n\n**Tl/DR; Post Summary / Post Script** : \n\nI'm perfecty aware that AMD and nVidia are eating Intel's lunch and have better more powerful CPUs/GPUs. However, Intel is much more than that and its other divisions are what will drive future growth. Analysts and investors are missing this big picture.",

        "selftext": "Six trading days after the S&amp;P hit its all time high, bulls and bears can both agree that there is much more uncertainty about what will happen next. While we all know the NASDAQ is in a bubble, no one can say for sure if it has popped or if this dip will be dwarfed by the face ripping rally that could show itself as September continues on.\n\nAs a confused bull right now I wanted to take a look at some tech stocks and offer a word of caution to those echoing \"BTFD.\" Buying dips is obviously a good strategy but doing so recklessly could leave you missing out on a good amount of profit. Don't try to be a hero calling bottom when a clear bottom has not shown itself.\n\nTaking a look at AMZN, MSFT, &amp; GOOGL charts should help paint this picture better.\n\n[AMZN Daily Candle Chart](https://preview.redd.it/a4cg6rl2zsm51.png?width=1543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1efead5e7afd376ec9bd6856857cdd0a0891f80)\n\n[MSFT Daily Candle Chart](https://preview.redd.it/zutwr967zsm51.png?width=1543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30030941855be77df09ca3d001ca8fbd452522ce)\n\n[GOOGL Daily Candle Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ggbp5b29zsm51.png?width=1543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9177952a6ebf33ac4c4885dd213664b2c5cd15c)\n\nAll three of these tech giants have broken the trend line, retested it on the Wednesday/Thursday bounce, and gone back down. Closing the week at new lows for MSFT and AMZN. AMZN even sporting a bearish divergence with RSI over 70 since the July high.\n\nWith 10 week and 40 week moving averages as far apart as they are, major price corrections could take place and it would be nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nWe all just like to make money. But I know many will be mad even looking at charts pointing towards further downside corrections for their beloved tech giants. I don't want them to but its what i think will happen.\n\nFeel free to discuss future market possibilities, rip me apart for making lines on a chart, or comment a nice \"fuck you gay bear\".\n\nIf the market turned around early next week and SPY never looked back at 330 I would turn bullish very easily. But until then, I will be short.\n\nPositions:  SPY 9/18 330p, TSLA 9/18 340p, AMD 9/18 72p",

        "selftext": "Back in July, Barron\u2019s ran a story profiling the rise of Nvidia (NVDA) as the company moved past Intel (INTC) in market cap to become the most valuable US semiconductor company. The  article cited Nvidia\u2019s favorable exposure to data center, gaming, and  AI as major reasons why the company overtook top spot from Intel. Only  two months later, Nvidia is now worth $107bn more than Intel. In other  words, Nvidia is worth more than an AMD more than its Santa Clara rival.  Around the same time, AMD (AMD)  also began to see significant out-performance relative to Intel shares.  With continued momentum in the PC market on the back of its Ryzen  processors and increased success in data center with the EPYC product  line, AMD has risen 57% since the start of July. Over that period, Intel  declined 15%. \n\nIn contrast to Nvidia and AMD, Intel is disproportionately associated with  the PC. Yet even within the PC market, analyst commentary has been  overwhelmingly positive on AMD whereas doubts have surfaced over Intel\u2019s  ability to innovate and remain competitive. In the span of a week at  the end of July, Intel announced a major delay with its 7nm chips and  AMD beat Q2 earnings, raised guidance, and hit its highest PC market  share since 2013. However, the focus on Intel as a struggling PC player  has wrongly overlooked several important developments that set the company up for a near-term rebound in PC and [long-term revenue opportunities in the same higher growth end markets that have fueled premium valuations for both Nvidia and AMD](https://blackjacketco.com/f/new-brand-new-intel-growth-ahead-for-tiger-lake-edge-and-av).\u00a0\n\n1. Release of Tiger Lake processor, expanded efforts in graphics via  Xe architecture, and development of discrete GPUs for data center and  desktop\n2. Continued momentum in company shift to data-centric business first and PC business second\n3. Expanded Total Addressable Market (TAM) associated with edge computing and edge-enabled technologies\n4. Competitive positioning in autonomous vehicle technology\n\nIntel is currently priced for stagnant to declining revenues, further market share erosion, and lower  relative probability of success compared to Nvidia and AMD. Given recent  product releases and refreshes, as well as a strong strategic vision to  increase share in these higher growth end markets, Intel revenue is  more likely to accelerate and lead to significant multiple expansion in  the coming years.\u00a0\n\n* Assigning Intel CY23 PT of $125 per share\n* FY23 revenue projected at $100bn\n* FY23 net income projected at $34bn delivering 7.55 in EPS\n* Applying 16.55x P/E and 4.55 P/S\u00a0\n\nFor an in-depth and comprehensive breakdown on Intel's competitive positioning, see below:\n\n**Tiger Lake and Renewed PC Innovation**\u00a0\n\nYesterday  Intel finally revealed the highly anticipated Tiger Lake 11th  generation processors for ultra-thin high-performance laptops. Industry  reporting in previous months had speculated that the new system-on-chip  (SoC \u2013 incorporates different components like graphics and AI into one  integrated unit) would offer CPU performance advances and improvements  in graphics and AI. Intel even leaked some specs on Monday that seemed  to confirm some of the performance metrics. Although independent  industry studies are required to run Tiger Lake through its full paces,  the event demonstrated that not only can Intel still innovate, it is  more than premature to start counting the company out on PCs.\u00a0\n\nTiger  Lake clocks up to 20% higher frequencies compared to the 10th  generation Ice Lake family and can reach a single core turbo of 4.8 GHz.  During the presentation, Intel noted that the integrated Iris Xe  graphics perform better than 90% of PCs sold last year, on-board AI is  up to 5x more effective, and WiFi connectivity is up to 3x faster. In a  like-for-like comparison to AMD, Tiger Lake enabled 4x faster photo  upscaling, 2x faster video processing and exporting via Adobe Pro, and  20% faster performance in both Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. For  gaming, Intel conducted side-by-side tests using Gears Tactics. Laptops  running AMD 4800U with integrated graphics and a Nvidia MX350 discrete  graphics card (with Intel 10th Gen i7) performed worse than Tiger Lake.  Intel\u2019s test showed that Tiger Lake handled the game at up to 66% higher  frames per second versus the AMD and Nvidia-powered laptops.\u00a0\n\nBarring significant discrepancies found during independent reviews, Intel just  delivered performance on 10nm that is equivalent to what is possible on  7nm. With the simultaneous launch of the Evo brand to encompass the new  11th generation-powered ultra-thin high-performance laptop range, Intel  can begin building customer brand recognition and altering perceptions  that Intel has lost competitive footing in the PC market. With 50 PC  designs set to ship with Tiger Lake as soon as this fall, and at least  150 designs anticipated from partner OEMs, Intel may see a very  near-term recovery in its PC market share even despite the 7nm delay.\u00a0 \n\n**Transition to Data-Centric Business and Future at the Edge**\n\nMore  important to Intel\u2019s future is the multi-year shift towards  higher-growth end markets associated with cloud, edge, and data. Rather  than PCs, Intel sees its primary business as the Data-Centric reporting  segment that now comprises 52% of revenues. That figure is likely to  expand in coming quarters following 34% YoY growth in the most recent  earnings report. In FY19 Q2, the Data-Centric segment only accounted for  46% of revenues.\u00a0\n\nThat  Data-Centric segment includes: The Data Center Group (36.3% of total  Intel revenues); Non-Volatile Memory Storage Group (8.5%);  Internet-of-Things Group (3.4%); Programmable Solutions Group (2.6%);  and Mobileye (0.7%). The two largest contributors to the segment are  performing extremely well. The Data Center Group grew 43% YoY and saw  operating income climb 72%. The second largest business in the segment,  Non-Volatile Memory Storage, grew 76% YoY for record revenue on the back  of NAND demand growth and higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs).\u00a0\n\nBy  2024, Intel expects its TAM to reach $300bn. But $230bn of this is  attributed to the Data-Centric TAM. And Intel\u2019s own calculations may be  slightly conservative. In the company\u2019s analysis of its various end  markets, Intel only mentioned the edge compute market in general terms.  Yet that market alone is projected to surpass $100bn by 2030. As much as  public cloud adoption drove demand for server-related products over the  past five years, the edge could end up being a far more important  trend. That is because, in addition to further server demand, the edge  will enable billions of IoT devices to finally become widespread after  years of hype. With TAM growth associated with edge server CPU, GPU, and  storage, plus IoT and edge AI solutions, Intel can achieve growth into  the 2030s so long as the company can execute on its strategic vision. \u00a0\n\n*Edge Server*\u00a0\n\nAn S&amp;P Global study  in spring 2020 estimated that Intel has 90-95% share of the data center  CPU market despite recent share gains by AMD. While edge server  architectures and processes differ versus hyperscale cloud servers, this  figure is testament to the strength of Intel\u2019s relationships with the  leading cloud providers that are also among the early movers in the edge  computing space \u2013 namely Amazon with its Lambda@Edge platform,  Microsoft with Azure Functions, and Google with Google Cloud Functions. \u00a0\n\nFor  smaller edge providers especially, like Fastly, Akamai, or Cloudflare,  there will be particular emphasis on price-per-performance for server  components. Until recently, that dynamic favored AMD whose EPYC Rome  7742 processor rivals Intel\u2019s Xeon Platinum 8280 on performance yet  undercuts it on price by about 60%. The cost efficiency of EPYC led to  some important edge server design wins for AMD, including Cloudflare\u2019s  new GenX server that excluded Intel parts for the first time.\u00a0\n\nThe  latest Xeon processors had been on the market for a couple years,  though, and Intel refreshed the product line earlier this year in an  attempt to greatly reduce cost while maintaining performance. In its 24  February press release, Intel directly addressed the need to become more  competitive with AMD on price-per-performance noting that the Xeon  refresh: \u201c\u2026\\[reinforces\\] Intel\u2019s data center leadership by providing  greater performance and performance-per-dollar choices for\u2026customers  across cloud, network and edge.\u201d While Intel compromised on  compatibility with certain server designs, the result is 1.42x better  price-per-core-performance and a cost of $141 per-core for the Gold  6258R. The price tag puts Xeon in a much stronger position relative to  EPYC Rome 7742 which goes for $108 per-core.\u00a0\n\nDespite  early advantages in cost-per-performance for AMD, Intel still managed  to double its edge deployments year-over-year according to Forbes. And  its impressive partner list includes Lenovo, Red Hat, Advantech,  Caswell, Inventec, Lanner, Nexcom, World Wide Technology, Ericsson, ZTE,  Verizon, Vodafone, Nokia, and China Telecom, among others. With drastic  improvements in price-per-performance, Intel could very well see  additional customer wins in upcoming quarters.\u00a0\n\nBeyond  CPU, edge applications will see an increase in demand for integrated  and hybrid GPUs. Between advancements in Intel Xe graphics and its  development of discrete graphics cards, the company will become better  positioned to take advantage of the more than 33% CAGR projected for  GPUs from 2020 to 2027 \u2013 taking the market from just under $20bn in 2019  to over $200bn according to Deloitte.  Even if Nvidia and AMD maintain large leads over Intel in GPU market  share for edge servers, even a marginal portion of the market could be  meaningful to the Data Center Group which measured around $7bn in Q2.\u00a0\n\nIn  addition, edge servers present an unprecedented opportunity for NAND  solutions as well \u2013 specifically flash storage that utilizes the NVMe  (Non-Volatile Memory Express) protocol. Edge servers have strong need  for high-performance startup operations and extremely reliable storage.  That is because rapid startup times are critical for edge providers to  quickly launch computing instances and deliver the lowest possible  latency for their customers. Improvements in NVMe NAND greatly shrink  the physical storage footprint, reduce power and cooling costs, all the  while improving the overall speed, flexibility, and failure rates. And  Intel Optane and 3D NAND SSDs are exceptionally reliable for storage and  offer performance improvements over legacy storage solutions.\u00a0\n\n*IoT and AI*\n\nMuch  like edge servers, edge deployed IoT devices will similarly boost  demand for Intel processors. For workload intensive industrial IoT,  Intel has its Core processor. And the Intel Atom processor is  purpose-built for lower-power or embedded applications. Because IoT  devices will collect and process vast amounts of data, these  applications will also require significant amounts of flash memory \u2013  specifically NAND. On-device NAND SSD can increase data transfer speeds  while also integrating module-level security features, remote  management, and more flexible power configurations. Collectively,  improvements in NAND will lower total cost of ownership for these  machines. \u00a0\n\nThe edge will lead  to rapid growth for edge AI chipsets that enable IoT devices to deploy  machine learning at the edge without having to send data via internet  back to a centralized data center. Deloitte notes that around 300  million edge AI chips were sold in 2017, but this year could see more  than 750 million units hit the market. With compounded annual growth in  edge AI chipsets anticipated to outpace the broader semiconductor  industry by a considerable amount, ABI research predicts that these edge chips will surpass the market for cloud AI chips by 2025 \u2013 marking a massive shift.\u00a0\n\n**Mobileye and Autonomous Driving Technology**\u00a0\n\nIt  is interesting the extent to which mainstream conversations in media  and financial commentary largely exclude Intel\u2019s Mobileye and instead  focus on Tesla as the technology leader in autonomous vehicles and  Nvidia as the chipmaker best positioned to disrupt. Although Telsa  claims to offer autonomous modes for its vehicles, based on the 5-level  autonomous capability hierarchy \u2013 the industry standard established by  the Society of Automotive Engineers \u2013 the most advanced cars currently  on the market only operate at level 2+. Level 2+ falls between levels 2  (partial automation) and 3 (conditional automation). The hardware to  support full level 5 autonomy does exist in 2020, and the software  necessary to manage these systems is not too far behind. However, it  will likely take 5-7 years before manufacturing volumes reach levels to  drive down hardware prices, the necessary regulatory frameworks come  into place, and fully autonomous vehicles gain broad consumer  acceptance. \u00a0\n\nIn the  intermediary period, the progression towards level 5 autonomy will  continue to be gradual and incremental. Higher degrees of autonomy will  be achieved by increasingly sophisticated advanced driver assistance  systems (ADAS) that prove out the viability of these technologies and  underpin the manufacturing, regulatory, and consumer environment that  will facilitate the future arrival of self-driving cars. Beyond this, in  many cases the same technology at the center of levels 4 and 5 builds  on the existing foundations of ADAS capabilities. And the dominant  player in the ADAS market is not Tesla, Waymo, or Nvidia. It is  Mobileye.\u00a0\n\nMobileye\u2019s market  share has consistently stayed above 70% for years, even as competition  from other players has ramped up \u2013 Nvidia in particular. The Mobileye  solution is noteworthy, pairing its SoC \u2013 the EyeQ family \u2013 to support a  range of ADAS capabilities using only a single camera sensor. This  differs from the LiDAR and radar-based systems favored by Waymo, Uber,  GM-owned Cruise, and Nvidia. Tesla \u2013 who previously used Mobileye  technology until the two parted ways in 2016 \u2013 also leverages a  camera-based system. However, Tesla deploys ultrasonic sensors and  radars in combination with billions of miles of driver data.\u00a0\n\nMobileye\u2019s  commanding market share in ADAS means that its technology is used by  more than 300 models from 25 global automakers, resulting in 60 million  vehicles on the road worldwide. In contrast, Tesla currently has fewer  than 1 million vehicles on the road equipped with variants of its  autopilot technology. And Mobileye is already working with 4 major OEMs  to soon provide level 3 autonomous solutions. As part of its  arrangements with OEMs, Mobileye receives access to sensor data from  customer vehicles. At present, Mobileye is collecting 3.7 million miles  per day and growing as another 2 million vehicles from these OEMs are  set to join the data-sharing program over the next two years.\u00a0\n\nWhat  this translates to is a massive partner network with the world\u2019s  leading auto OEMs who will all have a vested interest in competing with  Tesla both in autonomous but also electric vehicles. This also means  that Mobileye has a significant advantage over Nvidia in getting its  ADAS and future autonomous solutions on vehicles. As Mobileye further  prioritizes its fully autonomous solutions, its leading competitive  positioning in ADAS, as well its strong relationships with OEMs, gives  the company a strategic advantage over its competitors as higher levels  of autonomous technologies go to market. This is evidenced by Mobileye\u2019s  strategic partnership with Tesla EV rival NIO to offer level 4 consumer  vehicles by 2022.\u00a0\n\nEven though  Mobileye made its name based on its single camera platform, the company  is separately developing what is called a full autonomous stack,  incorporating the necessary LiDAR, radar, non-camera sensors, GPS,  modems, and other hardware components that will run on its 5thgeneration  EyeQ processor. In the meantime, Mobileye recently demoed a  self-driving vehicle that navigated the congested streets of Jerusalem  using only 12 cameras and no LiDAR, radar, or non-camera sensors.\u00a0\n\nOn  the back of the hyperbolic move in Tesla shares YTD, numerous articles  have lauded the company\u2019s so-called multi-year advantages over rivals in  the space. Notably, in July Elon Musk stated that Tesla is \u201cvery close\u201d  to level 5 autonomy with no updates needed to hardware as the company\u2019s  Tesla Computer processor currently supports full autonomy. Mobileye\u2019s  EyeQ 5 also supports level 5 autonomy, however. And although the Tesla  Computer exceeds EyeQ 5 on tera operations per second (TOPS), EyeQ 5  offers footprint and power consumption advantages. Moreover, unlike most  other players in autonomous systems, Mobileye has opted for an open  architecture that enables OEMs to program their own software on top of  Mobileye hardware.\u00a0\n\nTesla has a  lead in data collected per mile at over 3 billion miles, but Mobileye is  catching up and its data repositories also exceed the billion-mile mark  on an annual run rate basis. To deepen the data sets available to  Mobileye, Intel also bought Israeli mobility-as-a-service company Moovit  for $900mn this year. Like Tesla, Mobileye is set to offer its  technology in the important robotaxi market that many in the industry  view as the precursor to consumer-adopted fully autonomous vehicles down  the line. Mobileye is launching pilot robotaxi fleets in Tel Aviv,  Paris, and Daegu City in 2022.\u00a0\n\nMobileye  still accounts for less than 1% of total Intel revenues despite  doubling sales since being acquired by Intel. Given the strength of  Mobileye\u2019s position in the ADAS market that is expected to grow to more  than $80bn by 2030, as well as the prospects in robotaxis and level 4/5  autonomous systems, Mobileye has strong potential to develop into a  major growth engine for Intel over the next 4-5 years.\u00a0\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIntel  shares are roughly flat since early 2018 despite revenues up almost 20%  from FY19 Q2 to FY20 Q2. The relative out-performance in Nvidia and AMD  shares over that time has furthered perceptions that Intel could fall  behind as the former two companies achieve sustained revenue growth tied  to more attractive end markets like data center, gaming, AI, and  autonomous vehicles.\u00a0\n\nHowever,  recent struggles with certain products and lost PC market share to AMD  have distracted investors from Intel\u2019s ongoing transition to a more data-centric business. With a $230bn TAM projected by 2024 for this  operating segment alone, Intel has multiple opportunities to likewise  drive revenue growth over the long-term.\u00a0\n\nGiven  the company\u2019s recent advancements with its 11th generation Tiger Lake SoC, continued progress in improving price-per-performance for edge  server components, and the vastly underrated leadership of Mobileye in  the ADAS and autonomous vehicle markets, Intel offers an extremely  compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to these  technology trends at a more reasonable valuation.\u00a0\n\n*You can find me on Twitter* [@BlackjacketCo](https://twitter.com/BlackjacketCo) *where I write about emerging technologies, industry news, and long-term market trends.

        "selftext": "Just as the title says the market will not tank. This is a healthy correction but of course when we're so fucking leveraged with short exp calls it feels like the apocalypse. \n\nLet's take a quick look at June 8th. SPY had a face ripping rally of roughly 30% from the previous 3 months. It was a steady climb up with a few dips a long the way. The drop off from June 8th was about 8% over a week. This is widely considered as a healthy correction. This wasn't followed by another rally. No, this is where the Kangaroo market was formed. AMD was trading like KO hovering in the $50's and theta gang was taking Bulls and Bears lunch. \n\nAfter a couple of weeks of this consolidation we started the bull run that was more rigged than Tim Donaghy officiating NBA games. SPY went up 18% in about 2 months with almost no dips along the way. Similar to June 8th, SPY drops about 8% in a week. Again, a healthy correction. Will this be followed by another 18% rally? Probably not. We'll have some big green and red days sprinkled in here and there in the next week or so. But theta is coming from the top ropes to kick our ass. \n\nThere was no major catalyst for this sell off that points to another market crash. Soft bank, tech bubble, elections, etc. All valid arguments but this is still normal compared to a sell off caused by a pandemic. Everyone one wants to be the next Michael Burry, Bill Ackman, and Bobby Axelrod. So keep buying those far OTM puts if you'd like, but the fed will not let SPY drop to $300. Mr. Pump won't let it either. \n\nWe've all gotten bear raped this last week and it hurts. Now's the time to learn to play both sides and start hedging. Having your account wiped out fucking sucks. I'm down 50% this month and I'm sure not letting myself get to 100%. Buy spreads, leaps, and wait for the storm to clear up a bit. \n\nMy positions are:\n\n AAPL 01/15 $130C \n\nSQQQ 10/16 $30C\n\n$WMT 01/15 $150C\n\nFeel free to roast me, inverse me, and tell me I'm wrong. We're all retarded here but our goal should be to help each other beat the MM's and buy Lambos or Cyber trucks.",

        "selftext": "I just finished reading '*The Intelligent Investor*' from Benjamin Graham. Afterwards, I tried my best to put Graham's advice into practice and analysed my portfolio thoroughly. As a sidenote, my portfolio was all US stocks (50% NASDAQ-100 and 50% single tech stocks as AMD, NVID, AMZN, ...). I looked at the balance sheets of the respective companies for the first time, with Graham's words in the back of my mind. After 2 days of analysis, I decided that none of my holdings is worth to hold at its current price. Sure, all of them are really good companies with great future prospects, but they are simply way too overpriced.\n\nOne sentences from Graham sticked to my mind the most:\n\n**The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.**\n\nThat sentence really hit me. It reminded me of the unrealistic optimism among todays \"investors\" that is most embodied in meme sentences like \"sto\\*\\*s only go up\", \"buy the dip\", and so on and so forth. It really made me realize that this whole game is really just nothing but a game anymore, pure speculation from people relying on the FED to keep their gains growing for another couple of month, before eventually everything has to fall apart.\n\nI think selling my positions was the right move as the market seems to be unsustainable and flooded by optimists these days. I know, timing the market is not Graham's advice either, but he certainly does not recommend a \"never sell anything and always try to buy the dip after a 5% correction\" strategy that most people promote on reddit these days. I feel smart and reliefed after selling to optimists.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Did I made a foolish move based on outdated knowledge? Will I get the opportunity to buy from pessimists in the next two years?",

I told her all the \"I'm not a financial advisor\", \"the market is too unpredictable at the moment\", and \"I don't feel comfortable as you may end up losing money\". She continued pressing me so I broke and told her she should probably invest in a company that'll still be around in 10 years so even if a crash comes her portfolio, I gave some more responsible advice and even recommended she invest in some REITs with high dividends that probably won't take to big a hit(relatively) if another crash comes.

        "selftext": "In a market with massively inflated valuations across the board (especially so in the technology sector), it feels like a breath of fresh air to see Intel trading at a P/E of less than 10. What I can't quite figure out is *why*.\n\nI know about the 7nm chip delay. I know AMD's 7nm chips are already out. I know Intel has been losing ground to AMD in the desktop market for years now. Yet, the magnitude of these factors has been completely exaggerated by Mr. Market. Intel recently released its 11th generation of CPUs, the 10nm Tiger Lake series, and benchmarks have put their performance up to 30% higher than that of AMD's 7nm chips (that metric comes from the Intel Core i7-1165G7, which isn't even the flagship chip of this generation of processors). However, even if we assume that AMD's 7nm chips are going to finally establish them as the dominant company in the desktop market, so what?\n\nIt may seem odd for me to brush off that particular loss of market share for a company that built itself on desktop CPU sales, but hear me out. Desktop sales have been in decline for years now, with laptop sales almost doubling those of desktops in 2019, and Intel's market share in the laptop market is still over 80%. Intel's management no longer considers it critical to dominate an industry in decline, and I tend to agree with them.\n\nTo offset the loss in desktop market share, Intel has increased its market share in data servers (a rapidly growing sector) to well over 90%. With massive corporations like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google making fortunes off of cloud services, Intel is taking a \"picks and shovels\" approach to profiting off of this trend (during the California gold rush, finding gold wasn't the only way to strike it rich. Many made enormous profits by selling picks and shovels to the miners). When PCs were revolutionizing the world, Intel took this same approach, and in an era when PC sales growth is dwindling, Intel is being proactive about expanding into new high-growth markets.\n\nIntel's current fundamental position has drawn comparisons to that of Apple in 2016, and I agree with the analysis. In 2016, Apple was widely considered to be a company whose upside had run out. They were fighting stiff competition in a saturated, slow-growth market, and their yearly revenue growth had started to reflect that fact. The stock fell out of favor with the market, and at one point fell to a P/E below 10. Any of this sound familiar? It gets better. What the market had neglected to realize was that Apple was still diversifying its product line (the purchase of Beats Audio, the release of the Apple Watch and Apple AirPods, etc.), was still a high-margin earner (net profit margins of \\~21% in comparison to INTC's historical margins of \\~20% and current margins of \\~30%), was beginning to reward shareholders through dividends and massive stock buybacks (INTC pays a safe dividend yielding 2.7% at current prices and is in the process of executing $10 billion worth of share buybacks before the end of this year), was in a great balance sheet position (\\~60% debt/equity in comparison to INTC's \\~50%), and had fantastic ratios (\\~40% ROE compared to INTC's \\~30%).\n\nI'd list Intel's intrinsic value at about $85/share, giving the stock a 40%+ margin of safety at the time of this writing. INTC is currently my second-largest holding, and I'll likely buy more if the share price declines further.\n\nMy primary inspiration for writing this (and the source of lots of my information) was a Seeking Alpha article that I'm not allowed to leave a link to because the auto-mods will remove this post lol. It's titled \"Intel: A Market Leader At A Great Price\" and goes over a lot of the same points as I did, but it's still worth a read imo.\n\nTLDR: INTC's recent price decline is attributable more so to overreaction and irrationality on the market's part than to the company's fundamental situation, which is reminiscent of AAPL's in 2016.",

You know their limit and potential\n\n2) lock profit using ghetto spread or legging since I don't have $25k. (best to lock at the price you bought your first leg)\n\nSo if I buy a call at $100, I will sell a call at $101 so I can get my funding back and still have the ability to trade again. ( If I buy a put, I will sell a put below the one I brought.)\n\nTo close on Robinhood, option, then you will see + and a number = # options that or - and a number = # options that you sell\n\n3) Stop loss at 20%\n\n4) Limit the amount of trade I make to 5 per days, otherwise, FOMO will my destroy my account\n\n5) Day trade only.\n\nTheta is a bitch.

AMD hit ATH of 94.28 on September 1 before pairing back gains with the entire market.\n\nIf you believe in AMD's 3 year plan, getting in at this price may be a good opportunity. The price of AMD hasn't been this lost since July 30 when it broke through the resistance at 60 and then surged to 95 based on big earnings and INTC's poor results.\n\nThe entire market seems volatile because of the recent JPow messaging on 0% interest rates through 2023. Its understandable to be skittish.\n\nBut as a long term hold, I feel confident that AMD will see the 90's again within 1 year, which makes a nice 1 year hold to benefit from capital gains.\n\nThe main risk is the news that broke recently that Sony has cut back production estimates on PS5 due to yield issues with AMD CPUs through manufacturing. We know that AMD uses TSMC to manufacture the chips, but its unclear currently whether this news has widespread impact or what the root cause of the issue was.

        "selftext": "\"The generation to generation improvement in performance, coupled with flat generation to generation pricing trends, implies an increase in performance/$ that is larger on the Ampere generation of cards than the Turing generation.

Based on past trends, we believe that around \\~3/4 of the installed base was on Pascal or older generation cards entering 2020. We believe this is important as a) it implies that 3/4 of Nvidia's installed base is on cards that are \\~4 years old, b) our view is that the typical GPU refresh cycle is around 4 years, and c) ultimately, we believe the larger performance/$ increase relative to prior generations could accelerate the installed base refresh cycle.

While AMD has improved execution across its client CPU and server CPU businesses over the past several years, the company has seen less success in its Gaming GPU franchise with share flat to down since 2016. As a result, we expect competitive dynamics between the two companies' businesses to remain largely unchanged, with our estimates implying ongoing share loss for AMD in the near term.\"",

        "selftext": " This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that\u2019s not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it\u2019s incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging \u2013 essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world \u2013 as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \\[1\\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs \u2013 a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \\[2\\], while the R&amp;D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \\[3\\].\n\nWhat is packaging?\n\nThe  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the \u2018workers\u2019 more productive in smaller spaces \u2013 first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we\u2019re now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it\u2019s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\\[4\\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they\u2019re specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that\u2019s not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  \u2018monolithic\u2019 , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.\n\n3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.\n\nChiplets\n\nChiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they\u2019re  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that\u2019s widely used right now (notably in  AMD\u2019s Zen 2 architecture), has an \u2018interposer\u2019 sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\\[5\\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we\u2019ll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it\u2019s likely that they\u2019re using TSMC\u2019s  CoWoS \u2013 Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \\[6\\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \\[7\\]While this approach is faster \u2013 each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won\u2019t have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting \u2018stuck\u2019, as you  would with AMD\u2019s approach, it\u2019s harder to design products for \u2013 you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies\u2019 philosophies. AMD\u2019s  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made  it\u2019s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an  attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences  inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it\u2019s  evident that each company has chosen the approach that\u2019s best for it \u2013  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD\u2019s smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD\u2019s  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the \u2018concrete  foundation\u2019 is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \\[8\\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. \u2013 just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.\n\nChiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they\u2019re sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two \u2018teams\u2019 have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it\u2019ll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.\n\n3D stacking\n\nIn  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it\u2019s easier to discuss them separately.\n\n3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its\u2019 \u2018Foveros\u2019 stacking tech in 2019 \\[9\\],  Samsung announced their \u2018X-cube\u2019 packaging a few weeks ago \\[10\\], and  TSMC announcing their \u20183DFabric\u2019 family just a few days ago \\[11\\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained  earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the  heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made  by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large  amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D  stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like  mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking  forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book,  to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical  footprint.\\[12\\] Even \u2018true\u2019 3D stacking \u2013 where you build layers one on  top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have  been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn\u2019t far  behind.\\[13\\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the  high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved  the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling  issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred  through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \\[14\\] These  are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data.  Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the  connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can  technically stack any chips we want together right now \u2013 TSMC\u2019s SoIC is  slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \\[11\\] the  issue is that cutting edge chips \u2013 especially x86 chips used in  datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat.  AMD Epyc\u2019s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power \u2013 an approximation of  how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \\[15\\]while Intel\u2019s  Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \\[16\\] When you consider the fact that all  this heat is coming off a piece of silicon &lt;500mm2, it\u2019s apparent  that it\u2019s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies \u2013 either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \\[17\\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips \u2013 for instance  Samsung\u2019s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \\[10\\] We\u2019re likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 of high-power logic on logic \u2013  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it\u2019s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive \u2013 even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.\n\nAfter  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn\u2019t I going to tell you  why Intel\u2019s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn\u2019t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel\u2019s future  is promising is threefold.\n\n1. Packaging  is in its\u2019 infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we\u2019re at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it\u2019s easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has \u2018won\u2019 the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.\n2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \\[18\\]\\[19\\] Although Intel\u2019s operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it\u2019s likely  that Intel\u2019s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel\u2019s engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It\u2019s current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.\n3. Intel\u2019s  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback \u2013 a terrifying thought for any competitors.\n\nIf these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.\n\nSemiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I\u2019m investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.\n\nFeel free to contact me if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!\n\n\\[1\\] [https://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/](https://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.eetimes.com/euv-tool-costs-hit-120-million/](https://www.eetimes.com/euv-tool-costs-hit-120-million/)\n\n\\[3\\] [http://euvlsymposium.lbl.gov/pdf/2012/pres/G.%20Yeric.pdf](http://euvlsymposium.lbl.gov/pdf/2012/pres/G.%20Yeric.pdf)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://semiengineering.com/knowledge\\_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/](https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/)\n\n\\[5\\] [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340843129\\_Chiplet\\_Heterogeneous\\_Integration\\_Technology-Status\\_and\\_Challenges](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340843129_Chiplet_Heterogeneous_Integration_Technology-Status_and_Challenges)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/services/cowos.htm](https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/services/cowos.htm)\n\n\\[7\\] [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/emib.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/emib.html)\n\n\\[8\\] [https://www.amd.com/en/campaigns/hpc-solutions-webinar](https://www.amd.com/en/campaigns/hpc-solutions-webinar)\n\n\\[9\\] [https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-foveros-3d-packaging/](https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-foveros-3d-packaging/)\n\n\\[10\\] [https://news.samsung.com/global/tag/samsung-x-cube](https://news.samsung.com/global/tag/samsung-x-cube)\n\n\\[11\\]TSMC Technology Symposium 2020\n\n\\[12\\] [https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/chipworks\\_real\\_chips\\_blog/2019/01/16/the-packaging-of-apples-a12x-is-weird/](https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/chipworks_real_chips_blog/2019/01/16/the-packaging-of-apples-a12x-is-weird/)\n\n\\[13\\] [https://www.nvmdurance.com/history-of-3d-nand-flash-memory/](https://www.nvmdurance.com/history-of-3d-nand-flash-memory/)\n\n\\[14\\] [http://www.appliedmaterials.com/files/Applied\\_TSV\\_Primer.pdf](http://www.appliedmaterials.com/files/Applied_TSV_Primer.pdf)\n\n\\[15\\] [https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7742](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7742)\n\n\\[16\\] [https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/194146/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-processor-77m-cache-2-60-ghz.html](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/194146/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-processor-77m-cache-2-60-ghz.html)\n\n\\[17\\] [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02503-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02503-1)\n\n\\[18\\] [https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000050863-20-000011/0000050863-20-000011.pdf](https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000050863-20-000011/0000050863-20-000011.pdf)\n\n\\[19\\] [https://www.tsmc.com/download/ir/annualReports/2019/english/index.html](https://www.tsmc.com/download/ir/annualReports/2019/english/index.html)\n\n\\[20\\] [https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-leadership-tech-team-changes-not-delayed-murthy-renduchintala-leaves](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-leadership-tech-team-changes-not-delayed-murthy-renduchintala-leaves)",

        "selftext": "So as most of you AMD fanbois know Intel don\u2019t got 7nm. Yes they\u2019re behind a generation but CPU performance improved by 15-20%. But honestly I could give a shit less. \n\nNormies don\u2019t look at that. Normies see the \u201cintel core\u201d sticker and they\u2019re sold. They have blind faith because they recognize the brand. To be honest if these companies weren\u2019t something I paid attention to I probably would have never even known that AMD is \u201cbeating\u201d Intel. Intel\u2019s core customers know that and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t think Intel is going to lose much more market share to AMD. Maybe they\u2019ll gain the super dedicated gamers and computer enthusiasts that care about that level of performance. But I don\u2019t think they represent the vast majority of tech consumers. The average tech consumer doesn\u2019t give a rats ass. They know Intel so they trust Intel. \n\nDon\u2019t believe me? \n\nAsk anyone that doesn\u2019t trade/ is a computer enthusiast if they know who INTEL is. Then ask them who AMD is. I\u2019m certain they\u2019ll only recognize one. \n\nAMD just doesn\u2019t have the same level of brand recognition. \n\nThe recent Tech \u201ccrash\u201d dragged intel back to a PE of 9. Meanwhile AMD is chilling at around 160. I find it hard to believe that somehow even though INTC has 10 times the revenue, and retains around 30% if that into NET income (where AMD is at was most recently at a wimpy 8%) that its valued far below AMD. Big fish have been eyeing it. Vanguard bit this quarter. \n\nOn top of that the recent acquisition of Mobileye should catch the attention of you Daddy Musk littles and NIO SIMPS (I don\u2019t blame you for throwing your life savings at them their cars do look sexy af) As you probably don\u2019t know the original version of TSLA autopilot ran on Mobileye. Daddy Musk got cocky and advertised the self driving system as being far more autonomous that it was which after a crash cause Mobileye to pull out of their deal with TSLA. If you ask TSLA it\u2019s because mobileye was unhappy with TSLA taking over some aspects of production. Either way that spells a smart business because they were either avoiding lawsuits or defending their right to their technology. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that they were Tesla\u2019s first choice and for good reason. \n\nMusk is now arguing against the use of a Lidar system saying that \u201canyone relying on Lidar is doomed\u201d, but Mobileye disagrees. So does Cornell. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/%3famp=1\n\nThe gist is a camera only system is bound to fail in certain environments and also performs worse in poor lighting. Ultimately if we\u2019re going to have fully self driving cars they\u2019re going to need to be able to function in all types of environments including the roads of India and China which is a task that Mobileye is already successfully undertaking. \n\nMobileye\u2019s customers include Nissan, Volkswagen, Cadillac, BMW and NIO. Most of which have agreed to share driving data with Mobileye, which puts them at a massive advantage compared to TSLA. Ultimately a camera only system is bound to eventually fail and in a society that is already skeptical about the safety of autonomous cars. \n\n\nAccording to the degenerates that call themselves analysts INTC has at most a 9% downside if it touches the historical low PEs of 7. But it also has a potential 100% upside. AMD on the other hand could drop all the way down to $8 and still have a higher price to earnings than Intel. But as you already know the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\n\nIntel has been more efficient with their money, they have real brand recognition that I highly doubt AMD will ever achieve. Oh and they\u2019re currently brining in like 10 times more tendies than AMD. They have a massive economic Moat while AMD barely has one. \n\nDon\u2019t trade on emotions trade on fact. And the fact is Intel has a bigger potential upside\n\nIntel isn\u2019t a fast mover, at these levels it still has a potential downside because the whole sector is shaky but that will only create better buying opportunities.\nIf it dips lower I\u2019m going I\u2019m going to add leaps on top of my existing position. \n\nDo your own DD-this isn\u2019t advice-but remember, I\u2019m right you\u2019re wrong; say hi to the wife for me.\n\nPositions: INTC 47.5 11/20C",

        "selftext": " \n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis is a follow up to my original post that I made a few months ago as I promised, you can find it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbwcpv/amd\\_analysis\\_and\\_why\\_you\\_should\\_sell\\_big\\_blue/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbwcpv/amd_analysis_and_why_you_should_sell_big_blue/)  \nThe following post will assume that you already read my previous post  or have an understanding of how the semiconductors work. This will cover two primary subjects, number one, Intel VS AMD and their competitive advantages, including nodes, partnerships and foundries along with how I expect things to play out over the next few years.\n\n**Intel VS AMD**\n\n*The following documents Intel\u2019s most recent launch and the potential inconsistencies I found, please be aware that the reviewers are not at fault and should not be blamed for anything that is potentially foul play.*\n\n***Cascade Lake and a story of deception***\n\n[Intel 10900k](https://preview.redd.it/t9l7el4iudo51.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b0fa720fcf9d783c5092a42a8ce8207d15d895)\n\nThe x86 CPU space has two companies currently competing in it. One is the master and one is subservient, but what happens when these roles get reversed and the master becomes the underdog? \n\nThe fight gets dirty.\n\nEver since the launch of the Zen architecture, AMD has been slowly gnawing away at Intel\u2019s market share, Zen 1 brought them back into the discussion, Zen+ consolidated their position and Zen 2 brought the fight to Intel\u2019s crown jewels. Intel in the years since Zen launched floundered with 10nm, and now 7nm while TSMC slowly ran away with their lead in manufacturing all the while AMD continued to innovate. This left Intel with two choices, buckle down and try to work the problem, or fight dirty. They chose the latter.\n\nIn 2018, well before Zen 2 launched, AdoredTV investigated Intel and their relation with reviewers and found that Intel was most likely seeding the tech press with golden samples. The scale of this was astonishing, almost all sites that he investigated had received exceptional samples. \n\nThis was in 2018, when Intel was still firmly in the lead when compared to AMD\u2019s Zen+ architecture. What about now? When AMD is on par or firmly in the lead with Zen 2?\n\nInspired by Adored\u2019s Conlake video, I chose to look into any potential foul play with their newest 10900k launch.\n\n***Methodology***\n\nIn order to ensure that Intel was fairly portrayed, I looked into as many publications that I could who published their all core overclocks along with their voltages set in the bios. All in all I found 17 publications that fulfilled the criteria.\n\nAfter I had collected the necessary data, I reached out to Silicon Lottery to ask about higher bins than what they published, that being 5.2 GHz, and 5.3 GHz.\n\nThey kindly responded to me and provided this information:\n\n*\u201cI can tell you that 1) we do not publish statistics until we reach a sample size of at least 100,*\n\n*and 2) there are a few 10900K that can fall within our theoretical 5.2GHz bin (we're talking about top \\~1% here), but a 5.3GHz bin is not possible for a 10900K under our tests.\u201d*\n\nFrom this statement we can safely assume that their theoretical 5.2 GHz bin would use 1.4 volts as each 100 MHz bump is matched by an increase of 0.025 volts, with their highest binned parts reaching 5.1 GHz at 1.375 volts.\n\nWith that out of the way let\u2019s move onto my findings.\n\n***Findings***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qlan4vkrtdo51.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d17d3f53fb045dc3af44d0fda3e2ac85f01caa9\n\n*\\*Power draw from the wall was about equivalent to that of Guru3D, implying a voltage of 1.4 volts.*\n\n*\\*\\*JayzTwoCents did not mention the voltage used, but I felt it was important to mention him as his result was completely out of line when compared to other sites.*\n\nThe first important note that should be made is that for some of the sites, they started with a voltage of 1.35 and applied a multiplier without doing any further tuning, meaning some of these publications could have achieved a better overclocking result. Secondly, because of the nature of some reviews, I could not get as many sources as I originally intended, but 17 should suffice for our needs.\n\nWith that out of the way, we can look at a few numbers, the average clock speed achieved and the average voltage necestated.\n\n**Average all core overclock:**\n\n*5.164 GHz*\n\n**Average Voltage:**\n\n*1.341 Volts*\n\nAnd we can also determine the mean all core overclock and voltage, which will be important to ensure the results are not skewed by aberrant values such as with JayzTwoCents and Overclock 3D.\n\n**Mean all core overclock**\n\n*5.1 GHz*\n\n**Mean Voltage:**\n\n*1.332 Volts*\n\nAs we can see, both the average and the mean samples would be considered Golden samples by Silicon lottery, who have had less than 100 samples achieve similar results. It is clear that something is a little fishy here, so let\u2019s take a deeper look into the results.\n\nStarting with Guru3D, the first result that completely blew me away, 5.2 all core overclock with only 1.35 volts applied. When compared to Silicon Lottery of less than 1% of samples reaching 5.2 GHz under their testing with the assumed 1.4 volts. Even if we are generous and add an extra 0.025 volts to ensure long term stability, Guru3D\u2019s review sample far exceeds the theoretical requirements for a 5.2 GHz, golden sample bin. \n\nMoving onto the next stand out, Overclocker 3D, we see an absolutely astonishing result, 5.4 GHz with a voltage of 1.402. Silicon Lottery stated that they do not believe it is possible for a 10900k to reach 5.3 GHz all core, let alone 5.4 GHz. This sample is definitively a golden sample, in all likelihood, Silicon Lottery has never seen a part that can perform this well despite testing hundreds of chips. \n\nAll other chips are excellent samples as well, with the vast majority of them landing in golden sample territory or at worse, good samples.\n\nThat being said, there is one outlier, JayzTwoCents. I am not entirely sure what happened here, it is the only chip that did not make 5.0 GHz, and is the only chip that would not be considered a good bin. Perhaps some wires got crossed or he was sent a retail unit by accident.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nMake of this what you will, but I feel that this is a clear demonstration that Intel is again seeding press with golden samples. This could have been done by them to quell the rumours that the 10900k would be a power hog or to potentially dull the edge of any potential reviews, but it is pretty clear that something is amiss. \n\nIt is also clear that Intel will continue to pull shenanigans until we call them out for it. I feel that the press should be a little more discerning or more skeptical of their results given what I have found and what Adored found in the past.\n\nFinally if you plan to buy an Intel product, please be aware that misleading information such as this is present and be aware of it.\n\n***Sources and Footnotes***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mse7izj9udo51.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd19e2f2deb5d2fa6f966e0026003e9dcce82bea\n\n**The future of Intel?**\n\nAs we can see, Intel is not shy about potentially deceiving press and consumers. That being said, I do not expect to see any legal consequences come of this as it is very difficult to ascertain if this did indeed happen.\n\nThat being said, the pain has just begun for Intel. The following will encompass a brief overview of some Intel products and the major issues they will be facing in the near future.\n\n***The death of a leading foundry***\n\nIn my last post, I said that Intel would not be highly competitive in 2022. While I admit, I was hoping to get the follow up post out much sooner, what I meant by this is Intel will not have 7nm until 2022 at the earliest. That being said, with Intel\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings, I have to readjust my personal road map for Intel, and I now believe they will be competitive again at earliest, 2023. There are a few reasons for this, and the following will be based upon leaks from Moore\u2019s Law is Dead, AdoredTV and RedGamingTech. All three have proven to be reliable sources, with Moore\u2019s Law is Dead predicting almost the exact performance of Intel Tiger Lake months in advance.\n\nCurrently, as we all are aware of, Intel is encountering massive difficulties with their 10nm and 7nm production. The issues are so prevalent that 10nm has been delayed for years, and 7nm will be delayed for just as long if not longer. Because of this they have been forced to delay product launches, back port architectures and increase power consumption massively to keep pace with AMD. \n\nThat being said, they cannot continue to increase power consumption in all sectors, for example, in note books, AMD recently launched their much anticipated Renoir APUs, which far exceed both press and my expectations. At the moment AMD\u2019s solutions are notably stronger in multithreaded tasks and graphics work loads when compared to Intel Cascade Lake and Intel Ice Lake. In fact, according to Hardware Unboxed, a reputable review channel, it is not uncommon to see AMD perform at twice the level as Intel when comparing low power solutions (15 watt TDP or lower). That being said, Intel Tiger Lake is a good improvement in terms of GPU performance, outclassing AMD by \\~20% in the 15 W form factor, while still being significantly weaker in multithreaded performance.\n\nThis shows that Intel absolutely needs 10nm yesterday, they cannot continue to increase power and lose efficiency, sooner or later they will find that even though their products consume twice the power, they are out classed in all aspects. That wall will be Zen 3.\n\n[AMD 3950x](https://preview.redd.it/a29o16umudo51.jpg?width=1344&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d12b43cb90019ef1bf776266e6b1234e7d38a99)\n\n***Zen 3***\n\nThis will be brief as not much has changed from my previous post, and I still fully expect AMD to take the gaming crown from Intel Cascade Lake. However, there are a few small updates that I must make. Intel Rocket Lake is expected to come out Q1 or Q2 of 2021, and it will have 8 cores at most. Though I am not sure why Intel would want to max their consumer platform at only 8 cores, and not maintain 10 cores, I suspect that 10 cores may consume too much power. However, it will have a 10-20% IPC bump, which *might* allow it to reclaim the gaming crown from Zen 3, though at the moment it could be a toss up depending on how well Zen 3 scales with frequency. \n\nFurthermore, I will clarify a few things: \n\n1. Zen 3 will have a unified cache, meaning that latency should be lower as packets do not have to cross over the infinity fabric.\n2. Zen 3\u2019s cores will have more access to L3 cache as it is unified, meaning it will have to access system memory less, thereby again improving latency.\n3. Zen 3 should have a small clock speed increase from an improved node, though I suspect it will be no more than 200 MHz\n4. Finally, Zen 3 should also have a higher f-clock, meaning it will have lower latency when accessing the system memory.\n\nAll in all, Zen 3 is a relatively iterative performance increase over Zen 2, with a 15-20% increase in single threaded performance being likely.\n\n***Big and Little cores Vs Zen 4***\n\nA few months ago, Moore\u2019s Law is Dead detailed Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapides; Intel\u2019s \u201cbig\u201d comeback. The following will be a summary of what he detailed, and I strongly recommend you watch his video to understand my reasoning to what will happen: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqErX7VkitI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqErX7VkitI)\n\nThe gist of it:\n\n1. Alder Lake will be on 10nm, and will utilize \u201cbig cores\u201d with high ipc, and \u201clittle cores\u201d with low ipc, and low power consumption.\n2. Alder Lake will come out late 2021 or early 2022.\n3. Sapphire Rapides will be Intel\u2019s big splash back into the data center, and will succeed Ice Lake server.\n4. Sapphire rapides will most likely have 56 cores.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nThough we have very little information on Zen 4, we know one thing for certain, it will be on 5nm TSMC. You may immediately see the issue, in my last post I said that 5nm was designed to compete with Intel 7nm, not 10nm. AMD will still have a node advantage. This along with what we know so far, Zen 4, will increase core counts substantially again, and it will be an advanced package solution, this shows that unless Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapids come out two quarters or more before Zen 4, it will not be competitive. \n\nThis is a major issue for Intel because as I detailed previously Intel\u2019s roadmap is massively behind schedule and I believe that all products that have yet to be announced, such as Alder Lake and Sapphire rapids will have been delayed by at least a few months. These delays will be further compounded by Intel\u2019s wording security problems forcing companies to either purchase more Intel products as a stop gap, or migrate over to AMD.\n\n***Data Center and the Cloud***\n\nIf you work in the server space, you know that security is paramount, and as I said in my last post, Intel has none of it. Now you may ask, why is Intel still selling massive amounts of CPUs to various OEMs such as Dell? Here is the reason as detailed by Mike Burzonne (who is supporting the Federal Trade Commission v Intel Corp. Dockets 9288 and 9341) on SeekingAlpha:\n\n\u201cAverage OEM price where I suspect deeper discounts are available for large volume bundles and hyperscale / cloud commercial.\n\nDesktop $283.79\n\nMobile $282.13\n\nXeon $715.04\u201d\n\nNow the astute may see the issue, Intel is selling these for much less than their suggested retail value. Essentially what these large OEMs are doing is, buy Xeons on the cheap, burning through them in about a year, then purchasing new ones. Obviously this is not sustainable, so they are potentially looking at AMD. \n\nMike Burzonne also believes that AMD ships about 50m units per year compared to the 400m of Intel, and from this the issue is clear, they do not have enough capacity to bring on these large OEMs in any meaningful way, plus the software stack is not entirely mature yet. \n\nNow if you look at the software stack, this is a very real head wind, but things are slowly changing, when Zen 3 is released, the Zen architecture will be just about 4 years old, which is typically when you start to see software maturity at around 5 years. This compounded with improved efficiency over Zen 2 should allow AMD to make a very convincing argument to not buy Xeons. Furthermore, we also know that AMD is ramping wafer orders from TSMC thus they should be able to increase shipments and bring large OEMs on board.\n\nThe way that Intel is going to combat this is by selling Xeons on the cheap while showing off what they have coming down the pipeline to incentivise companies to make do with their current products. The issue with this is they have proven time and time again that they do not have the ability to execute, as proven most recently by the 7nm delays.\n\n***Trouble with the FTC***\n\nThis will be very brief as I do not entirely understand the ins out outs of the suit, but the reason I specifically brought up Mike Burzonne was his involvement in an anticompetitive suit against Intel for monopolistic practices as summarized in my first post. Mike Burzonne believes that total damages could exceed 20b and a 2010 revision states 88B in damages.\n\nThe reason why the charges are so slow to move is Mike Burzonne believes that the FTC and the European Union are synchronizing to ensure that the charges are proper and cannot be easily dismissed, nor will there be lasting economic tensions as Intel is a US based cooperation.\n\nIf you wish to read more about the suit, here is the 2010 revision: [https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public\\_comments/proposed-consent-agreement-matter-intel-corporation-corporation-ftc-docket-no.9341-550006-00014%C2%A0/550006-00014-55228.pdf](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_comments/proposed-consent-agreement-matter-intel-corporation-corporation-ftc-docket-no.9341-550006-00014%C2%A0/550006-00014-55228.pdf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6miicxssudo51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c10575c5850a57d5dcdcf7c54b0e570b282dba30\n\n**Conclusion/TLDR**\n\nAs I believe I highlighted very clearly, Intel is increasingly starting to turn to more shady tactics to paint themselves in the best light possible, such as with the Cascade Lake reviews, they are losing ground to AMD in efficiency and performance, they are losing server market share and they have a potential massive lawsuit on the horizon. \n\nAll of this should demonstrate that AMD has a golden opportunity to gain massive market share as Intel toils with 10nm and 7nm.\n\nOne final thing I should note, is that the FTC lawsuit is very much uncertain, and I would be wary of basing any decisions on it. \n\nFinally, I see AMD as worth 150B in the next few years as they eat Intel\u2019s lunch, cloud compute continues to grow rapidly, and their collaborations with Xbox and PS5 bear fruit.",

        "selftext": "Are you sad about missing out on the NVDA, AMD, and AAPL runups? The good news is that the company that provides essential semiconductor capabilities to these companies is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.) TSM contractually manufactures chipsets for 499 clients. By focusing solely on contracted production, TSM has the smallest (5nm) chip on the market and a 3nm chip on the horizon, creating an infrastructural economic moat insurmountable even for the aforementioned veteran firms, who struggle to produce 7nm chips by comparison. Recently blowing Intel out of the water, TSMC is years ahead of its competitors.\n\nTSMC is trading at a 26.67 P/E ratio, compared to NVDA's 91 P/E and AMD's 152 P/E ratio. One reason for this cheap valuation is that people think Taiwan may be invaded by mainland China. As a student of international relations specifically studying Cross-Strait relations, I can tell you this is a fallacy. Taiwan-United States relations have never been better, and the United States even has a bill that almost explicitly says The United States will protect Taiwan in the event of an attack. [https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/why-us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-after-bill-help-taiwan](https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/why-us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-after-bill-help-taiwan)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e5ez47gq9jm51.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c6e97224e63f2b8eec427fb924111f7f5adaacc\n\nAnother reason why people may be scared of TSMC's future is because of mainland China's desire to get into the semiconductor industry. Recently, however, rumors that TSMC employees have been poached to mainland China's were proven false. The company is dead in the water, leaving TSMC as the sole fab. [https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4004304](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4004304) TMSC is also expanding production capacity by planning a massive $12bn manufacturing facility in Arizona, showing clear growth potential. \n\nAfter great news in late July, the stock has shot up about 20%. Since then, it has successfully tested a base of $77 time and time again. The 10-week line (in red) is rapidly approaching this base, and the company is ready to shoot off. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7due2ot8jm51.png?width=1270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c3ae01dde9f878ac05e5f0b89cae19d47677e52\n\nThink about it: with Neuralink, self-driving cars, faster cell phones, drones, electronic body implants and accessories, and more automation, what product will be in the highest demand?

        "selftext": " **NVIDIA 3rd Party Card Catastrophe**  \n\n\nListen up idiots, \n\nSo most GPUs are made by a 3rd party. AMD and NVIDIA make the actual \"brain\" of the GPU but 3rd party partners add onto it for better performance (very basic explanation). Don't ask me why this is, it is just mainly because of logistical reasons.  \n\nBut that is not the point, the point is that the great majority of GPUs are third-party cards meaning that they get to change around the design of the PCB. The issue here is that some of these third-party partners cheaped out on little capacitors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Big Capacitors](https://preview.redd.it/63d87b2bwip51.png?width=980&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a95dc6f5ecad00af735592a86b9d9f64a919c504)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Big + Small \\(more expensive but better\\)](https://preview.redd.it/jnv10ezcwip51.png?width=980&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f67fb502c4876ff55bc3ea7b1abe92b957c1d74)\n\n By cheaping out it is leading to bad power delivery. The only way to fix this rn is to down clock the card which the normal person doesn't know how to do and doesn't expect is necessary when they are buying a 500$+ piece of hardware.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like if there is a mass callback that will be bad PR. NVIDIA could always release drivers that make the cards run below their listed spec but i'm not sure if people will really want that even if the performance loss is marginal.    \n\n\nEVGA already confirmed the suspicions that these cards were crashing because of capacitor issues. It may be different for other companies but at least for EVGA this is what they are saying currently.  \n\n\nPositions:  \nNone currently because I don't think the suits could give two shits.   \n\n\nSources:\n\n [https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/)\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8)\n\n [https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes)   \n\n\n*This is not financial advice just me presenting the facts and the possibility of a callback.*",

DLSS is witch craft, able to easily double the FPS in games. it simply makes no more sense to buy amd gpu any more. plus nvidia has better drivers, as always.\n\nand dont forget the Samsung deal. nvidia's able to reduce price on 3000 series cards due to samsung offering very cheap price, rumor is half of what TSMC offers. this means much higher margins when it reports next earnings. the EPS gonna go through the roof.\n\ncloud gaming is booming. its a new industry that analysts expect to grow to 5 billion industry in just a few years. nvidia is including a 1 year free GFN subscription with 3000 series purchase by the way, in order to further kickstart the cloud gaming business. cloud gaming is bascially video game streaming, like netflix. so if netlifx get crazy valuation even though its only a pure play in streaming, why cant nvidia?\n\ndata center business is growing strong. it surpassed gaming revenue for the first time. the AI business will continue to be a secular trend. we're living increasingly in a digital world. think of all the surveilllence system, what do you think power them to do facial recognization? its the GPUs. china's been expanding its police state and will only require even more GPUs to do the tasks and the rest of the world will follow too.\n\nonce nvidia finish the ARM aquision, it will have CPU capabilities just like intel and amd. and ARM cpus has been growing stronger every year. nvidia, being a new player in the CPU space, gonna compete against intel data center business by releasing cheaper cpus. if AMD stock price is skyrocketing coz people think they gonna take intel's cake, imagine what gonna happen with nvidia when people realize nvidia poses an even stronger threat to intel than amd does?\n\nalso, nvidia has superb software. its CUDA ecosystem is industry standard. its very hard to break away from an ecosystem. CUDA is to AI what microsoft office is to office work. amd and intel are not gonna be able to take its place.\n\nnvidia market cap now is only 300 billion. 1 trillion is totally achievable within 1 year, honestly i wouldnt even be surprised if it achieves 700 billion before the end of 2020, especially with the QE environment we are in right now. it will be the first semiconductor company with 1 trillion valuation and it well deserves it.",

        "selftext": "Many of us are probably thinking about buying the dip because stock is on sale. That is a valid strategy if we look at the dip in the right context. If a stock is under-priced or reasonably priced, then the dip presents a huge buying opportunity because the stock is now even more under-priced. If a stock is over-hyped and has seen massive gain over very short period of time, then the dip is a trap. So let look at some number:\n\n||Pre-covid Price (Feb 20)|Gain (from Feb 20 to Aug 31)|Drop (from Aug 31 to Sep 4)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tesla|$179.88|177.03%|\\-16.05%|\n|Apple|$80.08|61.14%|\\-6.26%|\n|AMD|$58.90|58.58%|\\-9.71|\n\nOn Aug 31, Tesla was at 177.03% above its pre-covid price. Now, it just drops 16.05%. Is it on sale? Obviously no because it's still more than 100% above its pre-covid price. Imagine during Labor Day, stores increase their merchandise's price heavily and then put a 16%-off sticker on it. Would you rush into the stores to buy the merchandise because it's 16% off? Most likely no.\n\nWe are only 60 days away from the presidential election, so there are a lot of uncertainty and volatility. So don't FOMO or YOLO into buying the dip of all the ATH stocks.

        "selftext": "The famous quote from Peter Lynch said to invest in what you know but that's just bad advice.\n\n&gt;This is the kind of company people adore owning: it\u2019s a relatively simple company, they make a very narrow, easy to understand product. They make an architecture that delivers superior performance for HPC and hyperscale workloads, Integrates compute and data on the same package by adding chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) with HBM2 technology to deliver 3X more memory performance over the previous architecture. This provides a generational leap in time to solution for data-intensive applications. Has a Page Migration Engine that frees developers to focus more on tuning for computing performance and less on managing data movement. Applications can now scale beyond the GPU's physical memory size to virtually limitless amounts of memory. Enables lightning-fast nodes to substantially accelerate time to solution for strong-scale applications. A server node can interconnect up to eight of it at 5X the bandwidth of PCIe. It's designed to help solve the world's most important challenges that have infinite compute needs in HPC and deep learning. Enables mixed-workload HPC data centers to realize a dramatic jump in throughput while saving money. For example, a single GPU-accelerated node powered by four of it interconnected with PCIe replaces up to 32 commodity CPU nodes for a variety of applications. Completing all the jobs with far fewer powerful nodes means that customers can save up to 70 percent in overall data center costs. Now, if you want a piece of crap like that, you will never make money. Never. Somebody will come along with more whetstones or less whetstones or bigger megaflop or a smaller megaflop. You won\u2019t have the foggiest idea what\u2019s happened. And people buy this junk all the time.\n\nHow many people really know about Intel, AMD, Nivida, ASML or TSMC beyond a surface level? \n\nIf you invested in what you know, I wouldn't be investing in Apple or Facebook since I don't use their products or services or understand their appeal. I don't buy things from Amazon or subscribe to their services as well. I have never bought a product recommended to me by advertisements or watched YouTube without adblock off. The only thing I would be investing in would be consumer staples.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe only thing I know is that I know nothing, and i am no quite sure that i know that.\u201d\n\n\u2015 Socrates, Essential Thinkers",

I like AMD because I think they gave a lot of room for growth they\u2019re stock history is very good and they\u2019ve been growing like crazy these past few months although their PE ratio is very high which scares me a little. Also the China/US tech war is stopping me from putting money in AMD but I still feel that it\u2019s got a lot of potential. Although I do like Walmart because they have a  strong foundation good history and if they acquire tiktok then that all boost they\u2019re online advertising.",

Hope you all are having a wonderful bloody morning. \n\nNot sure if you guys are familiar with this company since you all just trade the same meme stocks over and over, but their stickers would go on computers and laptops. These stickers powered those devices and not only that, they reflected bunch of cool colors. This is a little history lesson for you Tik-cockers, instead of another gay dance. \n\nAnyways on a serious note, is Intel dead? Are you guys ever going to be bullish on Intel again or did AMD already do the job and put them out of their misery? Just curious because this stock dove straight down and has not seen $60 since July 23, and has struggled to ever show that green line some of y\u2019all post. Unlike AMD that went to the stratosphere and reached new highs. \n\nWhat do you guys think the future holds for this NASDAQ fossil, will it ever get back to where it was or is it just south from here?\n\nIf you made it this far thank you, I will be hoping to read your replies retards &amp; hope your lines turn green! \ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Many of us are probably thinking about buying the dip because stock is on sale. That is a valid strategy if we look at the dip in the right context. If a stock is under-priced or reasonably priced, then the dip presents a huge buying opportunity because the stock is now even more under-priced. If a stock is over-hyped and has seen massive gain over very short period of time, then the dip is a trap. So let look at some number:\n\n||Pre-covid Price (Feb 20)|Gain (from Feb 20 to Aug 31)|Drop (from Aug 31 to Sep 4)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tesla|$179.88|177.03%|\\-16.05%|\n|Apple|$80.08|61.14%|\\-6.26%|\n|AMD|$58.90|58.58%|\\-9.71|\n\nOn Aug 31, Tesla was at 177.03% above its pre-covid price. Now, it just drops 16.05%. Is it on sale? Obviously no because it's still more than 100% above its pre-covid price. Imagine during Labor Day, stores increase their merchandise's price heavily and then put a 16%-off sticker on it. Would you rush into the stores to buy the merchandise because it's 16% off? Most likely no.\n\nWe are only 60 days away from the presidential election, so there are a lot of uncertainty and volatility. So don't FOMO or YOLO into buying the dip of all the ATH stocks. And take profit if you already have massive gain.",

        "selftext": "I will start off my discsussion using a couple of examples where investors/analysts missed the big picture and the company/stock has proven that they're much more than that.\n\n**Microsoft**\n\n\nIn July 2013, Microsoft stock had the biggest drop of the century after reporting their earnings. The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. \n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/\n\n**Apple**\n\nBack in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple\u2019s stock shouldn\u2019t obsess with near-term iPhone sales. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,\u201d he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html\n\nLook at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.\n\n\n**Intel**\n\nI'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader\u2019s methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely on solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't. Also, the fact that TSMC will be on 5 nm by the time Intel fixes the 10 nm/7 nm node problems. Those are problems I'm well aware of and they have been beaten to death already. There is nothing I can add to that. I will talk about that later on but in the end as not the focal points. What I'd like to talk about and focus on is the data-centric transformation and its MobilEye division.\n\n\n**Data Centric Transformation**\n\nIntel in 2019 pivoted from being a PC centric business to a data centric business. The TAM of this is 250 billion dollars. Revenue in this business group has grown from 42% of revenue in 2015 to 51% of revenue over the TTM. While many business transitions result in periods of low performance, as firms switch focus from declining to new businesses, Intel has managed to grow its revenue by 12% compounded annually over the past four years as it better positions itself for future growth.\n\nhttps://channelbuzz.ca/2019/04/intel-emphasizes-data-centric-transformation-of-company-at-new-xeon-launch-30025/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\n**Self driving business**\n\nIntel purchased MobilEye in 2015. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel . Mobileye has a plan to dominate self-driving. Self driving taxis and cars are a big growth business. MobilEye is in a great position to capitalize on this business. Mobileye says it shipped 17.4 million systems last year. Today, over 40 million cars have Mobileye technology installed, and our products have been selected for implementation in serial production of 313 car models from our 27 OEM partners by 2017 (compared to 36 car models across seven OEMs in 2010). Some of the partners include Volkswagen, BMW, Nissan, Ford. It also has partnered with NIO, a Chinese EV company which people have dubbed the Chinese Tesla.\n\nThe firm\u2019s acquisition of Mobileye strategically positions it to build out its driverless technology business as well. In just three years, Mobileye has experienced rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $210 million in 2017 to $879 million in 2019. Its share of automobile semiconductor sales increased from just 0.5% to 1.9% over the same time. If Mobileye continues taking market share in this fast-growing segment, Mobileye\u2019s could provide a meaningful contribution to Intel\u2019s operations, as it made up just over 1% of revenue in 2019. ResearchAndMarkets.com expects the autonomous/driverless market to grow 18% compounded annually from 2020 to 2025. Intel is positioned to grow with this new market.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/ford-expands-partnership-with-mobileye-intels-autonomous-driving-business/\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18039216/volkswagen-intel-mobileye-self-driving-ride-hailing-israel-2019\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/mobileye-testing-autonomous-cars-germany-104521486.html\n\n\n**PC Business**\n\nThis is the side of Intel most people immediately associate Intel with. Intel\u2019s PC-centric business is not something to write-off. There is still a piece of the PC-centric market where Intel has an opportunity to grow: graphics processing units (GPU). Allied Market Research, expects the GPU market to grow from $19.8 billion in 2019 to nearly $201 billion in 2027 or by 34% compounded annually. For example, Intel is aggressively entering the discreet GPU business, which is about 80% of the current GPU market. The iGPU processors codenamed Tiger Lake just released September 2nd. Intel poached AMD's GPU guy Raja Koduri and nVidia's Tom Peterson. Intel hired engineers and marketing experts from Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA, the market leader in the space, to assemble a team to develop and rollout the firm\u2019s Intel Xe GPU.\n\nIntel is also releasing entry level processors. The entry-level processors will be targeted at budget-tier laptops and fanless mini desktops when they launch in early 2021. \n\nhttps://www.nextplatform.com/2020/09/02/intel-puts-its-xe-gpu-stakes-in-the-ground/\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-jasper-lake-10nm-tremont-atom-cpus-leak-pentium-celeron-skus-2021/\n\n\n**7 nm/10 nm process**\n\nSince I have your attention until here - I'd like to say one final thing about this debacle. Lot of people assume that Intel's problems with this are due to complacency. Its not. Its due to Intel attempting to achieve and do something others have been unable to do, which is the exact opposite of complacency. Intel tried to use GAAFET for 7 nm when TSMC and Samsung warned Intel not to.  Intel was warned by TSMC and Samsung that the GAA-FET technique is too challenging to implement at this point in time, but Intel\u2019s pride and persistence led it to stubbornly try and tackle the GAA-FET problem, until it finally conceded this July.\n\nI agree Intel fucked up here but the point I'm trying to make is that this was not due to complacency as widely believed. Intel has a lot of management problems, hostile work environment etc but complacency is not one of them.  Intel never got complacent about its objectives, but it may have gotten complacent about its approaches, methods, and processes.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/i8qrx4/intel_exemployee_reveals_insider_details_on/\nhttps://www.dvhardware.net/article73530.html\n\n\n**Tl/DR; Post Summary / Post Script** : \n\nI'm perfecty aware that AMD and nVidia are eating Intel's lunch and have better more powerful CPUs/GPUs. However, Intel is much more than that and its other divisions are what will drive future growth. Analysts and investors are missing this big picture.",

        "selftext": "*** this post was originally posted on w s b, and it received 4 awards within 30 minutes, but it was removed for some reason. Hope this is more helpful here!! *** \n\nI\u2019m relatively new to the game so I don\u2019t really know the more advanced strategies so anyone who has more tips to add, please comment below. \n\nSimplified definitions of terms used in this post: \n\nDelta: how much the value of each contract you own will change when the underlying stock moves by $1. \n\nGamma: how much the delta will change when the underlying stock moves by $1. \n\nTheta: how much the value of each contact you own will go down over time as you get closer to the date of expiration. \n\nCatalyst: something that can affect the stock price. This could be bad or good news that came as a surprise, or if could be a planned event like an earnings release. \n\nImplied Volatily (IV) : the markets forecast for a likely movement in the underlyings stock price. This also makes the contact more expensive because it\u2019s riskier. \n\nHigh % of IV means that there are catalysts coming up that can greatly change the stock price. (For example: earnings soon, stock split soon, major event or announcement soon, any event that affects this stock) \n\nVega: how much the value of each contract you own will change if the implied volatility changes by 1%.\n\nIV crush: Whenever there is a planned event or catalyst, the IV% tends to go up leading up to that event. The bigger the event and the more controversial it is, the higher the IV runup. After the news has broken, the IV gets \u2018crushed\u2019 and falls down drastically, lowering the price of the contact. \n\nVolume: the amount of times that exact contract was either opened or closed today. \n\nOpen interest: the number of that exact contact that is currently being held by others in the market. \n\nStrike price: the target stock price that you think the underlying stock can hit either before or at the time your contract expires. \n\nIn the money: the strike price of your contract is currently lower than the price of the stock. If your contract expires ITM, you can exercise it and buy 100 shares at that price, or it will be sold. \n\nOut of the money: the strike price is higher than the stock price. If your contract expires OTM, it will be completely worthless. \n\n\nTips and tricks for earnings plays: \n\n\n\u2014- Always remember that your goal is to sell your options contract to someone else, whether you sell before or after earnings. (Unless you want to excercise it) \n\nIf you sell before earnings, you are selling it to someone who is taking a huge bet that the stock price will skyrocket after earnings. \n\nIf you sell after earnings, your contract could be in the money if the stock skyrocketed and therefore it\u2019s easy to sell. If earnings didn\u2019t go well, you\u2019re selling to cut your losses to someone who still believes in your strike price on the expiration date. \n\n\u2014- almost NEVER hold through earnings unless you\u2019re extremely confident in the underlying and you have some sort of first hand knowledge of their performance this quarter. \n\nIV crush is gonna lower the value of your contract regardless of whether the underlying stock price goes up or down. \n\nThose who hold after earnings are hoping that the stock price will go up so much that they will still make money regardless of losing money due to IV crush. \n\n\u2014- you can actually measure the amount of IV crush your contact will experience if you deuce to hold after earnings. Go research the IV rank for the underlying stock and look at the free one year chart (market chameleon) \n\nLook at the past earnings dates and see how much the IV dropped after an earnings announcement. If the average is around 10% IV. Take your contracts Vega and multiple by 10. \n\nThat is the minimum amount your contract price will likely drop after earnings. Make sure you are confident that the value will increase enough after earnings to outweigh the loss from IV crush. \n\nIf you think the underlying stock price will go up by $10 after earnings, multiple your current delta by 10 and then subtract the amount your contract will go down due to IV crush. \n\nIf you\u2019re breaking even, it\u2019s probably a bad idea to risk holding through earnings. \nIf you\u2019re now negative, SELL BEFORE EARNINGS! \n\nI\u2019ve personally experienced the stock price go up by 5% after earnings, but my option contract value went way down. \n\n\u2014- to avoid IV crush, use market chameleon or something else to look at the IV rank. The higher the IV rank, the more you are likely to suffer from IV crush. This probably means that you\u2019re buying way too close to earnings. \n\n- if you bought the underlying within a couple of weeks, it\u2019s very likely that the Implied Volatily has been greatly inflated. You\u2019re probably too late. Don\u2019t do it. \n\n- if WSB has been talking about this stock\u2019s earnings for a couple of weeks now and you just now decided to jump in, you\u2019re too late. Don\u2019t do it. \n\n\u2014- the only way to get around IV crush is to buy when the IV is very low. This usually means that you purchased the contract months ago. But if you bought when IV was low, you should almost ALWAYS sell before earnings to capture the profits from the IV runup. \n\n\u2014- the morning after plan: After an earnings release, the IV basically gets crushed and resets. Purchase a call contract that expires after the next earnings date. This is called a leap. \n\nEven if the stock trades sideways the entire time running up to earnings, your contact will gain value due to the IV runup and you should most likely sell before earnings to capture profits. \n\n\u2014- follow the media, and/or wallstreetbets.\n\nStock price, implied volatility move with the media. The more they talk, the more the option contract will change. The more hype, the more the stock price will increase. \n\nTry to recognize a trend in hype early and jump on the bandwagon. Then attempt to hype everyone else up in the comment section on Reddit. Take advantage of it. Then sell before earnings. \n\nFor example PRPL. If you don\u2019t believe in this company and you doubt that they will have good earnings. Buy in when the hype starts and sell before earnings. \n\nDon\u2019t be the guy who bought it two days before earnings and held through earnings. \n\n\u2014- If bad news breaks that you personally don\u2019t believe matters for the underlying stock value, sell and take profits because the media will cause the price to go down. \n\nIf you truly believe that news doesn\u2019t matter, but in on the dip and watch it go back up. \n\n\u2014- you\u2019ll be surprised to hear that everyone has a little bit of insider knowledge. Use it for your advantage. \n\nFor example, you work at Home Depot and you\u2019ve never seen this much traffic going in and out of the store. Bet on Home Depot earnings. \n\nYou\u2019re a video gamer and you\u2019re obsessed with researching leaks and rumors on the next Nvidia or AMD graphics cards and you\u2019re convinced that these will be a blowout. Bet on earnings. (Early) \n\nYou work at fedex and it\u2019s been incredibly busy due to the lockdown and stay at home orders. Bet on FedEx. \n\nYou work in the educational field and you know that schools are ordering massive amount iPads for schooling from home. Go long on aapl. \n\nMy example: I\u2019m a YouTuber who has been studying Apple products and the future of their Apple silicon chips and I\u2019m convinced they\u2019re going to be great. I\u2019ve researched the leaks and rumors on the release dates. Positions: $140c 11/20 and $150c 1/15/21 AAPL\n\nTrade stocks that are in your field and you have a slight advantage. \n\n\u2014- make your own media. \n\nIf you have a bit of insider Knowledge and you strongly believe that a stock will go up or down, don\u2019t keep it to yourself. \n\nPost a DD on reddit trying to convince others that you\u2019re making the right bet. Be sure to correctly write out the ticker because people search for it on Reddit. This helps for SEO for google search results. \n\nExamples: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iiplpg/why_apple_has_much_more_room_to_grow_within_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ijypyi/why_you_should_buy_sabr_leaps_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nCorrectly spelled tickets: $AAPL and $SABR\n\nIf it makes sense, others will join in. This will increase the value of your options. This also increases the chance that you\u2019ll create the next PRPL or RKT hype train if others start making their own DD on that stock. Comment on their posts and try to get others hyped up. Show off your gains so far. \n\nPump it up and dump it before earnings for profits. \n\nDon\u2019t be the guy who held PRPL through earnings. \n\n\u2014- if you are confident in your play and it takes a dip, considering buying in again at a lower strike price to average down. This makes for a vertical spread. \n\n\nTips for when you decide to buy an option contract: \n\n\u2014- the most important thing is that you choose strike prices and expiration dates that have high open interest. A good rule of thumb is at least 1,000 OI. \n\nThe more the OI, the more other people are making the same bet, which is reassuring. \n\nIf you have insider knowledge, this rule doesn\u2019t really apply as much since you\u2019re getting in before others. \n\n\u2014- is the open interest is much lower than the volume, this means that people are dumping that option and either cutting losses or taking profits. They are not confident in that contract at all. It may be a good idea to avoid this contract or stock. Possibly buy puts. \n\n\u2014- when choosing your strike price, it\u2019s a good idea to choose round numbers or multiples of 5. For example, don\u2019t buy the $91 call, buy the $90 call. Don\u2019t buy the $12.5 call, buy the $15 call. Don\u2019t buy the $295 call, buy the $300 call. \n\nPeople like even numbers and if they choose to buy options, they are more likely choose those numbers. \n\nThey are more likely to buy that contract from you when you choose to sell it and take profits. \n\nI\u2019ve experienced this myself when I bought a $91 call and a $90 call. The $90 call gained more value as the underlying stock price went up. \n\nThese strike prices will tend to have much higher vomume and open interest, which is good. \n\n\u2014- compare the prices and Greeks of multiple option contract choices before you buy. One of them might have a higher delta/theta ratio for not much more premium. \n\n\u2014- have a goal of closing your contract at least 3 days before earnings unless this stock is getting a ton of hype on reddit or in the media. \n\n\u2014- avoid getting a contract with an expiration date too close to the earnings date. For example, your contact expires Friday and the earnings is Thursday evening. \n\nYou will lose a good chunk of value from theta. \n\n\u2014- set your expiration to at least a week after earnings to avoid theta decay. \n\n\u2014- if you plan on holding through earnings, it would be a good idea to choose an expiration date 2 weeks after earnings just in case the stock value drops after earnings. \n\nThis gives you another week for the stock to hopefully recover, but your chances are pretty slim because of IV crush and theta decay. \n\n\u2014- avoid buying options too far out of the money. There\u2019s a reason they\u2019re cheap. Remember that if that the stocks value goes down 5%, it has to go back up 5% and then go up even more to hit your strike price. \n\n\u2014- If you\u2019re starting to inch closer to the date of expiration and you\u2019re still way out of the money, consider cutting your losses. Your contact will quickly be worth 1 cent, maybe even a few days before expiration.  \n\nYou could cut your losses and buy in at a cheaper price with a further expiration date. Or invest elsewhere. \n\n\u2014- it is a safer bet to buy one contract that\u2019s in the money for a higher price instead of buying 5 contacts out of the money. \n\nYour 1 contract will hold its value much better if things don\u2019t go as planned. The 5 OTM contracts could potentially make more if things go as planned, but you could lose every last dime. \n\n\u2014- avoid putting in more than 25% of your total portfolio into one earnings play. If you totally fail, you still have some cash to work with and your confident isn\u2019t crushed. \n\nIf your confidence is crushed, you tend to make terrible yolo plays as an attempt to redeem yourself or punish yourself. \n\n\u2014- it\u2019s a safer bet to gradually make a bunch of smaller gains using up to 25% of your portfolio instead of YOLOing eveyrhing on one earnings play and losing it all. \n\nHave any more tips?

        "selftext": "So after Nvidia dropped their Ampere to challenge the GPU market, everyone is expecting AMD to bring their new Radeon series. When? No one was exactly sure. Today, though, they [hinted](https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-big-navi-tease-frank-azor/) that they might reveal it tomorrow. \n\nAfter NVDA\u2019s launch of RTX series last week, the GPU is where AMD needs to increase their revenue. There is a high likelihood Q4 and 2021 Q1 revenues &gt;3B. With margins still around 45% and PE values for AMD &gt;50 at least, AMD could be heading for 120B-140B valuation. stock price target: 105-115. \n\nSo, long calls are where you want to be, with [$87.5 by 10/02 being very likely](https://unusualwhales.com/alerts/52d63c41-c852-452c-890d-cef8de89dcd0).

        "selftext": "Hello, I've done some research but I'm new to investing so I could use some advice.  \nI'm looking to invest \\~10k into my TFSA. Im in my 20s &amp; I've been trying to figure out how to allocate my money. I dont mind volatility or high risk investments &amp; I'm open to keeping my money invested long term.\n\nIm interested in renewable energy ETFs such as CNRG &amp; ICLN. Im also interested in tech related stocks such as AMZN, NFLX, SPOT, NVDA, &amp; AMD\n\nConsidering that I only have 10k to start with, and am looking for growth, Would it make sense for me to buy a few of each stock (just 1 AMZN) and then put the difference in CNRG &amp; ICLN? Should I choose 1 ETF instead of both? Should I be looking elsewhere for growth?  \n\nThese are sectors/companies that I believe in but I dont if I'm spreading too thinly considering the amount of money that i'm open to invest at this point.\n\nAll input is appreciated, thanks.",
