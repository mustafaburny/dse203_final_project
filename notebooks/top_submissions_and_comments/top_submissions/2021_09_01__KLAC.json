        "selftext": "Companies which operate in duopolies often have wide moats which deliver good financial performance because they're less susceptible to new entrants, often due to high barriers to entry. Many industries also mature to the point where it's only profitable for a handful of companies to operate, which can be profitable for those which survive. For an example, look at the memory semiconductor manufacturing industry. Lots of consolidation over the past two years like Intel selling its NAND business to SK Hynix and Western Digital buying Kioxia. \n\nMy question is, what are some duopolies in relatively attractive industries? Regardless of market cap. I'll start: \n\n$V and $MA: one of the first duopolies many people think of, the two companies with a solid grip on the payment processing space. Have been some worries about new technology/entrants as of late but the chart for these companies tells the story. \n\n$WM and $RSG: waste management is a highly fragmented industry but these two companies have come out on top after Republic Services (the 3rd largest at the time) bought Allied Waste (2nd largest) in 2008. Many think of garbage disposal as a boring, defensive industry akin to utilities, but both stocks are up 150% in five years (good but not great) with a 1.5% dividend, good management and should (theoretically) offer decent downside protection in an economic downturn. \n\nSemiconductor capital equipment: not listing individual stocks because the entire industry is a series of duopolies between $ASM, $LRCX, $AMAT, $TOELY, and $KLAC. The technology is so damn hard and expensive to develop that the market has been whittled down to these five companies supplying most equipment for fabricating semiconductors, charts speak for themselves. \n\nWhat are some other ideas on duopolies? Open to any feedback on this strategy as well.",

        "selftext": "DD Format borrowed from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/user/hooman_or_whatever/comments/m0vwbu/proterra_actc_dd_the_most_undervalued_stock_on/). Even though that stock did not age well, I thought the DD post format was great. \n\nHere's my take on Cepton, with the conclusion that they are flying under the radar at the moment and this is quite an opportunity to invest.\n\n  \n\nTopics to be Discussed:\n  \n\n-   Overview\n-   Leadership\n-   Board of Directors\n-   Products, Services, and Technology\n-   Partnerships and Customers\n-   Competition\n-   SPAC Transaction Overview\n-   Financials and Fundamentals\n-   Forward-Looking Statements and Speculation\n-   Bear Case\n-   Notes and resources for further DD \n-   Conclusion \n\n  \n  \n\n# Overview\n\nCepton provides state-of-the-art, intelligent, lidar-based solutions for a range of markets such as automotive (ADAS/AV), smart cities, smart spaces, and smart industrial applications. Cepton\u2019s patented MMT\u00ae-based lidar technology enables reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solutions that deliver long range, high resolution 3D perception for smart applications.\n\n  \n\nFrom the very start, Cepton has focused on the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) market. As disclosed in the S-4 filing, Cepton has the largest known lidar production award - GM selected Cepton as their lidar supplier for upcoming 2023-2027 cars featuring UltraCruise functionality.  Cepton has designed a suite of lidars exceptionally attractive to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like GM, Ford, and all other top 10 OEMs by being:\n\n - automotive grade\n - small form factor &amp; best-in-class performance\n - ultra competitive price (tech advantage)\n - partnership with tier 1 supplier (mass production)\n\n  \n\nFounded in April 2016 and led by industry veterans with over two decades of collective experience across a wide range of advanced lidar and imaging technologies, Cepton is focused on the mass market commercialization of high performance, high quality lidar solutions. Cepton is headquartered in San Jose, California, USA, with a presence in Germany, Canada, Japan and India, to serve a fast-growing global customer base.\n\n  \n\nCepton is going public via a SPAC merger ticker **GCAC.** A [press statement](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/05/2275660/0/en/Cepton-Technologies-Inc-an-Innovator-in-Automotive-ADAS-Lidar-and-Growth-Capital-Acquisition-Corp-Enter-into-Business-Combination-Agreement.html) released on August 5th, 2021 suggests that the merger is \"expected to close in the Q4 2021\". The S-4 was filed September 8th, 2021, and is available [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001498233/000121390021047072/fs42021_growthcapital.htm#T29). \n\n  \n\n**Investors:**\n\n  \n\nKoito Manufacturing, LDV Partners, GRC SinoGreen, Plug and Play Tech Center \n\n  \n  \n\n# Leadership\n\n  \n\n-   Jun Pei, CEO, from Velodyne, Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford\n-   Mark McCord, CTO, from KLA-Tencor, Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford\n-   Winston Fu, CFO, from LDV Partners, Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Stanford, MBA from Kellogg\n-   T.R.

According to both Cepton's investor presentation and S-4 filing, these things take considerable time (2+ years) &amp; have incredible competition (at least 30 lidars considered for GM production award). No other lidar company expects deployment on a significant number of vehicle models (especially non-luxury) anytime in the near future.\n\n  \n\nMicrovision (MVIS) has completed their **prototype** lidar in April 2021. Cepton finished their prototype in 2017, and is currently fine tuning the mass production process. Futhermore, Microvision recently claimed that they would win the markets by being cheap and selling their lidars for an AVERAGE of less than $1000. Cepton lidars are &lt; $500 with the Nova lidar being &lt; $100. Needless to say, Cepton is not concerned with competition from Microvision at the moment.\n\n  \n\nAnother interesting fact I noticed: many Velodyne and Innoviz leaders have left and decided to join Cepton.\n\n  \n\n# SPAC Transaction Overview\n\n  \n\n-   Transaction reflects a ~$1.5Bn value for Cepton\n-   Ownership: 85% Cepton shareholders, 12% SPAC IPO &amp; founder shares, 3% PIPE investors \n-   $58.5mm PIPE raised\n-   $1.774 bn pro forma equity value\n-   $1.549 bn pro forma enterprise value\n -   1.8x  2025E revenue of $861mm\n -   4.6x 2025E Adj. EBITDA of $339mm\n-   $225mm pro forma cash (includes Cepton's $34mm cash position)\n-   The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Cepton and Growth Capital Acquisition Corp.\n-   Expected to close \"Q4 2021\"\n-   [Form 8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-100487/)\n\n  \n\n# Financials\n\n  \n\n**All data derived from SEC forms and the** [investor presentation.](https://assets.website-files.com/5fda6517fa06201bd2829536/610b6b067aca0357e44ee137_Cepton_Announcement%20Presentation_vFF_present.pdf)\n\n  \n\n-   **2025E EBITDA:** 39%\n-   **2026E Free Cash Flow:** $389MM\n-   **'21E-'26E CAGR:** 207% (Peer median 153%)\n-   **'25E-'26E Adj. Gross Margin:** 51-53% (Peer median 56%)\n-   **'25E-'26E EBITDA Margin:** 39%-44% (Peer mediuan 31%)\n-   **'25E Valuation:** 1.8x (Peer median 2.1x)\n-   **'26E Valuation:** 1.3x (Peer median 2.1x)\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nAs of writing this, GCAC is trading at $9.89, below the theoretical floor of $10 for SPACs.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n# Bear Cases \n\n  \n\nThe merger falls apart. This seems quite unlikely as both Cepton and GCAC have experienced leadership &amp; backgrounds. \n\n  \n\nCepton's deal with GM falls through. While again this is theoretically possible, the chances seem very small based on the investor presentation &amp; S-4 filing. Cepton had been in talks with GM for years before the announcement, and GM went through an extensive selection process of over 40 other lidar companies. Furthermore, Cepton is already partnered and supported by Koito, a Tier 1 supplier already approved and supplying parts for GM vehicles. \n\n  \n\nThe AV market is a bust. Cepton is currently focused on mass-market Lidar serving ADAS, which is a very real &amp; growing market. While it is true that currently the lidar market is pretty saturated, there is definitely an addressable market for ADAS in vehicles in the next 5 years. Cepton's ability to actually land the largest known Lidar production deal is nothing to scoff at. \n\n  \n\n# Notes and resources\n\nI urge everyone to do their own research &amp; DD. \n\nHere's a list of resources to start with: \n\n- [Investor presentation](https://assets.website-files.com/5fda6517fa06201bd2829536/610b6b067aca0357e44ee137_Cepton_Announcement%20Presentation_vFF_present.pdf](https://assets.website-files.com/5fda6517fa06201bd2829536/610b6b067aca0357e44ee137_Cepton_Announcement%20Presentation_vFF_present.pdf)) \n- [S-4 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001498233/000121390021047072/fs42021_growthcapital.htm#T29](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001498233/000121390021047072/fs42021_growthcapital.htm#T29) \n- [Press release for Cepton + GCAC merger](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/05/2275660/0/en/Cepton-Technologies-Inc-an-Innovator-in-Automotive-ADAS-Lidar-and-Growth-Capital-Acquisition-Corp-Enter-into-Business-Combination-Agreement.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/05/2275660/0/en/Cepton-Technologies-Inc-an-Innovator-in-Automotive-ADAS-Lidar-and-Growth-Capital-Acquisition-Corp-Enter-into-Business-Combination-Agreement.html)\n- [Forbes - GM selects Cepton to supply Lidar](https://www.dailyadvent.com/news/9283e8963297dea4b9b25a78e41113f6-General-Motors-Selects-Cepton-To-Supply-Lidar-For-2023-Production) \n- [Cepton patents](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Cepton&amp;oq=assignee:(Cepton)](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Cepton&amp;oq=assignee:(Cepton))) \n- [Cepton products](https://www.cepton.com/products/overview](https://www.cepton.com/products/overview)) \n- [Q&amp;A interview with Cepton CEO](https://www.just-auto.com/interview/lidar-of-the-pack-qa-with-cepton/](https://www.just-auto.com/interview/lidar-of-the-pack-qa-with-cepton/)) \n\n  \n\n# Conclusion\n\n  \n\nCepton has strong fundamentals, landed impressive deals and partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout leader in the lidar market. ADAS (safety &amp; assist) is not as sexy as AV (self driving), but there is a clear market for it TODAY, and Cepton has already taken the first step with the landmark deal to supply lidar for multiple GM cars.\n\n  \n\nAs of writing this post, GCAC is trading at $9.89, and is a relatively low-risk investment as SPAC's typically have a $10 floor due to the ability to redeem the stock at closing of the merger for $10.\n\nWhile the lidar &amp; SPAC markets are not so hot at the moment, I still see Cepton as undervalued at the moment, and the situation as a great low-downside investment opportunity. If Cepton succeeds with its engagements with all top 10 OEM's, then this current price would be one hell of a steal. \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n**Game plan**  \n\nI bought &amp; plan to hold shares for several years. \n\nYou can also just play the merger - buy now, then hold until the merger date &amp; decide then whether to keep or sell.\n  \n- Buy shares, GCAC will change to CPTN after the merger. Shares will be 1:1\n- Warrants, GCACW, if you're not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of $11.50\n- Options trading - buying calls &amp; selling puts\n\n  \n  \n\n**TL;DR:** \n\nCepton quietly landed massive deals &amp; partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout lidar company. Currently GCAC is trading at &lt;$10, which is usually the floor for SPACs. This seems like a fairly low-risk low-downside investment, with great upsides at the moment since awareness of Cepton is so low.\n\nYou could also check out [their investor presentation.](https://assets.website-files.com/5fda6517fa06201bd2829536/610b6b067aca0357e44ee137_Cepton_Announcement%20Presentation_vFF_present.pdf)\n\n  \n\n_Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, nothing I ever say or do is a financial recommendation.
