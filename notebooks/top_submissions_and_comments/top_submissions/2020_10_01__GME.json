        "selftext": "Just a quick estimate: the last two console cycles GME's market cap was 9.7bn and 6.6bn. If we go with a conservative 3bn target with 65m shares outstanding that would be a 46$ price target. 2019 revenue was 6bn already. Now take into the account the bubbly nature of today's account and the fact that Tesla's 2019 revenue was just 4x of Gamestop's (yes, that's right, 24bn vs 6bn) we have a pretty (realistically) optimistic thesis\n\nNow, I would argue that this console cycle could be even better for the company than any of the last two: \n\n* New management trying to turn the company around + Ryan Cohen who turned *dog food company* into a multibillion business\n* Gaming is going to only increase in popularity\n* Despite bearish arguments, GameStop actively tries to get into digital. Part of everything a person spends digitally on an xbox sold at GameStop goes to the company. I think that is a huge additional revenue stream.\n* CDs are declining only in a percentage of total sales compared to digital, but absolute numbers are not decreasing. I saw a data on that somewhere but am too lazy now to search for it so treat it as my personal opinion\n* (if you like crayons) GME formed two perfect cup&amp;handle patterns: on 1month and 1hr charts\n* If that was not enough there might be countless wildcard events: Sony sharing digital revenue (not that much of a stretch), any other partnership with major gaming entities, share buybacks (was in the past so not off the table), some new investors, or any of the ideas they come up to let GameStop live and prosper\n\n\nNow if we speculate that GameStop's market cap would only be 9bn (was one cycle ago) we have a share price of 138$ per share.\n\nThe short squeeze is just a cherry on top of that, propelling the price up faster and higher. But we can also play that. The new short interest data comes out on Oct 26th, so we'll have a more clear picture of what is happening on the short side. Right now I see 51% fee rate on IBKR with 500k shares available to short (yesterday it was 120k and 53%)",

        "selftext": " Alright Autists,\n\nYou've been hearing a lot about Gamestop. It is MASSIVELY shorted. There are roughly [\\~70 million shares](http://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/GME.htm) that have to be bought sooner or later.\n\nThere aren't many opportunities like this where a company is turning around, entering a new console super cycle with a healthy balance sheet, gaming and tech visionaries leading the turn around, and negative sentiment prevailing for years. This created one of the greatest short bubbles I've seen in the market. Rumor has it that a few Wall Street firms are on the short end of this trade.\n\nPeople have already posted about [Ryan Cohen](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-price-chewy-investor-plans-amazon-rival-ecommerce-2020-9-1029612504), [Reggie Fils-Aime](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/09/reggie-fils-aime-gamestop/), [Microsoft](https://www.businessinsider.com/xbox-deal-with-gamestop-includes-revenue-share-on-digital-sales-2020-10)...I'm going to talk a little about Gamestop's E-commerce. E-commerce is very important as it will massively increase its total addressable market and help continue optimizing its dense retail structure (increasing profitability.)\n\nNow that Gamestop is turning into an e-commerce gaming power house (\"Chewy of Gaming\"), it's good to track their e-commerce metrics. Gamestop's total addressable market went from purely relying on brick-and-mortar to include everyone with internet. Their website is very nice now and they also recently [updated the app](https://twitter.com/Reggie/status/1311802247114678273)\n\n. Covid has changed consumer shopping behaviors and forced companies to up their e-commerce games, subsequently putting [consumer loyalty up for grabs](https://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/articles/building-customer-loyalty-in-the-post-covid-19-retail-environment/) (Gamestop already has [55+ million loyalty members!](http://news.gamestop.com/fact-sheet-0))\n\nLet's see what their e-commerce has been doing. Referring to the charts below (data excludes the app; it's only web and mobile web traffic):\n\n1. [Gamestop web traffic is skyrocketing](https://www.similarweb.com/website/gamestop.com/)  \n from August to September. What's really interesting is that its Category Ranking (a measure against its own competitors) went from 83 to 38! This could mean that Gamestop is capturing market share from its e-commerce competitors (Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Newegg, etc.)\n2. Organic search is improving (less ad costs and means people are searching for Gamestop directly)\n3. Social media referrals are increasing (Twitter and Reddit leading the way)\n4. [Google searches](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=gme%20stock)  \n for Gamestop's stock are at all time highs! (Bonus...not directly related to Gamestop's e-commerce)\n5. Another big one that not many people know about yet is that Gamestop is penetrating PC Gaming Hardware. That is a [$40 billion industry](https://wccftech.com/pc-gaming-hardware-market-to-grow-by-3-6-billion-in-2020-thanks-to-covid-19/)  \n and growing! The overall industry is growing at roughly 10% a year and entry-level gaming hardware is growing at over 20%! I believe Gamestop has the advantage of being a dominant player in that industry compared to Newegg, Best Buy, Amazon, etc. As a comparison, roughly half of [Best Buy's revenue](http://s2.q4cdn.com/785564492/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/Best-Buy-Fiscal-2020-Annual-Report.pdf) (pg. 26) comes from Computing and Mobile (\\~$20 billion.) Gamestop is getting ready to attack that industry hard and get its piece of the pie. This could be a very fast growing and lucrative category!\n\nI've attached a screenshot of interestings graphs and metrics, and you'll find references to articles in the hyperlinks above. Enjoy :)\n\nTL:DR Gamestop e-commerce is killing it. Long GME\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8i101rnd5rt51.jpg?width=4656&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f834005a3da8de9426f1facf1e7e38de815952cb",

You'd be an idiot to buy in now. Right? Maybe. \n\nHere's why maybe not. \n\n1) Go here. [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities). GME has been on the list since 9/22. How many days ago is that? 13 market days. \n\n2) Read SEC rules here: [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). In particular, look at section IV: \n\n *In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as \u201cthreshold securities,\u201d if the failures to deliver persist for* ***13*** *consecutive settlement days.*[*\\[10\\]*](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) *Threshold securities are equity securities*[*\\[11\\]*](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn11) *that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency (e.g., National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)); totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding. As provided in Rule 203 of Regulation SHO, threshold securities are included on a list disseminated by a self-regulatory organization (\u201cSRO\u201d). Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a participant\u2019s fail to deliver positions will not remain for* ***13*** *consecutive settlement days, if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for* ***13*** *consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.*\n\n**Now put 1) &amp; 2) together.** \n\nNow decide how much you're willing to lose and look into AH purchases. \n\nPositions: Shares, 10/9 9c, 10c; 10/16 9c, 13c",

        "selftext": "The general bear sentiment I see here is \"hurr durr another Blockbuster\" without much arguments besides that. Some even compare it to NKLA (a fraud company with business under it besides pretty renders). \nI'm very bullish on GME, mainly for the short squeeze of a lifetime, but a solid argument could still be made for a company itself.\n\nHere I'll try to list main bear points, comment if I forgot something, I'll add it to the post. My goal is to build the most precise model of what is happening and I do not want to blindly follow the hype train, so please criticize what you think is wrong and together we'll find the truth.\n\n**1. The squeeze already happened, from 5 to 15**\n\nFacts: most shorts were in a 7$ and therefore were slightly underwater at 9. Yes, we've had huge volume during Thursday and Friday and one may say that all shorts covered already. However, half the volume (about 50m) during those couple of days were new shorts (source: http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html). So if we even accept the premise that all 60m shorts covered we still have 50m shorted which is close to 100% float again. The reality is that there are probably quite a number of old bears still holding the line and who are heavily underwater.\n\nThis is what REAL short squeeze looks like: VW Oct 2008 The Great Squeeze\n\nAlso, look at shares available to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME\n\n**2. Gamestop has a dying business model and is not going to last long-term**\n\nWell yes, but you're looking at what Gamestop was. They are actively trying to turn the company's course around right now with a help from Ryan Cohen who at the very least has an excellent experience in managing and growing retail business. In itself it might be a questionable bullish case, but the market has a GameStop bankruptcy priced-in at 7$ and a perspective of a turn-around is a massive deviation from that common sentiment.\n\nAbout the long-term thing: go to fucking /r/investing for that. Nobody's telling that this company is going to be a beast in 20 years time. The main point is that they're not dying, possibly growing somewhat and have an enormous potential for a huge squeeze. The following year or two after the consoles release are going to be explosive as it has every time before, which is also enough time for management to come up with new ways for a company to live besides selling games and consoles.\n\nMy wild guesses: PC bangs, e-sports involvement, gaming stuff (I know they already are, but there is a lot of space to grow in that direction)\n\nMichael Burry involvement is also a somewhat convincing argument.\n\n**3. Strong balance sheets **\n\nYou are seriously telling me that a market cap of 700m$ is adequate for a company which generated 6.5b$ revenue in 2019, having 2.3b$ in assets and 700m$ with cash on hands? And a company during the new console season which historically drive the price up to the tits\n\n**4. Physical sales are decreasing compared to digital **\n\nYes, in percentages. But you should also account for the overall growth of the gaming market, and an argument can be made that total numbers are not decreasing that much. Now excuse me on this one, I can't manage to find exact stats in numbers and not in percentages (I've seen it a while ago somewhere on this sub), so if anyone has it please post.\n\nSummary: \n\n* Gamestop isn't going to go bankrupt anytime soon \n\n* It is being overshorted with the premise that it is going to be bankrupt \n\n* The company actively tries to change it's course, so we would have a lot of positive news incoming \n\n* Every tiny piece of positive news is being multiplied tenfold by the short-sellers being underwater \n\n* Shares are heavily underpriced on what GME has right now in cash and revenue, and we're not even talking about possible company's revival \n\n* We're at wsb, not at fucking /r/investing. I always thought wsb was all about high-risk high-reward calculated bets. And here we have a perfect storm waiting to happen",

        "selftext": "I know most of this sub is way too advanced for most of this information, but I wanted to post a general overview because stock trading is a means to an end and I have come very far in my quest to retire young. Maybe I can help someone who is getting started. \n\nRecommendations from the Machine\n\nFinance recommends buy-and-holding the S&amp;P 500 to anyone who is looking to invest their money. As everyone knows, the market has historically returned 9.8% while the average day trader returns -36.3% and quits within 2 years. In fact, if you make more than minimum wage, then you are the top 1% of all day-traders. Congratulations!\n\nWork forever for the Machine\n\nThe truth is that while the market compounds at 9.8% a year, inflation compounds as well. Taxes will also increase before you get a chance to enjoy your nest egg at 65. Depending on how you count, this takes your return to as low as 5%/year in real growth. On top of that, these returns are averages gathered over 90 years. If there is a market crash before, or during, your retirement, you will have to return to the work force because your investments will take up to 10 years to recover.\n\nBeat the Machine (if you are poor)\n\nExperts say you can\u2019t beat the market, but ordinary Americans have $5,700 of credit card debt that compounds at \\~15%. This means the average American can pay off their credit card, and most forms of debt, and beat the market when considering a risk-adjusted return. \n\nBeat the Machine (by buying lottery tickets) \n\nI know [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets) is all about Yoloing weeklies on Hertz. If you are going to lose your future purchasing power to inflation, taxation, and regulation, then you might as well spend that money on lottery tickets today.\n\nInvest to beat the Machine\n\nThe alternative to Yolos and buy/hold is to play the stock market directly. Retail investors actually have some pretty large advantages over large institutions. \n\n1) Look into real estate: if you think buying stocks on margin is good for juicing returns, just know that the US government will let you leverage your money 3,233% if you are buying a home. Keep in mind that unlike the stock market, you gain on your home through appreciation, amortization, tax loopholes, and inflation.\n\n2) Excess capital: Most small investors have jobs. If you already paid off your debt and live below your means, you can accumulate a significant amount of cash reserves that can be used to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d during market down turns. Compare this to a hedge fund that must raise capital from new/existing investors if they experience a steep decline.\n\n3) Time horizon: Hedge funds must show an increase in assets every quarter or they risk losing investors who can transfer their assets to another firm. If you are a retail investor, you can hold on to assets for years to get a 500% return (I\u2019m looking at you Tanker Gang!)\n\n4) The kiddie pool: Many institutions are just too big to take meaningful risks in small markets. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are about to ride the short squeeze in GME, if you are HODLing your Bloc Chainz, or if you are knee deep in the GDXJ. A lot of these markets are just too small for the big dogs to enter without massively changing the fundamentals. \n\nUse these retail advantages by building up an emergency/Yolo fund during good times. Be willing to look at assets (10% of your portfolio) that have explosive value but need a catalyst to make those outsized returns (Bloc Chainz, oil tankers, GME, XLE, etc)\n\nOptions\n\nOnce you build up a significant war chest, you can start playing options. You can *wheel* your capital (sell covered calls till assigned, then sell puts) until you cash flow 2X what you need to live a happy life, then retire. This may be as little as $500,000 if you are frugal, and as much as $1,000,000 if you want that 6-figure life.\n\nPositions: Life Savings on GME",

        "selftext": "Michael Pachter, of Wedbush, detailed how this works:\n\nFor example, if a customer signs up for the $15 monthly Xbox Game Pass Ultimate at a GameStop store, we would expect GameStop to receive $1.50 or so from that monthly revenue stream for as long as the customer continues to subscribe. If instead, the customer signs up for Xbox All Access for $35/month, GameStop would share $3.50 per month for 24 months.\n\nFurther:\n\nThat's right. In years 3 and 4 combined, if just 5 million customers extend the subscription for two years, GameStop makes $180 million in incremental profit with zero cost involved. That's nearly a quarter of GameStop's current market cap in recurring income at 100% margin!",

        "selftext": "I took the time to write a proper response for once on another post only to get automoded so I'm posting it here because I'm curious what people are thinking. I really hope I'm not breaking any rules but please don't remove this mods\u2764\ufe0f\n\nThis F/Y I created a relatively diverse portfolio and went from a nice and steady gain of around ~50% since May to about -50% from my initial investment as of tonight. I thought I was making the right calls until I wasn't. No I'm not gonna post loss porn but I've got for letters for you..  H Y L N \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udd2b. Got f'd so hard I can still feel it weeks later. So yeah feel free to keep reading cuz I'm a fucking idiot and you might get a kick out of this.\n\nSo. GME. If you're still reading...\n\n\nBULL CASE, NO SQUEEZE:\n\nif we consider the company's\n\n-cash in hand (i.e. ability to stay afloat)\n-sold out pre-orders on the new consoles\n-brand awareness (how many of us bought something from GameStop as a child? I bought a LOT of shit from GameStop as a kid and I want my fucking money back so I'm in as I'm sure a lot of others are in for a similar reason)\n-constant cost cutting by way of closing down locations which aren't making money\n-change of management \n-involvement of Michael Burry (i watched the Big Short and thats all the DD we really need here let's be honest..\n-institutional investors holding a signification amount of shares and not selling even after such ridiculous rallies\n-GameStop's attempt at pivoting to e-commerce\n-Microsoft deal\n-rumoured Sony deal\n-potential for further deal(s) with more big names\n-increasing retail interest\n-retail investors looking for the next success story\n-premium meme status\n\nI think the stock price (without any sort of squeeze action) will sit around $30 to $50 by the time earnings from the new consoles come into play. This puts the company at a market cap of around $2bn to $3.5bn, respectively - a fairly reasonable valuation compared to previous gaming cycles and taking all aforementioned factors into consideration (and assuming they all go in favour of GME i.e. no bad news, no scandals, no big investors selling off, smashing earnings reports etc, securing further deals).\n\nThis valuation MAY be achievable solely based on earnings from new consoles and other products, as well as a successful pivot to e-commerce. However, I personally believe the valuation of $2bn to $3.5bn is contingent on some sort of catalytic news (i.e. more deals with the likes of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo) carrying the price to the $20 to $25 range PRIOR to the console earnings coming into play. If such a catalyst occurs in time, it may provide the stock with a new floor around $20 to $25 (making the valuation sit at around $1.3bn to roughly $1.6bn) as more retail investors start to take notice.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nBULL CASE WITH SQUEEZE: assuming that a short squeeze actually takes place, God only knows where it could end up. I REALLY like that one guy's PT of $500 but that's probably not going to happen. With that being said, I can't even fathom what a short squeeze with 170% short interest could actually do to a stock like this.. Please, someone with ACTUAL knowledge of the market feel free to chime in here. \n\nSo... PT with the turnaround story, securing new deals/partnerships with big companies, increase in retail interest, AND some squeeze action on the side?? $100 to infinity. \n\n\n-----\n\n\nBEAR CASE: the company has been in decline for about 6 years. When we consider WHY the stock is trading so low, one wonders why would it suddenly become worth even $1bn, let alone $2bn to $3.5bn. The rise of e-commerce and now with the ultimate fuck you from the universe (covid) to brick-and-mortar stores.. it's really no wonder why the company is doing so terribly. They may continue to trade at these elevated prices running up to and through the console cycle, but it will not last. This is because making a breakout in the e-commerce sector will be nearly impossible because of Amazon (worldwide), eBay (worldwide) GAME (UK/Europe), and large supermarket chains like Tesco (UK), Asda (UK) and Costco (USA/UK) already having a pretty solid grasp on the market in their respective territories. \n\nAdditionally, as mentioned above, the bull case is contingent on so many factors that it is more likely to continue declining in the mid to long term rather than trending up by any significant measure. Contrary to what a lot of people are thinking, the bear case is actually supported by the ridiculous short interest. Why would so many people be betting against a stock with such passion (170% shorted ffs) if they didn't absolutely believe that they are right and that GME is done for? At least one really solid catalyst WILL be required to push the stock up significantly. It seems that the Microsoft deal was not a significant enough catalyst make the share price moon. So how far up is another deal REALLY likely to push the share price?\n\nAlso, If there is no such catalyst until new console earnings come into play, or if big investors start pulling out at ANY point, the stock MAY still spike as console earnings come into play, however, it most likely will not hold above $25 and will crash hard as fuck when people start taking profits/realise what's about to happen.\n\nAlso, why would this console cycle affect GME the same way as it previous cycles? We now have so many options to choose from when it comes to buying ANYTHING let alone games or consoles. Of course, Amazon won't be able to fulfil every single order. GameStop WILL pull in hella revenue as demonstrated by the selling out of BOTH waves of PS5 preorders. However, the effect on the share price will not be the same. We will most likely see some huge spikes leading up to/after earnings, but it will be short-lived as people will see that GameStop is one of MANY retailers offering competitive prices for the same items and as supply and demand meet an equilibrium. \n\nAlso.. what do most people do when they can't find something at their go-to store? Most people I know would look at Amazon or eBay rather than waiting it out. This will pull a lot of revenue away from GameStop as other retailors will fill the gaps and reduce the prospects of revenue growth over time. This, in turn, will make the stock price tumble once again, and probably harder than it ever has because this may be GameStop's last shot at turning it around.\n\nUltimately, I think if any sort of a bear scenario plays out, we could be looking at 52-week low within the next few weeks (I personally don't hold this opinion as I need to keep believing to remain sane).\n\n\n-----\n\n\nI could keep talking in circles about why the stock is/isn't gonna moon and who's gonna get fucked the hardest; bears or bulls, respectively. Every reason FOR either side can be easily followed up with an argument AGAINST it.\n\nI would personally really like it if someone could pump the stock so hard that shorts start covering, causing a domino effect of shorts covering their positions (and their asses), leading to ultimate short squeeze so I can finally make a little bit (or a lot) of money. But for all we know, this shit could crash so hard I might never be able to bring myself to trade again. \n\nPOSITIONS: all in on GME shares cuz I haven't learned a thing from HYLN.\n\nDISCLAIMER: it this goes tits up, one of you millionaire bears better help a brother out with cash flow or i WILL do it \ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc4b.\n\nGood luck to both sides \ud83d\udc2e\ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\udc3b See you all on the flip flop.",

They are currently 1.63 so im not really in any pain besides unrealized gains guh. \n\nThe arguments against GME :\n\n1. They are just buying Microsoft tablets.\n\nNot true they are entering a multi year strategic partnership which allows them to get some royalties when customers sign up for Xbox live (which will be free for 2 years when customers buy from them.. worth af). Also Microsoft closed all their stores so they are positioned from a customer access and strategic physical standpoint. \n\n2. Hurr durr all games are online no need for physical store. \n\nAutist, have you tried to download cod on your Xbox? Most people buy the cheap consoles with the least amount of space. Cod literally takes up a third of my memory. Same with gta v and other big games like Skyrim. You can only store so many games. \n\nPs5 just said 80-90% of games are going to be backwards compatible meaning discs and pre owned games will still be important and a physical marketplace will continue to exist. \n\n(Hurr durr cloud gaming will take over) \u2014&gt; agreed but google stadia is at early adoption stage and Jedi for Microsoft won\u2019t be viable until a few years. \n\nAlso nerds buy their fanboy shit from stores, and GameStop is the strongest nerd merch store nationally. \n\n\nIf anyone has any other reasons why calls won\u2019t be printing let me know if not shut the fuck up and buy the dip f*******\n\nThank me later or now with platinum I\u2019m trying to give edgy posts some stickers or shit.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m sure everyone read enough of how management is going to turn this around but no one spoke about how the gaming console itself is going to benefit Gamestop since they deal with a lot of physical/disc sales/resale.\n\nI just want to talk about the second coming of Tesla that is Gamestop. I talk mostly about how Gamestop will boom with rise in physical game vs digital. What I talking about? I\u2019m talking about the coming of 4k gaming. While you bitches are trying to just play the short squeeze for a price target of 50$ you are completely missing the bigger picture. We are going to easily go above the company\u2019s all time record high made back in 2008 62.11$ without the squeeze when all said is done. (Don't forget our buddy Michael Burry managed to kill 1/3 of the outstanding shares through last years buyback) \n\nBack in 2012, anyone who was a gamer can tell you how big of a POS the console launches were because of one reason. The hardware were absolute trash, it was using AMD\u2019s CPU/GPU and everyone complained because you\u2019re paying a premium for low tier outdated PC parts. Intel cpu was what people wanted fitted with Nvidia graphic cards. You have 12 year olds rocking PCMR (PC MasterRace) logo everywhere making fun of peasants potato PCs. Look at AMD in 2012, it was trading at 2$. Company probably had Donald Trump at the helm making the calls running the company into the ground like his Casinos. \n\nAnyways, this time is fucken different and even better than it was back in 2008. In 2008, cpu/gpu improvements were still doing fucken leaps and bounds year after year. The game consoles were outdated within a year or 2. In 2020, CPU/GPU improvements slowed to an absolute crawl and parts cost a fucken arm and a leg. Moores law hit a wall and getting 2x performance over last year was no longer possible and the cost for parts kept going up. You want the latest and greatest? That\u2019ll cost you 2000$+ for PC gaming, hell no one is going to have that kind of money especially with this recession. \n\nNow here comes PS5 and Xbox Series X, giving you the latest top of the fucken line gaming hardware for 600$. M$ and Sony is losing money on this like back in 2008, you will hear every fucken reviewer praise this and tell you go out and buy it. Everyone and their mom\u2019s going to go buy new gaming console for their kids so they can fuck off while they have sex with her boyfriend in the other room.\n\nHow does any of this benefit Gamestop? Well with now the latest and greatest gaming console and top of the line hardware we will see an actual push for 4k gaming.\n\n4k gaming to say the least is very hardware intensive and also takes up a fuck ton of storage space. What takes up a lot of storage space? 4k fucken texture packs for 4k gaming alone takes up +20gb of space. Yes that fucken storage space is going to be huge. The last generation we never had any real push for 4k gaming, fucken hell they mostly ran below 1080p to even be remotely playable at 30 FPS. You think people are going download entire games when it takes days or weeks to download with their dial up connections. No they will buy physical discs 9/10 times. \n\nMoreover anyone who plays games on console will tell you 99% that they prefer disc over digital downloads because it cost the same as digital and \n\nLastly, we all know that with the new console release there is actually a lack of new games but that matters not. All games are backwards compatible, so where does Gamestop benefit from this? Well they are only the biggest used game reseller around the block. When people go to buy the new console they are going to go to Gamestop over Amazon or Bestbuy and buy used game to play when everyone goes back into lockdown. Everyone who was planning on spending 3000 on trips oversea will be buying games instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone who says they are going to go like Blockbuster and point to the last 2 quarters is trying to shill you. Everyone knew that a new super gaming console cycle was coming, they were holding off on their purchases and been saving their pennies for this. The next quarter for Gamestop is going to be its biggest.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBig push for 4k gaming will result in large files downloads incentivizing people to choose physical discs over digital.\n\nPositions. Shares and even more shares for now. After election IV Armageddon 01/15/21 30C or further out.\n\nTL;DR x2 Also for everyone saying that Gamestop will go out of business. Here\u2019s just a quick discussion on just simply why it makes sense for Microsoft/Sony to exist. https://youtu.be/8gEfHD\\_y7Pc?t=938\n\n Gamestop will be their showroom, so it makes sense for Gamestop to thrive and not run them out of business. Amazon/Bestbuy/Walmart sure as hell aren\u2019t going to advertise games for them since they aren\u2019t a gaming retail store primarily.\n\nPS. Bunch of hedge funds trolling GME to scare you out of positions so they can cover their shorts.",

        "selftext": "Today GEX (Gamma exposure) closed at its [highest level ever.](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[S&amp;P and GEX 10\\/13\\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/nhatmg16zys51.png?width=1901&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f58fa864882dbddca066ed4ddc51ac1fd61e1a7c)\n\nNow, some of you may yell stonks only go up I don't care about gamma rays. However it is important, and can help you make money if you pay attention to it in times like this. If you need a refresher on what gamma is here is some background.\n\nAn options Delta is the chance that an contract will expire ITM. For instance, deep ITM contracts delta will be close to 1.00 because it has a near 100% chance of profitability. While an OTM contract will have deltas closer to 0.\n\nGamma is literally the derivative of delta, or the rate of change of delta. Its value will show how much a contracts delta changes when the underlying stock goes up or down $1. So if your OTM contracts delta changes from 0.1 to 0.3 when GME moves up $1 that contracts gamma at that time would be 0.2.\n\nGamma shouldn't be ignored because it shows you the rate of change of your chances of \"winning\" in real time. Imagine a coin flip where in mid air the chance of landing tails changes from 50% to 60%, pretty solid information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What does high GEX mean?**\n\nA high GEX means the market is currently skewed towards call options. A GEX of 15,000,000,000 means that for every 1% move down on the S&amp;P, MMs have to sell 15B shares they bought as hedges for the calls they sold. This would push the price down further and further. A high GEX puts the breaks on the current market price action and means MMs expect a change to happen soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[SPY and GEX \\(10\\/12\\/20\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ek920p23yys51.png?width=1038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=794b0f74985012c2c3771442c4154e221e979eb0)\n\nThis chart (although a day old and doesn't show the 15B spike today) shows that high GEX doesn't mean an immediate market crash. In fact in the past year GEX is only a decent indicator of corrections in the mid term future. However a GEX of 15 Billion has never been seen before and we should keep a close eye on it and DIX to get a better idea about where we are going this month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave some opinions on high GEX? I would love to hear them.\n\nWant to bitch me out because I don't know what I'm talking about? Have at it.\n\nHave information on where my dad has been since he left me? Please tell him to call me!\n\n**TL;DR** GEX is higher than Melania on her pain pills",

As it turns out, DOMO Capital has confirmed that GameStop will be getting a cut of ALL downstream revenue related to systems they sell.\n\n\\-GameStop will share revenue of all digital content: DLC, full-game downloads, microtransactions, XBOX game pass, movies, etc.\n\n\\-Applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the Xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GS, they would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold\n\n\\-Incentivizes GameStop to push XBOX. What does this mean? If talks are not already underway, expect Sony and Nintendo to reach similar agreements so that Microsoft doesn't get preferential treatment. They certainly don't want to miss out with GameStop being the largest reseller of systems\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone really think GameStop is going to turn around? No, not likely. But the conditions for a squeeze are growing every day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Analysts are missing a lot of the potential upside here, even if only temporary.

I own a bunch of calls and am considering trimming positions a little to take some profits. I figured it would be good to consolidate together a bunch of the DD and points I've seen on this sub over the last month\n\nI understand the short squeeze theory: right now \\~106% of shares outstanding and more like \\~150% of the public float is shorted.\n\nFor a short squeeze, you need one of these things to happen:\n\n* A large shareholder rapidly buying shares and then saying they are not going to lend these shares out (see what happened with Porsche-Volkswagen in 2008)\n* Merger &amp; acquisition rumors / speculation\n* Change in long-term prospects of the business that fundamentally changes the thesis of everyone short\n* Catalyst for capitulation of the shorts (i.e. they realize they are wrong / are losing too much money in the short-term and close out positions)\n\nIn the case of GME:\n\n* Shorts have not started capitulating - the short interest chart above shows short interest as % of shares outstanding actually increasing over the past several months \n* The Microsoft news is a bit of non-news, but could also be a positive:\n   * The partnership does not appear to have any meaningful economics for GME\n   * However, the positive signaling is that why would Microsoft announce a long-term partnership with GME if they don't think it will be around for at least a couple more years\n   * Longer-term, if the partnership is valuable for Microsoft, there could be more meaningful support / economics provided to GME\n* Ryan Cohen (Chewy Co-Founder) has taken a big stake\n   * Helps remove a large % of shares out of the public float\n   * If he gets more involved, perhaps he has a vision for how to transform GME in a more digital videogame world - this would be a big catalyst\n* Michael Burry still owned a large chunk as of 6/30/2020 - will be interesting to see what his holdings look like on the next report date\n* Most importantly, the thesis of hedge funds that are short has not changed - the medium-term prospects of GME are bleak, especially after the initial wave of foot traffic from the console sales\n   * Mall traffic is down - COVID only accelerated the decline of malls\n   * GME's footprint of 5,500+ stores seems like its unsustainable in the long-run - question is can they trim the footprint fast enough to a smaller, more profitable footprint that they will be around in the long-run\n* The short squeeze feels like it will be a battle of who has more conviction and a longer time horizon - the hedge funds who are short or the WSB traders who are long\n   * I love all of you guys, but I don't have much faith in WSB having more conviction / longer investment horizon than hedge funds (and by longer I mean who is willing to hold their position for a year to see it play out)\n\nI do agree with the members on this sub that you can make money trading GME in the short-term, potentially seeing a rally up - but this is probably not going to be a LT winner\n\nPlease add anything you think I have missed or where you think I am wrong\n\nPosition: $6c 1/15/2021 since mid Sep (screenshot attached)",

        "selftext": "I made a post touching on this yesterday but nobody took it seriously. After letting my thoughts digest overnight, I did a little more research. My theory is that retail sales will be a lot better than anticipated especially for any store that has an online presence. There are a bunch of stocks you can play to get the most out of this, but the one I suggested yesterday was Party City. After doing some further research, I am now even more bullish on this stock.  [Look here](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Party+City/page/B26E1A61-40CC-4708-83DA-187E7FD38BA8?ref_=ast_bln). Party City is basically a store within Amazons online mall. Apparently a bunch of items are sold out. Not only that but there are analysts predicting holiday in store sales will be up this year across retail, which is contrary to the discounted prices many retail stocks are trading at. That's right, higher than last year even. Don't take it from me though, here's what the former [Toys R Us Ceo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGKYY2Dp6QA) thinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are two plays to be made here. The 2-3 week out play is PRTY. They have an earnings report on 11/4. Apparently this earnings will not include Halloween sales so this is expected to be a boring earnings report. The summer is their worst season for sales already. I think they will report better than expected sales though since people haven't been able to go to bars and have probably been throwing their own parties and what not. Also, while it won't be included in the report, by that point analysts should have a better idea of how well PRTY halloween sales will be. If I am right and the Halloween demand is higher than what is currently priced in, this could send this stock to the moon. This is why I think this thing could be the next Gamestop. One really good quarter for PRTY will probably send it to $5 easily. $3 or $3.50 calls would fn print. 10000% return potential on this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that said, if there are any of you out there who only want a meager 100% return like pussies, my other retail play is Kohl's (KSS). Very undervalued, has managed to be profitable during pandemic unlike Macy's and others, great online sales blah blah blah. I'm actually going to just leave this part of my dd out, but if you're still interested here's an [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/10/16/kohls-stock-offers-strong-upside-at-20/#5e60fe6225cf). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTldr; The retail bears are wrong. Party City could easily show revenue growth in their next report and if that's the case it's going to the moon.",

GameStop is also cash strong with cash on hand of about **$12 per share**. The recent partnership with Microsoft is the nail in the coffin for the short's thesis of near term bankruptcy. \n\nLet's take a closer look at the announcement. The key word is **\"multi-year\"**\n\n\"GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) (\u201cThe Company\u201d) today announced that it has entered into a **multi-year** strategic partnership agreement with Microsoft Corp\"\n\nFrom a recent article today \"After Gamestop's 368% Rally, Is This as Good as It Gets?\" and I quote. \n\n \"Coupled with arguably one of GameStop's most important developments, the just-announced **10-year agreement with Microsoft** to modernize the retailer's back-end operations and expand its digital and physical game options, there is hope for the company's future.\"\n\nDoes the agreement suggest that GameStop will survive for another **10 years**? If so it is 10 more years then the shorts expected.\n\nIt also seems that some analyst have been dismissive over the details of the agreement. The recent partnership involves **\"revenue sharing\"** which will benefit GameStop**.**\n\nVerified by an email from DOMO Capital's **Justin Dopierala** to GameStop. Here is GameStop's response:\n\n\" GameStop and Microsoft will both benefit from the customer acquisition and **lifetime revenue** **value** of each gamer brought into the Xbox ecosystem.\"\n\nGameStop is trading at a discount with or without the agreement. It is my belief that GameStop is just getting started &amp; although the sentiment is slowly shifting GameStop's management seems to be moving faster than ever before. With only one month away from away from the biggest console release ever will Nintendo and Sony join in? \n\nLet the games begin!\n\nShort Interest: 141% as of 9/30 update\n\nI am team **Reggie, Burry, Cohen**\n\nRecommended positions: Jan $13 Calls, April $15 Calls",

        "selftext": "This post is to go over the recent meme stocks from WSB and how to play them for max trendies.\n\nGameStop: very strong consolidation ~$9.30. The catalyst will be when they announce a stock buyback. They have $800 millions cash on hand on a $600 million market cap. This is the same playbook RH used (they had a 80% of their shares shorted at the time) to set off a short squeeze that took their stock from $30 to $300+ in 3 years. Unusual options activity at a January strike, so that\u2019s your best bet. Lastly, for every $1 they use buying shares they gain $1.2 on their balance sheet. With over 100% of shares shorted, this will \ud83c\udf19\ud83c\udf19\ud83c\udf19\n\nPG&amp;E: yes, we have all been burned on this one! However, unusual options activity for 10/09/2020. This utility is WAY underpriced and already has a small deal with Tesla. This is pure speculation, but someone knows something and it might be a much larger partnership with Tesla.\n\nVale: to all bag holders and u/extraegg, this stock is real. Price action has been very consistent and moving higher. Unusual options activity for October as well. IV is rising as well. I am less sure on this one bc the options activity might literally be WSB \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nPalantir: seems like there is a hard floor ~$9/share. This makes sense bc insiders purchased around this price. If all the weak hands are out, it might be time to buy in!\n\nClang gang: just hold your gold and silver mining ETFs no real price action is expected ATM\n\nTanker Gang: these are the true meme stocks. The CEO of STNG just doubled down on April 2021 calls at a $12 strike price. STNG is trading at .3 to price/NAV. With numbers that good, they can sell ships and buy back stock, or get acquired for the price of the ships and see a 300% increase over night. ASC is also trading at .3 to NAV and announced a 30 million buyback on a 100 million market cap. The stock only went up 15% when by all means it should have gone up 30%. This may be a longer term play, so I advise shares for all tankers except STNG since the CEO is begging people to buy calls.\n\nVix: UVXY is cheap, buy shares and sell CCs in the event that a correction takes a bite out of your meme stocks!!!\n\nTheta Gang: GameStop wheeling is free money!\n\nMay the odds be ever in your favor!\n\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83e\udd11\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0",
