        "selftext": "I just finished my watchlist after evaluating 300+ companies. It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it. \n\nIt's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.\n\n\\- ALPHABET -A-. Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks. \n\n\\- ARISTA NETWORKS. Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.\n\n\\- FACEBOOK. This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy. \n\n\\- GALAPAGOS. To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences. \n\n\\- INCYTE GENOMICS. Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%\n\n\\- LULULEMON ATHLETICA. Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase. \n\n\\- MASTERCARD. Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.\n\n\\- MICROSOFT. No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices. \n\n\\- NVIDIA. Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars. \n\n\\- VEEVA SYSTEMS. One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.\n\nOne last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.\n\nHope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!\n\nTL;DR. Stonks only go up.",

        "selftext": "I have done an analysis comparing purchasing the top 3 US market cap companies every year on January 1st and holding until today vs. purchasing the same amount of SPY on January 1st and holding until today (close price on 4/24/2020.) \n\nTo determine \"top 3 market cap\" I used the Q1 values in [Financial Times' Global 500 list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization). Since the FT Global 500 list started in 1996, that is where I begin. \n\nIn my **Big 3 Portfolio**, I purchase $1000 worth of each that year's top 3 market capitalization companies at their Jan 1st open price.\n\nIn my **SPY Portfolio**, I purchase $3000 a year of SPY (S&amp;P 500 tracking index, aka \"the market\") at it's Jan 1st open price.\n\nThus the total cash basis of 25 annual batches of $3000 is $75,000 for each portfolio.\n\n*IMPORTANT NOTES:*\n\n*  *After pulling all the data, I realized the faulty assumption of this study is that the FT500 market cap ranking is posted on January 1st to know which 3 companies to purchase for that year. I have no idea what day it was posted, and if the years before the FT500 went to quarterly rankings were later in the year it might be showing more in hindsight instead of foresight. In hindsight, I probably should have purchased the previous year's top picks those early years and the previous Q4 picks after the survey went quarterly. May do a version 2 along those lines at some point.*\n* *I do not reinvest dividends. I may include that on a version 2.0.*\n* *I used fractional shares (i.e. however many shares you could have purchased with exactly $1000). That might not have been possible when this started but is possible now.* \n* *This assumes no additional buying or selling. Another analysis worth doing might consider selling companies that drop out of the top 3 on the last day of the year and buying the new ones taking their place with the profits you have built up so far. This would keep you from holding companies like GE and Exxon as they decline and likely lead to bigger returns, I'd guess.*\n\nHere are my findings, broken down into combined annual lots of $3000 for each portfolio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Year**|**Top 3 Market Cap**|**BIG 3 $1000 x 3 Lot  Value Today**|**Big 3 Lot Gain ($)** |**Big 3 Lot Gain (%)**|**SPY $3000 Lot Value Today**|**SPY Batch Gain ($)**|**SPY Batch Gain (%)**|**Big 3 - SPY Net Gain ($)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1996|GE, KO, XOM|$5,174.90|$2,174.90|72%|$13,823.64|$10,823.64|361%|\\-$8,648.74|\n|1997|GE, MSFT, XOM|$18,975.80|$15,975.80|533%|$11,413.15|$8,413.15|280%|$7,562.65|\n|1998|GE, MSFT, XOM|$12,473.44|$9,473.44|316%|$8,723.77|$5,723.77|191%|$3,749.67|\n|1999|GE, MSFT, XOM|$6,396.14|$3,396.14|113%|$6,880.45|$3,880.45|129%|\\-$484.31|\n|2000|CSCO, GE, MSFT|$3,875.26|$875.26|29%|$5,726.21|$2,726.21|91%|\\-$1,850.94|\n|2001|GE, MSFT, XOM|$9,060.78|$6,060.78|202%|$6,431.14|$3,431.14|114%|$2,629.64|\n|2002|GE, MSFT, XOM|$6,511.29|$3,511.29|117%|$7,374.77|$4,374.77|146%|\\-$863.48|\n|2003|GE, MSFT, XOM|$8,188.52|$5,188.52|173%|$9,554.42|$6,554.42|218%|\\-$1,365.90|\n|2004|GE, MSFT, XOM|$7,604.92|$4,604.92|153%|$7,597.19|$4,597.19|153%|$7.73|\n|2005|GE, MSFT, XOM|$7,547.51|$4,547.51|152%|$6,983.46|$3,983.46|133%|$564.05|\n|2006|GE, MSFT, XOM|$7,610.09|$4,610.09|154%|$6,780.97|$3,780.97|126%|$829.11|\n|2007|GE, MSFT, XOM|$6,583.31|$3,583.31|119%|$5,967.73|$2,967.73|99%|$615.57|\n|2008|GE, MSFT, XOM|$5,517.03|$2,517.03|84%|$5,793.42|$2,793.42|93%|\\-$276.39|\n|2009|MSFT, WMT, XOM|$11,796.00|$8,796.00|293%|$9,386.44|$6,386.44|213%|$2,409.56|\n|2010|AAPL, MSFT, XOM|$15,617.62|$12,617.62|421%|$7,554.60|$4,554.60|152%|$8,063.02|\n|2011|AAPL, CVX, XOM|$7,625.22|$4,625.22|154%|$6,699.63|$3,699.63|123%|$925.59|\n|2012|AAPL, MSFT, XOM|$11,920.97|$8,920.97|297%|$6,644.57|$3,644.57|121%|$5,276.41|\n|2013|AAPL, BRK-B, XOM|$6,117.07|$3,117.07|104%|$5,850.11|$2,850.11|95%|$266.96|\n|2014|AAPL, MSFT, XOM|$8,672.80|$5,672.80|189%|$4,614.14|$1,614.14|54%|$4,058.66|\n|2015|AAPL, BRK-B, XOM|$4,245.55|$1,245.55|42%|$4,113.33|$1,113.33|37%|$132.21|\n|2016|AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT|$7,645.98|$4,645.98|155%|$4,234.18|$1,234.18|41%|$3,411.80|\n|2017|AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT|$6,818.03|$3,818.03|127%|$3,772.26|$772.26|26%|$3,045.76|\n|2018|AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT|$4,901.87|$1,901.87|63%|$3,169.47|$169.47|6%|$1,732.41|\n|2019|AAPL, AMZN, MSFT|$5,225.28|$2,225.28|74%|$3,451.13|$451.13|15%|$1,774.14|\n|2020|AAPL, AMZN, MSFT|$3,339.98|$339.98|11%|$2,623.82|\\-$376.18|\\-13%|$716.16|\n||||||||||\n||**COST BASIS ($3000 x 25 years)**|**BIG 3 TOTAL VALUE TODAY (4/24/2020)**|**BIG 3 NET GAIN ($)**|**BIG 3 NET GAIN (%)**|**SPY TOTAL VALUE TODAY (4/24/2020)**|**SPY NET GAIN ($)**|**SPY NET GAIN (%)**|**BIG 3 - SPY NET GAIN**|\n|**TOTALS**|**$75,000**|**$199,45.35**|**$124,445.35**|**166%**|**$165,164.01**|**$90,164.01**|**120%**|**+$34,281.34**|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe annual Big 3 lot beat the annual SPY lot long-term 19 out of 25 years.

This would keep you from holding companies like GE and Exxon as they decline and likely lead to bigger returns, I'd guess.*\n\nHere are my findings, broken down into combined annual lots of $3000 for each portfolio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Year**|**Top 3 Market Cap**|**BIG 3 $1000 x 3 Lot  Value Today**|**Big 3 Lot Gain ($)**|**Big 3 Lot Gain (%)**|**SPY $3000 Lot Value Today**|**SPY Batch Gain ($)**|**SPY Batch Gain (%)**|**Big 3 - SPY Net Gain ($)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1996|GE, KO, XOM|$5,174.90|$2,174.90|72%|$13,823.64|$10,823.64|361%|\\-$8,648.74|\n|1997|GE, MSFT, XOM|$18,975.80|$15,975.80|533%|$11,413.15|$8,413.15|280%|$7,562.65|\n|1998|GE, MSFT, XOM|$12,473.44|$9,473.44|316%|$8,723.77|$5,723.77|191%|$3,749.67|\n|1999|GE, MSFT, XOM|$6,396.14|$3,396.14|113%|$6,880.45|$3,880.45|129%|\\-$484.31|\n|2000|CSCO, GE, MSFT|$3,875.26|$875.26|29%|$5,726.21|$2,726.21|91%|\\-$1,850.94|\n|2001|GE, MSFT, XOM|$9,060.78|$6,060.78|202%|$6,431.14|$3,431.14|114%|$2,629.64|\n|2002|GE, MSFT, XOM|$6,511.29|$3,511.29|117%|$7,374.77|$4,374.77|146%|\\-$863.48|\n|2003|GE, MSFT, XOM|$8,188.52|$5,188.52|173%|$9,554.42|$6,554.42|218%|\\-$1,365.90|\n|2004|GE, MSFT, XOM|$7,604.92|$4,604.92|153%|$7,597.19|$4,597.19|153%|$7.73|\n|2005|GE, MSFT, XOM|$7,547.51|$4,547.51|152%|$6,983.46|$3,983.46|133%|$564.05|\n|2006|GE, MSFT, XOM|$7,610.09|$4,610.09|154%|$6,780.97|$3,780.97|126%|$829.11|\n|2007|GE, MSFT, XOM|$6,583.31|$3,583.31|119%|$5,967.73|$2,967.73|99%|$615.57|\n|2008|GE, MSFT, XOM|$5,517.03|$2,517.03|84%|$5,793.42|$2,793.42|93%|\\-$276.39|\n|2009|MSFT, WMT, XOM|$11,796.00|$8,796.00|293%|$9,386.44|$6,386.44|213%|$2,409.56|\n|2010|AAPL, MSFT, XOM|$15,617.62|$12,617.62|421%|$7,554.60|$4,554.60|152%|$8,063.02|\n|2011|AAPL, CVX, XOM|$7,625.22|$4,625.22|154%|$6,699.63|$3,699.63|123%|$925.59|\n|2012|AAPL, MSFT, XOM|$11,920.97|$8,920.97|297%|$6,644.57|$3,644.57|121%|$5,276.41|\n|2013|AAPL, BRK-B, XOM|$6,117.07|$3,117.07|104%|$5,850.11|$2,850.11|95%|$266.96|\n|2014|AAPL, MSFT, XOM|$8,672.80|$5,672.80|189%|$4,614.14|$1,614.14|54%|$4,058.66|\n|2015|AAPL, BRK-B, XOM|$4,245.55|$1,245.55|42%|$4,113.33|$1,113.33|37%|$132.21|\n|2016|AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT|$7,645.98|$4,645.98|155%|$4,234.18|$1,234.18|41%|$3,411.80|\n|2017|AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT|$6,818.03|$3,818.03|127%|$3,772.26|$772.26|26%|$3,045.76|\n|2018|AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT|$4,901.87|$1,901.87|63%|$3,169.47|$169.47|6%|$1,732.41|\n|2019|AAPL, AMZN, MSFT|$5,225.28|$2,225.28|74%|$3,451.13|$451.13|15%|$1,774.14|\n|2020|AAPL, AMZN, MSFT|$3,339.98|$339.98|11%|$2,623.82|\\-$376.18|\\-13%|$716.16|\n||||||||||\n||**COST BASIS ($3000 x 25 years)**|**BIG 3 TOTAL VALUE TODAY (4/24/2020)**|**BIG 3 NET GAIN ($)**|**BIG 3 NET GAIN (%)**|**SPY TOTAL VALUE TODAY (4/24/2020)**|**SPY NET GAIN ($)**|**SPY NET GAIN (%)**|**BIG 3 - SPY NET GAIN**|\n|**TOTALS**|**$75,000**|**$199,445.35**|**$124,445.35**|**166%**|**$165,164.01**|**$90,164.01**|**120%**|**+$34,281.34**|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe annual Big 3 lot beat the annual SPY lot long-term 19 out of 25 years.

Users have spiked from 10 million in December to 200 million in March, and just recently 300 million.\n   * **The company\u2019s funnel is increasing, as so many users are having a trial by fire on Zoom\u2019s video calling application. However, I am skeptical that Zoom will be able to convert enough of these free users within a reasonable time frame to justify the current valuation.**\n* **I want to clarify that I see Zoom growing tremendously over the next five years, but the price is way ahead of itself**\n   * I attribute the growth to its Y/Y revenue growth being 88.4% over the past year, 118% the year prior, and 149% two years prior.\n   * With a SaaS business model, Zoom will enjoy a low CapEx due to third-party hosting (mostly Amazon Web Services) which eliminates the costs of self-managed servers, and as such is positioned against significant depreciation costs\n   * I point to the **PEG** (**appropriate for high growth/speculative stocks**) and P/E ratios to expected favorable future earnings, but also an indication that the stock is highly overvalued\n      * **NTM** (next twelve months) **PEG is 10x** which means that the stock is **overvalued** when **taking into account both current earnings and the expected growth rate for these earnings in the future**\n      * LTM P/E ratio of 1489.9x and a NTM P/E ratio of 346.5x which both indicate the stock is trading high relative to earnings but offers little insight into the company\u2019s EPS growth prospects\n\n**List of Key Drivers**\n\n* **Zoom was actually profitable on a GAAP basis in fiscal 2019**\n   * Unlike many young software companies, I expect profitability to continue as SaaS business models generally have consistent costs\n* **Strong balance sheet with $0 debt and approximately $850 million in total cash and short term investments**\n* **Long runway for growth with continued market penetration through leveraging their cloud-based solution's ease of use and innovative features**\n   * Gaining traction with its Zoom Phones VoIP solutions with more than 2,900 customers\n   * Pricing tiers are based on a per user per month basis and include Basic (free), Pro ($15), Business ($20), and Enterprise for $20 (more features with a volume discount).\n   * Zoom Rooms enables conference rooms with Zoom Meetings functionality and is $49 per room per month.\n   * Zoom Conference Room Connector allows organizations using legacy providers (such as Cisco) to join Zoom meetings and is priced at $49 per port per month.\n* In its S-1 filing, the company sized the unified communications and collaboration market at $43.1 billion by 2022, with a 3% annual market growth rate and a clear shift toward cloud-based solutions\n   * It is clear that cloud-based software is an emerging market within communications that has tremendous growth potential\n* **The unprecedented circumstances surrounding academics and work has given Zoom the ability to place its service in the hands of millions of people and the opportunity to retain some of these customers**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*List of Key Risks \\*\\*\\***\n\n* **Strong competition from a variety of technology providers**\n   * **Cisco (Webex) and Microsoft (Teams and Skype) dominate the video conferencing market and can bundle a broad array of solutions in response to a competitive threat from Zoom.**\n   * **The industry has considerable intellectual property development which exposes Zoom** to **adverse rulings** in patent infringement cases that could force the company to pay **confiscatory license fees** or **abandon technology altogether**\n* **Zoom offers a freemium model** and **caters to companies** of all sizes which means **revenue is concentrated among the largest customers.** \n   * **Smaller customers typically have higher churn,** which could be exacerbated in Zoom\u2019s case, where the **number of free users far outpaces the number of paid users**. I believe the nature of the model would dictate a higher churn than fully paid enterprise software models.\n   * It remains unclear whether we are witnessing a paradigm shift in the way people work that enables Zoom to convert a substantial proportion of the new free users into paying subscribers or whether these users will simply abandon the service when the current restrictions are lifted\n* Although expected to produce revenue growth at the high end of peers, this higher valuation offers less room for missteps and therefore carries greater inherent risks \n   * **Zoom faces several lawsuits surrounding privacy concerns**\n   * **Risks of customer data breaches** and service outages especially with **80% of Zoom\u2019s R&amp;D staff is based in China** which poses a significant risk due to trade relations, data sensitivity, and the significant rise of intellectual property and trade secret theft present in China\n   * Zoom completed its IPO in April 2019, so it has a **limited operating history as a public company to scrutinize**\n   * **At high valuation levels, companies can often become momentum stocks that are punished severely if they do not deliver against expectations, which are regularly higher than consensus**\n* Executing across so many different aspects of growth simultaneously in their product portfolio.\n   * Zoom Phone (VoIP product) is a more complex sale, the company is moving from smaller to larger customers, and there is a new head of sales.\n\n**Section II: Intrinsic Value** \n\n* Three Stage Growth\n   * Zoom is currently in its early-high growth stage and will continue to benefit from high revenue growth for several years to come\n      * I expect this growth to significantly fade in FYE 2026 to relatively lower and stable rates\n   * **There is a strong indication that revenue will grow as a result of customers increasing 20-fold from 10 million in December 2019 to 300 million in March 2020**\n      * **I expect that most of the revenue will result in businesses allowing more employees to work from home due** to the obvious viability of the platform for online meetings and work, which presents the opportunity to downsize offices to cut costs\n      * **I still expect the number of customers to go down tremendously from its current high once schools and businesses return to normal operations**\n   * Free Cash Flow to Equity approach \n\nFundamental Drivers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/it9ya3qxjpu41.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b81c2c5a0711758de7c6d1bdaec3d511a8b4a867\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Terminal Value: $48,612.20; Intrinsic Value of Equity: $35,781; Intrinsic Share Price: $128.24](https://preview.redd.it/tqqre03bkpu41.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56b26d7004088d6869cadc97cb8df6df379535a5)\n\n**Intrinsic Valuation Drivers**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63fvmn7kkpu41.png?width=538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0103516a422d6ca1da5cbfede7e710a3eb109a7c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq4su1alkpu41.png?width=543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5bb30091d05ecc19c062a9488c63e12fff98f62\n\n**Section III: Relative Valuation**\n\n**Comparable Companies**\n\n* **Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO)** engages in the design, manufacture, and sale of Internet Protocol based networking products and services related to the communications and IT  industry. Enterprise Value = $170,416\n   * Its SaaS product, Webex Meetings, is a cloud-based web and video conferencing service that enables global and virtual teams to collaborate on mobile devices and standards-based video systems in real time. Webex Meetings includes features such as screen sharing, meeting recording, customizable layouts and meeting broadcasting.\n   * Current market leader in line with Microsoft\u2019s platforms Teams and Skype\n* **Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)** provides communications, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. Its Consumer segment provides wireless and wireline communications services. Enterprise Value = $373,424 million\n   * Verizon recently agreed to purchase Blue Jeans Network, Zoom competitor, for $400M\n* **Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)** develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services. Enterprise Value = $1,284,431 million\n   * Its SaaS product, Teams, is a unified communication and collaboration platform that combines persistent workplace chat, video meetings, file storage, and application integration (Office 365). Microsoft also owns and markets another SaaS product, Skype and Skype Business, which they purchased for $8.5 Billion in 2011\n   * Current market leader in line with Cisco\u2019s Webex platform\n* **LogMeIn (LOGM)** is a provider of software as a service and cloud-based remote connectivity services for collaboration, IT management and customer engagement. Enterprise Value = $4,301 million\n   * GoToMeeting (including GoToWebinar) is a web-hosted service created and marketed by LogMeIn. It is an online meeting, desktop sharing, and video conferencing software package that enables the user to meet with other computer users, customers, clients or colleagues via the Internet in real time.\n   * Direct competitor with Zoom and is a veteran of the industry\n* **VMware (VMW)** provides cloud computing and virtualization software and services and engages in the provision of cloud infrastructure and business mobility. Enterprise Value = $59,183 million\n   * Its products include Software-Defined Data Center, Hybrid Cloud Computing, and End-User Computing. It supports modernizing data centers, integrating public clouds, empowering digital workspaces and transforming security\n   * Similar business plan to Zoom as it operates as a SaaS, but it also helps in scaling businesses into digitalizing its services, which is similar to Zoom\u2019s ability to assist businesses with learning how to operate and adapt to its online platform\n* **8x8 Inc. (EGHT)** is a provider of Voice over IP products. Enterprise Value = $1,981 million\n   * 8x8 products include cloud-based voice, contact center, video, mobile and unified communications for businesses. Zoom directly competes in the VoIP market segment with 8x8\n   * Company has a struggling financial situation but provides insights into how this specific segment of the communications industry (that is VoIP) is oversaturated with competition and offers little to no opportunity for growth\n      * This may be the reason Zoom only offers its VoIP product in a package with other products\n* **Adobe Inc. (ADBE)** is a software company. Enterprise Value = $159,048 million\n   * The Company offers products and services used by professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, enterprises, and consumers for creating, managing, measuring, optimizing, and engaging with compelling content and experiences.\n   * Adobe is a mature state software company that offers insights into what a successful SaaS business with a diversified portfolio of quality products looks like, which is helpful to compare to a young company like Zoom.\n\n**Multiples**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Zoom is astronomically higher than its peers in every multiple except for NTM EPS](https://preview.redd.it/dn603roolpu41.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f7b0bf5f7992985f009f598d91a12e830d665a0)\n\n**Benchmark Analysis: Profitability Margins** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ZM is in line with its peers in terms of gross profit, but severely lags behind in all of the other benchmarks](https://preview.redd.it/er9xsmttlpu41.png?width=270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba048badb5c11760d8a81531c43742e3d284fc8a)\n\n**Putting these multiples to work:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h47qxen4mpu41.png?width=254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50711d50b9df4f4d0f5b33035a18482a267358a6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b6kjyhn4mpu41.png?width=241&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31ef6ed6ac25355cff8b29865284f73eb3814b2c\n\n[My favorite part\\^](https://preview.redd.it/uj8yloiohpu41.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af1c2d3eea986b01a57f377d0f9a8c24e4b2333a)\n\n**TLDR: Although Zoom should be trading at multiples  higher than its peers as it is a relatively new company and only IPO'd in 2019, the current share price (as of 4/20/2020) is way ahead of itself. With speculative high-growth stocks one should pay closer attention to the PEG Ratio rather than the P/E ratio (PEG of 1 indicates it is neither overvalued or undervalued; &lt;1 is undervalued; &gt;1 is overvalued)** In conclusion, I feel that ZM is highly overvalued when compared to its peers, the DCF yields a stock range that shows Zoom is overvalued as well, but that it justifies higher multiples and ratios. I want to emphasize that given the current market situation, a likely bear market cycle for the greater part of the year, Zoom is trading significantly higher than it should be. On top of this, its PEG ratio (over 1 is considered overvalued) shows that the stock is significantly higher than its projected EPS growth as well as that it has a high P/E ratio to begin with. \n\n**TLDR; TLDR:** Appropriate range according to peers: $70-$85 --&gt; More appropriate range would be $85-$100 taking into account my FCFE model (which is very difficult to conduct with only four years of financial information)\n\n**Strike and Date:** 8/21 $85 - $100 range ... to be even safer: 11/20 $100",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks face headwinds as investors look forward to a big earnings week, a Fed meeting and state reopenings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/stocks-face-headwinds-as-investors-look-forward-to-a-big-earnings-week-a-fed-meeting-and-state-reopenings.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The stock market is struggling to make headway, as a big week of events rolls around, including a Federal Reserve meeting, the first look at post-shutdown economic growth and earnings from more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s a busy week for earnings, and some of the biggest blue chips are likely to join the growing list of companies withdrawing guidance amid the uncertainty of how the coronavirus and shutdowns are impacting their business. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald\u2019s are among about 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&amp;P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia\u2019s plan to reopen.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it\u2019s a fundamental story,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said it\u2019s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that\u2019s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. \u201cPeople are watching what\u2019s going on in places like Georgia, but they\u2019re also watching what\u2019s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s really one thing that really matters. It\u2019s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed bazooka\n&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it\u2019s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what\u2019s working and the things that still need to happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tilley said the Fed\u2019s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. \u201cIt looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they\u2019ve come back in,\u201d he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank\u2019s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said this Fed meeting isn\u2019t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they\u2019re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re borrowing from a bank or whether you\u2019re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Economic impact\n&gt; First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.\n*****\n&gt; Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.\n*****\n&gt; The impact of that should show up in Friday\u2019s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,\u201d Tilley said.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings\n&gt; Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.\n*****\n&gt; An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It\u2019s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,\u201d said Golub. \u201cMy estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it\u2019s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that\u2019s too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. \u201cWe had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that\u2019s really bad.\u201d Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3vJvFZR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/B4Di7Fh.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/7XXBq3H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QyE3rll.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jyp5KqQ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fCYKkgg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PdPKvec.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sEY6EDm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QuCVREP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gkpOUiT.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GrUMf6m.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election-year Mays: DJIA\u2019s Second Worst Month\n\n&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fac23214c1353f0b68d7710f6f7886a1/2eed74513d6bc154-86/s400x600/2540f531fb63ceab611b44ad7e0a2c0165670319.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective\n\n&gt; One month ago today the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We\u2019ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we\u2019ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&amp;P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Picture-4.23.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we\u2019ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?\n\n&gt; \u201cThis remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Market-returns-4.20.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020\n\n&gt; The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy has performed so far this year.\n\n&gt; The \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.\n\n&gt; As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.\n\n&gt; Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far\n\n&gt; We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.\n\n&gt; As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/avgearn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators\n\n&gt; Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity index started off the week coming in at \u20134.19 which was well below estimates of \u20133. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)\n\n&gt; The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&amp;P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.\n\n&gt; In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Other honorable mentions not on this list reporting next week include industrial bell-weather Caterpillar (CAT), stocks likely benefiting from the COVID economy like Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Clorox (CLX), and finally, some travel and leisure stocks like Expedia (EXPE), Royal Caribbean (RCL), United Airlines (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Earnings-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Bounces Right Where It Was Supposed To\n\n&gt; With central banks around the world unleashing waves of liquidity, there have been heightened concerns that one result will be a decline in the purchasing power of our money. For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.\n\n&gt; Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/042320-Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$CBSH** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$CHKP** \n&gt; * **$MRK** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$WHR** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$BP** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$CLX** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$CMS** \n&gt; * **$CNX** \n&gt; * **$APRN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lRp3xer.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Yw1LKpH.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HW4ersg.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KnhCH1m.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XeUrTNF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/20sK5un.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QXrGzmn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tSP1S0Y.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Sn4QllI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DhxQrOU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1CpjzdJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/raeflTF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/43jb0Pu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/axhdXpO.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wiL7F9e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HZkJ2ai.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:00 PM ET on Thursday, April 30, 2020. The consensus earnings estimate is $6.35 per share on revenue of $73.42 billion and the Earnings Whisper \u00ae number is $6.84 per share. Investor sentiment going into the company's earnings release has 80% expecting an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are for earnings to decline year-over-year by 11.81% with revenue increasing by 22.98%.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks face headwinds as investors look forward to a big earnings week, a Fed meeting and state reopenings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/stocks-face-headwinds-as-investors-look-forward-to-a-big-earnings-week-a-fed-meeting-and-state-reopenings.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The stock market is struggling to make headway, as a big week of events rolls around, including a Federal Reserve meeting, the first look at post-shutdown economic growth and earnings from more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s a busy week for earnings, and some of the biggest blue chips are likely to join the growing list of companies withdrawing guidance amid the uncertainty of how the coronavirus and shutdowns are impacting their business. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald\u2019s are among about 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&amp;P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia\u2019s plan to reopen.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it\u2019s a fundamental story,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said it\u2019s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that\u2019s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. \u201cPeople are watching what\u2019s going on in places like Georgia, but they\u2019re also watching what\u2019s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s really one thing that really matters. It\u2019s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed bazooka\n&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it\u2019s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what\u2019s working and the things that still need to happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tilley said the Fed\u2019s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. \u201cIt looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they\u2019ve come back in,\u201d he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank\u2019s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said this Fed meeting isn\u2019t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they\u2019re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re borrowing from a bank or whether you\u2019re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Economic impact\n&gt; First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.\n*****\n&gt; Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.\n*****\n&gt; The impact of that should show up in Friday\u2019s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,\u201d Tilley said.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings\n&gt; Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.\n*****\n&gt; An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It\u2019s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,\u201d said Golub. \u201cMy estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it\u2019s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that\u2019s too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. \u201cWe had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that\u2019s really bad.\u201d Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3vJvFZR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/B4Di7Fh.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/7XXBq3H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QyE3rll.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jyp5KqQ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fCYKkgg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PdPKvec.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sEY6EDm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QuCVREP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gkpOUiT.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GrUMf6m.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election-year Mays: DJIA\u2019s Second Worst Month\n\n&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fac23214c1353f0b68d7710f6f7886a1/2eed74513d6bc154-86/s400x600/2540f531fb63ceab611b44ad7e0a2c0165670319.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective\n\n&gt; One month ago today the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We\u2019ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we\u2019ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&amp;P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Picture-4.23.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we\u2019ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?\n\n&gt; \u201cThis remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Market-returns-4.20.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020\n\n&gt; The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy has performed so far this year.\n\n&gt; The \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.\n\n&gt; As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.\n\n&gt; Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far\n\n&gt; We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.\n\n&gt; As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/avgearn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators\n\n&gt; Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity index started off the week coming in at \u20134.19 which was well below estimates of \u20133. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)\n\n&gt; The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&amp;P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.\n\n&gt; In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Other honorable mentions not on this list reporting next week include industrial bell-weather Caterpillar (CAT), stocks likely benefiting from the COVID economy like Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Clorox (CLX), and finally, some travel and leisure stocks like Expedia (EXPE), Royal Caribbean (RCL), United Airlines (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Earnings-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Bounces Right Where It Was Supposed To\n\n&gt; With central banks around the world unleashing waves of liquidity, there have been heightened concerns that one result will be a decline in the purchasing power of our money. For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.\n\n&gt; Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/042320-Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 24th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEYmZu0gJo))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.26.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p72X2AQhQg))**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$CBSH** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$CHKP** \n&gt; * **$MRK** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$WHR** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$BP** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$CLX** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$CMS** \n&gt; * **$CNX** \n&gt; * **$APRN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lRp3xer.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Yw1LKpH.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HW4ersg.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KnhCH1m.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XeUrTNF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/20sK5un.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QXrGzmn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tSP1S0Y.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Sn4QllI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DhxQrOU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1CpjzdJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/raeflTF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/43jb0Pu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/axhdXpO.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wiL7F9e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HZkJ2ai.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks face headwinds as investors look forward to a big earnings week, a Fed meeting and state reopenings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/stocks-face-headwinds-as-investors-look-forward-to-a-big-earnings-week-a-fed-meeting-and-state-reopenings.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The stock market is struggling to make headway, as a big week of events rolls around, including a Federal Reserve meeting, the first look at post-shutdown economic growth and earnings from more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s a busy week for earnings, and some of the biggest blue chips are likely to join the growing list of companies withdrawing guidance amid the uncertainty of how the coronavirus and shutdowns are impacting their business. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald\u2019s are among about 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&amp;P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia\u2019s plan to reopen.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it\u2019s a fundamental story,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said it\u2019s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that\u2019s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. \u201cPeople are watching what\u2019s going on in places like Georgia, but they\u2019re also watching what\u2019s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s really one thing that really matters. It\u2019s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed bazooka\n&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it\u2019s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what\u2019s working and the things that still need to happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tilley said the Fed\u2019s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. \u201cIt looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they\u2019ve come back in,\u201d he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank\u2019s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said this Fed meeting isn\u2019t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they\u2019re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re borrowing from a bank or whether you\u2019re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Economic impact\n&gt; First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.\n*****\n&gt; Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.\n*****\n&gt; The impact of that should show up in Friday\u2019s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,\u201d Tilley said.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings\n&gt; Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.\n*****\n&gt; An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It\u2019s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,\u201d said Golub. \u201cMy estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it\u2019s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that\u2019s too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. \u201cWe had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that\u2019s really bad.\u201d Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3vJvFZR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/B4Di7Fh.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/7XXBq3H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QyE3rll.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jyp5KqQ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fCYKkgg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PdPKvec.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sEY6EDm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QuCVREP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gkpOUiT.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GrUMf6m.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election-year Mays: DJIA\u2019s Second Worst Month\n\n&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P.

It used to be part of what we called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fac23214c1353f0b68d7710f6f7886a1/2eed74513d6bc154-86/s400x600/2540f531fb63ceab611b44ad7e0a2c0165670319.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective\n\n&gt; One month ago today the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We\u2019ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we\u2019ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&amp;P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Picture-4.23.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we\u2019ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?\n\n&gt; \u201cThis remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Market-returns-4.20.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020\n\n&gt; The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy has performed so far this year.\n\n&gt; The \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.\n\n&gt; As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.\n\n&gt; Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far\n\n&gt; We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.\n\n&gt; As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/avgearn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators\n\n&gt; Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity index started off the week coming in at \u20134.19 which was well below estimates of \u20133. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)\n\n&gt; The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&amp;P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.\n\n&gt; In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Other honorable mentions not on this list reporting next week include industrial bell-weather Caterpillar (CAT), stocks likely benefiting from the COVID economy like Colgate Palmolive (CL) and Clorox (CLX), and finally, some travel and leisure stocks like Expedia (EXPE), Royal Caribbean (RCL), United Airlines (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Earnings-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Bounces Right Where It Was Supposed To\n\n&gt; With central banks around the world unleashing waves of liquidity, there have been heightened concerns that one result will be a decline in the purchasing power of our money. For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.\n\n&gt; Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/042320-Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$CBSH** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$CHKP** \n&gt; * **$MRK** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$WHR** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$BP** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$CLX** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$CMS** \n&gt; * **$CNX** \n&gt; * **$APRN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lRp3xer.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Yw1LKpH.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HW4ersg.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KnhCH1m.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XeUrTNF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/20sK5un.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QXrGzmn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tSP1S0Y.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Sn4QllI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DhxQrOU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1CpjzdJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/raeflTF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/43jb0Pu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/axhdXpO.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wiL7F9e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HZkJ2ai.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.

        "selftext": "Hey guys! Earnings season is up. I have tried a premium selling strategy that has worked for me pretty well for at least more than an year. The strategy is a simple put credit spread. And you do it on the companies that have a history of beating revenues, companies that have a strong management, etc. Sure, these companies can also take a dip if they miss their estimates but they tend to come back up after sometime. Examples for such companies might be FAANG+Microsoft. To protect my downside, I go out in the 45 DTE monthly, give up some premium collected and go far out to 2X the expected move. It gives me a little more room to the downside and enough time to recoup losses if the trade goes against me. \n\nI have made a list of such companies. I would like you guys to punch holes in my theory and suggest more companies like these. \n\n\nNFLX -\nINTC - \n\nGOOGL - 4/28\nAMD - 4/28\nSBUX - 4/28\nPEP - 4/28\nBA - 4/29 bmo\nMSFT - 4/29\nFB - 4/29\nTSLA - 4/29\nMCD - 4/30\nAAPL - 4/30\nAMZN - 4/30\nV - 4/30\nGILD - 4/30\n\nBYND - 5/5\nSPCE - 5/5\nDIS - 5/5\nSQ - 5/6\nLYFT - 5/6\nSHOP - 5/6\nUBER - 5/7\nROKU - 5/7\nCSCO - 5/13\nNVDA - 5/21\nKO - \nWMT - 5/19\nBABA - 5/20\nBIDU - 5/21\nHD - 5/19\n\n\nCRM - 6/2 \nCOST - 6/4",

        "selftext": "Analyst checks at Needham confirm that stay-at-home measures have driven a surge in demand across the board for communication services providers through March. After $CSCO and $MSFT, the most notable cloud vendors include $ZM, $RNG and $FIVN.\n\nHowever, as April progressed, this initial COVID-19 driven tailwind appears to now have turned into a headwind, as many customers under financial pressures are beginning to reduce usage or postpone projects. In person sales and deployment have also been curtailed. The verticals seeing the biggest impact (unsurprisingly) are retail, manufacturing, travel and transportation. Growth expectations in the industry is reportedly being revised down by \\~5% on average.\n\nZoom was repeatedly highlighted as the pure play vendor seeing the biggest near term demand increase. Interestingly, the checks also indicate Zoom has thus far seen minimal customer churn despite all the negative publicity related to its security issues.",

Something that's very needed atm, while there's a big increase in homeworking, streaming, videochatting, pharma research and social networks. Microsoft and Facebook are a few of their clients, to give some examples. They are very innovative and are slowly gaining market cap from Cisco. \n\nAs for financials, nothing but good. Steady growth over the past years, 66% expenses to earnings, assets 3x liabilities and enough cash on hand to cover not only long term debt, but all liabilities.\n\nOnly concern is their Q4 fallback in 2019, but their Q2 earnings are expected to grow a lot due to the arguments of usage increase above. \n\nDo you guys know more about this company?",

Being a Tech Product Manager for a FTSE 100 company, I get to see what Enterprises are buying and shifting IT infrastructure towards. As a result, the innovations Microsoft, Cisco and Honeywell are doing may make them good stocks to have on your watch list. You can find the video here [https://youtu.be/axBInKClTRA](https://youtu.be/axBInKClTRA)\n\nI've broken them down and included both the qualitative and quantitative research elements with each. I tried to keep it brief because I didn't want this video to be too long but I can do more of these if you like.\n\nIf you find the video helpful then please subscribe to the channel and help it to grow.
