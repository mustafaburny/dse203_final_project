Small businesses are laying off left and right. PAYX gets its revenue as small businesses pay them a fee every pay period to distribute paychecks to employees. And PAYX is overwhelming exposed to the small business sector. SQ is down a lot more than PAYX even though these two companies are in the same space. Look at SQ and PAYX one month charts in your shitty Robinhood viewer. SQ down 42% and this shitty payroll processor is down 22%. Doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out people on unemployment don\u2019t get paychecks. \n\nI\u2019m in for 2 contracts\n$45p 6/17 \nand getting order in for two more \n$45p 9/18",
