        "selftext": "First off this is not financial advice; just my personal opinion on a recent IPO that has a lot of room to run. ZIPRecruiter (ZIP) is undervalued and in the sweet spot of a massive secular trend; my DD has me convinced that this stock could break out.\n \nFirst off, it\u2019s important to realize that pretty much every employed person in America is considering a job change now that the pandemic is easing up. For the past year and a half, people have stuck it out in terrible jobs mostly because they were happy to have stable employment at the time, and also nobody was hiring. Now that the economy is taking off and companies are trying to hire again, most workers are going to test the waters. Recent estimates from Microsoft are that 40% of US employees will switch companies this year, and other surveys found that at least 26% of workers leave their companies will find new work. Experts are calling it the \u201cGreat Resignation of 2021\u201d. The numbers are impossible to predict, but just think about all the people in your own friend groups that have been complaining about their jobs for months and are trying to make a change.\nhttps://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-great-resignation-of-2021-are-30-of-workers-really-going-to-quit/ \n \nSo if you agree that the labor markets are unfrozen and people will be taking advantage of it, how can you make money off it? Look at the software companies that will power/enable this big trend. Staffing / recruiting companies that offer this as a service will benefit, but they don\u2019t scale well. If Manpower Group or Kelley Services has an extra 10 job applicants, they may need to hire an extra recruiter (costs go up as revenues go up). With software platforms, the new job applicants add volume with no incremental costs. \n\nThe biggest recruiting tool of all is LinkedIn, but that\u2019s owned by MSFT and is just a sideshow to their main business. Other large software players in the HR Tech space have recruiting tools, such as GOOG, SAP, WDAY, ADP, CDAY, etc \u2013 but again the recruiting platform is on the periphery of what they do... so not a core competency of any big players. Besides these guys, the market is fragmented. There are thousands of job boards, recruiting firms, talent agencies and staffing companies that will help match applicants to companies, but there is only one standalone software company that focuses on recruiting that is publicly traded: ZIP.\nhttps://ideal.com/top-recruiting-software/\n \nHow does ZIP make money and why do they stand out? The platform is free for individual people to look for jobs, but companies will sign up for recurring accounts where they create jobs and post them into the platform. ZIP is a job aggregator, meaning it takes the job posting and replicates this on thousands of job boards across the world, and then brings back quality candidates to the companies. For employees, it will match you with dozens of roles based on what you are looking for. And because most jobs are virtual/remote now, this software opens up new roles and opportunities that previously a person wouldn\u2019t have considered.\n \nNow here\u2019s where it really gets interesting. ZIP went public a few weeks through a direct listing, with no fanfare or hype. Unless you really follow the HR software IPO market, you wouldn\u2019t even know that this happened. Shares currently trade around $24 and the company has a market cap of $2.5B.\n\nZIP has an EV/Rev ratio of ~9x, which is under the big players above: MSFT = 10x, CDAY = 14x, WDAY = 11x, etc\u2026 meaning it\u2019s cheaper to buy a share of ZIP than a fully diversified software company that has products in multiple categories. If recruiting is going to grow gangbusters this year as the economy rebounds, how come ZIP is trading at a discount to larger companies that have smaller expected growth rates?\n \nI\u2019m not a professional stock picker, so this is just my speculation, but I think there are 4 reasons why ZIP isn\u2019t getting any love (yet)\n\n1. They are too small. $2.5B market cap is a rounding error to a company like MSFT, GOOG, or WDAY.\n2. In 2020, ZIP had a negative growth year (2019 revenues of $430M went down (3%) in 2020 to $418M). Professional investors don\u2019t like that, especially when every other software company went gangbusters in 2020. Well let\u2019s dig into that\u2026 why did ZIP\u2019s revenue decrease in 2020? BECAUSE NOBODY WAS LOOKING FOR JOBS AND COMPANIES WEREN\u2019T HIRING NEW PEOPLE. It was a pandemic and nobody was doing anything except watching netflix. \n3. The company had a Q1 earnings call in between filing the IPO paperwork but before the stock was trading. Management had a lot of great things to say (they basically argued that this is an unprecedented time in the recruiting market and they are well poised to capture it), but I honestly don\u2019t think anyone was paying attention\n4. On the earnings call, the management said that Q2 is going to be huge (80% growth when compared to Q2 2020) but then the second half of the year could ramp down if people stop switching jobs. Perhaps analysts didn\u2019t like that, but isn\u2019t that obvious? As long as the economy keeps picking up steam, ZIP is going to do well.\n \nTL/DR \u2013 ZIP is a stock worth taking a look at; I feel they will fly under the radar until Q2 earnings when they will explode. I\u2019m not a financial advisor, so do you your own research too. I LIKE THE STOCK!! I picked up 1200 shares last week.",

        "selftext": "Reviewing the Bear Case on Paysafe (PSFE)\n\nJP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, recently noted that fintechs pose \"enormous competitive threats\" to banks and SF Federal Reserve board member, Jackie Reses, sees them \u201ctaking over and revolutionizing banking\u201d with \u201ca wholesale transition\u201d of \u201ca $16 trillion market cap\u201d.\n\nIn this context, fintech Paysafe (PSFE) is newly listed on the NYSE and introduced to the US market. Already well known in Europe, Paysafe reports a substantial $362 million in free cash flow, projects $100 billion in transactional volume, $1.5 billion in revenue, healthy double-digit growth and expanding $30%+ EBITDA margins, but, despite absolutely no negative news, the stock has taken a pounding which, in turn, has brought the bears out in force with some dubious arguments. Sorry for the long post, but I thought I'd address all of these arguments in one post:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCommon bear arguments:\n\n\\#1 Old business\n\n\\#2 Complex regulatory landscape / no moat\n\n\\#3 Growth by acquisition is risky and difficult\n\n\\#4 No growth\n\n\\#5 Slow growth\n\n\\#6 Not profitable\n\n\\#7 Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.\n\n\\#8 Blackstone made 3X and will sell\n\n\\#9 Founder share and warrant dilution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#1) Old business. \n\nPaysafe\u2019s extensive experience in risk management and its time-tested regulatory expertise over many regions globally is one of its greatest strengths. This is the reason that Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a rapidly moving space that is anticipated to grow 10X. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nMuch of Paysafe\u2019s business is in back-end payment processing so most don\u2019t even know they are using it, but Paysafe is considered to be at the forefront in its field: Winner \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d and they are rapidly expanding in the US with new partnerships (just last 3 months: Coinbase, Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto)\n\nIn Europe, where Paysafe is more known and used, Trustpilot (1) rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 25,000 reviews, and Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews.\n\nPaysafe has the No. 2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. They\u2019ve just integrated their digital wallet platforms, Neteller and Skrill, recently voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nAside from Coinbase, Luckbox and Microsoft, they are partnered with Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, among many others. They are currently moving quickly to integrate their services to offer easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into global banking as a service.\u00a0\n\nIn preparation for their plans, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone, two from CVC, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, and the Chairman of the Board of Fidelity.\n\nAs Chairman Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab\u2026I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet\u2026 It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\" This doesn't sound like an old company resting on its laurels. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#2) Complex regulatory landscape / no moat. \n\nBill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now also Paysafe\u2019s Chairman of the Board, calls Paysafe,\u201ca fortress. It\u2019s got a moat\u2026 We have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\" Their regulatory acumen is the reason they currently dominate globally in sports betting/iGaming and are integrating their global platforms to expand into banking as a service. There are 1.7 billion \"unbanked\" because so many in the world who have mobile devices, still don't have access to the essential ID metrics that most banks and credit cards require to open accounts. Paysafe's risk management and cross boarder regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant to go. Leaning into this strength, they've brought on PayPal's former CRO and added a multi-jurisdictional regulatory expert to their Board of Directors\n\nFrom SEC filed transcript (2) - Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh: \u201cTo be a true global player in the iGaming space, the level of payments regulation, of gaming regulation and certification is very, very complex. When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be a winner in this space, you\u2019re catering to some incredibly demanding clients. They want to be global, they want multiple APMs, but they want you to understand payment regulation in hundreds of countries in gaming and gambling regulation in hundreds of countries. That\u2019s something that Paysafe has developed very, very successfully in every market we\u2019ve entered.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#3) Growth by acquisition is hard. \n\nSynergistic inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a key pillar of Paysafe\u2019s forward growth strategy. Bill Foley's proven track record in quickly generating this kind of growth speaks for itself. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). Foley says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d (2, 4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#4) No growth. \n\nIt\u2019s true that Paysafe\u2019s revenue stagnated in 2020 resulting from business closures during Covid, but prior to that they reported a strong 27% CAGR (4,5), which is on par with high profile competitors:\n\n2017: $864 million rev\n\n2018 : $1.14 billion rev (+32%)\n\n2019 : $1.418 billion rev (+24%).\n\n2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)\n\nUnlike many fintechs, Paysafe has heavy exposure in brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed in 2020 due to Covid. During this market dislocation, they pivoted, \u201cexited low value referral channels\u201d and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and e-commmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.\n\nLooking at other brick-and-mortar payment processors hard-hit during the same period, like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:\n\n\u2014Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)\n\n\u2014 Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)\n\nNot claiming that Paysafe should be valued according to these two traditional payment processors but, given their commensurate slow down during Covid, it is interesting to note that their their averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46, which is very much in line with the valuation comps cited below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#5) Slow growth. \n\nGoing forward, Paysafe conservatively projects $10-13% annual growth over the next two years but they are careful so say that those growth projections exclude M&amp;A plans and expansion in iGaming which is expected to grow at 55% CAGR over the next several years. iGaming accounts for over a third of Paysafe\u2019s revenue so this growth is a significant exclusion.\n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso, who recently initiated coverage with a $19 price target (6) said, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d\n\nIn the short time since he wrote that, here are some of the headlines signaling a price target upgrade:\n\n1 \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n\n2 \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n\n3 New Hampshire: \"Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n\n4 \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n\n5 \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n\n6 \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n\n7 \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n\n8 \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n\n9 \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n\n10 \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n\n11 \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n\n12 \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n\n13 \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n\n14 \"Single-sports betting in Canada wins House vote, nears legalization\"\n\n15 \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n\n16 \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \\~12.5% (not far from Paysafe\u2019s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter eliminating outliers with highest multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes:\n\n1 Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.\n\n2 Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.\n\n3 As noted Paysafe\u2019s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&amp;A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.\n\n4 The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon\u2019s \"enormous competitive threats\" comment.\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers projects roughly 20% more growth than Paysafe yet trades at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#6) Not profitable. \n\nPaysafe expects $900 million in gross profit with healthy 30-32% EBITDA margin. As one recent article pointed out, \u201cPaysafe has shown some intriguing projections in terms of its profitability. The company\u2019s projected gross margin is 63%, an impressive number compared to competitors like Square with a gross margin under 30%.\u201d\nThese fintech competitors are trading at much higher multiples but have worse EPS than Paysafe:\n\nRepay: -0.67,\n\nAffirm : -2.18,\n\nNuvei : -1.08,\n\nPaysign : -0.19.\n\nBill : -0.62,\n\nShift4 : -0.43\n\nAverage EV/EBITDA multiples of the above companies would put Paysafe's SP at $69\nIf you read their transcripts and presentations, you\u2019ll see that profit is being utilized to grow the business and integrate their global platforms into what they call Paysafe Unity. They\u2019ve recently completed the integration of Skrill and Neteller digital wallets into a single code. Foley has indicated further elimination of redundancies to create new efficiencies and increase margins to enhance M&amp;A activities. From what I can tell, Foley is all about the long game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#7) Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.   \nPaysafe just paid down $1.1 billion in debt. Why would they turn around and borrow again? As Fidelity\u2019s Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d\n\nTheir 3.6X Debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintech peers. Investopedia: \u201cDebt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. A high ratio result could indicate a company has a too-heavy debt load.\u201d \n\nOf the 11 fintech competitors I looked at, all but three (PYPL, ADYEY, NUVCF), have worse Debt/EBITDA ratios than Paysafe and many have negative EBITDA, making debt service that much more difficult:\n\nSquare: 77.8X\n\nRepay : 8.7X\n\nFiserv : $21.2B / $4.7B : 4.5X\n\nGPN : $10.27B / $2.8B : 3.67X\n\nShift4 : $1.8B / -$8M : negative EBITDA\n\nAffirm : $1.67B / -77.6M negative EBITDA\n\nPaysign : $4.3M / -$5.79M : negative EBITDA\n\nBill : $947M / -43.85M : negative EBITDA\n\nDepending on whether you include SQ and AFRM, the combined multiples of the above competitors (by EV/EBITDA, EV/free cash flow or EV/revenue) puts Paysafe\u2019s share price in the $45 to $90 range. Point being, their debt position is better than most and hardly a red flag. Further, management has said they\u2019ll be able to fund M&amp;A plans with expanding 32-35%+ EBITDA margins ($500 - 560 million, 21% CAGR) and $362 million in free cash flow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#8) Blackstone made 3X and will sell. \n\nThe common myth is that Blackstone/CVC made 300% by paying $3 billion to take Paysafe private and receiving $9 billion in the recent deal to bring it public. The reality, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (8), is that Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private in 2017 for $3.9 Billion and they received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares on the recent deal. Adjusted for inflation, they paid $4.2 billion so it\u2019s more like a 33% return on a 4 year hold.\n\nImportantly, this came AFTER they grew revenue 65% ($864B to $1.426B), stewarded a billion in investments to grow the business, and the deal included paying down over $1.1 billion in debt. This suggests Foley cut a great deal for shareholders. It also explains why private equity has signaled that they'll stay on long term to reap much bigger gains through Foley\u2019s time-tested M&amp;A playbook.\n\nBlackstone itself says (9), \u201cThe term of private equity funds can be upwards of 7-10 years.\u201d With so much runway and comps pointing to a 3-4X valuation, why would Blackstone leave so much money on the table?\n\nBlackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler signals an ongoing interest in staying on: \u201cWe believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview Foley said, private equity\u2019s plan to stay on was part of what encouraged PIPE to invest $2 billion: \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d\n\nThis trust was reiterated in the SEC filed FTAC\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination: \u201cCommitment of Paysafe\u2019s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such stockholders\u2019 belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects of Paysafe going forward.\u201d\n\nThe PIPE investors are even less of a concern because they are title and life insurance companies known for long-term investment strategies, they are closely aligned with Foley and understand both his M&amp;A track record and his ability to create mutually beneficial synergistic deals through what Bloomberg called the \u201cThe Foley Network\u201d (perhaps, for example, Paysafe will handle Fidelity\u2019s massive transactional volume). \nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Bill Foley said, \u201cThe thing that was different about our transaction is that we brought capital to the table. The companies that I\u2019m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset besides the fact that it\u2019s a great asset.\u201d\n\nBesides, just as large funds will often drive price down to accumulate large positions, they also can drive price up to sell into strength and will do so via off-market trades to avoid price slippage. Therefore, we probably wouldn\u2019t even notice profit taking until after quarterly filings. Paysafe\u2019s fundamental value in context indicates such prospects present very little long term risk, especially from current price levels. Given Paysafe's $100B market share (similar to Square\u2019s), once audited numbers are available, many large funds focused on this space will necessarily seek a more balanced exposure through Paysafe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#9) Founder share and warrant dilution. \n\nAccording to the 20F recently filed, roughly 53 million warrants pose potential dilution at a maximum of 7.5% (movement we've seen in a day), but the cashless conversion option, generally exchanging 3 warrants for a single share, can reduce that dilution by 2/3 to around 2.5%. It is very likely that many will use this option since most warrant holders do not have the extra cash to pay an additional $11.50 for each warrant conversion. It will probably be somewhere in the middle of the two scenarios (\\~5%) but this is not a major concern in the scheme of things.\n\nImportantly, the 20F also shows that all founder shares are already included in the current outstanding share count so there is no risk of dilution there.\n\nTotal FTAC Founder shares 175,292,458 24.2 %\u00a0\n\nBlackstone Investors 123,734,571 17.1 %\u00a0\n\nCVC Investors 156,006,433 21.6 %\u00a0\n\nOther Pre-Business Combination Paysafe Shareholders 53,701,074 7.4 %\u00a0\n\nCannae (excluding amounts included in Founder) 50,000,000 6.9 %\u00a0\n\nPIPE Investors (excluding Cannae) 165,000,000 22.8 %\u00a0\n\n723,734,536 100.0 %\u00a0\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite a lack of negative news, short sellers and bashers have been able to exploit a perfect storm of doubt created by seemingly unrelated events ranging from forced selling pressure coming from widely reported changes in margin requirements (25% to 100% upon ticker change without any prior notice), to simultaneous limits on buying resulting from excessive delays (7+ trading days) in the new PSFE ticker being available on many platforms, to things in the media that this sub will not allow to be discussed.  In this context, it is hard not to see a month's worth of \u201cfake sell walls\u201d and HFS \u201cshort ladder attacks\u201d as anything other than opportunistic price manipulation but, speculation can only get you so far. \n\nI think Paysafe is currently undervalued and, as the developments in legalized sports betting come to fruition, it is very likely a 3X from here. M&amp;A plans already in the works will bring additional catalysts.

        "selftext": "First off this is not financial advice; just my personal opinion on a recent IPO that has a lot of room to run. ZIPRecruiter (ZIP) is undervalued and in the sweet spot of a massive secular trend; my DD has me convinced that this stock could break out.\n \nFirst off, it\u2019s important to realize that pretty much every employed person in America is considering a job change now that the pandemic is easing up. For the past year and a half, people have stuck it out in terrible jobs mostly because they were happy to have stable employment at the time, and also nobody was hiring. Now that the economy is taking off and companies are trying to hire again, most workers are going to test the waters. Recent estimates from Microsoft are that 40% of US employees will switch companies this year, and other surveys found that at least 26% of workers leave their companies will find new work. Experts are calling it the \u201cGreat Resignation of 2021\u201d. The numbers are impossible to predict, but just think about all the people in your own friend groups that have been complaining about their jobs for months and are trying to make a change.\nhttps://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-great-resignation-of-2021-are-30-of-workers-really-going-to-quit/ \n \nSo if you agree that the labor markets are unfrozen and people will be taking advantage of it, how can you make money off it? Look at the software companies that will power/enable this big trend. Staffing / recruiting companies that offer this as a service will benefit, but they don\u2019t scale well. If Manpower Group or Kelley Services has an extra 10 job applicants, they may need to hire an extra recruiter (costs go up as revenues go up). With software platforms, the new job applicants add volume with no incremental costs. \n\nThe biggest recruiting tool of all is LinkedIn, but that\u2019s owned by MSFT and is just a sideshow to their main business. Other large software players in the HR Tech space have recruiting tools, such as GOOG, SAP, WDAY, ADP, CDAY, etc \u2013 but again the recruiting platform is on the periphery of what they do... so not a core competency of any big players. Besides these guys, the market is fragmented. There are thousands of job boards, recruiting firms, talent agencies and staffing companies that will help match applicants to companies, but there is only one standalone software company that focuses on recruiting that is publicly traded: ZIP.\nhttps://ideal.com/top-recruiting-software/\n \nHow does ZIP make money and why do they stand out? The platform is free for individual people to look for jobs, but companies will sign up for recurring accounts where they create jobs and post them into the platform. ZIP is a job aggregator, meaning it takes the job posting and replicates this on thousands of job boards across the world, and then brings back quality candidates to the companies. For employees, it will match you with dozens of roles based on what you are looking for. And because most jobs are virtual/remote now, this software opens up new roles and opportunities that previously a person wouldn\u2019t have considered.\n \nNow here\u2019s where it really gets interesting. ZIP went public a few weeks through a direct listing, with no fanfare or hype. Unless you really follow the HR software IPO market, you wouldn\u2019t even know that this happened. Shares currently trade around $24 and the company has a market cap of $2.5B.\n\nZIP has an EV/Rev ratio of ~9x, which is under the big players above: MSFT = 10x, CDAY = 14x, WDAY = 11x, etc\u2026 meaning it\u2019s cheaper to buy a share of ZIP than a fully diversified software company that has products in multiple categories. If recruiting is going to grow gangbusters this year as the economy rebounds, how come ZIP is trading at a discount to larger companies that have smaller expected growth rates?\n \nI\u2019m not a professional stock picker, so this is just my speculation, but I think there are 4 reasons why ZIP isn\u2019t getting any love (yet)\n\n1. They are too small. $2.5B market cap is a rounding error to a company like MSFT, GOOG, or WDAY.\n2. In 2020, ZIP had a negative growth year (2019 revenues of $430M went down (3%) in 2020 to $418M). Professional investors don\u2019t like that, especially when every other software company went gangbusters in 2020. Well let\u2019s dig into that\u2026 why did ZIP\u2019s revenue decrease in 2020? BECAUSE NOBODY WAS LOOKING FOR JOBS AND COMPANIES WEREN\u2019T HIRING NEW PEOPLE. It was a pandemic and nobody was doing anything except watching netflix. \n3. The company had a Q1 earnings call in between filing the IPO paperwork but before the stock was trading. Management had a lot of great things to say (they basically argued that this is an unprecedented time in the recruiting market and they are well poised to capture it), but I honestly don\u2019t think anyone was paying attention\n4. On the earnings call, the management said that Q2 is going to be huge (80% growth when compared to Q2 2020) but then the second half of the year could ramp down if people stop switching jobs. Perhaps analysts didn\u2019t like that, but isn\u2019t that obvious? As long as the economy keeps picking up steam, ZIP is going to do well.\n \nTL/DR \u2013 ZIP is a stock worth taking a look at; I feel they will fly under the radar until Q2 earnings when they will explode. I\u2019m not a financial advisor, so do you your own research too. I LIKE THE STOCK!! I picked up 1200 shares last week.",

        "selftext": "Why I think BB is legit\n\nHonest View on BB\n\nApe Research Analyst Report on BB: To the Moon\n\nWhat's up apes, I know the last couple weeks have been life-changing for some of us. As a grad student who grew up on the lower end of the middle class, I recognize how pumped some fo you must feel and commend everyone's brass balls- it's never easy to make money in a casino as heavily manipulated as the free market that is the USA. But turning to BB: it was never meant to be just some squeeze (although its end result could technically be called that if you really wanted too)- it's a retooling company embedded in a crucial sector to the modern global economy.\n\nAnd so while some of us have become capable of retirement in recent weeks, I want to talk about a name that is on the cusp of a resurrection.\n\n# For BB Holders, it's been tough lately.\n\nMany people have harsh memories of Blackberry: it was on the cusp of bankruptcy as recently as 2015. Revenue growth sunk from $20B at its peak in 2011 (82% hardware sales) to under a $1B in the 2010s; $BB stock sunk from a peak of $146 in 2008 to single digits, thanks to negative cash flows and rapidly declining top line growth.\n\n[Not surprising BB ate shit for so long- this useless Etch-a-Sketch was 82&amp;#37; of their revenue in 2011!](https://preview.redd.it/w7dt7c4bwd371.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80e0a1b70f7bad3078d8bb3d3982d69b1d12f1bb)\n\n[It's been a long, tough run for Blackberry shareholders since they ended hardware production\\/sales. The stock has been largely irrelevant for years, falling from a peak of $146 in May 2008 to single digits \\&lt; $5B market cap. But its transition into a cybersecurity company is only beginning to pay fruit, which I believe the market will catch on to very soon. Times are a-changing!](https://preview.redd.it/f5zqz58dwd371.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=763644f3ae3cc922a25d1e06d7d0a295ae5d5ed9)\n\n# A Rebranded Business for the Digital Economy\n\nLike we've seen with the Chads in Gamestoink, successful companies are the ones willing to renounce their fading legacy businesses and embrace initiatives and industries that sit on the cusp of the digital age. Enter Blackberry. Now we all remember Blackberry's legacy business- the handheld pagers that looked like shit, but only quirky people embraced (POTUS and CEOs used Blackberry pagers over iPhones for the longest of times, until Blackberry discontinued its hardware line).\n\nHowever, the primary focus for Blackberry has never changed. Blackberry was always security-centric, and with the installation of CEO John S. Chen in 2013, Blackberry pivoted towards software- a trend that was always going to happen given Apple's prowess in manufacturing superior smartphones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[John S. Chen's my homie. If you're scared about holding BB bags, just reassure yourself that that chin can hold both yours and his. But seriously, he's an innovator, having been credited with \\\\\"Saving Blackberry\\\\\"- pay attention, his vision doesn't end with subsistence.](https://preview.redd.it/l39tl9rfwd371.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91ee66024cfba9e04ea1566f5690aeb57ecd2497)\n\nBut like Ryan Cohen with Gamestop/Chewy, Blackberry recognized it needed to adapt to survive, and that's exactly what it has done under Chen's stewardship. A glimpse at Blackberry today is far different than the pioneer that once controlled 20%+ of the mobile hardware market.\n\n[Revenues have intuitively followed a similar trajectory as Blackberry's market cap. But the transformation under Chen's leadership so far is tangible: after hardware sales alone accounted for 82&amp;#37; of revenue in 2011, the company made a wide U-turn. After establishing \\(and meeting\\) a goal for fiscal 2020 revenue to top $1B again, hardware has fallen to just \\~3&amp;#37; of sales. Enterprise software \\(44&amp;#37;\\), Licensing &amp; IP \\(31&amp;#37;\\), and Technology Solutions \\(22&amp;#37;\\) now dominate BB's topline as of 2020, cementing its push and admittance to the cybersecurity market.](https://preview.redd.it/u9mg373iwd371.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c8790440834c2d2f933eb88018fa6971d95ce0e)\n\n# So what does Blackberry actually do now?\n\nTo be clear, the only people walking around with Blackberry \"phones\" nowadays are old junkies trying to revive some 2000s nostalgia. Blackberry doesn't make that archaic crap anymore. All you need to remember are three phrases when thinking about the new Blackberry: **enterprise software, licensing IP,** and **technology solutions**.\n\n* **Enterprise software** is one of the fastest growing components of BB's cybersecurity offering. It includes products like the Blackberry Enterprise Mobility Suite, which provides endpoint management and BlackBerry AtHoc, a secure communications platform.\n* **Licensing IP** is the segment responsible for the monetization of the Company\u2019s global patent portfolio as well as the mobility licensing operations, which license the BlackBerry brand and device software to handset vendors.\n* **Technology Solutions** is the business that includes BlackBerry QNX embedded software as well as several emerging businesses such as the BlackBerry Radar fleet management solutions.\n\nExciting Partnerships, Soaring Ambitions\n\n*\\*\\*You should really take a look at some of Blackberry's partnerships in the last 2 years- this is not a company that makes shitty pagers anymore, it's the company that embodies \"digital transformation.\"*\n\nTake a look at some of the companies Blackberry is sleeping with and tell me your smooth gorilla brain doesn't swell:\n\n* **Baidu** has an extensive partnership with BB in its autonomous vehicle unit, dating back to 2018. In January 2018, the two companies announced they would [partner](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) to utilize Blackberry QNX's OS as the backbone of Baidu's autonomous system. Blackberry also agreed to help Baidu integrate smartphone integration software for Chinese connected cars (CarLife), conversational AI (DuerOS), and HD maps. In January 2021, these two [expanded](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) their relationship: Blackberry's QNX Neutrino Real-Time OS is being utilized for all future EV models produced with the EV branch of GAC (Guangzhou Automotive Group, yes the C isn't a typo). Pretty exciting stuff to say the least..\n* **Motional**, which is a Hyundai backed AV startup, [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform) in February 2021 its intentions to use BB's Black Channel communications technology for all of Motional's future AVs. A very integral input for Motional and impressive win for Blackberry, being able to ensure safe data communication exchanges within vehicle safety systems is essential for AVs' successful integration in society... otherwise where is the trust in accepting that ride? Not to mention that Apple (*the Tim Apple*) was chirping around with Hyundai and Kia, talking about making a \"smart car,\" *earlier this year!* I guess all the ape memes about Blackberry being a legitimate competitor to Apple shouldn't be sneezed at by Wall St equity research analysts and BB \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs...\n* **AWS**, yes Amazon Web Services (!), is another credible player lining up with Blackberry. Although not quite as exciting as building actual AVs, the work they do is still essential to ensure this dream can actually be realized. In December 2020, the two Chads [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform) a multi-year partnership to develop BB's IVY platform (Intelligent Vehicle Data, yes the \"Y\" is weird, but makes sense for ape leadership), allowing automakers to read sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from the data both in the vehicle and in the cloud.\n\nTake it from Amazon's new CEO, Andy Jassy himself: *\u201cAWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user\u2019s needs and preferences. Through this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.\u201d*\n\n[These geniuses love Blackberry, starting with their most intelligent, scalable business: AWS! Shouldn't you apes like BB as well?](https://preview.redd.it/ktha1d7nwd371.png?width=1218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892b2415869531f1cf47f9c54b6d6e668c252877)\n\nBut why should I stop there? I'm tired of seeing fear-mongering Wall Street hedge funds, investment bankers, and research analysts attempting to push their positions (BB's primary competitors are IBM, Microsoft, VMware, and Mobile Iron, the former 3 of which are all significantly owned by \"institutions\" - &gt;75%) and allege Blackberry is a dying business that makes crappy hardware.\n\n* **Microsoft** (Yes its rival!) even realizes its budding competitor is crafting innovative solutions, announcing a partnership in [October 2020](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management) for Microsoft Teams! Microsoft plans to integrate Blackberry AtHoc, which will allow organizations on Teams to contact, alert, and account for all members of their group directly through Teams should some calamity transpire. Especially as we witness more cyber attacks (the digital economy's biggest threat will stem from this), it will be an all hands-on-deck effort to safeguard the integrity of our software. BB's partnership with Microsoft (and [ServiceNow](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-athoc-and-servicenow-partner-to-deliver-secure-and-re) for incident response management) not only grounds its strong advance to cybersecurity industry disruption, but its diverse agility to penetrate various sectors, ranging from AV/EV, CRM software, IoT, 5G, and so much more.\n* If the corporate pedigree isn't enough for you, I'll end with the **U.S. Air Force**. No, unlike what bulge bracket banks may lead you to believe, BB's revenue stream is well-diversified, as the USAF [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/the-united-states-air-force-chooses-blackberry-spark-for-secure-productivity) a partnership in September 2020. Blackberry Spark, utilized for UEM and UES, will help the Air Force with their secure productivity needs, enabling virtual work environments whilst ensuring premium security. As we face more threats in the cyber space and continue pivoting towards a \"work-from-home environment\" regardless of the permanent trends form Covid, BB's wide-ranging partnerships, from Fortune 500 tech companies to the U.S. military prove it is an essential cog in the 21st century digital economy. Not to mention consistent ARR is exactly what investors (the suits) should be looking for, so what gives with the nasty financial press?\n\n# Blackberry's Financial Trajectory (Revs, Bottom Line, CF)\n\nWe have to take a look at Blackberry's financials, after all that is what this casino allegedly runs on. Luckily, if we ignore what the \"experts\" in Battery Park are shilling, we'll notice Blackberry is not the capsizing Titanic all the research analysts make it out to be. I'll take you into a deeper dive into the top &amp; bottom line with just the facts and my brilliant takes, and y'all can make your own decision on whether BB stock is seriously a pile of rat shit or an emerging growth stud.\n\n[As you might expect, Blackberry's overall top line consistently declined until roughly 2020+ \\(when every single one of these dope partnerships was announced\\). As BB wound down its legacy hardware, handset, and related service products, sales declined nearly $400M over the course of final two years, a marked decline from the near $20B struck in 2011. This trend seems to be on the reverse though: the new partnerships in 2020\\/21 have certainly underscored BB's transition into a software company, a trend even Wall St has had to acknowledge by lifting growth targets for fiscal year 2021. IMO, the $1.2B projected top line figure for '21 is conservative, and I think these figures could start to double, triple, and \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 in 2024+. Let me explain why with more charts:](https://preview.redd.it/3pq5gyspwd371.png?width=874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1a643492be05c1ec2f4830bd0b66b180276b6b3)\n\n[All those dope corporate and military partnerships I highlighted earlier? They mainly fit into BB's Enterprise software\\/services revenue stream, which is now 44&amp;#37; of overall revenue. This is the first component that I believe is going to drive revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and tendies for us and BB in the years to come. We'll first notice that growth in this space really picked up in 2020 for BB, similarly to when their overall topline reversed trend- because this is the soul of 2021 Blackberry! And no, this doesn't even really include the innovative AV\\/EV partnerships, these are just institutional clients like Microsoft, ServiceNow, or Salesforce who want to buy one of Blackberry's SaaS established offerings. Think of the potential addressable market in the years to come: work from home, AI, 5G, IoT, we can keep going- all of these things need to be protected, without security, there is no system- every software, hardware, and appliance company under the sun is going to be lining up because they have no choice. You are adapt or go extinct. I expect BB to continue driving this aspect of its growth in a gargantuan way: think 25-50&amp;#37; growth YoY.](https://preview.redd.it/m106ixxswd371.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59e12724037bc3b9f099ab2859bea4b6608f00ee)\n\n[If Enterprise Software is to be Blackberry's Patrick Mahomes, Technology Solutions will be Blackberry's Tom Brady. Since 2017, this aspect has doubled as a portion of overall BB revenue, from roughly 10&amp;#37; in '17 to over 22&amp;#37; projected in '21, reflecting BB's successful ongoing foray into innovative technologies. In this segment we see BB's partnerships with Motion\\/Baidu reflected, cutting-edge technology projects that will enable unfathomable innovations in the future. We could say autonomous vehicles, or drones or anything that will be automated- they will all need to be securitized, whether with each other or on the cloud. BB's deep partnerships with global leaders like Baidu indicate John Chen has been playing 4D Chess since 2013: intensive capital expenditures to transform a company's creative intelligence don't just happen with the snap of your fingers. Put simply, you don't just go from making pagers to making AVs overnight- it's a lengthy process that will affect your growth\\/profitability, as evidenced by Blackberry's fall from grace. But if my instincts are right, Enterprise Software and Technology Solutions will drive BB's revenue growth\\/profitability, propelling it back to $100B market cap in the not-so-distant future.](https://preview.redd.it/1h96psxuwd371.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=595d7f66d80d079394875a718984ee589b593bcc)\n\n[BB earns a decent amount of revenue from Licensing\\/IP, which is quite frankly a pleasant surprise to me. Essentially this component comprises BB's monetization of its global patent portfolio and licensing operations, which do things like license the Blackberry brand\\/device software to various vendors \\(a lot of handset\\). It is somewhat impressive that it's currently 31&amp;#37; of BB's top line, but then again not too surprising. Considering the Enterprise Software\\/Technology Solutions streams are at really nascent stages of growth, it makes sense that this more \\\\\"legacy\\\\\" revenue stream is so prominent. But then again, this component jumped over 20&amp;#37; in 2020 \\(what seems to be BB's turning point\\), so it's not like I'm going to argue with more revenue either. I'd say this the Matt Stafford component of BB: a reliable and solid contributor, but not something I would be betting the bank on either. But if it produces \\(which is certainly not out of the question\\), I won't complain either \\(unless I'm from Detroit\\).](https://preview.redd.it/fx1ebhmxwd371.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06730b56ca47298cd1347a8c090542c1e90eae96)\n\n[I think we've established hardware\\/handsets are a legacy business for Blackberry. Why do I talk about it? B\\/c Wall Street does, and WSB often falls prey to their fear-mongering. DON'T PAY ATTENTION. It's like Mitch Trubisky- yeah that ish was dope in 2015-2016, but we all know it's washed now and the only reason we keep talking about is because shillers want to use it to keep diverting from the real gold.](https://preview.redd.it/j0fszgu0xd371.png?width=896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4b2250478ab2cb6ad49956d4b2f4f89560fc56c)\n\n[I'm not going to hammer earnings to crazy... to actually say with strong conviction that you can accurately forecast that out YoY is bullshit, and anyone from Wall St telling you they can is likely doing the same thing. Never the less, we see a clear trend: great profitability growth when Blackberry pagers led the mobile handset market, awful declines from 2012-2018 as BB closed hardware operations and invested in software\\/cybersecurity ambitions, culminating in the mixed bag we've been seeing in 2018 and beyond. Wouldn't be surprised to see this earnings churn to continue until \\~2023-2025, after all, you have to invest\\/incur losses if you want long-term profitability. I'm going to stay watching the 3 primary components of BB's revenue growth for now.](https://preview.redd.it/voaefw43xd371.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71f9cc1c63d585f57e3b88e20803c7f0f3ab4d79)\n\n[I care about Cash Flow far more than net income. Yeah, it's nice to look profitable, but how much money is actually coming in to your company? We see... a slow pick-up after 2020 \\(\\*pinch me\\*\\), when BB's resurrection appears to have started. Even in its legacy days, Blackberry was seeing hella cash leave the company, which just underscores software is a more profitable business than hardware. 2021 projections indicate Cash Flow could increase at the largest YoY rate in Blackberry's history \\(albeit from it's near-zero base\\). Nevertheless, if revenue growth booms like I think it will, FCF metrics are gunna look pretty green in 2022+.](https://preview.redd.it/ja112d95xd371.png?width=1234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d56e1feaa214463cd5b3b518e9b1c6171368f65b)\n\n# My Strongest Convictions on BB\n\nWell apes, thanks for enduring my BB nut. Now time for you to swallow:\n\n* I don't believe BB is \"just a meme.\" To the tards that made fuckloads of money on BBBY, KOSS, SNDL, and even AMC (not GME, PM me if you want to debate what I would call GME) to an extent in these \"not-exactly-the-future\" businesses with high amounts of short interest- kudos to you, here's your \ud83d\udc51, King. But the tough truth is I'm skeptical that \"squeezing\" is always going to work. For starters, you think the hedgies are really that fucking stupid? I mean, come on, Chancellor/Emperor Ken Griffin had to extend Melvin $5B in credit, lather up Vlad, and testify in front of Congress. Don't exactly think continuous losses and Congressional subpoenas are exactly what the hedgies want either... I'm sure their risk management committee have been popping Addies daily since January to make sure they aren't overfuckingextended in one bet. \\*Cough\\* \\*Bill Hwang\\* Cough\\*\n* No, I truly believe Blackberry Ltd is the 2016 version of AMD in the 2021 cybersecurity market. Back then, AMD's legacy business was flailing, and the entire chip market was dominated by Intel. They went into the changing room, made themselves up, and reorganized. Capturing 1%, then 2%, then 3% of the market share seems so little nominally, but means so much for the top line, bottom line, and the share price when you go from 0 to 1. 1 to 10 may seem like a big jump, but it's launching from the ground (a baseline of 0) that is most lucrative- and that is *exactly where Blackberry (BB) sits right now*. Capturing 2% of the global cybersecurity market would send BB flying, and we'd be soaring back to $140. If BB is actually as innovative as I think, who knows?\n* Unfortunately, if you think this is a short squeeze, I'm sorry, get out. I actually kinda like seeing closes like today (plummeting down 15%), because we shake out the weak hands and I can buy more cheap shares. No one's forcing you to buy this stock, I just like it. Facts &amp; numbers don't lie either. Short interest is 9% on roughly 500M shares outstanding, so we would likely need Jay Powell, Cathie Wood, Elon, and Chamath to hop in if there was actually to be a \"squeeze\" overnight.\n* But to contradict myself somewhat, I also think June 2021 (right now) could be one of the most preferential entry points into BB ever. Data indicates 40% of the shares are owned by institutions (similar numbers to GME), indicating 60% is retail, many of them apes. The suits may scream \"overvalued reeeee,\" and they have a point, BB stock isn't exactly cheap. As it trades at roughly 8X forward sales, BB is valued as a fast growing company, but not beyond the likes of PLTR &amp; SNOW (yes different industries, but valuations that are multiple times higher) or competitors like Palo Alto Networks or Cisco. As a graduate student attempting to be not completely rarted with my limited capital, I love the risk-reward for BB, especially considering they report earnings on June 22. I suspect these numbers will come in far stronger than the St is saying, and at least they will start to lift future guidance in a significant way (both catalysts for a 50-100% move in BB IMHO). I guess we'll see how the financials reward BB's transition, but I am truly convinced this is the AMD of cybersecurity.\n* This last part is a mixed-bag (but suspicious if we dive deeper), and I'm sure a lot of apes will downvote me and possibly completely avoid BB with this knowledge, but I want to share facts since they are evidently so hard to find. We got the usual mutual funds (Vanguard, Fidelity, TD, etc) who own BB (roughly 25%) and two woke funds who invest in \"innovative trends\" own the other 15%. But data does indicate nasty little Ken (Citadel) reported buying 1.3M shares of BB in Q1. BB was heavily shorted pre-GME (like 30%+), and Citadel/gey bears almost definitely bought shares to cover. The question I'm wondering was did Citadel actually buy BB b/c they were so worried about a squeeze since it is a legitimate growth stock or b/c he shares my sentiments about its turnaround? Regardless, both seem like positive catalysts for the stock, and hopefully Ken answers my question.... oh wait...\n\n[Self-explanatory.](https://preview.redd.it/w33d8rdaxd371.png?width=1886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab406b459250bc6669c79e67c65c145f9b879709)\n\nObligatiory: BB to the moon.",
