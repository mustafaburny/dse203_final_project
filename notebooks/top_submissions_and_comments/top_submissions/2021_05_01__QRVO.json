        "selftext": "Goooooood Sunday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 3rd, 2021.\n\n# **More earnings, April\u2019s big jobs report and inflation worries could swing markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/more-earnings-aprils-big-jobs-report-and-inflation-worries-could-swing-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April\u2019s jobs report and a barrage of earnings news make for another busy week for markets, as the calendar rolls into May.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks notched solid gains in April, as REITs, consumer discretionary names and communications services companies outpaced the broader market, all more than 7% higher. However, April finished on a sour note, with stocks selling off on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSince November, there\u2019s been a 30% rally,\u201d said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office. He noted that historically the November to April period is historically the strongest for stocks. \u201cThere\u2019s the adage \u2018sell in May, go away.\u2019 It may be somewhat appropriate this year since we\u2019ve done so well in the last six months.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Big jobs report\n&gt; April\u2019s employment report is released Friday, and the market is expecting a big number.\n*****\n&gt; Economists say payrolls in April could easily reach 1 million, after 916,000 jobs were added in March. Estimates range from about 700,000 to a forecast of 2.1 million from Jefferies economists.\n*****\n&gt; According to Dow Jones, there is a consensus forecast of 978,000 among the economists it surveyed and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 5.8% form 6%.\n*****\n&gt; Fed speakers will also be important after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in the past week that the Fed is still looking for \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d in its goals for the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The chairman emphasized that the Fed is not close to tapering back its bond buying program, a surprise to some investors. Some bond market pros had expected the Fed to start discussing cutting back purchases at its June meeting and begin to reduce its $120 billion monthly bond buying by the end of the year or early next year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week is all about the jobs number, because as part of the Fed\u2019s path to \u2018substantial progress\u2019 on their two roles, we\u2019ll see how much further along that path they are next Friday\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. The Fed\u2019s mandate is to pursue full employment and a steady pace of Inflation, which it has targeted at 2%.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has expected a temporary period of high inflation which it expects to see subside later in the year though Boockvar and others say inflation could be hotter than the Fed expects. The core personal consumption expenditures price index jumped 0.36% in March, with the year-ago rate rising from 1.4% to 1.8%. It is expected to go even higher in April. Headline inflation in the consumer price index is expected to begin running at 3% or better when it is reported May 12.\n*****\n&gt; Just days after Powell\u2019s comments on tapering, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan Friday said the Fed should begin the discussion on paring back bond purchases because imbalances in financial markets and the economy is improving faster than expected.\n*****\n&gt; The market\u2019s focus on the Fed\u2019s bond program makes the jobs report even more important. If the Fed starts to taper back those asset purchases, it would then signal it would be on the path toward raising interest rates. Most economists do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates before 2023.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf this jobs number comes in super hot, it\u2019s going to make people up their estimate on when the Fed might taper,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is among Fed speakers in the coming week, but he is not expected to provide any new views when he participates in a National Community Reinvestment Coalition conference Monday afternoon. Kaplan speaks Tuesday and Thursday, and New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are also among Fed officials speaking in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings soar\n&gt; So far, a record 87% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beat earnings estimates, and earnings look to be growing by more than 46%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub upped his forecast Friday for the S&amp;P 500 based on strong earnings. \u201cWe are raising our 2021 S&amp;P 500 price target to 4600 from 4300, representing 9.2% upside from current levels, and 22.5% for the year,\u201d he wrote.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings are expected from a diverse group of companies, from General Motors to ViacomCBS. Pharma will be in the spotlight as vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna both report. Draftkings and Beyond Meat are also on the schedule.\n*****\n&gt; A host of travel related companies issue results, including Booking Holdings, Hilton Worldwide , Marriott Vacations, and Caesars Entertainment. Consumer brands, like Anheuser Busch Inbev and Estee Lauder also report, as do insurers including AIG, Allstate, and MetLife. (A calendar with some key earnings dates appears below.)\n*****\n&gt; Chang said the market has discounted a lot of the positive news already.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn spite of the really strong reports from the bellwether companies, you\u2019re seeing some of the names starting to peter out a little bit,\u201d said Chang. \u201cI think it\u2019s a sign that so much good news is discounted. I suspect the market is due for a breather. I think in the next couple of months, we\u2019re likely to see sideways movement. There\u2019s likely to be a pullback which will be healthy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 5.2% in April, finishing Friday at 4,181. It is now up 11.2% for the year so far. The Dow rose 2.7% in April, to 33,874, and the Nasdaq gained 5.4% in April, ending Friday at 13,962.\n*****\n&gt; Chang said he expects some of the \u201cboring\u201d blue chips that haven\u2019t participated as much in the rally to do better. Some of those names can be found in pharma, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Heading into the coming week, investors will be watching for words of wisdom from Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting Saturday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9wZQvOO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kGnKjBS.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xazpmUE.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ceFPlXO.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/N8zkbCl.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EXJdhi8.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/a3EftWo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OA6dm0N.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UOEq2t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/69XfINF.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hdAqJr1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IEzICwV.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/9nsqXUH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 and DJIA Up Last 9 Post-Election Year Mays\n\n&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $960,943 for November-April in 70 years compared to just $1,656 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $788,997 for November-April in 70 years compared to a gain of just $10,145 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we once called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up twelve times in the past twenty-three years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010.\n\n&gt; Post-election Year Mays rank near the top, registering average gains on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 of 1.3% and 1.7% respectively. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced in every post-election year May beginning in 1985. Russell 1000 has been up ten years straight in post-election year Mays.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/4c1485a3ca7e34234ba1f7666450bc23/abec686095f47da5-c9/s400x600/90a50e5d1712125c12d3f5af1efad8228681daa0.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Up Over 10% First Four Months \u2013 Preceded Flat May to late-October\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 was up 11.5% year-to-date. Provided these gains hold through the end of April, this year will be just the seventeenth time since 1950 that the S&amp;P 500 has finished the first four months of the year with a gain exceeding 10%. The best January to April span occurred in 1975, up 27.3% (S&amp;P 500 was in the early stages of a new bull market following the bear ending 10/3/1974 in which the S&amp;P 500 declined 48.2%). The next best year was, 1987 (most will remember what happened later that year) and the most recent year was 2019 (a solid year from beginning to end).\n\n&gt; In the above chart we have plotted all 17 previous years in which the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% January through the end of April. Along side for comparison is \u201cAll Years,\u201d \u201cPost-Election Years,\u201d and 2021 through yesterday. In the previous 17 years, gains tended to fizzle in early-May before gaining some additional ground from around mid-June to mid-July before once again stalling out till late September with more weakness lasting until late-October. On average, by late-October arrived, gains from the previous three months were given back and since the start of May S&amp;P 500 gained around 2.5% on average. You don\u2019t have to go away in May but considering the historically modest gains from early-May to late-October, it may not quite be worth sticking around.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ad49ec327ff1b942a31c993f0a0a82fe/79778de7b3df0abd-1c/s500x750/865ae39798a9e1d8450988b067a15e5a90a7c5bc.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Here Comes Sell In May\n\n&gt; \u201cThe sun was warm but the wind was chill. You know how it is with an April day. When the sun is out and the wind is still, you\u2019re one month on in the middle of May.\u201d American Poet Robert Frost\n\n&gt; One of the best known investment axioms is to \u201csell in May and go away.\u201d This is largely because the six months from May through October have historically been some of the weakest months of the year for stocks. As you can see below, the next six months have tended to be on the weak side.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the next six months have indeed been the worst six months of the year, up only 1.7% on average. To add insult to injury, we are leaving the six most bullish months of the year. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index is set to gain close to 30% during these most bullish six months, one of the best six-month gains ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are up more than 87% from the March lows, suggesting a well-deserved pullback during these troublesome months is quite possible,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut with an accommodative Fed, fiscal and monetary policy, along with an economy that is opening faster than nearly anyone expected, we\u2019d use any weakness as an opportunity to add to positions.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s the catch, isn\u2019t there always a catch? Stocks have actually been higher during these worst months of the year eight of the past ten years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blog-4.30.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # U.S. Economy Jumps Out of the Gate in 2021\n\n&gt; In what was initially expected to be one of the slower quarters of the year, the U.S. economy jumped out of the gates in 2021, with gross domestic product (GDP) growing 6.4% quarter over quarter. A faster than expected vaccination program, nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus\u2014including direct payments to consumers\u2014and faster than expected job growth helped fuel a surge in personal consumption\u2014the largest portion of GDP.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, personal consumption grew 10.7% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, the second highest level since the 1960\u2019s:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThe U.S. economy is off to a great start in 2021, and this should set the stage for solid growth in the remainder of the year as pent up demand continues to flow through the economy,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cMany areas of the country are still facing restrictions on activity, so we don\u2019t think growth will just be limited to the first quarter.\u201d\n\n&gt; However, the growth story in the first quarter wasn\u2019t solely about direct stimulus payments. While personal consumption has understandably gained a lot of attention, federal non-defense spending added the most to GDP in nearly 60 years, a segment of the economy unaffected by transfer payments like stimulus checks.\n\n&gt; Digging into the numbers even further, spending on services grew a modest 4.6%, which should accelerate in the second and third quarters as remaining restrictions are lifted in response to falling cases and rising vaccinations. As of April 28, the US is averaging around 2.5-3 million vaccines administered per day, which has helped over half the adult population receive at least one dose of the vaccine, while nearly 40% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n&gt; The U.S. vaccination program has helped pull the economy forward, but net trade was a modest drag on growth in the first quarter, where domestic growth pulled in imports at a faster pace than the recovery outside of the U.S. lifted exports. As the rest of the world gets better control of COVID-19, rebounding economic growth overseas should provide an additional tailwind for U.S. economy.\n\n&gt; We upgraded our forecast for U.S. GDP in our recent Weekly Market Commentary from 5\u20135.5% to 6.25\u20136.75%, and we expect to see the economy continue its pace in the second quarter as restrictions are lifted and activity normalizes.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Where Do President Biden\u2019s First 100 Days Stack Up Versus President Trump?\n\n&gt; President Biden\u2019s 100th day in office is tomorrow, on April 29. Hard to believe it has been 100 days already, but overall the economy continues to improve and stocks have done very well under our new President.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve heard the question many times: Where does the Biden rally rank? That is what we will look at today. The term \u201chundred days\u201d was first used on July 24, 1933, on the radio by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). He was discussing the 100-day session of the 73rd U.S. Congress, but over time this term has changed to refer to the first 100 days of a new president.\n\n&gt; Per Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist, \u201cPresident Biden has been quite kind for stocks, with the Dow up nearly 10%, which is on pace for the best first 100 days in office since FDR in the early 1930s. Then toss in the cherry on top that stocks had one of their greatest rallies ever from Election Day until the inauguration and it is clear that although maybe everyone might not like President Biden, but the stock market doesn\u2019t have many issues with him.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has averaged 4.3% the first 100 days of a new President, while it has been higher the first 100 days in office for five of the past six Presidents. In fact, President Biden\u2019s return currently ranks as the third best since 1900, with only Taft and Roosevelt better. Lastly, breaking it down by political party and the first 100 days under a Democratic President was much stronger, up 10.3% on average versus down 0.2% for a Republican President.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a chart we shared earlier this year that shows that stocks did amazingly well from Election Day until the inauguration under President Biden.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What can we glean from those first 100 days? Is there any pattern that might suggest how stocks will do during the rest of the time President Biden is in office? You can look for yourself below, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be any clue as to what might happen. President Eisenhower had a weak first 100 days, then a big rally over the remainder of his time in office. Conversely, President Taft saw a big rally during the first 100 days, only to have negative returns for the remainder of his time in office. In the end, fundamentals, valuations, and technicals drive long-term equity returns. The good news is only once since the Great Depression did that mean lower returns for the remainder of time in office after the first 100 days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28.-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Wild Data Close To Q1\n\n&gt; Today was quite the day for economic data, with two key releases from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We'll start with BEA data on personal income and spending in March.\n\n&gt; First, as shown below, the savings rate surged in the month, with households saving 27.6% of personal income net of taxes. That's a huge number, even by the standards of the elevated savings rates that we've seen over the course of the pandemic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The reason there was so much saving going on is that transfer payments rose by more than $300bn on the month, driven by the delivery of economic impact payments also known as \"stimulus checks\" or even shorter: \"stimmies.\"\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Incomes also rose thanks to rebounding labor market activity following winter storms in Texas during February and the longer-term trend of reopening across the economy. As shown, the 13.5% annualized growth of wage and salary income in the month was very strong. It was also helped along by wage growth, which we will discuss later on.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-3.png))**\n\n&gt; With spending surging thanks to stimulus checks and other factors, core personal consumption expenditure prices surged by the most MoM since 2009, over 4% annualized. The 4% move was in no small part due to the swing in activity from February to March, and isn't likely to be sustained, but it is a helpful indicator that prices may be more robust in this recovery than they were during the low inflation post-GFC period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-4.png))**\n\n&gt; For broad inflation that will concern the Fed, one factor that will be needed along with steadily rising prices is strong wage growth. The second big report today was Q1 wages in the BLS Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI does a better job of measuring wage growth than other series because it accounts for changes in the composition of employment over time. As shown in the chart below, Q3 saw the strongest sequential wage growth on record, with a 4.6% annualized advance in wages versus Q4. Some of that came from incentive-paid occupations, which benefit from bonuses and related payments, skewing the results. As shown in the chart, though, there was very strong wage growth even excluding incentive-paid occupations. Anecdotal reports of very tight labor markets amidst booming reopening demand got support from this release.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-5.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 30th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjA8Px0K-o))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 5.2.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aQ1EZJdcmc))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "Goooooood Sunday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 3rd, 2021.\n\n# **More earnings, April\u2019s big jobs report and inflation worries could swing markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/more-earnings-aprils-big-jobs-report-and-inflation-worries-could-swing-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April\u2019s jobs report and a barrage of earnings news make for another busy week for markets, as the calendar rolls into May.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks notched solid gains in April, as REITs, consumer discretionary names and communications services companies outpaced the broader market, all more than 7% higher. However, April finished on a sour note, with stocks selling off on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSince November, there\u2019s been a 30% rally,\u201d said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office. He noted that historically the November to April period is historically the strongest for stocks. \u201cThere\u2019s the adage \u2018sell in May, go away.\u2019 It may be somewhat appropriate this year since we\u2019ve done so well in the last six months.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Big jobs report\n&gt; April\u2019s employment report is released Friday, and the market is expecting a big number.\n*****\n&gt; Economists say payrolls in April could easily reach 1 million, after 916,000 jobs were added in March. Estimates range from about 700,000 to a forecast of 2.1 million from Jefferies economists.\n*****\n&gt; According to Dow Jones, there is a consensus forecast of 978,000 among the economists it surveyed and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 5.8% form 6%.\n*****\n&gt; Fed speakers will also be important after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in the past week that the Fed is still looking for \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d in its goals for the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The chairman emphasized that the Fed is not close to tapering back its bond buying program, a surprise to some investors. Some bond market pros had expected the Fed to start discussing cutting back purchases at its June meeting and begin to reduce its $120 billion monthly bond buying by the end of the year or early next year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week is all about the jobs number, because as part of the Fed\u2019s path to \u2018substantial progress\u2019 on their two roles, we\u2019ll see how much further along that path they are next Friday\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. The Fed\u2019s mandate is to pursue full employment and a steady pace of Inflation, which it has targeted at 2%.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has expected a temporary period of high inflation which it expects to see subside later in the year though Boockvar and others say inflation could be hotter than the Fed expects. The core personal consumption expenditures price index jumped 0.36% in March, with the year-ago rate rising from 1.4% to 1.8%. It is expected to go even higher in April. Headline inflation in the consumer price index is expected to begin running at 3% or better when it is reported May 12.\n*****\n&gt; Just days after Powell\u2019s comments on tapering, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan Friday said the Fed should begin the discussion on paring back bond purchases because imbalances in financial markets and the economy is improving faster than expected.\n*****\n&gt; The market\u2019s focus on the Fed\u2019s bond program makes the jobs report even more important. If the Fed starts to taper back those asset purchases, it would then signal it would be on the path toward raising interest rates. Most economists do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates before 2023.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf this jobs number comes in super hot, it\u2019s going to make people up their estimate on when the Fed might taper,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is among Fed speakers in the coming week, but he is not expected to provide any new views when he participates in a National Community Reinvestment Coalition conference Monday afternoon. Kaplan speaks Tuesday and Thursday, and New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are also among Fed officials speaking in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings soar\n&gt; So far, a record 87% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beat earnings estimates, and earnings look to be growing by more than 46%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub upped his forecast Friday for the S&amp;P 500 based on strong earnings. \u201cWe are raising our 2021 S&amp;P 500 price target to 4600 from 4300, representing 9.2% upside from current levels, and 22.5% for the year,\u201d he wrote.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings are expected from a diverse group of companies, from General Motors to ViacomCBS. Pharma will be in the spotlight as vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna both report. Draftkings and Beyond Meat are also on the schedule.\n*****\n&gt; A host of travel related companies issue results, including Booking Holdings, Hilton Worldwide , Marriott Vacations, and Caesars Entertainment. Consumer brands, like Anheuser Busch Inbev and Estee Lauder also report, as do insurers including AIG, Allstate, and MetLife.

To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $960,943 for November-April in 70 years compared to just $1,656 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $788,997 for November-April in 70 years compared to a gain of just $10,145 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we once called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up twelve times in the past twenty-three years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010.\n\n&gt; Post-election Year Mays rank near the top, registering average gains on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 of 1.3% and 1.7% respectively. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced in every post-election year May beginning in 1985. Russell 1000 has been up ten years straight in post-election year Mays.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/4c1485a3ca7e34234ba1f7666450bc23/abec686095f47da5-c9/s400x600/90a50e5d1712125c12d3f5af1efad8228681daa0.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Up Over 10% First Four Months \u2013 Preceded Flat May to late-October\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 was up 11.5% year-to-date. Provided these gains hold through the end of April, this year will be just the seventeenth time since 1950 that the S&amp;P 500 has finished the first four months of the year with a gain exceeding 10%. The best January to April span occurred in 1975, up 27.3% (S&amp;P 500 was in the early stages of a new bull market following the bear ending 10/3/1974 in which the S&amp;P 500 declined 48.2%). The next best year was, 1987 (most will remember what happened later that year) and the most recent year was 2019 (a solid year from beginning to end).\n\n&gt; In the above chart we have plotted all 17 previous years in which the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% January through the end of April. Along side for comparison is \u201cAll Years,\u201d \u201cPost-Election Years,\u201d and 2021 through yesterday. In the previous 17 years, gains tended to fizzle in early-May before gaining some additional ground from around mid-June to mid-July before once again stalling out till late September with more weakness lasting until late-October. On average, by late-October arrived, gains from the previous three months were given back and since the start of May S&amp;P 500 gained around 2.5% on average. You don\u2019t have to go away in May but considering the historically modest gains from early-May to late-October, it may not quite be worth sticking around.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ad49ec327ff1b942a31c993f0a0a82fe/79778de7b3df0abd-1c/s500x750/865ae39798a9e1d8450988b067a15e5a90a7c5bc.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Here Comes Sell In May\n\n&gt; \u201cThe sun was warm but the wind was chill. You know how it is with an April day. When the sun is out and the wind is still, you\u2019re one month on in the middle of May.\u201d American Poet Robert Frost\n\n&gt; One of the best known investment axioms is to \u201csell in May and go away.\u201d This is largely because the six months from May through October have historically been some of the weakest months of the year for stocks. As you can see below, the next six months have tended to be on the weak side.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the next six months have indeed been the worst six months of the year, up only 1.7% on average. To add insult to injury, we are leaving the six most bullish months of the year. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index is set to gain close to 30% during these most bullish six months, one of the best six-month gains ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are up more than 87% from the March lows, suggesting a well-deserved pullback during these troublesome months is quite possible,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut with an accommodative Fed, fiscal and monetary policy, along with an economy that is opening faster than nearly anyone expected, we\u2019d use any weakness as an opportunity to add to positions.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s the catch, isn\u2019t there always a catch? Stocks have actually been higher during these worst months of the year eight of the past ten years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blog-4.30.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # U.S. Economy Jumps Out of the Gate in 2021\n\n&gt; In what was initially expected to be one of the slower quarters of the year, the U.S. economy jumped out of the gates in 2021, with gross domestic product (GDP) growing 6.4% quarter over quarter. A faster than expected vaccination program, nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus\u2014including direct payments to consumers\u2014and faster than expected job growth helped fuel a surge in personal consumption\u2014the largest portion of GDP.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, personal consumption grew 10.7% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, the second highest level since the 1960\u2019s:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThe U.S. economy is off to a great start in 2021, and this should set the stage for solid growth in the remainder of the year as pent up demand continues to flow through the economy,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cMany areas of the country are still facing restrictions on activity, so we don\u2019t think growth will just be limited to the first quarter.\u201d\n\n&gt; However, the growth story in the first quarter wasn\u2019t solely about direct stimulus payments. While personal consumption has understandably gained a lot of attention, federal non-defense spending added the most to GDP in nearly 60 years, a segment of the economy unaffected by transfer payments like stimulus checks.\n\n&gt; Digging into the numbers even further, spending on services grew a modest 4.6%, which should accelerate in the second and third quarters as remaining restrictions are lifted in response to falling cases and rising vaccinations. As of April 28, the US is averaging around 2.5-3 million vaccines administered per day, which has helped over half the adult population receive at least one dose of the vaccine, while nearly 40% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n&gt; The U.S. vaccination program has helped pull the economy forward, but net trade was a modest drag on growth in the first quarter, where domestic growth pulled in imports at a faster pace than the recovery outside of the U.S. lifted exports. As the rest of the world gets better control of COVID-19, rebounding economic growth overseas should provide an additional tailwind for U.S. economy.\n\n&gt; We upgraded our forecast for U.S. GDP in our recent Weekly Market Commentary from 5\u20135.5% to 6.25\u20136.75%, and we expect to see the economy continue its pace in the second quarter as restrictions are lifted and activity normalizes.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Where Do President Biden\u2019s First 100 Days Stack Up Versus President Trump?\n\n&gt; President Biden\u2019s 100th day in office is tomorrow, on April 29. Hard to believe it has been 100 days already, but overall the economy continues to improve and stocks have done very well under our new President.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve heard the question many times: Where does the Biden rally rank? That is what we will look at today. The term \u201chundred days\u201d was first used on July 24, 1933, on the radio by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). He was discussing the 100-day session of the 73rd U.S. Congress, but over time this term has changed to refer to the first 100 days of a new president.\n\n&gt; Per Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist, \u201cPresident Biden has been quite kind for stocks, with the Dow up nearly 10%, which is on pace for the best first 100 days in office since FDR in the early 1930s. Then toss in the cherry on top that stocks had one of their greatest rallies ever from Election Day until the inauguration and it is clear that although maybe everyone might not like President Biden, but the stock market doesn\u2019t have many issues with him.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has averaged 4.3% the first 100 days of a new President, while it has been higher the first 100 days in office for five of the past six Presidents. In fact, President Biden\u2019s return currently ranks as the third best since 1900, with only Taft and Roosevelt better. Lastly, breaking it down by political party and the first 100 days under a Democratic President was much stronger, up 10.3% on average versus down 0.2% for a Republican President.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a chart we shared earlier this year that shows that stocks did amazingly well from Election Day until the inauguration under President Biden.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What can we glean from those first 100 days? Is there any pattern that might suggest how stocks will do during the rest of the time President Biden is in office? You can look for yourself below, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be any clue as to what might happen. President Eisenhower had a weak first 100 days, then a big rally over the remainder of his time in office. Conversely, President Taft saw a big rally during the first 100 days, only to have negative returns for the remainder of his time in office. In the end, fundamentals, valuations, and technicals drive long-term equity returns. The good news is only once since the Great Depression did that mean lower returns for the remainder of time in office after the first 100 days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28.-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Wild Data Close To Q1\n\n&gt; Today was quite the day for economic data, with two key releases from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We'll start with BEA data on personal income and spending in March.\n\n&gt; First, as shown below, the savings rate surged in the month, with households saving 27.6% of personal income net of taxes. That's a huge number, even by the standards of the elevated savings rates that we've seen over the course of the pandemic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The reason there was so much saving going on is that transfer payments rose by more than $300bn on the month, driven by the delivery of economic impact payments also known as \"stimulus checks\" or even shorter: \"stimmies.\"\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Incomes also rose thanks to rebounding labor market activity following winter storms in Texas during February and the longer-term trend of reopening across the economy. As shown, the 13.5% annualized growth of wage and salary income in the month was very strong. It was also helped along by wage growth, which we will discuss later on.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-3.png))**\n\n&gt; With spending surging thanks to stimulus checks and other factors, core personal consumption expenditure prices surged by the most MoM since 2009, over 4% annualized. The 4% move was in no small part due to the swing in activity from February to March, and isn't likely to be sustained, but it is a helpful indicator that prices may be more robust in this recovery than they were during the low inflation post-GFC period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-4.png))**\n\n&gt; For broad inflation that will concern the Fed, one factor that will be needed along with steadily rising prices is strong wage growth. The second big report today was Q1 wages in the BLS Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI does a better job of measuring wage growth than other series because it accounts for changes in the composition of employment over time. As shown in the chart below, Q3 saw the strongest sequential wage growth on record, with a 4.6% annualized advance in wages versus Q4. Some of that came from incentive-paid occupations, which benefit from bonuses and related payments, skewing the results. As shown in the chart, though, there was very strong wage growth even excluding incentive-paid occupations. Anecdotal reports of very tight labor markets amidst booming reopening demand got support from this release.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-5.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 30th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjA8Px0K-o))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 5.2.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aQ1EZJdcmc))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;
