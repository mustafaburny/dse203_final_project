        "selftext": "This is because i still see posts about PLTR sbc that are total crap. So here's a better more honest analysis of SBC and a look into the companies current prospects.\n\n\n\nFirstly regarding Palantir. Their leadership is incredible. 90% commercial growth YoY. 50% overall YoY growth and a guidance of 30% growth through 2025 that is totally sandbagged and going to get beaten easily next earnings. \n\nThey have 0$ in debt.  Zero fucking dollars in debt. \n\nRoughly 2.5 billion in cash including 50 million in gold because they're so diversified \n\nHundreds of millions in start up investments\n\n3.5 billion in remaining money coming in from contracts (meaning they could stop doing business and still pull in 3.5 billion first) \n\nStock based compensation has gone down significantly in last two quarters. \n\nStock based compensation is completely comparable to other companies in similar fields or in tech. \n\nIt's not just for their executives it's a fantastic way to incentivize all employees existing and future to stay with the company for the long run by granting shares. \n\nStock based compensation doesn't equal them selling shares. It means granting shares. You're equating it with mostly Alex Karp and a few other leaders doing PRE SCHEDULED tax sales of shares because he's as part of going public (he has almost 10% ownership) the government is taxing him as if going public means he owes taxes on billions of dollars that he ONLY has in shares. In order to cover this he and others sell shares on a pre determined schedule so they don't go to jail with the IRS.\n\n\nIt has nothing to do with their commitment to the company or their leadership or their faith in the future. If you had any idea what you were talking about you'd realize none of them have really changed their overall stake in the company which is basically what your post alleges is that they're just printing money and getting out dishonestly which couldn't be further from the truth\n\nThere is a really good seeking alpha article on this that goes into comparing them to other companies, I tried to link to it but apparently it's a reddit rule that you aren't allowed to so if you want an HONEST analysis not hype bear fud. Google it you'll find it instantly it's titled \n\nPalantir: The Truth About Its Stock-Based Comp\nWritten by : Business Quant\n\n\nNothing is uniquely negative about PLTRs stock based compensation and it's a very good long term tool for growing a company that has only been public for about a year so what can you really expect at such a stage. It's total dilution amounted to about 10% . Retail traders own 75% of this stock and have sold off well over 10% many times over the FUD from this shitty narrative. \n\n\n-\n-\n-\nHere's some general insight into the company \n\n\nThe company is NOT a 20 year company that has never been profitable. What they were doing 20 years ago for the government is barely comparable to the company today. Foundry (their flagship product for both commercial and even government partners) has basically only existed for about 2 years and has even undergone significant improvements even in the last years that will guarantee great margins and efficient delivery. They continually built the company under a growth model taking in revenue, hiring the BEST engineers ask anyone who studied coding and software in any large schools around the country between 2005-now these guys have always had a legendary reputation with engineers students would wear palantir t shirts and shit constantly because they were the place that was actually doing cutting edge software work. They always reinvested over and over growing the government side while working on perfecting their current new products for over a decade making Foundry and the apollo AI framework that now allows them to actually deploy Foundry cheaply. \n\n\n\nLets even take a look at recent earnings. Quarter prior international growth was 17% So at most recent quarter 28% international growth they posted a pretty excellent QoQ increase. It suggests growth is picking up everywhere. Also I think the fact that they've done immense hiring in the short term plays into both why SBC is being kept high and why some margins were less than Q1. Most of the hiring they've done started in Q2 and only really picked up steam into the middle of the year. Let's also realize that the hiring has been almost entirely focused on distribution employees so they're very clearly moving into much greater expectations and focus of sales than they ever have in the history of their company. Peter Thiel actually has incredibly long explanations of how he thinks the optimal way to build a software companywide is to give as little focus on distribution as possible for as long as possible. This year's hiring is a dramatic indication that they're moving to a new stage as a company. \n\nAlso the fact that their product keeps improving even quarter to quarter. They're constantly saying that they themselves are continually finding new ways and more importantly new industries that Foundry and Appllo can enter and be extremely useful. The perfect example of this was the exciting and very recent development of their meta constellation satellite work that they're now doing. \n\nI think the reason the stock jumped 10% on earnings and now a lot more since was a direct reaction to the evidence that there is no industry they aren't relevant in for software and they're definitely only at the beginning of entering many industries. \n\nRecent announcements like Foundry for builders or startups more accurately is another reason for the stocks rise because it was argued for a very long time that they would never be viable at offering their product to anything other than extremely large companies. Most importantly was that at the end of Q1 they announced that they were going to be offering Foundry for free as a way to get it into the hands of more companies it seemed very clear as investors to expect this as a short term damper on margins. The idea is that it would get their product into so many more hands that it would be worth it in the long term with a very obvious temporary effect on margins. The fact that client growth both US AND internationally is accelerating not decelerating points to the idea that their distribution network is at its beginning but it is working and I assert extremely high odds that client growth continues to accelerate for consecutive quarters for a long time. \n\nThey will easily do more than 400 million revenue at next quarters report easily beat guidance and the one benefit to where SBC has been is that it is very likely it decreases potentially even dramatically decreases. Their trajectory is very predictable currently and they are a company that eventually will be a necessity to use if businesses don't want to get out competed. One of their main benefits to their customer companies is increasing margins of customers by finding many inefficiencies so they're one of the few products that can increase your bottom line without making you do anything as a company. This means that even during economic downturn they will be strongly potentially even more in demand because companies will need ways to look better and show cash flow even when consumption declines for periods of time.\n\n\n\nIf you want to understand the history of the company or what they do they're basically a SaaS company (yes SaaS their margins are good enough and they're only going to improve as they focus more and more outside of government Gotham products) \n\nTheir software allows you to run your company through their platform and it keeps your data completely private. Meaning palantir doesn't see your data and mine information and neither does anyone else. You get better illustrations and representations of your companies affairs and it makes significant insights and determines ways to create better efficiency, heads up preemptive solutions before problems occur, and in many cases can bring so many data sets into play that you can learn things you didnt even know were possible. \n\nIf you want resources for this there are a number of testimonials from customers describing what Foundry does for them on Palantirs youtube\n\nYou can go search Tom Nashs video on SkyWise (which is Foundry for airbus). He has a couple of them really incredible deep dive\n\nYou can watch their most recent video about meta satellite constellations\n\nThey have partners within every industry. Research, academics, science, cancer, genomics, aerospace, literally every military branch, health care both insurance providers and health care providers like the NHS, also NIH, big oil companies like BP, big manufacturers like 3m, faurecia, Rio Tinto mining, John deere, big retailers like bass pro and others even larger, news media companies, robotics, AI, autonomous driving like wejo partnered with gm on that, electronic vehicle startups and even electronic flying vehicle start ups, now satellite companies and US Government satellite ownership even. Do you see where this is going? There's nothing they can't break into and they are what is going to be necessary to have a competitive edge which is why everyone is going to have to use them. \n\n\nWhich brings me to another point. Palantir doesn't have direct competition. They've explained this many times and anyone who says they are a snowflake competitor doesn't understand them as a company at all. Their competition is potential clients who choose to attempt to make an in house software to glean insights into their own data and structure it uniquely for their own needs. This is Palantirs biggest \"competition\" and they will crush it. That kind of work often takes years and is extremely expensive. Just the time that Palantir can save companies and the headaches of making all the mistakes that come with originally building a software like that makes Palantir worth it. \n\nThey have incredible partnerships with Amazon and IBM for new and important distribution channels for getting their products out and quickly and have stated many times that they can deploy their software completely remotely cutting out the old concern that they will never scale because they need forward deployed engineers to set up software. They still use those but I think it's heavily around massive clients and particularly US gov gotham products not Foundry as we now know it. \n\nSick of this ridiculous SBC destroying value garbage narrative. We'll see how much value is destroyed in a year when their stock explodes and you'll be wishing you didn't listen to the geniuses who thought they caught Palantir swindling everyone. Also all the people who didn't get swindled by the bear narratives this year are fucking happy as hell because most of them have at least doubled their positions over the last 6 months as the stock constantly traded in a holding pattern. \n\nLast point is its holding key resistance right now could easily break out in the short term towards 30$ or beyond. Don't say I didn't warn you. If it holds this 26$ mark and doesn't break down below it this month you'll never see PLTR under 24 dollars again and after next earnings I guarantee you'll never see it under 30$ again.",

        "selftext": "So if you look at a stock like Apple, 146.03 currently, what is the chance that this will be Apples ATH, and the stock will NEVER EVER grow higher than this? Exactly, it's basically zero. At some point on monday, the stock price will go at least to like 147 or sth., or if not monday, than in the next week/month or sth.\n\nSo there is zero chance of losing your money and you can cash out super fast if you buy like 1000 Stocks for 146.03 and sell them for 146.50, you just made 470 bucks, congratulations. You now repeat this with fairly stable stocks like IBM thousands of times and you are rich. Thank me later.\n\nOnly issue I could think of is trading costs but in said example, they should be much lower than the return.",

        "selftext": "So, there's a lot of confusion to $IRNT and I want to provide my perspective. I'm not a professional trader or anything like that.\n\n$IRNT rose based on a few important things. The company itself, Super 8-K Redemption, Option Chain activity, and Short Interest, as well as the traction it attracted.\n\nThe company: They're a Cyber Security Solutions enterprise. Their investment partners are Kleiner Perkins, CS Capital, and ForgePoint Capital. ([here](https://www.ironnet.com/company/about)) Their partners are Microsoft, AWS, CROWDSTRIKE, DomainTools, NUTANIX, Cortex XSoar, Paloalto, IBM Radar, Splunk, Splunk Soar, and SWIMLANE. ([Here](https://www.ironnet.com/company/partners/technology-partners)).\n\nQuick Summary for this quarter:\n\n* Solutions provider for cyber attacks, IronNet Cybersecurity (NYSE:IRNT)FQ2 revenue jumped 23% to $6.1M, subscription revenue grew to $5.8M vs. $5.3M last year.\n* Annual Recurring Revenue (or ARR): $24.1M vs. $19.5M prior.\n* Customer Count: 51 compared to 22 last year.\n* Operating loss of $17M compared to $14.2M.\n* Net loss: $17.2M compared to $14.3M.\n* Cash and cash equivalents: $14.1M.\n* **Outlook**: \u201cOur cloud-based subscription revenue -- which grew to 60% of product revenue in the first half of the year, a 65% year-over-year growth rate -- is a strong proof point for the business and underscores the fully recurring aspect of our financial model. Our cloud focus coupled with the large deal formation that we are seeing reflects IronNet\u2019s ease of deployment and increasing market recognition, which keeps us on pace to double ARR in the third quarter and meet our growth objectives for the full year.\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0James Gerber, CFO.\n* **FY Guidance**:\u00a0Revenue of $43M-45M;\u00a0ARR of $75M as of end of the fiscal year.\n* The stock has a market cap of $1.64B and has seen a jump in price of \\~19% over the last five trading days.\n* Recent bullish rating on the stock by contributor who writes, 'IronNet Is Extremely Undervalued At $20'\n* Previously (Sept. 14):\u00a0IronNet misses on revenue\n* Shares jump \\~14%\u00a0during pre-market hours.\n\nRegarding the [Super 8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-263381/), this has reduced the float to anywhere between 1.3M to 6M. Additional, [8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-272930/) before Super 8-K filing for those who like to read these.\n\nIt's looking like the float is realistically between 2.7M - 3.5M. Extremely low and the reason why it moves so easily. Looks like on Friday the shorts and MM won that battle. SI% actually increased on Friday and every Call Above $30.00 was OTM and was definitely mostly written by MM's.\n\nHere's the Option Chain for October 15th:\n\n[Option Activity for Oct. 15th](https://preview.redd.it/7vo75izu3jo71.png?width=884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bcdbf55d6840ea2e839d1a5412046c0e83fa15f)\n\nOption Chain Oct. 15th\n\nShort Interest was at 58% of the float before Friday, and the shorts have actually increased on Friday. Also, I can't access Ortex but I saw a video today of someone looking it up and saw the increase. Anyone with access to confirm on Monday would be great. Don't forget to use the shares amount shorted and divide by the current float.\n\nThe CTB% is above 500% this is from iborrowdesk. I know some will debate data etc, but even if you cut that in half thats still outrageous.\n\n[IBorrowDesk](https://preview.redd.it/nl2z9cjx3jo71.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c482c55c65282bd5a7d19c17e4b481c2a535e5e8)\n\nWhen the weeks start and more data is published this will need to be monitored.\n\nTechnicals:\n\nFirst off the Fibonacci Retracement (5 day, 5 Min):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fibonacci Retracement \\(5 day, 5 Min\\).](https://preview.redd.it/nb0he1zz3jo71.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7a9e390d34ff67e66d08e9571a06ef1c0fabd60)\n\nFibonacci Retracement (5 day, 5 Min).\n\nYou can also see my entry position with the green arrow. If this picture is too blurry, the support/resistances are $19.24, $27.11, $33.29, $37.63, $41.97, $47.34, and $56.06.\n\nStarted the line with the lowest point before September 14th. These are levels to check throughout the week and especially Monday and Tuesday. We're looking to support at $33.39. If we can maintain support above $27.11 and support strong resistance that'll be positive, if we break $27.11, the next resistance line is $19.24. This is were things can get weary as this can be a sign of a negative trend. Good thing is this company seems rock solid, and is being evaluated at &lt;$20.00. But keep this in mind.\n\nLooking to see if a Cup and Handle will form:\n\n[Cup and Handle Example](https://preview.redd.it/gbv44fw24jo71.png?width=834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=823caf5853fd090c12099c1893b43b063a39ff2c)\n\nCup and Handle Example\n\nMACD:\n\n[MACD](https://preview.redd.it/y0zdgl754jo71.png?width=1911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37fb91c717cfe898eed6ca9cbee796cbed8d59d4)\n\nMACD\n\nRSI:\n\n[RSI: \\(Close,5\\) - $45.32, Oversold @ below $30.00, Overbought above $70.15, per RSI, 5 Day.](https://preview.redd.it/v5i8gug74jo71.png?width=1883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d97db747278fb821a8b671afe84cea202e05894e)\n\nRSI: (Close,5) - $45.32, Oversold @ below $30.00, Overbought above $70.15, per RSI, 5 Day.\n\nThis is also a stock that is trending heavily, so, technicals can't be completely relied on. Only next week will determine that.\n\nGoogle Trends:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[7 Day Trend, Friday is still highly trending, the flat line is beacause of the weekend.](https://preview.redd.it/ad2upoca4jo71.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfa2a677644ee0e7d378f8a4af5bcc01aad9cb79)\n\n7 Day Trend, Friday is still highly trending, the flat line is beacause of the weekend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[30 Day Trend](https://preview.redd.it/dcjxb0cc4jo71.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d00ba95bfb1c9aa6e79a0eb1c3c33bea0a41a9d0)\n\n30 Day Trend\n\nWith this stock closing at $30, if we test support we can very much expect bullish sentiments. If over the next few days support isn't being tested, then supports become resistance.\n\nThis stock is highly shorted, has a very large ITM Option Activity, very small float, and a high CTB%.\n\nI think there's a lot that can come out of this stock, but also if the interest isn't there then probably not. Thing about this stock though is retail owns and can own the float until any PIPE lock ups expire.\n\nThat's something else that will be important to follow are the SEC filings for the lock ups.\n\nOverall, this seems to be a solid company with a lot of growth up ahead.\n\n\"Its annual recurring revenue also noted a year-over-year growth in the recent quarter to **$24.1 million**. For the full financial year, IronNet now forecasts $75 million of ARR on up to $45 million in revenue.\" As of 3 days ago.\n\nI'm not a professional trader what's so ever, I ordered Wendy's for supper. I have no idea where this could go, it really depends on a variety of factors but it's worth watching going into next week and October.",

Just the time that Palantir can save companies and the headaches of making all the mistakes that come with originally building a software like that makes Palantir worth it. \n\nThey have incredible partnerships with Amazon and IBM for new and important distribution channels for getting their products out and quickly and have stated many times that they can deploy their software completely remotely cutting out the old concern that they will never scale because they need forward deployed engineers to set up software. They still use those but I think it's heavily around massive clients and particularly US gov gotham products not Foundry as we now know it. \n\nSick of this ridiculous SBC destroying value garbage narrative. We'll see how much value is destroyed in a year when their stock explodes and you'll be wishing you didn't listen to the geniuses who thought they caught Palantir swindling everyone. Also all the people who didn't get swindled by the bear narratives this year are fucking happy as hell because most of them have at least doubled their positions over the last 6 months as the stock constantly traded in a holding pattern. \n\nLast point is its holding key resistance right now could easily break out in the short term towards 30$ or beyond. Don't say I didn't warn you. If it holds this 26$ mark and doesn't break down below it this month you'll never see PLTR under 24 dollars again and after next earnings I guarantee you'll never see it under 30$ again.",

chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

In addition to producing the **first and only quantum computer available via the cloud on both Amazon Braket and Microsoft Azure,** IonQ has defined what it believes to be the best path forward to scaling quantum computing power. By 2023, IonQ plans to develop modular quantum computers small enough to be networked together, which could pave the way for broad quantum advantage by 2025.

He led RSI ($19+ now) and GENI ($19+ now), which are both revered as successful SPACs compared to the many flops in the space. It looks like Niccolo is at it again with a SPAC that is ready to outperform in an oversubscribed round.\n\n&gt;\u201cThis was the easiest PIPE to raise of our career,\u201d de Masi said. \u201cHarry \\[dMY Chairman You\\] and I have done five SPACs between us. **This PIPE was the most oversubscribed so far. We weren\u2019t able to give everyone what they wanted. Because demand was high, some companies placed orders for a lot more than we were able to provide to them.**\u201d  [SRC](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2021/03/23/ionq-takes-quantum-computing-public-with-a-2-billion-deal/)\n\n# Bullish Indicators (Warrants and Options)\n\nWarrants were trading at $3.00+ for past few weeks, despite the common stocks of DMYI being at the floor at $10.00. **This signals bullish in the next 5 years that warrants are exercisable, as many traditional SPACs have their warrants under $2.00 -- even when the underlying commons are above $11/12.** \n\nSimilarly, I noticed a lot of option purchases over the next few months, specifically calls. There was a major imbalance to the cost of calls compared to puts. $15 strike calls (+50% upside) had higher premiums than $7.50 puts (25% downside) which shows bullish engulfment. Traditionally, the IV should have a $7.50 put similar to a $12.50 call since they indicate same price movement (+/- 25%). **Clearly, a lot of demand for these calls, as we have seen on Friday with DYMI move up and large purchases of Oct 15 calls.**\n\n# Quantum Space Growth and Sympathy Plays\n\nThere is no denying that quantum will be huge and play a big role in development of many existing Fortune 500 companies. Take, for example, ARQQ which just de-spacc'd last month. Yeah, it went to $30+ (granted it also is short float). \n\nOther recent Reddit Threads on this Topic:\n\n[Observations on DMYI Pipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/pt9810/some_observations_on_dmyiionq_pipe/)\n\n[DMYI - IONQ - the one and only first MOVER in this quantum revolution, beating GOOGLE and IBM by a huge mile!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/pq6ayj/dmyi_ionq_the_one_and_only_first_mover_in_this/)\n\n[Goldman Sachs, QC Ware and IonQ Demonstrate Quantum Algorithms Proof-of-Concept $DMYI](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/pshh1w/goldman_sachs_qc_ware_and_ionq_demonstrate/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, this is for educational purposes -- purchases are at your own risk.***\n\n***Disclosure: Long 3500 shares of DMYI with a mix of bullish calls and covered calls.***",

Bb\n\nTLDR: bb has more exposure and better tech in regards to RTOS in not just the automotive sector but also in industrial. Ivy could revolutionize cars and monetize car data exponentially. Cyber security is as good as crwd, according to real world hacking testing done by SE labs. Patent sale finalization 80% probability done this quarter- rumored to be 1B+ and 7 year trailing while retaining rights to use patents.\n\n***this DD will be a work in progress and will be updated as much as I can***\nLet\u2019s start with QNX and IVY.\n***QNX***\nQNX is a non-Linux based microkernel RtOs. Let\u2019s break that down piece by piece: non-linux/microkernel- Linux by design is a monolithic kernel that runs all operating system components in kernel space; it includes all device drivers, file management, and networking and graphics stacks. Only user applications run in user space. Although a monolithic design protects a kernel from errant user code, it doesn\u2019t protect it from errant kernel code. A single programming error (or successful exploit) in a file system, protocol stack or driver can crash a monolithic operating system. January 2020, the Linux kernel had around 27.8 million lines of code in its Git repository; with about 100 thousand lines of code the QNX Neutrino RTOS is 99.7% smaller. Smaller foot print= less vulnerability.\nA microkernel operating system embodies a fundamental innovation in the delivery of OS functionality: modularity. The tiny kernel is a side effect. With a microkernel OS, the microkernel works with a team of optional cooperating processes that provide higher-level OS functionality. Critically, unlike with a monolithic kernel, these processes run in user space; that is, outside privileged kernel space.  A microkernel OS like the QNX Neutrino RTOS encapsulates each application and OS service in its own isolated process space. The microkernel protects and allocates memory, and gives drivers and other OS services only the minimum privileges they need to perform their functions. \n***RTOS vs OS***\n\nA Real-time Operating System (RTOS) is an OS for devices and systems that need to react quickly to a trigger. In the case of a software fail-safe, for instance, an RTOS would pre-empt lower priority processes to take care of the higher-priority task. The LiDAR and video imaging that autonomous vehicles use to drive the car down a highway without straying outside the lines or hitting anything is very compute-intensive. It makes sense that a complex system with life-safety responsibilities might have an RTOS so that a processor can make a quick decision. On the other hand, an OS can be detrimental if it\u2019s not really needed, and yet necessary if the system has a processor that must be interrupted so it can react to high priority tasks. Traditional MCUs are not going to run several threads simultaneously and are not going to have sophisticated interrupt capabilities. A while ago, the embedded world was mostly populated by MCUs due to the high price of performance computing and the fact that simple control loops were all that was needed. LINUX based car OS\u2019s are just that, operating systems that lack in priority management and interrupts.\n***IVY***\nQNX, but ***cloud connected***. \u201cBlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.\u201d\nSo all that sensor data flowing through qnx is or can be valuable both to the OEM\u2019s and to third party app developers. From a user stand point, imagine at App Store for your car that you can download cool shit from. You know how Tesla\u2019s can make your car fart? Imagine that\u2026 but not having to pay for a tsla. Or an app that allows you to make payments for tolls, gas, food, etc from your car([car payments](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-ivy-to-provide-secure-vehicle-based-payments). \nFrom an OEM standpoint, the sensor data alone is a gold mine. Being able to track real world, real time conditions of their vehicles could/should streamline production, recalls, and r&amp;d. The potential for a cloud-base RTOS is infinite.\nBest part about IVY? ***SUBSCRIPTION BASED***\nIf IVY gains the same amount of vehicles as QNX and the annual subscription per car is say 10 bucks. Annual gross would be 1.95 billion. At the same ratios that would put the stock roughly at 2x current levels.\n\nCompetitors for QNX/IVY- doesn\u2019t really exist yet.

I won\u2019t talk about the higher end rumors because even i(a dude who unironically invested in GNUS)\n\n\n\n\nSome accolades :\n-Bb has secured design wins with 24 out of the top 25 EV manufacturers in the world, representing 82% of global EV volumes. An increase from 23 from last quarter. The final hold out, while not being named- being tsla.\n-SE labs conducted breach testing using \u201creal world hacker techniques\u201d with a 0 penetration result.

The resulting product is a potent oxidizing agent that is effective against ALL organic odorous compounds. \n\nPartnering with Ikigai Holdings LLC (Jordan Stanley, Jane Pak) \u2013 \r\n\n[This is Jordan Stanley](https://stanleymarketingworks.com/drtv-work.php) - this is Jordan Stanley\r\n\nJordan Stanley LinkedIn: \r\n\u201cIKIGAI Holdings (IKIGAI), a Nevada Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a consumer brand developer of \"Essential\" and \"Everyday\" products that are designed to scale to over $100,000,000 USD in annual sales per product.\n\n\" Over the following 10 years, I earned the reputation of an undisputed leader in Direct Response TV, producing such well-known campaigns as Billy Mays\u2019 OxiClean, Procter&amp; Gamble\u2019s Tide, Febreze, and Downy brands. \"\n\n\"Out of 45,000 commercials in the Procter &amp; Gamble database dating back over 60 years, the commercials I have written, directed and produced have achieved \"highest-scoring, best-performing commercials\" for Downy, Febreze, Dryel, Ivory Snow laundry products and have the distinction of being the \"#1 best-performing 2-minute spot\". I have the distinction of having 2 spots in the top 10 as measured by ASI/Ipsos. Using my method, about $3 Billion of revenue has been generated to date.\u201d\r\n\nJane Pak, Co-Founder of Ikigai Holdings, offered us this quote: \"Creating a mass-market brand begins with finding superior products with unbeatable claims. Our research validated that the current leading odor eliminating products are inferior to the CupriDyne formula and we're thrilled to have the opportunity to disrupt the consumer odor elimination category with such a compelling offer.\"\n  \nThis is a huge moneymaker, and having Ikigai Holdings involved is huge. \n\nNext catalyst - \n\nAOS Partnership - \nWhat is AOS -  \u00a0Advanced Oxidation System (AOS) can remove micropollutants that are an emerging concern to the water treatment industry. Given that micropollutants are bioactive and persistent contaminants that are not removed by traditional wastewater treatment methods, AOS has the potential to fill an important niche treatment gap with growing demand: effective and cost-efficient removal of micropollutants in wastewater treatment.\n\n\u201cWe have signed a \"memorandum of understanding\" with Aquaco Resources, Inc., to sell water treatment equipment and provide engineering solutions for its customers. Founded by Pat McEntee, a former executive at Oracle, IBM, and ABC/Disney, Aquaco is dedicated to delivering best-of-class technical solutions to manage the water needs of agriculture and food processing industry clients. Its marketing strategy involves developing strategic alliances with leading universities, cities, industry associations, researchers and multiple technology and service companies to deliver modern, long-term, practical solutions for the issues of water scarcity, water quality, delivery and reuse which are crucial to every agriculture producer in California. Aquaco will also offer its customers flexible long-term financing options and dedicated local services to ensure customers' water security into an uncertain future.\r\n\nAquaco is drafting a series of agreements that would ensure BioLargo and its engineers an important role in its operations. Aquaco anticipates that once the venture is operational, it will expand nationally and at capacity, its goal is to generate revenues in excess of $100 million annually after at least a 4-5 year ramp-up period.\u201d\r\n\nThis is huge for BLGO and one of their cornerstone technologies. Clean water is a huge problem in the world right now and BLGO has a tech that puts others to shame while also creating ZERO waste. BLGO is all about a better healthier earth, they back it up with money making earth helping tech. \n\nThird and final catalyst -  if you guys made it here I very much appreciate you for taking the time to read everything. \n\nClyra deal - \nWhat is Clyra? Clyra Medical Technologies, founded on our mission of \u201cMakes Lives Better\u201d, is a healthcare company that develops and\u00a0commercializes products designed to safely treat wound and skin infections and promote wound healing, while reducing the need for antibiotics.\n\nClyra: \r\n\nClyra Medical: \"Finally, our subsidiary Clyra Medical Technologies, which is commercializing medical products based on our patented technologies pursuant to a license agreement, recently launched a new product, Bioclynse, the first efficacious, safe, and long-acting wound irrigation solution that can be used throughout the entire surgical procedure, with no need to rinse out. Clyra has recently landed its first repeat orders from hospitals using the product, and Clyra management is excited about its future. Help spread the word about this great product with medical professionals, as we believe this product and products stemming from it have the potential to improve best practices in surgeries into the future. Clyra is organizing resources and relationships to expand its marketing and sales efforts for this great product.\"\n\nThis is FDA 510k - A 510(K) is a premarket submission made to FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device (section 513(i)(1)(A) FD&amp;C Act) that is not subject to premarket approval.\n\nHospitals are already buying it....  anyone familiar with what this tech is accomplishing understand the potential here. CTXR is doing something similar with catheters only and check their price.  (I'm not saying they are both doing the same thing but it's to give you guys a general idea of how undervalued BLGO is right now. ) \n\nIn closing - \n\n$BLGO is at .1888 cents as of closing today, this is criminally undervalued with everything they have going on. DYOR!!!! Check my history to see the last penny play I posted, it's already moving. BLGO is already starting to do the same, up 2% since the news broke.",

strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range.

        "selftext": "Smooth Brains,\n\nNo short-squeeze/gamma-squeeze thesis here. This is solely an undervalued stock that is in the midst of transformation. Rackspace Technologies (RXT), is what we like to call a cloud managed service provider (MSP). They essentially partner with corporations and help them with their migration / shift to the cloud via recurring, multi-year contracts (revenue visibility). In addition to cloud services provided, they also offer a multitude of other services such as privacy and data protection services, building out managed applications, etc. The business recently IPOd after being bought-out by Apollo, so there is a large amount of leverage on the business, but the cash flow of the business is robust and should allow Rackspace to paydown debt and further drive equity value for shareholders. The business currently is trading around $15, off from a peak of the upper-$20s. It traded down due to lumpiness in gross margin as the business is sunsetting certain products and as they win new clients, the margin falls off as the revenues are recognized over multi-year periods. The business is trading at around \\~9x EBITDA, which is well below where other managed-service providers trade in the market. Especially for a business with a TAM of $400B+. Gross Margin should bottom out at around 31%, vs. the historical 32 - 33% (which was the reason for a large sell-off in the stock prior), largely because of the pressures from public cloud transition (multicloud mix transitioning towards public cloud coupled with the decline in the OpenStack Business)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome quick and dirty highlights for everyone:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Rackspace is uniquely positioned in the market, having built a culture around strong support for its customer base. Only Rackspace now offers customers the ability to deploy workloads and managed applications in multicloud environments more efficiently. Via proprietary technology, tools, and AI, Rackspace can host and manage IT workloads for customers far more efficiently than those customers can themselves, while offering scale advantages in hosted applications.\n\n2) TAM - total market is growing at 8-10% per year, and should reach over $520B by 2023. Rackspace will participate in cloud adoption and deployments, driving the need for Rackspace's services and will be able to further penetrate the market as it builds its sales and marketing efforts\n\n3) Bookings momentum growth supports accelerating revenue growth coupled with improving FCF generation and profitability\n\n4) Partners with all major cloud provides (AWS, Azure, IBM, VMware)\n\nTransactions that show how undervalued the business is:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eeayczv1sbn71.png?width=412&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9592f1bdd805c126f7cd8191865eb5377a2de68d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Adoption is just beginning](https://preview.redd.it/7dzs4iaesbn71.png?width=492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08dd5b347762bc5d084abd4c59d7e2f5f4fb824c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Re-positioned of the business driving strong bookings and less capital intensity](https://preview.redd.it/n734gljksbn71.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5167e80acfd06122b81966ac8a428f3f4fb5e609)",

        "selftext": "This is because I continue to see posts made about PLTR sbc that are total crap. So here's a better more honest analysis of SBC and a look into the companies current prospects.\n\n\n\nFirstly regarding Palantir. Their leadership is incredible. 90% commercial growth YoY. 50% overall YoY growth and a guidance of 30% growth through 2025 that is totally sandbagged and going to get beaten easily next earnings. \n\nThey have 0$ in debt.  Zero fucking dollars in debt. \n\nRoughly 2.5 billion in cash including 50 million in gold because they're so diversified \n\nHundreds of millions in start up investments\n\n3.5 billion in remaining money coming in from contracts (meaning they could stop doing business and still pull in 3.5 billion first) \n\nStock based compensation has gone down significantly in last two quarters. \n\nStock based compensation is completely comparable to other companies in similar fields or in tech. \n\nIt's not just for their executives it's a fantastic way to incentivize all employees existing and future to stay with the company for the long run by granting shares. \n\nStock based compensation doesn't equal them selling shares. It means granting shares. You're equating it with mostly Alex Karp and a few other leaders doing PRE SCHEDULED tax sales of shares because he's as part of going public (he has almost 10% ownership) the government is taxing him as if going public means he owes taxes on billions of dollars that he ONLY has in shares. In order to cover this he and others sell shares on a pre determined schedule so they don't go to jail with the IRS.\n\n\nIt has nothing to do with their commitment to the company or their leadership or their faith in the future. If you had any idea what you were talking about you'd realize none of them have really changed their overall stake in the company which is basically what your post alleges is that they're just printing money and getting out dishonestly which couldn't be further from the truth. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4441572-palantir-the-truth-about-its-stock-based-comp\n\nHere's one HONEST analysis not hype bear fud. \n\n\nNothing is uniquely negative about PLTRs stock based compensation and it's a very good long term tool for growing a company that has only been public for about a year so what can you really expect at such a stage. It's total dilution amounted to about 10% . Retail traders own 75% of this stock and have sold off well over 10% many times over the FUD from this shitty narrative. \n\n\n-\n-\n-\nHere's some general insight into the company \n\n\nThe company is NOT a 20 year company that has never been profitable. What they were doing 20 years ago for the government is barely comparable to the company today. Foundry (their flagship product for both commercial and even government partners) has basically only existed for about 2 years and has even undergone significant improvements even in the last years that will guarantee great margins and efficient delivery. They continually built the company under a growth model taking in revenue, hiring the BEST engineers ask anyone who studied coding and software in any large schools around the country between 2005-now these guys have always had a legendary reputation with engineers students would wear palantir t shirts and shit constantly because they were the place that was actually doing cutting edge software work. They always reinvested over and over growing the government side while working on perfecting their current new products for over a decade making Foundry and the apollo AI framework that now allows them to actually deploy Foundry cheaply. \n\n\n\nLets even take a look at recent earnings. Quarter prior international growth was 17% So at most recent quarter 28% international growth they posted a pretty excellent QoQ increase. It suggests growth is picking up everywhere. Also I think the fact that they've done immense hiring in the short term plays into both why SBC is being kept high and why some margins were less than Q1. Most of the hiring they've done started in Q2 and only really picked up steam into the middle of the year. Let's also realize that the hiring has been almost entirely focused on distribution employees so they're very clearly moving into much greater expectations and focus of sales than they ever have in the history of their company. Peter Thiel actually has incredibly long explanations of how he thinks the optimal way to build a software companywide is to give as little focus on distribution as possible for as long as possible. This year's hiring is a dramatic indication that they're moving to a new stage as a company. \n\nAlso the fact that their product keeps improving even quarter to quarter. They're constantly saying that they themselves are continually finding new ways and more importantly new industries that Foundry and Appllo can enter and be extremely useful. The perfect example of this was the exciting and very recent development of their meta constellation satellite work that they're now doing. \n\nI think the reason the stock jumped 10% on earnings and now a lot more since was a direct reaction to the evidence that there is no industry they aren't relevant in for software and they're definitely only at the beginning of entering many industries. \n\nRecent announcements like Foundry for builders or startups more accurately is another reason for the stocks rise because it was argued for a very long time that they would never be viable at offering their product to anything other than extremely large companies. Most importantly was that at the end of Q1 they announced that they were going to be offering Foundry for free as a way to get it into the hands of more companies it seemed very clear as investors to expect this as a short term damper on margins. The idea is that it would get their product into so many more hands that it would be worth it in the long term with a very obvious temporary effect on margins. The fact that client growth both US AND internationally is accelerating not decelerating points to the idea that their distribution network is at its beginning but it is working and I assert extremely high odds that client growth continues to accelerate for consecutive quarters for a long time. \n\nThey will easily do more than 400 million revenue at next quarters report easily beat guidance and the one benefit to where SBC has been is that it is very likely it decreases potentially even dramatically decreases. Their trajectory is very predictable currently and they are a company that eventually will be a necessity to use if businesses don't want to get out competed. One of their main benefits to their customer companies is increasing margins of customers by finding many inefficiencies so they're one of the few products that can increase your bottom line without making you do anything as a company. This means that even during economic downturn they will be strongly potentially even more in demand because companies will need ways to look better and show cash flow even when consumption declines for periods of time.\n\n\n\nIf you want to understand the history of the company or what they do they're basically a SaaS company (yes SaaS their margins are good enough and they're only going to improve as they focus more and more outside of government Gotham products) \n\nTheir software allows you to run your company through their platform and it keeps your data completely private. Meaning palantir doesn't see your data and mine information and neither does anyone else. You get better illustrations and representations of your companies affairs and it makes significant insights and determines ways to create better efficiency, heads up preemptive solutions before problems occur, and in many cases can bring so many data sets into play that you can learn things you didnt even know were possible. \n\nIf you want resources for this there are a number of testimonials from customers describing what Foundry does for them on Palantirs youtube\n\nYou can go search Tom Nashs video on SkyWise (which is Foundry for airbus). He has a couple of them really incredible deep dive\n\nYou can watch their most recent video about meta satellite constellations\n\nThey have partners within every industry. Research, academics, science, cancer, genomics, aerospace, literally every military branch, health care both insurance providers and health care providers like the NHS, also NIH, big oil companies like BP, big manufacturers like 3m, faurecia, Rio Tinto mining, John deere, big retailers like bass pro and others even larger, news media companies, robotics, AI, autonomous driving like wejo partnered with gm on that, electronic vehicle startups and even electronic flying vehicle start ups, now satellite companies and US Government satellite ownership even. Do you see where this is going? There's nothing they can't break into and they are what is going to be necessary to have a competitive edge which is why everyone is going to have to use them. \n\n\nWhich brings me to another point. Palantir doesn't have direct competition. They've explained this many times and anyone who says they are a snowflake competitor doesn't understand them as a company at all. Their competition is potential clients who choose to attempt to make an in house software to glean insights into their own data and structure it uniquely for their own needs. This is Palantirs biggest \"competition\" and they will crush it. That kind of work often takes years and is extremely expensive. Just the time that Palantir can save companies and the headaches of making all the mistakes that come with originally building a software like that makes Palantir worth it. \n\nThey have incredible partnerships with Amazon and IBM for new and important distribution channels for getting their products out and quickly and have stated many times that they can deploy their software completely remotely cutting out the old concern that they will never scale because they need forward deployed engineers to set up software. They still use those but I think it's heavily around massive clients and particularly US gov gotham products not Foundry as we now know it. \n\nSick of this ridiculous SBC destroying value garbage narrative. We'll see how much value is destroyed in a year when their stock explodes and you'll be wishing you didn't listen to the geniuses who thought they caught Palantir swindling everyone. Also all the people who didn't get swindled by the bear narratives this year are fucking happy as hell because most of them have at least doubled their positions over the last 6 months as the stock constantly traded in a holding pattern. \n\nLast point is its holding key resistance right now could easily break out in the short term towards 30$ or beyond. Don't say I didn't warn you. If it holds this 26$ mark and doesn't break down below it this month you'll never see PLTR under 24 dollars again and after next earnings I guarantee you'll never see it under 30$ again.",

        "selftext": "Aloha gentletards, I\u2019m here to tell you about a little 100 banger. Bb\n\nTLDR: bb has more exposure and better tech in regards to RTOS in not just the automotive sector but also in industrial. Ivy could revolutionize cars and monetize car data exponentially. Cyber security is as good as crwd, according to real world hacking testing done by SE labs. Patent sale finalization 80% probability done this quarter- rumored to be 1B+ and 7 year trailing while retaining rights to use patents.\n\n***this DD will be a work in progress and will be updated as much as I can***\nLet\u2019s start with QNX and IVY.\n***QNX***\nQNX is a non-Linux based microkernel RtOs. Let\u2019s break that down piece by piece: non-linux/microkernel- Linux by design is a monolithic kernel that runs all operating system components in kernel space; it includes all device drivers, file management, and networking and graphics stacks. Only user applications run in user space. Although a monolithic design protects a kernel from errant user code, it doesn\u2019t protect it from errant kernel code. A single programming error (or successful exploit) in a file system, protocol stack or driver can crash a monolithic operating system. January 2020, the Linux kernel had around 27.8 million lines of code in its Git repository; with about 100 thousand lines of code the QNX Neutrino RTOS is 99.7% smaller. Smaller foot print= less vulnerability.\nA microkernel operating system embodies a fundamental innovation in the delivery of OS functionality: modularity. The tiny kernel is a side effect. With a microkernel OS, the microkernel works with a team of optional cooperating processes that provide higher-level OS functionality. Critically, unlike with a monolithic kernel, these processes run in user space; that is, outside privileged kernel space.  A microkernel OS like the QNX Neutrino RTOS encapsulates each application and OS service in its own isolated process space. The microkernel protects and allocates memory, and gives drivers and other OS services only the minimum privileges they need to perform their functions. \n***RTOS vs OS***\n\nA Real-time Operating System (RTOS) is an OS for devices and systems that need to react quickly to a trigger. In the case of a software fail-safe, for instance, an RTOS would pre-empt lower priority processes to take care of the higher-priority task. The LiDAR and video imaging that autonomous vehicles use to drive the car down a highway without straying outside the lines or hitting anything is very compute-intensive. It makes sense that a complex system with life-safety responsibilities might have an RTOS so that a processor can make a quick decision. On the other hand, an OS can be detrimental if it\u2019s not really needed, and yet necessary if the system has a processor that must be interrupted so it can react to high priority tasks. Traditional MCUs are not going to run several threads simultaneously and are not going to have sophisticated interrupt capabilities. A while ago, the embedded world was mostly populated by MCUs due to the high price of performance computing and the fact that simple control loops were all that was needed. LINUX based car OS\u2019s are just that, operating systems that lack in priority management and interrupts.\n***IVY***\nQNX, but ***cloud connected***. \u201cBlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.\u201d\nSo all that sensor data flowing through qnx is or can be valuable both to the OEM\u2019s and to third party app developers. From a user stand point, imagine at App Store for your car that you can download cool shit from. You know how Tesla\u2019s can make your car fart? Imagine that\u2026 but not having to pay for a tsla. Or an app that allows you to make payments for tolls, gas, food, etc from your car([car payments](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-ivy-to-provide-secure-vehicle-based-payments). \nFrom an OEM standpoint, the sensor data alone is a gold mine. Being able to track real world, real time conditions of their vehicles could/should streamline production, recalls, and r&amp;d. The potential for a cloud-base RTOS is infinite.\nBest part about IVY? ***SUBSCRIPTION BASED***\nIf IVY gains the same amount of vehicles as QNX and the annual subscription per car is say 10 bucks. Annual gross would be 1.95 billion. At the same ratios that would put the stock roughly at 2x current levels.\n\nCompetitors for QNX/IVY- doesn\u2019t really exist yet.

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/772aqq7nwno71.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7319d506eb7da567c5ab1a86d4e4f1d08dc06e29\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

Dr. Don Basile, PhD: Chairman &amp; Co-CEO of Roman DBDR SPAC  \n \\-he has over 20 years of experience in the tech industry, and has led many silicon valley tech companies through multiple funding rounds, meaning he has a lot of knowledge when it comes to valuing tech companies.\n2. Dixon Doll, Jr.: Co-CEO of Roman DBDR SPAC  \n \\-was CEO and COO in computer data memory and software management companies Violin Memory and DBM Cloud Systems, meaning he could be a valuable asset to CompoSecure.\n3. John Small: CFO of Roman DBDR SPAC  \n \\-used to be the CFO of Viggle, and has over 20 years in investment banking experience, including at Morgan Stanley.\n\n**The CompoSecure team:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Jon Wilk: CEO of CompoSecure  \n \\-was Head of Product and Chief Marketing Officer at JPMorgan Chase Consumer Bank, as well as the President of Paychoice a leading SaaS-based payroll company which was sold to Sage in 2014. \n2. Timothy Fitzsimmons: CFO of CompoSecure  \n \\-CEO of his own consulting firm called Your CFO &amp; Controller, he has been working in finance for over 30 years.\n3. Adam Lowe: Chief Innovation Officer of CompoSecure  \n \\-with a PhD and MBA from Cornell, Adam Lowe now has over 10 years in experience in the security and tech industry. He is a former group leader of the Innovation Development Team at SRC Inc. He will be leading the Arculus product launch which I will discuss further on.\n\n**What is CompoSecure &amp; What do they do?**\n\nCompoSecure is a payment technology company that is trusted by multiple blue chip customers for whom they have produced almost 100 million metal payment cards. Credit cards, debit cards, prepaid cards, IDs, customer loyalty cards, you name it they make it. They have 30 patents issued and 44 pending. Thus far, clients relationships have an average tenure of 12 years, meaning this company isn\u2019t just a start up. Their customers include JPMorgan Chase, American Express, Capital One, RBC, HSBC, UBS, Amazon, Verizon, and the list goes on. The company has grown tremendously, as they now have over 675 employees and are expecting to produce 22 million metal cards this year.\n\n**A Major Catalyst on September 9th**\n\nCompoSecure is launching their Arculus card on Thursday, September 9th, marking the launch of the first metal NFC-enabled cold storage device. Arculus will allow clients to store private keys and sign transactions with an offline device, all while protecting their wallets from network-based vulnerabilities, alleviating burdens of existing solutions. Essentially, this is a hot &amp; cold crypto storage device that is tangible to its users. It uses advanced three-factor authentication security across biometric, PIN and Key card and truly air-gapped. Arculus card will be a no charging required, crypto key storage solution with encrypted NFC (\u201ctap-to-transact\u201d). Additionally, it allows clients to easily send, receive, and trade crypto assets through the mobile app. Price is approx. $100 for a card.\n\nWatch the Creator Story here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yKjEFjvNNw\n\n**What do they plan on doing in the future?**\n\nIn 2022, CompoSecure plans on adding a payment feature to their Arculus card, allowing users to tap the card to their phone to verify identity and open the Arculus Wallet app or enable transactions. By 2023, CompoSecure expects Arculus to enable eGames to accept growing list of currencies and protect accounts from hacking and loss in the quickly expanding gaming market. Another big add-on to Arculus they are expecting to launch in 2023 is a Warranty &amp; Insurance option for clients, which enables regulatory protection from loss of crypto and other digital assets &amp; facilitates processes such as IP address check, screening, &amp; Know Your Transaction (KYT) for the crypto space.\n\n**Company Financials**\n\n1) Historical Results\n\n2018A: $155 mm in sales $69 mm in EBITDA\n\n2019A: $243 mm in sales $107 mm in EBITDA\n\n2020A: $261 mm in sales $116 mm in EBITDA\n\nHistorical revenue CAGR of 29%\n\n2) Projected Results\n\n2021E: $276 mm in sales (+ $10 mm Arculus sales) $102 mm in EBITDA\n\n2022E: $316 mm in sales (+ $40 mm Arculus sales)  $105 mm in EBITDA\n\n2023E: $363 mm in sales (+ $127 mm Arculus sales) $160 mm in EBITDA\n\n2024E: $418 mm in sales (+ $429 mm Arculus sales) $274 mm in EBITDA\n\n2025E: $480 mm in sales (+ $1.09 b Arculus sales)  $586 mm in EBITDA\n\n**Okay this is fun and all but what is the deal valuing the company at? 5 billion dollars?**\n\nThe deal values the company only at $903 mm. Total common equity value of $826 mm. When adding the $380 mm in debt to the company value you get a Total Enterprise Value of $1.2 billion. The deal leave the company with $361 mm in cash on their balance sheet to funds their Arculus program, $175 mm of which is PIPE led by BlackRock &amp; Highbridge Capital Management. Further breaking down the PIPE, however, it must be noted that $130 mm of it is convertible notes, and the other $45 mm is common shares.\n\n**Risks**\n\n1) Metal Card Sales risk: with new payment features coming out all the time, it is possible that in a decade from now people no longer use cards, that all payment mechanisms are directly tied to phone, albeit not very likely given that cards are still the generally accepted means of transacting.\n\n2) Arculus Product Failure risk: CompoSecure is investing lots of money and time into this Product, and it is their main way of growing the business. That being said, if the market does not respond well to Arculus product, the company could fail to meet its projected financial results down the road.\n\n3) Dilution risk: the PIPE part of the deal is mostly convertible debt, meaning shareholder dilution is very likely upon PIPE unlock and share price appreciation.\n\nIf I am missing any risks, please let me know. Pleasure to discuss.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCompoSecure is what I call The Perfect Growth &amp; Value Play. If you only look at the business from a perspective of their current operations and forget all of the Arculus products aiming at the crypto space, the deal already then seems to be quite fair. The market cap is just under a billion, yet they are making over $100 million in EBITDA and is still expected to grow without Arculus. Now, when adding the Arculus card and its additional features to this, you are now in a value play, but exposed to pential multi bagger type of growth. Nobody knows if it will turn out actually making $1.09 billion in revenue for them by 2025, but at least there is value in the business regardless. Cheers!\n\nDisclosure: 500 shares only, I like to spread my money very thinly in high conviction plays.\n\nTHIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, DO YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE PLEASE THANK YOU",

        "selftext": "Hey guys I started trading options in June and am here to share the secret I\u2019ve discovered to remaining profitable over the long term. First a little about me. My first play was buying puts on AMC at its peak and selling them after it was announced that AMC would be issuing more shares to raise money. Unfortunately I was only able to double my money because IV was so high. Next I bought CRSR calls and 10x my money to 60k. After losing a lot back I pulled off another 10 bagger on CRSR and now I\u2019m riding a banned ticker to the moon. But there\u2019s 2 keys to being successful. Firstly, don\u2019t lose money. Use stop losses. Never hold an option beyond a 30% loss. Secondly, buy stocks that will go up, not down. Just look at the graph and predict the direction and read post\u2019s to see if it\u2019s gaining retail hype. Thanks for reading",

        "selftext": "(TSXV: SCAN) (OTCQB: LDDFF) (FRANKFURT: LD2)\n\nI have noticed Liberty Defense gaining a lot of attention recently from their flagship product, HEXWAVE, so I looked into it a bit to see if this stock is worth the hype. After looking into them, it does seem very likely that their HEXWAVE threat detection device will be a massive hit in in airports, stadiums, schools and any public venues across America.\n\n**About HEXWAVE:**\n\n* Contactless screening and threat detection system for all weapon types \u2013 metallic or non-metallic\n* Data rich and able to transmit 400,000 data points to create a 3D image that AI is able to interpret and provide clearance or no clearance\n* Throughput time is over 1000 an hour, which is unrivalled by any competitor\n* 7 years of product development and over $20M has been invested for research and testing\n\nThe product is currently in the Beta testing phase and the company has signed for beta testing agreements with Allianz Arena (2nd largest stadium in Germany), University of Wisconsin Police Department, Metro Toronto Convention Centre, and 7 other large partners. The long term goal for this product is for it to replace conventional security gates that are used at venues, schools, stadiums, places of work, government facilities and any other at-risk locations.\n\n**The Market:**\n\nThe market for security systems is an estimated $5 billion and is expected to grow at 7.2% annually. The contactless design of the HEXWAVE eliminates privacy concerns as no divestment of keys, wallets, or cell phones is required. The most recent news from Liberty Defense is a technical and marketing collaboration agreement on August 10th with Micro-X, to explore a combined technology offering with Liberty's HEXWAVE walk-through screening portal for enhanced people and passenger screening in aviation or commercial security settings. Liberty also has plans to advance airport passenger screening by solving the shoe removal problem. Liberty has exclusive licenses for two innovative solutions developed by PNNL and funded by Department of Homeland Security; high definition millimeter-wave body scanner for upgrades or new deployments and footwear screener based on proven millimeter-wave technology.\n\nI\u2019m really looking forward to the HEXWAVE product launch, set to take place in mid-2022. This product has the potential to change venue security forever and when it takes off so will SCAN!\n\nThis is not investment advice! If you are interested please look into them.",

Though smaller, Rigetti said the development marked a recent design breakthrough that put his company on a path to much more rapid advances in the coming years.\n\n\u201cWe have found a better way to scale,\u201d Rigetti said in an interview with the Financial Times. The latest prediction is based on a modular design that involves linking a number of smaller quantum chips into a single processor, simplifying the job of getting a large number of qubits to work together.\n\nThe company claimed the design gave it an edge over rivals, putting it on a path to build a 1,000 qubit system in 2024 and one based on 4,000 qubits in 2026. Its founder also predicted that it would be able to build a machine ten years from now with more computing power than all of today\u2019s cloud computing systems combined.\n\nHowever, company executives said the decision to go public now reflected a belief that early, more rudimentary versions of the technology would yield commercial benefits much sooner. \u201cWe believe we can get to customer value in a couple of years,\u201d said Taryn Naidu, chief operating officer.\n\nRigetti said it planned to go public early next year through a merger with Supernova Partners, a spac, or acquisition vehicle, co-chaired by hedge fund investor Alexander Klabin and Spencer Rascoff, a former chief executive of real estate site Zillow.\n\nThe funding includes a $100m equity investment from investment groups that include T Rowe Price, Bessemer Venture Partners and Franklin Templeton. Other investors include In-Q-Tel, the CIA\u2019s venture capital arm, and Palantir, the data analytics company that has done extensive work for the national security establishment.\n\nWhile Wall Street\u2019s spac boom has opened a route for quantum computing companies to go public, stock market investors have yet to show real appetite for the technology. Shares in IonQ, a rival start-up, closed on Tuesday at $7.73, well below their $10 notional value at the time of the company\u2019s listing last week.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 5, 2021**\n\nVolatility in the stock market continues, with the three major indexes, particularly the Nasdaq (QQQ), reversing hard after suffering one of its worst days all year, with Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) leading the charge. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington and wait for upcoming economic and earnings data to gauge concerns over supply chain disruptions and inflation. Tech stocks once again came under pressure as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continues to rise. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.04% higher, the Nasdaq closed 1.35% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closing 0.92% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed, closing just 0.35% higher.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen previous episodes of rising rates, both earlier this year as well as when the Fed first announced intentions to begin tapering quantitative easing in the not too distant future. Each of these episodes caused a hiccup but didn\u2019t derail the broader bull market. According to Edward Jones, yields went from below 1% to 1.75% during the first three months of this year, a period that included pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500 of 3.7% for four days and 4.2% for 12 days. However, during that entire three-month stretch in which rates were rising, the stock market rose more than 7%.  In this current spate, 10-year rates have jumped from 1.30% on September 15 to as high as 1.54% last week, reflecting a renewed concern over inflation pressures and reduced Fed stimulus expectations\n\nStocks are struggling to regain their footing after the September selloff, given that many of the concerns that sparked last month\u2019s drop remain. Congressional lawmakers have yet to come to an agreement on a solution to raise the debt limit to prevent a potential government default sometime mid-October. Failure to do so would be catastrophic for the US economy.  As a reminder, Congress successfully averted a government shutdown last week. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it as early as this week Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown.\n\nLooking ahead, the September Jobs Report will be released later this week. Market participants are hoping to see payroll gains accelerate after a shockingly disappointing August report, which shoed just 235,000 new payrolls gains versus more than 700,000 expected. Consensus economists anticipate that 475,000 payrolls returned in September, and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.1% or the lowest since March 2020.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* According to Facebook (FB), yesterday\u2019s nearly six-hour outage was caused by a mistake during a routine maintenance on how internet data routed through its network. Here is a blog by the company [https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/)\n* Despite broad weakness in tech in recent weeks, shares of Netflix (NFLX) have been on fire, with the company breaking previous ATH twice in the last five days.

I agree and personally divested all my holdings in Chinese stocks months ago, some at a loss. Just my opinion.\n* National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), South Africa\u2019s largest metalworkers union with over 155,000 members, said it was launching an indefinite strike to press for wage increases.

        "selftext": "**Disclaimer:**\n\nMade some great trades in the past and made some great bad trades trying to time the market. I've been silent for a while. I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. Do your own DD and fact check me if you need to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is FASTLY?**\n\nFastly is a CDN (Content Delivery Network), kind of like Amazon, Google, and Facebook who sells connections to the internet to websites like Shopify, Reddit, Discord etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHY FASTLY ISN'T SO POOPY**\n\nJune 8th Outage -  Fastly had a bug and the internet was shut off for a while. During this outage some customers of Fastly were revealed. \n\nKnown client list as of June 8th 2021 -  Reddit, Spotify, Twitch, Stack Overflow, GitHub, gov.uk, Hulu, HBO Max, Quora, PayPal, Vimeo, Shopify, Stripe, and news outlets CNN, The Guardian, The New York Times, BBC and Financial Times.\n\nI don't know about you, but I use Reddit, Spotify, Twitch, Paypal. Seems like pretty big clients, so I think Fastly and the internet will be staying around for a while. This company cannot go tits up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cybersecurity and the Internet BIZ**\n\nAs of 2021 the Cybersecurity market is $180bn industry. Forecasts say these numbers will only go up over time as the web becomes more connected and security protocols, speed, delivery continues to improve.\n\nBUG - Cyber security ETF, I'm surprised that FSLY is not part of this ETF (yet)\n\nI believe sales will continue to grow. The internet is like the universe 2.0 and continues to expand over time, URLs might not be norm but apps and app connectivity are. Fastly is a CDN for apps too, for the popular app like TikTok.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FASTLY TEAM**\n\nOne word - DEDICATED.\n\nYou see people bounce from netflix to facebook to twitter to amazon to google to IBM very often. I see this on linkedin all the time, and the time they spend in the company 2-3 years to get a salary bump and a company under their belt to boast about.\n\nAt Fastly, look up the employees, they are dedicated, 6+years and counting. These employees who connect the internet can move to Amazon, Facebook, and Google, but they choose to stay at Fastly... \n\nThis only means one thing, the employees believe in the company, they like where they are, and they like what they do. Sounds like a recipe for success to me. (7% insider ownership) The founder is no longer the CEO but the CA and they continue to invest and develop ext-gen WAF and RASP to protect web applications, APIs and microservices. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SHORTS?! EXPOSED**\n\n2021 is almost over, but the norm for this year was squeeze every short.\n\nFastly has a 16% short interest on a 100m float. Meaning 16m shares shorted.\n\nThe average vol of FSLY is 3.5m and they last time there was a short squeeze that was 10/16/2020 where the volume traded the float.\n\nI went through the options chain to see who owns these short positions that were monthly's at one point that expire THIS WEEK 10/15.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[15 OCT 21 PUTS](https://preview.redd.it/hv5os40kz9t71.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c04042b6ce1df306f31d544c54dee96efc9f09d2)\n\nThe 3300 put options I believe belong to  **Walleye Trading LLC,** based off their 13f filing from Aug 16th. \n\n300 Puts owned by  **Centiva Capital, LP**  based off their 13f filing\n\n600 Puts owned by  **Zweig-DiMenna Associates LLC**  based off their 13f filing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(**How can I check this?** SEC search their 13-f and open the info tables.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's obvious that these institutions will want their puts to not expire worthless but what can they do? It's a bull market and FSLY just took off. Sounds like they will be covering the 43, 44, and 45's if the squeeze goes past the big $45 before expiration.\n\nAre hedgefunds friends? Nope, they cannibalize off each other too, that's probably why some whale moved the price this week in hopes to start this ramp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe $43's already got pushed out and the $44 are close. If the $45 are pushed out it's ogre and gamma ramping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere can a squeeze go? I'm not sure but I know it can trade the float or up to three times the float if there is naked short selling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nFSLY If you are reading this you are using them. SHARES FOR LONG HULL, the internet universe expansion is imminent.\n\nFSLY Price movement, shorts found, squeeze or no squeeze? 10/15/2021 remind you later?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions:\n\n400 FSLY Shares @ $43.3\n\n100 contracts 50C1022 @ .13 (to back my squeeze thesis.)",

        "selftext": "Hey gang!\n\nMajor averages took off after a slew of large companies killed earnings. The Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) led  indexes higher, gaining 1.8% as falling bond yields boosted large-cap tech stocks. With eight members reporting earnings, the S&amp;P 500 Index ETF (SPY) added 1.6%. The benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) climbed 1.5% and the small-cap focused Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) rose 1.3%.\n\nFirst time unemployment claims fell to the lowest level since the pandemic began, as the 239K claims reported was lower than the 315,000 expected. September's producer price index numbers came in lighter than forecast, with demand increasing 0.5%, just below the 0.6% expected. Lower inflation rates could have helped ease bond yields, spurring investors to leave safe havens and return to high growth technology stocks. \n\nI'm four for four (like Wendy's!) on earnings forecasts, and took some nice profits (73%) from iron condors on Citigroup today. Have been correct calling JPMorgan (bearish), Delta Airlines (bearish), Bank of America (bullish), and Citigroup (bearish). Technically Citigroup ended green today, but I'm pricing the wings of my earnings iron condors wider than the straddle's implied move. I'm also *doing my research* on expected earnings for the companies, industry, option pricing, and open interest. If you'd like to know more, feel free to message me. \n\nObligatory: these are not stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that kind of advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing unusual option data, (so if you don't see your favorite stonk, don't take it personally) please do you own DD, etc. etc. etc.\n\nI pull my data from a premium Market Chameleon account. News I generally get from Finviz, but I also check Google. For economic reports, my go to is ForexFactory. Unusual option activity is defined as options that see at least 1.4x the average option activity by volume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|STOCK|PRICE|VOLUME (AVG)|CALLS% - PUTS%|MOST ACTIVE|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PROG|2.12|108.1K (22.8K)|82 - 18|Oct 2.5c (27.3K)|\n|EDU|2.38|104.3K (58.6K)|50 - 50|Nov 3.5c (32.8K), Nov 2p (27.5K)|\n|WTRH|1.04|13.3K (3.6K)|80 - 20|Nov 1.5c (2.6K)|\n|WTI|4.10|7.9K (1.9K)|98 - 2|Nov 5c (6.2K)|\n|MIC|3.73|7.7K (683)|57 - 43|Apr 5c (4K)|\n|NGL|2.76|5.8K (1.3K)|98 - 2|Jan22 5c (2.3K)|\n|TGB|2.20|5.1K (1.5K)|97 - 3|Nov 2c (2.5K)|\n|MCF|4.49|4.2K (877)|99 - 1|Oct 4c (1.1K)|\n|AMPE|1.72|3.9K (1.8K)|100 - 0|Oct 1.5c (2.5K)|\n|GNW|4.43|3.7K (1.8K)|98 - 2|Dec 5c (1.4K)|\n|HMY|3.85|3.6K (1.3K)|97 - 3|Jan22 5c (2.7K)|\n|SEEL|2.39|3.2K (1.6K)|98 - 2|Oct 2.5c (2K)|\n|BWEN|3.36|2.7K (380)|90 - 10|Nov 5c (1.1K)|\n|CEI\\*|1.25|40.5K (57.5K)|78 - 22|Oct 1c (4.2K)|\n|FAMI\\*|0.34|N/A|N/A|N/A|\n\n\\*including for ongoing interest/narrative purposes.\n\nNotes:\n\n**PROG +2.45% (+1.44%)** Another wacky day for PROG. After being up in premarket trading PROG slumped out the gate, before shooting to a more than 12% gain. The stock then proceeded to give almost all of it back throughout the day. H.C. Wainwright initiated a \"buy\" rating for the stock with a $4 price target today, yet the price action remained muted on more than 92 million in volume. Open interest as of this morning shows more than 53,000 call options in the money, down from the nearly 62,000 yesterday. ITM open interest has steadily declined this week, putting any sort of OPEX gamma pressure into question. $2 appears to be the battleground and it will be interesting to see if the stock can retain this key level. \n\n**EDU +1.28% (+0.42%)** After opening to a 3% loss, EDU rallied mid-session to post a modest gain. Yesterday the Chinese government laid out a strategy to promote vocational education among its population, offering a lifeline for beaten private education stocks such as EDU. With big trades on either side of the option chain, it's tough to tell if investors were scalping calls on an up day, or prepping for a return to the downside with puts. \n\n**WTRH -18.9% (+0.97%)** A pullback was likely for WTRH, a day after rocketing more than 50% after news broke that Morgan Stanley held a 10% stake in the company. Morgan Stanley reported their earnings today and rose 2.5%, so its possible there could be more upside in the future for WTRH when one of their larger holders is doing well. Ahem, to quote yesterday's report \"With large gains like this, I nearly always expect substantial profit taking the next day, so my bet is that puts will print\". I'm not one to toot my horn a bunch, but BEEP BEEP Y'ALL. To be fair, it was a pretty easy call. \n\n**WTI -5.25% (-1.2%)** WTI fell for the second straight day off no news. \n\n**MIC -0.27% (-0.27%)** I still don't know exactly what this stock is. \n\n**NGL +7.78% (-0.36%)** No reason that I could find for either the price movement or elevated option activity. \n\n**TGB +1.85% (-1.36%)** TGB was up 5% in premarket trading, and managed to swing to the upside after briefly trading in the red. No news. Notable that there are over 32,000 call options in the open interest at the $2 strike for November. \n\n**MCF +0% (+0%)** MCF opened green, fell to a 2% loss, then rallied and fell again for a net zero day. Most of the option activity appears to stem from well over 1,000 calendar spreads at the $4 strike between October and November. \n\n**AMPE +1.8% (+1.18%)**  Was up more than 6% at one point during trading, and was up nearly 5% in after hours trading before pulling back. A lot of the option activity appears to be options being scalped, which can give the appearance of high volume. Considering that nearly all of the activity took place with options that expire tomorrow and that numerous orders were filled by algorithms, the action on this stock today was probably just some quick flips. \n\n**GNW +2.07% (+0%)** No news. A solid amount of the option activity came from a single order for 993 of the December $5 calls, which is slightly bullish *if* they were purchased instead of sold. \n\n**HMY +1.27% (-1.03%)** HMY kind of barcoded in a range today. No news, and the most active option was the same as yesterday. Hmmm. With Producer Price Index numbers coming in better than expected and bond yields falling, this could have been an inflation play closed out from yesterday. \n\n**SEEL -0.42% (+1.7%)** No news. SEEL was up early, then down late. \n\n**BWEN +25.82% (-2.89%)** Curiously no news related to the 25% gain, although BWEN saw 14x its average volume of 400K shares traded. The float is small at just under 18 million, but I'm stumped. \n\n**CEI -10.56% (-2.36%)** The hits keep coming for CEI. According to open interest numbers, over 132,000 call options will expire worthless this month. Once the stock started falling from its relative lofty levels, I imagine MMs were able to unwind their hedges. This continual unwind could be what is responsible for CEI's 46% loss in the last week. That and relative volume falling off, as only 118 million shares were traded today. Shorts are eating good on this one. \n\n**FAMI -3.66% (-1.13%)** Also continuing its fall is FAMI, although not as steep. FAMI is down 7.54% over the last week, as volume has waned. Only 85 million shares were traded today - still roughly 5x the float - but that's less than its 106 million share average. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreat day for the bulls, who knows what tomorrow brings. We do get retail sales numbers tomorrow, so we'll have an idea if inflation has pumped the brakes on consumer spending, which I doubt it has. Economists are forecasting a 0.2% decline in retail sales, but a 0.5% increase in core retail sales. The difference between the two is that automobile sales are removed from core retail sales, as they account for 20% of retail sales and could skew the numbers. \n\nEarnings tomorrow aren't the sexiest, with Charles Schwab (SCHW), Rio Tinti (RIO), PNC Financial (PNC), Truist Financial (TFC), and JB Hunt (JBHT) on deck. I'm most interest in JBHT and how they are affected by supply chain bottlenecks. Next week we start to see some of the big boys report, with IBM, Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA), Verizon (VZ), Intel (INTC) and others on tap. \n\nThe end of October is a murderer's row of mega cap stocks reporting across all sectors. Should be ample opportunity to make money. \n\nOk, I gotta get back to writing option education articles for \\[redacted\\]. Man I wish I could tell y'all who I write for so I don't sound so full of shit. Anyways, this report will most likely be massive tomorrow with monthly OPEX and triple witching. Huzzah!\n\nboom",

        "selftext": "Rackspace is currently primed for a 20%+ gap fill and return to 20$ (30% growth) with cheap options due to running under the 50MA for so long.\n\nNotice how the recent two days have held the 20dMA as support, and had whicks above the 50dMA- that nice large gap up back to 17 will create a sick swing range and definitely print you some nice tendies.  With some luck I think getting above the 200MA, back above 20$/Share, is reasonable before the end of the year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21b3fced83t71.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1285bfadaa51a51148ad561a654805c57640d6b9\n\n**What is rackspace?**\n\n\\- They are a very tech-savvy data center with their own provisioning management tools.    Basically, startups need a place to put their servers, and they can put them in rented rack space at rackspace.\n\n**Boring longer version stolen from some older DD someone else wrote:**\n\nRackspace Technologies (RXT), is what we like to call a cloud managed service provider (MSP). They essentially partner with corporations and help them with their migration / shift to the cloud via recurring, multi-year contracts (revenue visibility). In addition to cloud services provided, they also offer a multitude of other services such as privacy and data protection services, building out managed applications, etc. The business recently IPOd after being bought-out by Apollo, so there is a large amount of leverage on the business, but the cash flow of the business is robust and should allow Rackspace to paydown debt and further drive equity value for shareholders. The business currently is trading around $15, off from a peak of the upper-$20s. It traded down due to lumpiness in gross margin as the business is sunsetting certain products and as they win new clients, the margin falls off as the revenues are recognized over multi-year periods. The business is trading at around \\~9x EBITDA, which is well below where other managed-service providers trade in the market. Especially for a business with a TAM of $400B+. Gross Margin should bottom out at around 31%, vs. the historical 32 - 33% (which was the reason for a large sell-off in the stock prior), largely because of the pressures from public cloud transition (multicloud mix transitioning towards public cloud coupled with the decline in the OpenStack Business)\n\nTLDR: Who cares.  There's rumours that Amazon might buy their data centers or something like that.  I haven't bothered to verify those rumours myself but if the above shit doesn't excite you then you're probably the type to get off of unfounded amazon rumours.\n\n**Some quick and dirty highlights for everyone:**\n\n1. Rackspace is uniquely positioned in the market, having built a culture around strong support for its customer base. Only Rackspace now offers customers the ability to deploy workloads and managed applications in multicloud environments more efficiently. Via proprietary technology, tools, and AI, Rackspace can host and manage IT workloads for customers far more efficiently than those customers can themselves, while offering scale advantages in hosted applications.\n2. TAM - total market is growing at 8-10% per year, and should reach over $520B by 2023. Rackspace will participate in cloud adoption and deployments, driving the need for Rackspace's services and will be able to further penetrate the market as it builds its sales and marketing efforts\n3.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 5, 2021**\n\nVolatility in the stock market continues, with the three major indexes, particularly the Nasdaq (QQQ), reversing hard after suffering one of its worst days all year, with Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) leading the charge. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington and wait for upcoming economic and earnings data to gauge concerns over supply chain disruptions and inflation. Tech stocks once again came under pressure as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continues to rise. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.04% higher, the Nasdaq closed 1.35% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closing 0.92% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed, closing just 0.35% higher. \n\nWe\u2019ve seen previous episodes of rising rates, both earlier this year as well as when the Fed first announced intentions to begin tapering quantitative easing in the not too distant future. Each of these episodes caused a hiccup but didn\u2019t derail the broader bull market. According to Edward Jones, yields went from below 1% to 1.75% during the first three months of this year, a period that included pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500 of 3.7% for four days and 4.2% for 12 days. However, during that entire three-month stretch in which rates were rising, the stock market rose more than 7%.  In this current spate, 10-year rates have jumped from 1.30% on September 15 to as high as 1.54% last week, reflecting a renewed concern over inflation pressures and reduced Fed stimulus expectations\n\nStocks are struggling to regain their footing after the September selloff, given that many of the concerns that sparked last month\u2019s drop remain. Congressional lawmakers have yet to come to an agreement on a solution to raise the debt limit to prevent a potential government default sometime mid-October. Failure to do so would be catastrophic for the US economy.  As a reminder, Congress successfully averted a government shutdown last week. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it as early as this week Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown. \n\nLooking ahead, the September Jobs Report will be released later this week. Market participants are hoping to see payroll gains accelerate after a shockingly disappointing August report, which shoed just 235,000 new payrolls gains versus more than 700,000 expected. Consensus economists anticipate that 475,000 payrolls returned in September, and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.1% or the lowest since March 2020.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* According to Facebook (FB), yesterday\u2019s nearly six-hour outage was caused by a mistake during a routine maintenance on how internet data routed through its network.

Perhaps, could be attributed to the immense popularity of \u201cSquid Game\u201d, which has become the company\u2019s most popular show in less than a month. I watched it, it lives up to the hype.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) unveiled a new version of its flagship operating system today, with the company debuting Windows 11. Here is a WSJ article about the features [https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-released-windows-11-but-should-you-upgrade-11633453762?mod=wsj\\_RHF](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-released-windows-11-but-should-you-upgrade-11633453762?mod=wsj_RHF)\n* Today, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen gave testimony before the Senate exposing FB\u2019s business practices and calling for more stringent regulation of the company. \n* Three top US hedge funds, Man Group, Elliot Management, Marshall Wace, and Soros Fund Management, who combined manage roughly $200b in assets, have warned that Chinese businesses have become \u201cuninvestable\u201d amid the anti-monopoly scandal, power shortages and Evergrande situation. I agree and personally divested all my holdings in Chinese stocks months ago, some at a loss. Just my opinion.\n* National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), South Africa\u2019s largest metalworkers union with over 155,000 members, said it was launching an indefinite strike to press for wage increases. This action could block critical supplies for car manufacturing, threatening to further strain a supply chain already stretched thin. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Chipotle (CMG) target raised by Stephens from $1850 to $200 at Overweight.

        "selftext": " \n\nUnfortunately, hardly any articles that the author knows of, be they articles on \"professional\" websites or blogs, go into the **technology** **and** **product** **details** as well as **manufacturing costs** **for** **products** **of** the companies about whose shares a buy or sell recommendation is made. Nor on what this means for **future** sales, market and company prospects.\n\nThis is not surprising, many investors are no longer interested in companies and their products at all, only in (minimal) daily profits, especially the short sellers who \"argue\" with \"arguments\" like \"*what* *a* *scam*\", \"*what* *a* *sh.. \"* and the like \"argue\" without ever substantiating this classification. Main thing to create a (negative) mood to get others to sell. Same in the opposite direction. There is daily speculation about takeovers or attempts to bring about a short squeeze based on certain percentages that a stock is sold short.\n\nBoth are wrong in the first place.\n\nHardly any investors still invest in products and companies, many are only \"gamblers\". At the same time, these players put products, companies and jobs at risk. For example, a good product cannot be developed and sold overnight. Nevertheless, these gamblers expect results in days or weeks and months at the most, and if they don't come immediately, this is made out to be a problem. Even though everything within the company is on schedule. Even the development of an iPhone takes a year or more. More and more often you can read, especially with new products or companies, that the company has not made any sales or profits yet. How could it, if the product is still in development?\n\nIf that still doesn't work, the killer argument will eventually be used. Competitor XYZ is already on the market and sells more. Or already has many partners. This was also the argument regarding Apple when Nokia was still the world market leader for mobile phones and smartphones and Apple presented the first iPhone. The outcome is well known. Or with Tesla vis-\u00e0-vis the established car manufacturers. Today, a Tesla drives away even a Porsche and Tesla is constantly building new factories. Porsche, on the other hand, is also doing well, but cannot keep up with Tesla's expansion and is technically (e.g. in terms of range) lagging behind.\n\nWhat all of this has in common is that you can't extrapolate from the past to the future. Otherwise, there would never be new market leaders. The future of a company lies in its current and future- oriented products, not in its old ones. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule, such as food manufacturers, like Coca-Cola, or banks, etc. Here, however, it should be about technical products and their manufacturers.\n\n**Summary: Ultimately, only the business outlook determines the future of a company and thus the share price. The business outlook depends on the current and future products.**\n\nThat is why short sales figures etc. are not considered here. Instead,it will be shown **why there is currently only one company in the field of lidar sensors that meets all the requirements of large car manufacturers** such as Volkswagen, Toyota, etc. and where **a short squeeze could be triggered shortly due to their technical superiority**, since this technological superiority cannot be explained away or \"sold short\".\n\n**It should likely cause price reactions when a company is valued at only about 1/3 the market cap of inferior competitors on the stock market, as** **Microvision** **currently is relative to** [**Luminar.**](https://www.luminartech.com/) Both companies in September 2021 at the world's largest motor show IAA in Munich:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSources: private\n\nBecause in the field of lidar for self-driving cars (levels 3-5), the current \"official\" market leader is Luminar. \"Market leader\" mainly because of the market capitalization and the hype around the young company founder and CEO. Luminar has not sold any finished products yet. Last year, Luminar only sold about 100 development systems. I am not aware of numbers for 2021.\n\nThere is no car in the world that could be purchased with a Luminar lidar. This is already due to the fact that the company does not yet have a deliverable product.\n\nHowever, if the market leader has not yet managed to launch and sell a product for **self-driving cars**, it is not surprising that its competitors have not yet been able to generate sales in this area either.\n\nIs lidar necessary?\n\nIt should not be discussed further that Mr. Musk as CEO of the company Tesla [considered ](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/)lidar systems [superfluous.](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/) First of all, this statement is already more than two years old (from mid-2019) and was quite correct at that time. when lidar systems were far too expensive (up to $100,000), far too big so they had to be mounted on car roofs and their resolution was simply too poor compared to cameras. But development continues and today the situation is very different.\n\nFor [his part, ](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html)an [IBM CEO had ](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html)also [estimated the worldwide demand for computers at only about five](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html) [(!) units.](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html) This shows that even CEOs of global corporations can be wrong.\n\nThe [series of accidents with Tesla cars](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/) show that cameras alone are probably not able to guarantee a safe control of a car.\n\nIn addition, there are **far larger car** **companies** **that** **see lidar** **as** **indispensable.**\n\nMarket for Lidar Systems\n\nSo, it should be undeniable that there is a market for lidar systems. With about 70 million cars produced per year plus trucks\\*\\*,\\*\\* etc., there will soon be an **annual** **demand of** **50-300 million units** (usually several modules are needed per car, just as a Tesla has many cameras; at least one device each for the view to the front and one for the view to the rear), even if you exclude the Tesla cars.\n\nTechnology\n\nAfter the introduction to the topic, we will now look at the technology and **why** **it** **cannot** **be that** a **technologically** **highly superior** **company is** **only valued at a company value of** **only** **1/3** **of** **the** **technically** **far** **inferior** **\"market** **leader\"** and thus a **short** **squeeze** **should only be a matter** **of** **time,** since the true valuation very probably cannot be prevented for a long time.\n\nThis should occur at the latest when the first orders come in or when just enough investors realize that **something** **seems** **to** **be** **fundamentally wrong here**. Depending on what happens first. Both can happen on a daily basis.\n\nUpcoming orders can be considered almost certain due to the superior technology and the much earlier availability of the Microvision models.\n\nCar manufacturers are not interested in TV appearances by CEOs or fairytale up-and-coming stories; they want to build the best cars in their segment and for their target group.\n\nGeneral requirements of car manufacturers for car models\n\nAll car manufacturers in all target groups have the following essential requirements:\n\n* Security\n* Design\n* Vehicle characteristics (such as maximum speed, turning circle, etc.)\n* Price\n\nDepending on the target group of a car model, these are of course weighted differently, so that no order can be given. Only safety should always be at the top of the list for all manufacturers.\n\nOf course, a Mercedes has to look better or different than a pick-up. But it doesn't have to be as maneuverable and its load area can be smaller. However, it is no longer possible to sell ugly pick-ups today. While roof superstructures may not bother pick-ups, they are probably not acceptable for a Mercedes, Volkswagen or Toyota.\n\nIn terms of lidar systems, this means:\n\n* Security:  \n\n   * Highest possible resolution\n   * Refresh rate must be high enough for short response times\n   * non-dazzle\n* Design: as invisible as possible\n* Price: must match the selling price of the vehicle\n\nSystem comparison\n\nSo, let's compare the (only) system from the (previous) market leader Luminar with those from Microvision (four models in total).\n\nFirst of all, it is noticeable that Luminar intends to sell only one model with the product \"Iris\", while Microvision intends to offer three other models in addition to the top model and to cover other market segments with lower or specialized requirements.\n\nLuminar Iris and Microvision Lidar models:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [Luminar](https://www.luminartech.com/products/) and Microvision [Press Kit](https://www.microvision.com/about/press-kit/#brochure)\n\nSecurity: Resolution\n\nThis is quite simple to understand. As is also known for cameras, a camera or a lidar system sees more details and thus smaller objects, the higher the resolution. **If** **the resolution** **is lower** **than that** **of** **the competition,** **a** **lidar** **system** **is** **generally considered to be less** **reliable,** as it may detect a tree, but not a stone on the road. However, both can be dangerous.\n\n**Only the resolutions measured by the companies themselves and officially published shall be considered.**\n\nThe company Luminar has **measured a resolution of** **600,000** **points** **per** **second for** their model \"Hydra\":\n\n&gt;*Measurement* *Rate* *per Pixel* *600,000* *pt/s*\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: Luminar presentation from 2020\n\nThe future **successor** **model** intended for sale is **to have a** **50%** **increase** **in** **resolution,** **i.e.** **approximately 900,000** **dots** **per** **second**. The 50% increase is due to the fact that the resolution in dots per square degree is to increase from 200 to 300 and the other parameters are to remain essentially unchanged:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: Luminar data sheets for the Hydra and Iris models\n\nIn contrast, Microvision **measured a** **resolution of** **over** **10** **million points** **per** **second**. That is **twelve** **times** the **resolution** **that** **Luminar** **offers**. This means that a Microvision Lidar system can also **detect** **twelve times** **more details**.\n\nAccordingly, Microvision also writes on its website of\n\n&gt;*The industry's highest resolution, full velocity, long-range automotive lidar sensor.*\n\nSource: [Microvision](https://www.microvision.com/) October 2021\n\nAs well as from\n\n&gt;*Highest Resolution*  \n*Sensor enables* ***over*** ***10 million*** ***measurement*** ***points/second on*** ***target*** *and* ***can detect*** ***smaller obstacles*** ***from*** ***longer distances***\\*.\\* *Allows* ***progression*** ***from*** ***object*** ***detection to*** ***perception.****\"*\n\nSource: [Microvision](https://www.microvision.com/) October 2021\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**These details have been there for months and were not changed after the world's largest auto show, the IAA in Munich in September 2021, where all the big-name rivals were also exhibiting.**\n\n**Nor** **does** **any other** **competitor** **appear** **to** **claim** **the \"highest** **resolution\".** As far as we know, no Microvision competitor has complained to the SEC about misrepresentation, so even the **competition,** **including** **Luminar,** **seems** **to accept** **that** **Microvision Lidar** **has the highest** **resolution** **for** **lidar** **systems** **for** **self-driving cars**.\n\nThe differences in resolution were particularly visible at the IAA in Munich this September. Both Luminar and Microvision filmed the visitors on or in front of their booths. The environmental conditions were therefore almost identical.\n\nLuminar Iris Resolution:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg)\n\nIt is clearly visible that Luminar only shows single lines, while Microvision shows closed objects. No wonder with a twelvefold higher resolution.\n\n**This makes the score 1-0 in favor of Microvision over Luminar.**\n\nThis in the already most important category, because as already mentioned, the **resolution** **is** **the** **most** **important** **to** recognize as **many** **details** **as** **possible**, i.e. objects on and beside the road, which could be a danger for the car or others (e.g. small children or animals should not be run over).\n\nSafety: refresh rate\n\nThe frame rate (Hz) is also very important. It indicates how many images a camera or lidar system delivers per second.\n\nFor example, if only one image per second is created, a car at a speed of 100 km/h has already covered a distance of 27.78 meters in that time. This corresponds to the length of about six cars. At a frame rate of 30, on the other hand, the car has covered less than one meter per frame. Thus, at 30 Hz, a passenger car has 30 times more decision-making power and (time) to react to something and can do so 30 times faster.\n\nLuminar and Microvision lidar systems each have up to 30 Hz.\n\nOn closer inspection, however, it is noticeable that Microvision systems always seem to have 30 Hz, Luminar Lidar lies in the range of 1-30 Hz. **This** **suggests** **that** **with higher** **frame** **rates** **at** **Luminar** **Iris** **the resolution decreases** while it remains the same at Microvision, so there are 30 images with the high resolution.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: Luminar Iris data sheet and [Microvision](https://www.microvision.com/) October 2021\n\nMicrovision thus seems to be significantly better here as well. However, since the details are not known what exactly 1-30 Hz means for Luminar, this category is not evaluated conclusively.\n\nSafety: non-blinding\n\nEveryone knows it: If you look into the sun without sunglasses, you will be blinded and see less or almost nothing. The same applies to cameras, but also lidar systems. Here, glare protection is necessary. For people, sunglasses. With cameras and especially lidar systems it is technically much more complex.\n\nFor lidar systems there is even not only one sun, but several. **If** **there are** **several cars on a road** **within sight** **of a lidar** **system,** **which also have lidar** **systems,** **these** **lidar** **systems can dazzle each** **other**. This will almost always occur in the future if many cars are equipped with lidar systems.\n\n**In discussions about lidar companies, this problem gets little attention as far as I know.**\n\n**This** **is** **one of** **the main problems** **that** **lidar** **companies** **have to** **solve.** **Without a** **complete** **solution,** **a lidar system** **can hardly** **be used in** **a meaningful way,** **since it** **can be blinded and consequently** **temporarily** **be** **completely or** **partially** **blind - while** **the** **car continues** **to drive.**\n\nThis is because **lidar** **systems** **themselves** **emit** **light** **in the form** **of** **laser** **pulses** and wait to see whether it is reflected. If it is reflected, it will eventually return to the lidar system. The distance of the reflected object can then be determined from the duration, since the speed of light is both known and constant.\n\n**Lidar systems thus illuminate the environment in areas of light that are invisible to humans.**\n\nConsequence: **A** **lidar system** **may be dazzled from** **all** **sides,** **as if many laser** **pointers were directed** **at** **the lidar** **system**. So not only the own light comes back, but also foreign light.\n\nA lidar system must therefore ignore all extraneous light and filter out its own on the amount of light. It must not measure extraneous light under any circumstances.\n\n**This is a technically highly complex and difficult problem to solve.**\n\n**As** **far** **as** **the author** **knows,** **only Microvision has** **solved this** **problem completely**.\n\nThe company Luminar has recognized the problem after all and names it also officially, has however according to own representation on the Internet side no complete solution for it. But only a partial solution whereby this is not defined more precisely:\n\n&gt;*limited* *interference*\n\nSources: [Luminar](https://www.luminartech.com/sensory-overload-making-sense-of-lidar/) and [Microvision.](https://twitter.com/MicroVision/status/1438633835395043328)\n\nHowever, Microvision clearly states that the lidar systems **are** **completely** **immune** **to light** **from** **other** **lidar systems** **and the sun** as show below from the [Microvision](https://www.microvision.com/) October 2021.\n\nVideo content from the [youtube video \"Interference Immunity\":](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK3t8zFcl3I) Microvision's description to the video states complete immunity to other lidar systems (\"free\"):\n\n&gt;*MicroVision's* *Interference* *Immunity* *video* *released at* *IAA 2021.* *MicroVision's* *lidar* *sensor* *will* *work* *across* *all* *ambient* *lighting and* *is* ***free of*** ***interference*** ***from*** ***other*** ***lidars***.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK3t8zFcl3I)\n\nAccording to Microvision, it has adopted a solution that Microvision has already developed for the HoloLens 2 from Microsoft and which is also used there. This is probably also patented.\n\n**A** **lidar** **system** **like Luminar's, which is** **only** **partially immune to other lidar systems** **and sunlight,** **is** **simply too dangerous** and can be blinded or even provide false information, endangering lives.\n\nThis point goes clearly to Microvision. **The** **score** **is** **therefore** **2:0**.\n\nOther competitors also don't seem to have solved this hugely important problem yet. Innoviz has only considered sunlight even with InnovizTwo. Also Blickfeld has not solved the problem, but only for sunlight. This seems to apply to all competitors This would make Microvision the only company whose lidar systems are completely immune to light from other lidar systems. For comparison:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [InnovizTwo](https://innoviz.tech/innoviztwo) and Blickfeld [Vision Plus](https://www.blickfeld.com/products/vision-plus/) and [MicroVision](https://www.microvision.com/)\n\nPracticability\n\nThe author still knows the Walkman from Sony.

This technology from the 80s of the last century is used by Luminar as a drive in Luminar Iris as shown in a patent drawing below (top picture is the inside of a Sony Walkman):\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [Walkman](https://blog.fh-kaernten.at/ingmarsretro/tag/walkman-en/?lang=en) and Luminar patent drawing.\n\nThe reason is simple: Luminar, like Sony back then, also wants to avoid vibrations being transmitted to the shaft.\n\nHowever, the author doubts that the Luminar Lidar system Iris will survive everyday car use for years without repairs. Belts wear out, become brittle and even the slightest changes in length etc. will render the systems unusable and result in high repair costs for the car owner.\n\nThe other moving parts such as shafts will also wear out. The slightest changes will also render the system unusable, since a laser beam has to be controlled, which requires the highest precision. With Sony Walkman, the music didn't sound as good then. With Luminar, the system will fail immediately. After all,cars have a lifespan of ten to twenty years.\n\nAlmost all of Luminar's competitors do not have this problem. Since they, including Microvision, do not use any moving parts in their systems, at least in the new models. **Microvision has** **chosen the** **right** **architecture** **with** **Solid State,** **which has long** **proven its** **suitability for** **everyday** **use** **in the** **Microsoft** **HoloLens 2** **and** **the further** **development** **IVAS** **for** **the US** **Army,** even under the most difficult conditions that regularly occur in the military.\n\nDesignHowever, a safe car is of no use if no one buys it.\n\nSince design is very important in all areas of life, from smartphones to cars, and is at least one of the deciding factors in a purchase decision, if not the deciding factor, no car manufacturer can afford to install ugly lidar systems, such as those used to be installed on the roof or as attachments in the front, etc.\n\nWhile Microvision plans to install its lidar system where the interior rearview mirror is located, Luminar wants to install the Iris model on the roof in a bulge in the roof.\n\nSuggestions from Luminar for the installation of \"Iris\":\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [Luminar](https://www.luminartech.com/products/) and [Luminar Press](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210902005531/en/)\n\nInstallation suggestion from Microvision:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [Microvision youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwiI1-rSgq0)\n\n**This is where the mechanical-optical internal design of Luminar Iris takes its toll, resulting in a lidar system that is many times larger than Microvision's chip-based lidar system, which has no mechanical parts.**\n\nThe dimensions of Luminar Iris are according to the official Luminar data sheet:\n\nSource: Luminar Iris data sheet\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThus, Luminar Iris without holders has a volume of: 27 cm \\* 5,4 cm \\* 10,6 cm = 1\\*\\*.545,48 ccm\\*\\*\n\nThe A-sample from Microvision has a size of approx.\n\n20 cm \\* 11 cm \\* 3,4 cm = 748 ccm\n\n**It should be noted that** **the** **data from** **Luminar** **are** **the final** **dimensions,** **while** **Microvision has** **only** **measured a prototype**, the size of which could be **halved in** the final product to **about 350 ccm**, as Microvision told visitors at the IAA.\n\nThe Microvision Lidar has therefore already as prototype only half the volume and like Luminar Iris and final, optimized product probably less than 1/5 of the size of Luminar Iris.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/ppqpc4/i_found_a_way_to_measure_the_asample/) and [Microvision](https://twitter.com/MicroVision/status/1436488111610073112/photo/)\n\nVery important for car manufacturers to know: While **Luminar** **Iris is** **wide and tall**, the **Microvision** **Lidar** **system** **is** **narrow** **and** **flat**.\n\nOnly this design allows the seamless integration into car designs.\n\nFrom this author's point of view, the **size and shape of** **Microvision's lidar system** is **a knockout** **criterion for** **all car** **manufacturers who don't** **want to** **disfigure their** **car** **design**.\n\nIn addition, self-driving cars **require at** **least** **two** **lidar** **systems**, one for the view to the front and one for the view to the rear. The roof would therefore have to be bulged out at the front and rear to accommodate the Luminar lidar systems.\n\nMicrovision lidar is both very thin and very narrow, while Luminar lidar is relatively thick and very wide. Car designers needed thin and narrow lidar systems.\n\n**This** **point** **also goes** **clearly to Microvision,** **so the** **score** **is** **already 3:0.**\n\nPriceDevelopment costs\n\nBy its nature, **a price of a** **component** **strongly** **depends** **on the number** **of** **pieces**. This is because a price is made up of several components. They are the fixed costs, the cost of materials and manufacturing costs (and service, recycling costs etc.)\n\nThe fixed costs are, for example, the costs of development but also the other general costs that a company has and that are attributable to the product. They become lower per unit the higher the number of units. Development costs of 1 million dollars mean that products sold in quantity 1 must cost at least 1 million dollars. However, if the product is sold in a million units, the price of a unit is only at least $1.\n\nDevelopment costs incurred:\n\n* Luminar: All expenses in the last ten years, as the company has only developed one product so far: **Accumulated deficit: $697,254,000** (Source: [Luminar Q2 2021 Results](https://www.luminartech.com/luminar-reports-q2-2021-results-and-business-update/))\n* Microvision: Operating costs for approximately two years, as development did not begin until early 2020 and company previously developed and sold other products (such as a projector for Sony, Sharp, Ragenthek; interactive projector, consumer lidar, projectors for HoloLens 2). Here, we can assume roughly **$50 million**, as Microvision's operating costs are about $25 million per year (Source: [Q2 2021](https://ir.microvision.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/9856/q2-2021-financial-and-operating-results-call)).\n\n**This makes the development costs to be allocated to the final prices about $800 million for Luminar by the start of production in late 2022 and only about $50 million for Microvision.**\n\n**This** **means** **that** **the development** **costs** **for** **Luminar's** **lidar** **systems** **are approximately 16** **times** **those for** **Microvision**. Of course, this has to be taken into account in the pricing.\n\nProduction costs\n\nHowever, the development costs do not yet constitute a product. The material costs in particular must be taken into account here. As a rule of thumb: The more expensive a material is and the more material is needed, the more expensive a product will be. A watch made of gold is more expensive than one made of steel. In the same way, a car is more expensive than a bicycle because it requires much more material (and for other reasons).\n\nBoth the amount of material needed and the manufacturing costs should be much lower for Microvision. While the Luminar Lidar consists of solid aluminum blocks, Microvision probably only needs a plastic housing.\n\nIn addition, Luminar has many mechanical components, whereas Microvision uses a chip-sized MEMS module and does not use any mechanical components and therefore does not have to manufacture any mechanical components:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSources: Luminar patent application and [Microvision](https://ir.microvision.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/333/microvision-announces-completion-of-its-long-range-lidar)\n\nIt is interesting that Luminar never shows the internal structure of Iris. Luminar always shows only empty cases.\n\nMicrovision, on the other hand, can use inexpensive plastic because Microvision does not use moving parts.\n\nThe mechanical components in the Luminar Lidar are not likely to be cheap to produce either, but they are much cheaper than the production of the many mechanical components, as **Luminar** **requires** **many machines** **such as** **lathes** **and milling machines** **for** **this,** **on** **which they** **have to be** **turned and milled to extremely low** **tolerances,** **for** **example**.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSources: Luminar [Q1 Update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_KGdSMOZdc&amp;feature=emb_logo) and [Q2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxmSsHsaDKc)\n\nPlease watch these videos, how complex the production of the Luminar Lidar is, while Microvision (see photo above) only has to assemble printed circuit boards, connect them and insert them into a housing. These differences are the reason why Luminar Lidar- System will never be able to produce as cheap as Microvision:\n\n* [The Path to Series Production: Q1 Update - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_KGdSMOZdc&amp;feature=emb_logo)\n* [The Path to Series Production: Q2 Update - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxmSsHsaDKc&amp;t=118s)\n\nThat's also why it takes Luminar two years just to set up production, while Microvision has developed a completely new system and can produce it in that time. Above is also Luminar's schedule (from [The Path to Series Production: Q1 Update - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_KGdSMOZdc&amp;feature=emb_logo)).\n\nCosts increase in manufacturing the lower the tolerances have to be. The lower the tolerances that have to be maintained during production, the more expensive they are. The **costs** **do not** **increase linearly,** **but** **rather** **exponentially**.\n\nIt goes without saying that only very low tolerances can be permitted here for the control of a laser beam, which certainly go to the limits of what is feasible.\n\nThis means that the **manufacturing costs** are certainly **many** **times** **higher** **than those of** **Microvision** due\n\n* to the high-precision machines\n* very precise tools required\n* **Luminar** **lidar** **consists** **of** **many more individual** **parts** **and**\n* significantly higher costs for quality assurance and testing.\n\n**Luminar ends up doing what Microvision does on a chip basis (MEMS), controlling a laser beam, the old-fashioned way via mechanical components like shafts and a belt drive. See patent drawing before.**\n\nThe result is not only a much larger device, much poorer resolution due to the limitations of the Luminar concept (e.g. moving masses, inertia, etc.) but also much higher cost to manufacture simply due to the large number of components.\n\n**Luminar** **thus** **undoubtedly** **needs** **significantly more** **material,** **more machinery** **and more personnel** **to produce a lidar** **system,** since **more** **steps** **are** **required** due to the large number of mechanical parts **and** **a high degree of** **automation does** **not** **seem** **possible**.\n\nThe Microvision Lidar can be assembled on almost any (automated) assembly line for smartphones or computers, since it consists of nothing more than a housing, computer chips and circuit boards, just like any smartphone, notebook or computer.\n\n**It** **can therefore be assumed that** **Luminar** **Iris** **is** **significantly more expensive to** **manufacture than** **Microvision Lidar.**\n\nScalability\n\nSince Microvision apparently does not have **any moving** **mechanical parts** to finish and therefore **does** **not** need any **special machines,** but will be able to use virtually any production line for smartphones or computers, there are not **only the correspondingly** **high** **costs** **for** **their** **own** **factories** **as** **Luminar** **needs** **them** and is also currently creating, but the **scalability and thus** **the** **deliverability is** **significantly** **higher**.\n\nSmartphones are now manufactured in quantities of hundreds of millions per year. Computers in similar orders of magnitude. **Consequently,** **it** **should** **not** **be difficult for Microvision to produce** **almost** **any number** **of** **units** **required if a** **mass** **producer** **such as** **Foxconn** **is** **commissioned**.\n\nDevelopment status\n\nWhile Luminar is still testing the stopping in front of a dummy on a short test section at low speed according to the last published videos, Microvision has already a company specialized in such tests with its own employees to test on a company-owned test track at high speeds. The following presentation of Luminar shows the current progress:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSources: Luminar and [Microvision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlG222Ybyvg)\n\nCustomers and partners\n\nA distinction must be made between customers (= companies that actually buy larger quantities of the products) and partners (= companies with whom contacts exist, e.g. for development, testing, etc., but who do not buy much or anything).\n\nCustomers\n\nLuminar does not have any known customers who purchase larger quantities for their end products. In fact, Luminar has not published any order intake to date.\n\nFor Microvision, the same is true for its Lidar division. In the other business areas, however, Microvision has already achieved sales in the double-digit million-dollar range, almost exclusively with Tier 1 companies, such as Sony, Sharp, Microsoft:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [Microvision](https://www.microvision.com/) October 2021 and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/buy)\n\nUnlike Luminar, Microvision is recognized as a supplier by market-leading companies and has already demonstrated the ability to deliver products of the required quality in high volume that are e.g. in use by the US Army through the Microsoft IVAS.\n\nPartners\n\nThis refers to companies that have some kind of agreement for something.\n\nLuminar lists many partners who do pay for development systems and services.\n\nMicrovision is run by techies who shun publicity. Luminar, on the other hand, is led by a \"sunny boy\" and startup CEO [Austin Russell](https://nypost.com/2020/12/04/luminar-chief-austin-russell-25-is-billionaire-after-ipo/).\n\nMicrovision has been in contact with Tier 1 automakers for years ([Q2 2021](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1384295b36c7ce41a69ebebc0424ca35/microvision/db/1111/9864/file/MVIS%2BQ2%2B2021%2BAugust%2B4%2C2021%2BWebcast%2BTranscript%281%29.pdf)):\n\n&gt;*Europeans* *OEMs* *and* ***Tier*** ***1s in Germany*** *have* *been the* ***most*** ***active*** ***in*** ***ADAS*** ***space***\\*,\\* *mostly* *because* *of* *regulation,* *ADAS* *held to* *safety* *and* *beyond.* ***As we*** ***have*** ***mentioned before,*** ***we*** ***have*** ***been actively*** ***promoting*** ***our*** ***technology*** ***in Germany*** ***since*** ***2019***\\*.\\*\n\nTier 1 car manufacturers in Germany are (only):\n\n* Volkswagen with the group brands VW, Audi, Porsche, etc.\n* Mercedes\n* BMW\n\n**This** **suggests** **which companies** **Microvision** **might** **be** **negotiating** **with at** **the** **moment**.\n\nConfidence of the CEO in his own company\n\n[The Luminar CEO is currently selling $200 million of his own stock](https://investors.luminartech.com/node/7546/html) \\- before the first product is even sold.\n\n**This** **shows** **the** **CEO's** **dwindling confidence** **in his** **own** **company**.\n\nLeadership\n\nNot to forget the excellent CEO Microvision has, who has done an **extremely** **good** **job** in a very short time (two years) and has the qualifications to lead Microvision to the world market leader in lidar systems and smart glasses. This is where his experience and qualification pays off which the Luminar CEO does not have.\n\n**His** **personal** **commitment** **and enthusiasm for** **success** **should also** **be** **emphasized**. While the Luminar CEO only appeared at the IAA in Munich for photo opportunities, the Microvision CEO was on site every day to meet with customers.\n\nPotential gains in lidar division for Microvision\n\nApproximately 70 million passenger cars are produced worldwide every year. In addition, there are trucks, etc.\n\nAs stated, 2-4 lidar systems are needed for cars, which **would** **correspond to** an **annual** **number** **of** **about** **150-300** **million units**.\n\n**If Microvision could achieve just 10% share, thus selling 15-30 million units per year, that would equate to $750 million to $1.5 billion in annual profits at just $50 earnings per unit.**\n\n**At a very conservative P/E of 10, the market cap would then have to be $7.5 billion to $15 billion. That would equate to a share price of about $50-$100.**\n\nMicrovision is thus undervalued not only relative to Luminar, but also relative to the expected gutters in the next few years. The author also assumes that Microvision will achieve a significantly higher market share than only 10%.\n\n**The current Luminar stock price of about $15 is equivalent to a Microvision stock price of $30, since Luminar has issued almost exactly twice as many shares as Microvision.**\n\nPrecise forecasts (volumen, profit margin) are difficult. However, it can be assumed that - as with airbags - **lidar systems will soon be installed in almost all cars by few suppliers.** The market will likely consolidate quickly - because of Microvision's technical superiority with Microvision at the top.\n\nConclusion\n\nConclusion remains: **Luminar** **has** **no future** **as** **a** **lidar** **manufacturer** **due to** **its** **already** **fundamentally** **outdated and non-performing** **hardware base**. At least not with large car manufacturers. Luminar could only specialize in software.\n\n**Microvision, on the other hand, has the best chance in the market for lidar systems for self-driving cars because of its technically superior hardware base that has been proven in mass-market products such as the Microsoft HoloLens 2.**\n\nMicrovision is also very much at an advantage, as mass production will start as early as this year, while Luminar is not scheduled to start until late 2022.\n\nIn addition, the **excellent,** **efficient** **and highly** **qualified management** **and development** **team** is certainly **superior** **to** **Luminar**. It has developed the Microvision Lidar from scratch to production readiness in only two years, while the Luminar team needs two years longer.\n\n**Therefore, it is only a matter of (probably short time) that Microvision receives the first orders from large automotive companies like Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW etc. This makes short selling of shares very risky.**\n\n**Orders can come** **in daily.** **Also, at** **some point** **stock** **buyers** **may recognize** **the massive undervaluation of** **Microvision** **stock** **in** **comparison to Luminar** **and at** **the same time initiate a short** **squeeze,** **which could** **lead to** **a price of** **$60 per** Microvision share. **$30 per Microvision share currently corresponds to the market capitalization of Luminar**.\n\nWhat has also gone completely **unnoticed** in the discussion is that **Microvision Lidar** **is** **probably the** **only** **system** **in the world that is fully immune to light** **from** **other** **lidar** **systems**.\n\n**Other manufacturers specify this only for sunlight as discussed before.**\n\n**However, this is one of the most important features for lidar systems to meet. Microvision also proved this as the only company at the IAA by having two lidar systems facing each other.**\n\nMany cars constantly encounter each other at the same time, on roads, in parking lots, etc. When they dazzle each other, accidents are inevitable. That's why Microvision is probably the only company, which shows this in a video. **The others** **just** **can't** **do it as far as known.**\n\n**This** **technological** **breakthrough**\\*\\*,\\*\\* **which has** **so far** **been completely** **disregarded in the** **valuation of** **the stock,** **is** **a** **very big** **competitive advantage** \\- along with the others such as resolution, form factor, etc.\n\nThat's why here is the link to the Microvision video again. **This** **technology** **alone** **could make an** **advantage of** **billions** **of** **dollars** **in profits** **and make Microvision the** **market** **leader**:\n\nVideo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK3t8zFcl3I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK3t8zFcl3I)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Other business areas\n\nNot included in this analysis are the other business areas. While Luminar has no other businesses, Microvision is the market leader in AR glasses, at least for projectors (see Microsoft HoloLens 2), and also offers [solutions ](https://www.microvision.com/solutions/other-solutions/)for HUD, interactive projectors, consumer lidar. **The solution for** **smart** **glasses** **can have a similar** **success as** **the one for** **lidar** **systems.**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSource: [Microvision](https://www.microvision.com/solutions/other-solutions/)",

Gaming revenue \u2014 all those RTX 30 series graphics cards \u2014 hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates.\n\n# Crypto Market dependence\n\nWhen of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company\u2019s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs.\n\nFor Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell **$400 million** worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just **$266 million.**\n\n# Future Growth In the Gaming Segment\n\nNVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates\u00a0that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. \n\n# Arm Deal\n\nNvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it.\n\n# Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD\n\nAMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record\u00a050% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech](https://preview.redd.it/faswa7u5dgr71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99fdf6382da174aa1c34fff4ffb72dab7abaa7f2)\n\n#  Q2 Earnings And Growth\n\nOn July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform \"Steam\" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded\u00a030%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market.\n\n[ AMD website - q2 Financial results](https://preview.redd.it/jjeh28b8dgr71.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1194ec52ebd44ff97c9ae9686ff69f63d4787d4b)\n\n#  Video Games Potential Growth\n\nVideo game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from\u00a0last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected\u00a0to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected\u00a0to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024.\n\n**AMD** supplies\u00a0semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for **Nintendo**'s Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell\u00a025.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022.\n\n# Xilinx Acquisition\n\nAMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx\u00a0is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly.\n\n# Intel ~ $INTC\n\nIntel\u2019s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It\u2019s struggled with R&amp;D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%.\n\nIntel fell behind **TSMC** in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to **AMD** in PC and data center CPU markets.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL](https://preview.redd.it/sxqjttladgr71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b541cb7bc838e7c7ddb580196ebc1e085bedce22)\n\n#  New CEO = New Future?\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia.\n\nIf Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again.\n\n# GPUs War\n\nIntel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from **Nvidia** and **AMD**, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.\n\n# Financial Comparisons\n\n[Market Size](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Market%20Cap?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit)\n\n1.

Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***Personal note:*** *Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.*\n\n**Sources:**  \n[Jika.io](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Revenue?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit) \\- Companies comparisons  \n[Motleyfool.com](https://motleyfool.com/) \\- stocks news  \n[nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com/) \\- news and information  \n[amd.com](https://amd.com/) \\- investor relations  \n[investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/) \\- investor relations",

        "selftext": "Hi, I have a few thoughts on intel and would like some discussion around it. I think it's a great long term value investment right now and would input. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Finances**\n\n- Market Cap: ~220b\n\n- P/E: ~12\n\n- 80b revenue\n\n- 2.58% dividend\n\n- P/E much lower than industry average, and much better than competitors (Intel @12, AMD @36)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bear case arguments:**\n\n**Failure to deliver**\n\nThe biggest argument I hear against Intel, is that they have failed to deliver, again and again. That it's a value trap and is a slowly sinking ship. AMD is rapidly stealing market share. I will address these with bull points under growth &amp; management below.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Shrinking market share**\n\nTheir % market share has barely declined, yet the market is pricing them as if they had been decimated.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Using TSMC is giving up on its own fabs**\n\nI will address this below, it's actually super bullish for Intel long term and is great for transitioning to their new fabs (under construction).\n\nhttps://www.techradar.com/news/intel-locks-down-all-remaining-tsmc-3nm-production-capacity-boxing-out-amd-and-apple\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Please let me know others, which I will investigate.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bull case arguments:**\n\n**Good products, high demand, too big to fail**\n\n- There is a global shortage for semiconductors at the moment. Demand is constantly increasing as basically all new devices utilize semiconductors in one way or another. As long as intel can keep building chips, there will be buyers.\n\n- Intel is 'too big to fail' in the USA. The US military and government rely on their chips. They need US factories and companies to build these chips. They are not going to design their military chips in Taiwan, especially with the increased global tensions. The US military alone will continue to prop up intel if things go south.\n\n- Intel still controls ~77.5% of the x86 market share.  \u200bhttps://www.extremetech.com/computing/325848-amd-x86-cpu-market-share-soars-hits-14-year-high\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Growth &amp; management**\n\nThe biggest argument I hear against intel, is that they have been unable to deliver, again and again. That it's a value trap. I argue that it was mainly an issue with management, of which they have a completely changed. It will be a non-issue moving forward.\n\n- Their next gen cpu's (alder lake) leaks suggest that they outperform amd 5950x in both single &amp; multithreaded benchmarks. We will know for sure in early nov (nov 4th, rumoured release date). If true, this hints towards a turnaround already starting and that they are resolving their issues. https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2021/09/27/new-benchmark-leak-reveals-impressive-performance-of-intels-12900k-12700k-and-12600k-alder-lake-processors/ \n\n\n- Intel has basically bought out all of TSMC's 3nm nodes (https://www.techspot.com/news/90780-intel-has-reportedly-secured-majority-tsmc-3nm-production.html). This is insanely good news for the long term outlook of Intel. At a high level, it appears that Intel is giving up on their own fabs and are on the decline. Looking deeper, I strongly disagree. Intel's previous CEO refused to use TSMC or anything beyond their own FABS to save face. They kept digging a deeper and deeper hole and falling further and further behind. Gelsinger (new CEO) acknowledges these issues, and is heavily investing (&gt;$120b) into new FABS, and using TSMC in the meantime to stay relevant, while transitioning to their new fabs.\n\n- Their new fabs are using ASML's next gen tech (ie: ASML's EUV chip-printing machines). Intel will get them before TSMC &amp; Samsung. There have been many closed door meeting between Gelsinger (intels new CEO) and ASML. https://fortune.com/2021/09/10/intel-ceo-big-honking-fab-planned-eu-europe-most-advanced/\n\n&gt; Thanks to an agreement the Intel CEO struck with his immediate counterpart at ASML, whom Gelsinger has already met three times face-to-face in the six months since taking the helm, the Intel facility should be the first to employ the Dutch company\u2019s upcoming \u201chigh numerical aperture\u201d EUV chip-printing machines. (ASML customers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., known as TSMC, and Samsung are on a waiting list, however.)\n\n&gt; This second generation evolution of ASML\u2019s extreme ultraviolet photolithography can reduce the size of transistors\u2014the building blocks of integrated semiconducting circuits\u2014to just 20 angstroms (\u00c5). That would make them less than a third in length of the current seven-nanometer nodes found in many of today\u2019s smartphones. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Management changed. This is the biggest point for me. They booted out the bean counters, and replaced them with engineers. Gelsinger (new CEO) was the CTO of intel during their glory years and is known as being a super strong / smart engineer. In my opinion, an engineer leading intel is more likely to make the company succeed vs a finance guy trying to cut corners. He is credited with designing some of their flagship cpu's / architectures that made Intel relevant in the first place. He knows what has to be done.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger\n\n- Hopping into the GPU game. Intel is known for having a good integrated graphics team. I would think that they have enough experience to pull off the dedicated gpu. Time will tell. https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-claimed-to-be-officially-targeting-rtx-3070-performance-with-first-alchemist-gpu/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat are your thoughts? \n\n*Yardsale2*",

Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia.\n\nIf Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again.\n\n# GPUs War\n\nIntel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from **Nvidia** and **AMD**, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.\n\n# Financial Comparisons\n\n[Market Size](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Market%20Cap?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit)\n\n1.

Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***Personal note:*** *Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.*\n\n**Sources:**  \n[Jika.io](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Revenue?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit) \\- Companies comparisons  \n[Motleyfool.com](https://motleyfool.com/) \\- stocks news  \n[nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com/) \\- news and information  \n[amd.com](https://amd.com/) \\- investor relations  \n[investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/) \\- investor relations",

        "selftext": "Hi, I have a few thoughts on intel and would like some discussion around it. I think it's a great long term value investment right now and would input. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Finances**\n\n- Market Cap: ~220b\n\n- P/E: ~12\n\n- 80b revenue\n\n- 2.58% dividend\n\n- P/E much lower than industry average, and much better than competitors (Intel @12, AMD @36)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bear case arguments:**\n\n**Failure to deliver**\n\nThe biggest argument I hear against Intel, is that they have failed to deliver, again and again. That it's a value trap and is a slowly sinking ship. AMD is rapidly stealing market share. I will address these with bull points under growth &amp; management below.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Shrinking market share**\n\nTheir % market share has barely declined, yet the market is pricing them as if they had been decimated.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Using TSMC is giving up on its own fabs**\n\nI will address this below, it's actually super bullish for Intel long term and is great for transitioning to their new fabs (under construction).\n\nhttps://www.techradar.com/news/intel-locks-down-all-remaining-tsmc-3nm-production-capacity-boxing-out-amd-and-apple\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Please let me know others, which I will investigate.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bull case arguments:**\n\n**Good products, high demand, too big to fail**\n\n- There is a global shortage for semiconductors at the moment. Demand is constantly increasing as basically all new devices utilize semiconductors in one way or another. As long as intel can keep building chips, there will be buyers.\n\n- Intel is 'too big to fail' in the USA. The US military and government rely on their chips. They need US factories and companies to build these chips. They are not going to design their military chips in Taiwan, especially with the increased global tensions. The US military alone will continue to prop up intel if things go south.\n\n- Intel still controls ~77.5% of the x86 market share.  \u200bhttps://www.extremetech.com/computing/325848-amd-x86-cpu-market-share-soars-hits-14-year-high\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Growth &amp; management**\n\nThe biggest argument I hear against intel, is that they have been unable to deliver, again and again. That it's a value trap. I argue that it was mainly an issue with management, of which they have a completely changed. It will be a non-issue moving forward.\n\n- Their next gen cpu's (alder lake) leaks suggest that they outperform amd 5950x in both single &amp; multithreaded benchmarks. We will know for sure in early nov (nov 4th, rumoured release date). If true, this hints towards a turnaround already starting and that they are resolving their issues. https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2021/09/27/new-benchmark-leak-reveals-impressive-performance-of-intels-12900k-12700k-and-12600k-alder-lake-processors/ \n\n\n- Intel has basically bought out all of TSMC's 3nm nodes (https://www.techspot.com/news/90780-intel-has-reportedly-secured-majority-tsmc-3nm-production.html). This is insanely good news for the long term outlook of Intel. At a high level, it appears that Intel is giving up on their own fabs and are on the decline. Looking deeper, I strongly disagree. Intel's previous CEO refused to use TSMC or anything beyond their own FABS to save face. They kept digging a deeper and deeper hole and falling further and further behind. Gelsinger (new CEO) acknowledges these issues, and is heavily investing (&gt;$120b) into new FABS, and using TSMC in the meantime to stay relevant, while transitioning to their new fabs.\n\n- Their new fabs are using ASML's next gen tech (ie: ASML's EUV chip-printing machines). Intel will get them before TSMC &amp; Samsung. There have been many closed door meeting between Gelsinger (intels new CEO) and ASML. https://fortune.com/2021/09/10/intel-ceo-big-honking-fab-planned-eu-europe-most-advanced/\n\n&gt; Thanks to an agreement the Intel CEO struck with his immediate counterpart at ASML, whom Gelsinger has already met three times face-to-face in the six months since taking the helm, the Intel facility should be the first to employ the Dutch company\u2019s upcoming \u201chigh numerical aperture\u201d EUV chip-printing machines. (ASML customers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., known as TSMC, and Samsung are on a waiting list, however.)\n\n&gt; This second generation evolution of ASML\u2019s extreme ultraviolet photolithography can reduce the size of transistors\u2014the building blocks of integrated semiconducting circuits\u2014to just 20 angstroms (\u00c5). That would make them less than a third in length of the current seven-nanometer nodes found in many of today\u2019s smartphones. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Management changed. This is the biggest point for me. They booted out the bean counters, and replaced them with engineers. Gelsinger (new CEO) was the CTO of intel during their glory years and is known as being a super strong / smart engineer. In my opinion, an engineer leading intel is more likely to make the company succeed vs a finance guy trying to cut corners. He is credited with designing some of their flagship cpu's / architectures that made Intel relevant in the first place. He knows what has to be done.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger\n\n- Hopping into the GPU game. Intel is known for having a good integrated graphics team. I would think that they have enough experience to pull off the dedicated gpu. Time will tell. https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-claimed-to-be-officially-targeting-rtx-3070-performance-with-first-alchemist-gpu/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat are your thoughts? \n\n*Yardsale2*",
