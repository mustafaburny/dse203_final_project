        "selftext": "(This was my response to a young investor here. Thought I might just post it, I like to lurk but whatever. Some edits have been made.)\n\nFor what it is worth this is my advise:\n\nSAVING IS HARD. Unless you were born to wealth it is hard. Sometimes even saving $5 is hard, and as you climb up in life there are always new things you will see to spend your money on. \n\n#1 if you see money laying on the ground PICK THAT UP. IT'S FREE MONEY. People throw money down because they don't know what money is really worth or what money can do. PICK IT UP AND POCKET THAT. NEVER THROW MONEY DOWN, NOT EVEN A PENNY. Damn, I hate seeing money on the ground. Even that penny was some time or labor earned, dont disregard that time and labor. \n\nTry to use your money earned to make you happy, but put some back. Even if it is only $5 this week, but you wanted to go out and have a good steak. \n\nIf you did not grow up with a family that knows how money works you need to educate yourself. They won't teach you in school. You either need family to teach you or you will have to learn on your own. Go to your library and read finance books, subscribe to some financial magazines, and watch YouTube, or go to broker sites and go through their online education stuff. TDA (not that I'm a fan of them or anything), Fidelity both have some good reading and watching. \n\nMy grandfather was born in the great depression to a pretty poor family, joined the navy, became a cop and spent 1960 (he was 30 when this got intresting to him) the day he died, investing and trying to learn this shit and tried to teach me what he found out, and I have spent the last 20+ years doing it too. I've gotten pretty good at what I can find and I'm 41, still think I'm not all that good at it, but I could still just say F it and retire today if I wanted to. Make no mistake, if you do not have generational support you have a lot to do, make sure you pass on what you learn. I try to educate my friends and family that will listen, but I feel like a blowhard sometimes. \n\nGo to seminars, or online live stuff. Learn the financial products and how to use them. Learn how to read company financials and how to interpret it. \n\nNone of this takes a huge amount of time. Spend 5 or 10 hours a week doing this instead of watching tv, reading fantasy, playing games (or working, fuck the man).  \n\nIn 1 year you will be ahead of 90% of others. \n\nDon't believe what financial media is telling you, by the time you hear it from them it's already over and the big boys are looking for bag holders. You have to learn how to do your own due diligence. Never believe anything you can't verify.  Pretty sure CrMer was shouting to buy lemanbrothers in 2008... that worked out well?\n\nBroad market ETFs are seeming more and more like those bundled loan securities pre 2008. Looks like we might see more losers than winner soon, but I could be wrong.... do your research. \n\nI like managed funds. Vanguard and Fidelity have their reputation for a GOOD reason, and they have their own clearing houses. \n\nPick a solid broker, read above. \n\nGet a ROTH and max it before anything else, then standard IRA, then brokerage. Try hard as hell to get 6 months or 1 year of savings to cover basic expenses. \n\nDon't be afraid to gamble a little every now and then, but don't make a r/WSB yolo 90% of your portfolio. Unless that's your risk tolerance... investing really is ALL ON YOU. (You can [and I have] make good money on a meme stock, but pIck an entry and exit; you do NOT need a 1000% gain, a 10% gain is PROFIT, AND PROFIT: IS PROFIT.)\n\nStart with managed ETFs, mutual funds, then maybe some passive ETFs that track indexes. Then, Once you  have your feet wet, and have some cash in savings (don't forget that inflation will take cash out of your pocket, but a market correction could take more [it's a balancing act]) Try some stock picking.\n\nAfter you have set yourself up  try picking some stocks. Look long term, 10+ years. I like inovationers or solid old companies that just truck along and pay dividends. Healthcare, biotech, chips, multifamily REITs are what I'm in. Go global too. \n\nMaybe after you are set long term, try short term picks. It really is all about risk and risk tolerance. \n\nAfter you have a little bank roll sell some options. Sell cash covered puts for stocks you like or own and want more of for a lesser price. Sell covered calls on stocks you have, and this can lower your cost basis.  \n\nDon't do naked calls, dont short sell. Avoid Infinite risk, but know what your risk is and go for it if you think you might have a win. \nIf you bet $500 on a play that could get you 5k I call that an ok gamble, IF you can take a $500 risk. \n\nIf you are not from a family already rich now, its about getting rich in 10, 20, or 30 years. Save now. Learn how this works, have capital for down turns (buy dips and crashes), and ride the waves. This is a lot easier if you are young and have the time to ride it out while you wage slave. \n\nLook at any chart of any index over 20 or 30 or even 100 years, guess what ..... stocks go up.\n\nDon't try to out think the market. Go with the flow. Follow the waxing and waning. Markets move through rotations just like tides in the sea. Move with it, not against it. \n\nDONT PANIC. \n\nDon't trade with emotion, do your due diligence and analysis, and. stick. to. your. plan.\n\nLearn how to make a budget and include your investments into it.\n\nBuy 1 or 2 realestate properties. Everything you invest after purchase price is considered a loss and can offset your tax burden (even if it adds value).\n\n\nLearn some hedges. I take a 1% stake against my positions with 1yr puts or calls every year. If I'm down in a year I'll take a 1% value call option. If I'm up I'll take a 1% put a year out. Its like insurance. And believe me, it CAN and WILL save your ass. \n\nTime in the market vs timing the market ... time in always wins, but having bad timing can set you back a long time. \n\nAnyway, at the end of the day... just do something. \n\nDo not disregard other avenues of investment either. Realestate, income property, land, art, farms, cattle (it's a big one where I'm from), antiques, clasic cars (but that might be over after all the boomers are gone [I'm gen X and still remember the smell of them (and that is a real thing kids)]. \n\nTry not to fall into investment fads.\n\nWhen I was a kid these collectors thought these stupid bennie baby things and pogs were for life.... if those dumb*sses would have bought $AAPL instead they wouldn't still have tubs of useless, multicolored, cute cotton, whatever animal like things they would have yachts. Those damb card games are another one, yes I do have some Magic gathering cards worth some money, but I didn't buy it as an investment, I was a geek who liked playing the game with my friends.\n\nAnd buy some $GME. Even 2 shares. That shit is crazy, who knows what will happen.\n\n\n*I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a dude on the internet sharing what he has learned. Nothing should be taken as any type of financial advise, but everyone should save some money and invest with using their own risk tolerance and the help of a certified financial adviser (not me).*",

A passively managed account [explained by investopedia here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-difference-between-passive-and-active-portfolio-management.asp) means the bank or institution will invest your savings as they choose:  \n\n&gt;Passive portfolio management mimics the investment holdings of a particular index in order to achieve similar results. \n\nThis gives them a lot of leeway, but people trust that big banks have the smartest minds managing funds, and \"[fiduciary obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp)\" will require them to use those minds to act in my best interests, right??\n\n[from investopedia](https://preview.redd.it/3erffg0840u61.png?width=547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24524b7948798f4698b338a66b6903787417dad4)\n\nWell, over the past 4 months of intense brain wrinkling, I learned that many brilliant minds think that a market crash is unavoidable in the near future.

My experience was unsettling- I learned that their retirement savings were in passively managed accounts through large institutions.  My mom had chosen how \"risky\" she wanted her investments to be- she chose a 50/50 plan, she said- and let the institution allocate accordingly.\n\nTurns out her investments are in 60% stocks, **40% bonds.**  My dad has even more in bonds than that.  I realize that this is a very common investment strategy for retirement funds, and in most markets provides a dependable, unchanging amount of money back-per-investment.\n\nDependable, unless you're concerned about a market crash, inflation, and [major dilution of the bonds market.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/flood-of-new-debt-tests-bond-market-11615372201)\n\n# BONDS WILL NOT PROTECT INVESTMENTS AGAINST INFLATION.

That advisor had moved his parents' funds *almost entirely out of bonds,* ***and started doing so over four years ago.***  Neither of his parents work any more- they're entirely dependent on that money for the rest of their lives- it's not something they would take any risks with.  Knowing that, their advisor *still* made this move *and* went so far as to give his parents a book, [\"Be an Owner, Not a Loaner\"](https://prezi.com/nwnd3jgtqff5/be-an-owner-not-a-loaner/), explaining the difference between how bonds and stocks would retain value based on current market conditions.  \n\nYet here were *my* parents, having chosen low levels of risk, having their money being invested in ***40%+ in bonds.***  \n\nIf you check out [J.P. Morgan's retirement guide here,](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/retirement-insights/guide-to-retirement/) they actually recommend a portfolio of **60% bonds** if you have \"medium-term goals\" like college or home loans.\n\n[from JP's retirement guide](https://preview.redd.it/hls1v5gxc3u61.png?width=493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17cef635a9c36e4de89e239aee4baf7997723298)\n\n[Goldman Sach's retirement guide](https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/fund-literature/brochure/brochure-model-portfolio.pdf?sa=n&amp;rd=n) is similar, explaining that the lowest-risk portfolios are those with the most money into bonds.\n\n[\\\\\"Fixed Income\\\\\" refers to money allocated to bonds](https://preview.redd.it/qebo1tyhd3u61.png?width=453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf99f39a01eb55e1df19a17e42dcebee18fcefb5)\n\nSo.... according to the sacks at Sachs, my husband's retired parents have their money in the \"highest risk\" portfolio possible.  Which doesn't make sense based on everything I know and have linked above, *especially* if there's a debt bubble about to burst, and one good catalyst could trigger it.\n\nThen I happen to see this news posted: [**3 big banks hold largest bond sales ever this week.**](https://www.barrons.com/articles/goldman-sachs-bank-america-jpmorgan-bonds-dividends-51618602441)  Bank of america sold $15 billion worth, JP Morgan sold $13 billion worth, and Goldman Sachs sold $6 billion.

It's uncommon but things may go wrong and they me require you to update info or something else depending on your case**\n\n**5: ALL SHARES COMING FROM ROBINHOOD WILL BE ON MARGIN BY DEFAULT WHEN THEY TRANSFER INTO YOUR FIDELITY ACCOUNT**\n\n **(SEVERAL DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIVES HAVE TOLD ME THAT IN ROBINHOODS TERMS AND SERVICE YOU AGREE TO YOUR ACCOUNT BEING A MARGIN ACCOUNT EVEN IF YOU SWITCH IT OFF)**\n\n**AS SOON AS YOU SEE YOUR TRANSFER COMPLETED AND THE SHARES ARE IN YOUR ACCOUNT, YOU MUST CALL FIDELITY AND REQUEST THE SHARES BE TAKEN OFF MARGIN. THIS USUALLY HAPPENS INSTANTLY BUT IT TAKES YOUR SHARES 24 HOURS TO SETTLE AFTER A TRANSFER, THAT IS WHEN YOU CAN EXPECT THEM TO BE OFF MARGIN.**\n\n\n**GO YOU BEAUTIFUL SMOOTH BRAINS, FLY OUT OF ROBINHOOD ASAP!!!! I WISH YOU LUCK**\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nEdit: **wow bots are attacking this post with downvotes already**\n\nEdit:**Transfers only start on business days so mine officially started monday and was in my account by tuesday evening.

Paysafe just went public through a reverse merger SPAC, and has been trading on the NYSE for less than a week. This is like getting in bed with Square at $15/share.\n\nHere are 8 reasons to believe\ud83d\ude4c:\n\n1. Bill Foley is behind the merger. The man is a legend in Financial Services and has a strong history of value creation, having led five separate multibillion-dollar public market platforms that completed over 100 acquisitions. Think Fidelity National Financial, Fidelity Information Services, Black Knight Financial, Dun &amp;amp; Bradstreet, Ceridian. You know, small companies. \ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcb0\n\n2. Founded in 1996, Paysafe is a leading global payments provider focused on digital commerce and iGaming transactions. The global online gambling market size was valued at USD 53.7 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% from 2020 to 2027. \ud83d\udcc8\n\n3. Paysafe holds the No. 2 market share position in the global digital wallet market. The company\u2019s digital wallet is in over 120 markets and has customers like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ: DKNG) and William Hill. The company has 3.8 million active users for its digital wallet segment.\n\n4. Paysafe is No. 1 in the iGaming eCash network segment. Customers for this segment include Fortnite, Twitch and Spotify Technologies (NYSE: SPOT).\n\n5. The company estimates that its 2021 payment volume will hit $103 billion. \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0Billion with a B! Revenue of $1.5 billion is estimated for fiscal 2021. Paysafe said revenue will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 11% from 2020 to 2023.\n\n6. The digital wallet segment is expected to have $441 million in revenue for 2021 with a 1.9% take on transactions. This represents 29% of the company\u2019s 2021 revenue.\n\n7. The eCash segment has 12 million active users and $5 billion in payment volume. This segment has a take of 6.8% and is expected to have 2021 revenue of $318 million.\n\n8. The integrated processing segment has over $75 billion in payment volume and a 1% take. This segment is expected to have revenue of $764 million in fiscal 2021, representing 50% of the company\u2019s total.\n\nMind you THIS IS NOT A STARTUP! It\u2019s a profitable company with a proven track record, robust sales and a lucrative Total Addressable Market within reach. It\u2019s a long term hold for sure, but with the core drivers outlined above I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll see this as a 10x bagger in less than 5 years. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udcc8\n\nPositions: 600 shares @ $16.45  \n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/online-gambling-market\n\n[Investor Deck](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp-II-and-Paysafe-investor-presentation.",

        "selftext": "Paysafe reports a substantial $362 million in free cash flow, projects healthy double digit revenue growth, strong and growing EBITDA margins to support its M&amp;A plans but the stock's recent pounding has brought the bears out in force, with some dubious arguments. Sorry for the length here, but I thought I'd address them all in one post:\n\nFirst, here\u2019s Paysafe's Q1 minimum guidance to meet or beat on May 11 ER:\n\n\t$360 million revenue\n\n\t$220 million gross profit\n\n\t$105 million EBITDA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCommon arguments addressed here:\n\n\\#1 Too much debt, they are going to borrow more.\n\n\\#2 Complex regulatory landscape / no MOAT\n\n\\#3 Blackstone made 3X and will sell\n\n\\#4 Growth by acquisition is risky and difficult\n\n\\#5 No growth\n\n\\#6 Slow growth\n\n\\#7 Not profitable\n\n\\#8 Old business\n\n\\#9 It\u2019s a SPAC\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#1) Too much debt.  Paysafe just paid down $1.1 billion in debt. Why would they turn around and borrow again?  Their path to EBITDA margin growth (21% CAGR) is what will pay for M&amp;A expansion. Their 3.6X Debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintech peers.  Debt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to service debt.  Most fintech competitors have negative EBITDA putting them at higher risk (Higher ratio is worse.) :\n\nSquare: 77.8X\n\nRepay : 8.7X\n\nFiserv : $21.2B / $4.7B : 4.5 X\n\nGPN : $10.27B / $2.8B : 3.67X\n\nShift4 : $1.8B / -$8M : negative EBITDA\n\nAffirm : $1.67B / -77.6M negative EBITDA\n\nPaysign : $4.3M / -$5.79M : negative EBITDA \n\nBill : $947M / -43.85M : negative EBITDA\n\nDepending on whether you include SQ and AFRM, the combined multiples of these competitors, whether by EV/EBITDA, EV/free cash flow or EV/revenue, puts Paysafe\u2019s share price in the $45 to $90 range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#2) Complex regulatory landscape / no MOAT.  Bill Foley has repeatedly said that Paysafe's \u201cunrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise,\u201d is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s MOAT. This is the reason they are able to dominate globally in sports betting/iGaming and are expanding to serve the underbanked and unbanked, spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant to enter due to risk and complexity.  As they lean into their regulatory lead, PayPal's former CRO has joined Paysafe and a multi-jurisdictional regulatory expert has recently joined their Board of Directors.\n\nFrom SEC filed transcript (1) - Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh:  \u201cTo be a true global player in the iGaming space, the level of payments regulation, of gaming regulation and certification is very, very complex. When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be a winner in this space, you\u2019re catering to some incredibly demanding clients. They want to be global, they want multiple APMs, but they want you to understand payment regulation in hundreds of countries in gaming and gambling regulation in hundreds of countries. That\u2019s something that Paysafe has developed very, very successfully in every market we\u2019ve entered.\u201d \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#3) Blackstone made 3X and will sell.  The common myth is that Blackstone/CVC made 300% by paying $3 billion and receiving $9 billion.  The reality, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (2), is that Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private in 2017 for $3.9 Billion and they received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares on the deal. Adjusted for inflation, they paid $4.2 billion so it\u2019s basically a 33% return on a 4 year hold. \n\nImportantly, this came AFTER they grew revenue 65% ($864B to $1.426B), stewarded a billion in investments to grow the business, and the deal included paying down over $1.1 billion in debt. This suggests Foley cut a great deal for shareholders. It also explains why private equity has signaled that they'll stay on long term to reap much bigger gains through Foley\u2019s time-tested M&amp;A playbook. \n\nBlackstone itself says (3), \u201cThe term of private equity funds can be upwards of 7-10 years.\u201d With so much runway and comps pointing to a 3-4X valuation, why would Blackstone leave so much money on the table?\n\nBlackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler signals an ongoing interest in staying on: \u201cWe believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d \n\nIn a recent interview Foley said, private equity\u2019s plan to stay on was part of what encouraged PIPE to invest $2 billion: \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d\n\nThis trust was reiterated in the SEC filed FTAC\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination: \u201cCommitment of Paysafe\u2019s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such stockholders\u2019 belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects of Paysafe going forward.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#4) Growth by acquisition is hard. Bill  Foley's proven track record in quickly generating synergistic inorganic growth through M&amp;A, speaks for itself. Over the last five years  Foley has grow Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X  ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS  from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). The majority of that growth was inorganic value creation through M&amp;A. Foley says, \u201cThose  characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with  Paysafe.\u201d (1, 4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#5) No growth. It\u2019s true that Paysafe\u2019s revenue stagnated in 2020 due to Covid, but prior to that growth they reported a strong 27% CAGR (4,5): \n\n2017: $864 million rev\n\n2018 : $1.14 billion rev  (+32%)\n\n2019 : $1.418 billion rev  (+24%).\n\n2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)\n\nUnlike most fintechs, Paysafe is very diversified with heavy exposure to brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed by 2020 closures due to Covid.  During this market dislocation, they pivoted, \u201cexited low value referral channels\u201d and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and ecommmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.  \n\nLooking at other hard-hit brick-and-mortar payment processors like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:\n\n\u2014Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)\n\n\u2014 Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)\n\nThe averaged EV/EBITDA multiples of these two payment processors would put Paysafe\u2019s share price at $25\n\nTheir averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#6) Slow growth. Going forward, Paysafe conservatively projects $10%+ annual growth over the next two years but they are careful so say that those growth projections exclude M&amp;A plans and expansion in iGaming expected to grow at 55% CAGR over the next several years.  iGaming accounts for over a third of Paysafe\u2019s revenue so this growth is a significant exclusion. \n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso, who  recently initiated coverage with a $19 price target (6) said, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d \n\nSince he wrote that, here are some of the headlines indicating an upgrade to his price target:\n\n\t1.\t\"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n\n\t2.\t\"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n\n\t3.\tNew Hampshire: \"Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n\n\t4.\t\"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n\n\t5.\t\"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n\n\t6.\t\"Wyoming Legalizes Crypto Use for Online Sports Betting\"\n\n\t7.\t\u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n\n\t8.\t\"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n\n\t9.\t\u201cCaesars Entertainment \\[Paysafe partner\\] announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n\n\t10.\t\u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n\n\t11.\t\u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n\n\t12.\t\u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n\n\t13.\t\u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n\n\t14.\t\u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \\~12.5% (not far from Paysafe\u2019s 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter eliminating outliers with highest multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and do not have positive free cash flow.\n\n2. Using low end of Paysafe's projections and factors in debt and potential dilution.\n\n3. As noted Paysafe\u2019s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&amp;A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth.\n\n4. The above comps were taken during a market pull back and do not reflect fintech gains since Jamie Dimon\u2019s comments about them posing \"enormous competitive threats\" to banks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#7) Not profitable. Paysafe expects $900 million in gross profit with a healthy $500-560 million EBITDA (30% margin). These fintech competitors are trading at much higher multiples but have worse EPS than Paysafe: \n\nRepay: -0.67, \n\nAffirm : -2.18, \n\nNuvei : -1.08, \n\nPaysign : -0.19. \n\nBill : -0.62, \n\nShift4 : -0.43 \n\nAverage EV/EBITDA multiples of the above companies would put Paysafe's SP at $69\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#8) Old business. In this space, having many years of multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise is a plus. This is why Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a rapidly moving space that is expected to grow 10X. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market  volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected  to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d \n\nOn its face, it may not be sexy to the average person but Paysafe is consdered to be at the forefront in its field: Winner \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d and they are rapidly  expanding in US with new partnerships (just last 3 months: Coinbase,  Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto)\n\nTrustpilot (7) in Europe, where Paysafe is more known and used, rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d  (4.7/5 stars) with over 25,000 reviews, and Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.2/5  stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated \"bad\" (1.2/5  stars) with over 17,000 reviews.\n\nPaysafe has the No. 2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. They\u2019ve just integrated their digital wallet platforms, recently voted  \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d,  \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current  ecosystems\u201d and they\u2019ve enabled crypto-to-crypto trading (Bitcoin &amp; 26 other crypto-currencies).\n\nAside from Coinbase, Luckbox and Microsoft, they are partnered with Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, among many others. They are currently moving quickly to integrate their services to offer easier migration of eCash,  integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into global banking as a service to the 1.7 billion \u201dunbanked.\u201d  This doesn't sound like an old company resting on its laurels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#9) It\u2019s a SPAC. Maybe the best argument.  \n\nPaysafe has been tarred and feathered as a SPAC: guilty until proven innocent.  Even after ticker change, Cramer called it a SPAC in the same breath that he said, \u201cThere is something about Paysafe that may be the ultimate stock for this moment.\u201d(8) \n\nIt\u2019s a hard moniker to drop. Literally every bear article written on Paysafe has relied on saying it was suspect because it was a SPAC, saying things like because Chamath sold Virgin Galactic, Paysafe can't be trusted. By contrast the bull articles that bothered to explore the fundamentals generally came up with $24-25 price targets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I hold $600K in commons and warrants\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

        "selftext": "My fellow WSB apes: I wanted to take this opportunity to address my fellow $CLOVtards about what we've been seeing recently. Before you downvote/try to remove a CLOV post, there's been endless rumors on $CLOV: folks think we're primed for a short squeeze, we got woke fucks arguing gamma squeeze, then you got the classic daytraders hopping into the ticker with surging volume.\n\nLet's get something straight with $CLOV. We aren't fighting for a squeeze- this is a **once in a lifetime investment opportunity**. We see a lot of names trading on hype and other manufactured momentum these days, but $CLOV's current valuation, fundamentals, and mission are arguably amongst the most attractive in the market today.\n\n# What does Clover Health Investments (CLOV) actually do?\n\nPeople who just wade into names for the hell of it are surely screwed. But assuming this 4.3K member community are true Clovtards willing to hold this stock indefinitely, we are on the precipice of a bonanza. Clover competes in the Medicare Advantage space, which is on the verge of placing Original Medicare Plans.\n\nOriginial Medicare is a clusterfuck. Part A covers 80% of covered hospital expenses and Part B covers the equivalent percentage of covered doctors expenses. Private insurers fill the space for **Part C** (Medicare Advantage) and Part D (covers prescription drugs uncovered by Medicare).\n\n[As we can see, the Medicare Advantage market is heavily expanding. Market membership has spiked nearly 5X since 2005, and is projected to represent 51&amp;#37; of overall Medicare plans by 2030, a continuous increase from its massive 39&amp;#37; share in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/elle314lqtv61.png?width=1182&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42c966658c73dabbb0d40f693ddc101ccec48f55)\n\nOf course, Clover's primary mission is capturing market share within Medicare Advantage and slowly pressuring competitors. According to Clover itself, from 2019-2021, the company had 42,594; 58,056; and \\~70,000 members respectively. So as a rough guesstimate from this raw data alone, Clover's capture of the Medicare Advantage market has fluctuated between 0.19%, 0.24%, and 0.29% (assuming the TAM doesn't change in 2021 and CLOV misses on its membership projections).\n\n[The biggest Medicare Advantage players right now are United Healthcare \\(UNH\\) and Humana \\(HUM\\), capturing 44&amp;#37; of the market in 2020. At roughly 0.24&amp;#37; of the market in 2020, CLOV clearly has a long way to go, but this is an impressive 26.3&amp;#37; increase in market share!](https://preview.redd.it/h9f6ygkqqtv61.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06ed3c1eea536b6982b68f1f2d64cea7429b15f1)\n\nIf we consider the Medicare Advantage market's TAM is currently $270B and growing 14% annually, some quick arithmetic indicates Clover's market share of 0.24% at 26.3% growth equals just 0.063% of total growth. When considering the total market is growing at 14% annually, Clover represented just 0.4% of total market growth in 2020.\n\nThese are minuscule numbers indeed considering how young Clover is, but delving deeper into the numbers/what CLOV actually does provides investors a more reliable understanding into the MA market.\n\n# How is Clover performing, and how is it different?\n\n[As of October 2020, Clover holds roughly 8&amp;#37; MA market share across its current geographies, which consist of 74 counties and 7 states \\(8 in '21\\) that cover Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. Since these states all have at least 30&amp;#37;+ Medicare Advantage penetration, I really like Clover's strategy of locking down saturated markets and then eating up the rest.](https://preview.redd.it/8honcat1rtv61.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef30830ff0ad81428fc731b4e3b5c6add0871f3e)\n\n[Clover Health Investments is a rapidly growing company, intensely investing in R&amp;D\\/capital expenditures while forgoing near-term short-run profits. Essentially, if the 10-year ticking up scares you, CLOV probably isn't for you. If we compare full-year revenues between '19 and '20, we notice CLOV is growing at roughly 45.5&amp;#37; YoY. As part of the whole \\\\\"go-go growth club,\\\\\" the losses expectedly are piling up as CLOV fortifies its product. It is encouraging to see the firm close net losses to $91.6M in 2020, down from $364M in 2019 and $202M in 2018.](https://preview.redd.it/9kqm73x5rtv61.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82522a8fd181720c2c1d41337f6af8f8965eef81)\n\nSo we get the idea Clover is growing far faster than its competitors (albeit in a crowded, but ballooning) Medicare Advantage market. But what is it that distinguishes CLOV from big players like UNH, Humana, and CVS?\n\n# Fellow ape, meet The Clover Assistant!\n\n[https:\\/\\/medium.com\\/clover-off-the-charts\\/the-value-that-clover-assistant-provides-to-primary-care-d9ee157b8402 | A good article by Sophia Chang \\(Chief Clinical Informatics Officer at Clover\\)](https://preview.redd.it/r5houhtcrtv61.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2569f5249d153a2611f6463ea5007c41fbb1853)\n\nJust an ape's thoughts on Clover Assistant- no CS background so don't kill me :) But from what I can tell, Clover Assistant acts as a product offering you might see see from a big data analytics company like Palantir, only Clover is aimed at Primary Care Physicians/Practices and geared towards healthcare.\n\nIn the linked article Sophia Chang describes how the Clover Assistant reduces transaction costs in the industry by giving PCPs better insights into their clients' health, pre-existing conditions, contraindications, prescribed medications, and institutional guidelines for ailments like diabetes. Clover Assistant is able to continuously log all this information, updating it with regards to any changes in a patient's diagnosis, new treatments, or medications that are potentially effective.\n\nFurthermore, Ms. Chang's personal experiences with Clover Assistant render the software as more sophisticated than some data collection apparatus that transmits information in live time (imo). She describes in great detail how this product is going miles to help diabetic patients alone:\n\n* Using the Assistant while seeing Clover members automatically keeps PCPs up to date with the American Diabetes Association and American Heart Association guidelines\n* The Assistant is capable of **management recommendations** based on Clover's formulary and member's out-of-pocket costs; it can pinpoint specific medications that could be more effective against a patient's co-morbidities, like dealing with a diabetic with cardiovascular disease\n* The Assistant can also **suppress inappropriate recommendations,** so it would be smart enough to veto a high-dose statin therapy to someone with active liver disease\n* Finally, and as Ms. Chang accurately states, most importantly, The Assistant shares the **specific reasoning** why a recommendation is being made, to best support the PCP\n\nAll in all, the Clover Assistant clearly seems like a groundbreaking innovation for the healthcare, and more importantly/specifically the Medicare Advantage market. When considering other players in the field like UNH, CVS, and Humana, their strategies for offering private insurance are archaic and soon to be left behind. As the Medicare Advantage continues capturing more of the overall Medicare market, I believe the Clover Assistant will enable high sustained membership growth over the coming years. It seems like a no-brainer that doctors, physicians, dentists, and other PCPs would want a revolutionary software by their side instead of hoping their business will be streamlined for the challenges of the 21st century.\n\n# The Bottom Line\n\nIf you can see Clover Health's advantages over its fossil-like peers, believe in its growth story, and are willing to make a bet, I'd say ***now*** really is the time to start buying shares, calls, etc. (\\*not financial advice\\*). $CLOV stock currently trades at roughly $9.30/share, which is below the PIPE offering at $10/share (this is what Chamath personally paid, what Chamath's company Hedosophia paid, what Fidelity Investments paid, and below what I'm sure many other VCs/billionaires paid for this future giant).\n\nWe've also heard a lot of talk about short interest/volume/remaining float. While I personally own mostly shares (but am slightly interested in this topic considering I'm flooded into the 5/21 call line too), $CLOV really could soar with the right confluence of events. I wouldn't necessarily call this a squeeze though- what would you call TSLA's movement when it went from $28/share to $500+?\n\nI can't really say for sure what the short interest is, but we know for certainty it's at least 35% as of 4/15 (this doesn't factor in 50%+ short volume that came in the week after). It is also notable that Clover's CEO, Vivek Garipalli owns roughly 83.584M shares, equivalent to roughly 17% of the total shares outstanding. (This was a source of immense controversy recently- analysts didn't know whether or not to include this in the short float). Nevertheless, Garipalli's agreement indicates he can't sell a single share until $CLOV stock hits $30+ for at least 90 days, for whatever that's worth.\n\nWhen considering UNH, Humana, and CVS are all worth 50-100X right now, there definitely is a mismatch. Either the big players are incredibly overvalued when trading at a healthy 17X forward earnings, or $CLOV is going to be a $100 stock pretty soon. I guess we'll see.",

        "selftext": "Can I get a quick sanity check here from the experts?  I've been dabbling in options trading for the past year or so, typically buying calls.  With all the volatility around GME I decided maybe I should try and sell some covered calls on shares that I own and I want to make sure I'm doing this right.  The language around options trading always trips me up and I don't want to accidentally do something stupid.  Here's my trade ticket from Fidelity: [https://imgur.com/VgvBU5s](https://imgur.com/VgvBU5s)\n\nWhat I want to do is sell 1 call option on my 100 shares with a strike of $500 on 4/23 and I set a limit price of $4.00.  In my head, here is what I believe happens when I submit the order:\n\n1. When someone buys my call option I will immediately see $400 in cash show up in my Fidelity account.\n2. On market close 4/23 if GME is below $500 the option expires worthless, I get to keep the $400 premium and my 100 shares.\n3. On market close 4/23 if GME is at or above $500 the option is in the money and my 100 shares of GME get sold for $500 each to whomever bought the option and $50,000 will show up in my account for the shares.  Total profit would be $50,400.\n\nThe thing that REALLY trips me up on the trade ticket is the \"Max Loss UNLIMITED\" at the bottom.  I'm assuming thats there because if the price of GME is at $10,000/share (or Infinity!) on or before 4/23 I've lost the opportunity to sell my shares for that price?\n\nThanks in advance for the help!",

        "selftext": "Originally sourced by u/inverseyourself\n\nYou heard what I said. On or around June 10th. I wouldn't be saying this unless I was 100% sure. Edit: Confirmed June 11th.\n\nThis is because they said it themselves on their 10-K filed in March. First, go here: https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/55a92a3e-144e-4d2b-8ee6-930db9045593.\n\nThis is their 10-K. Now, go to page 40. Now, look at the asterisk connected to Item 40 of the 10-K.\n\nITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES\\ ** The information not otherwise provided herein that is required by Items 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 will be set forth in the definitive proxy statement relating to our 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on or around June 10, 2021 which is to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This definitive proxy statement relates to a meeting of stockholders involving the election of directors and the portions therefrom required to be set forth in this Form 10-K by Items 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 are incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction G(3) to Form 10-K.\n\nDid GameStop just drop one of the most important dates for this short squeeze event in an obscure footnote at the end of their 10-K? Yes. They didn't even mention it in the beginning. In fact, most of their 10-K eludes to the \"Annual Shareholders Meeting\" without putting a date at all.\n\nLast year, it was June 12th. See: https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-preliminary-voting-results-annual-meeting. This year, it's June 11th. See https://www.reuters.com/companies/GME.N/events .\n\nSo, what does this mean? Hm, no idea. But I know that a share recall last year by some of the biggest shareholders led to GameStop going from $2.50 to almost $16 a few months down. You know, the thingy where shorts were covering their shorts!\n\nLast year, GameStop gave until April 20th for shareholders to count themselves as voters, i.e. the \"record date.\" What that means is that brokerages had around two weeks to find all these shares being called back -- i.e. recalled. This explains the massive ramp up in volume prior to this date!\n\nNow, we all talk about this amorphous Texas law people are discussing in relation to the record date. First, a record date is simply the date by which voters qualify to vote if they actually own the shares i.e. not lent out. Second, what exactly is this Texas law? A few of you are saying that Texas law requires at least 60 days prior notice for the record date. A few others are saying SEC regs require 60 days for a share recall. NO. Guys, I call BS. I think both statements are wrong. LET'S CLEAR THE AIR:\n\nHere's the actual Texas statute, the Texas Business Organizations Code:\n\nSec. 21.357. RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSE OF SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING. The record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a shareholders' meeting or any adjournment of the meeting, as provided by the directors in accordance with Section 6.101, must be at least 10 days before the date of the shareholders' meeting.\n\nSee here: https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BO/htm/BO.21.htm\n\nTexas law actually says NOTHING about notice for this record date or a share recall. Rather, all it says is that the record date must be set AT LEAST 10 days BEFORE the annual shareholder's meeting. That's all, got it?! So let me repeat, the record date simply needs to be at least ten days prior to the shareholder's meeting. OK, in English: the record date where YOU need to have YOUR shares in YOUR legal possession to vote MUST BE AT LEAST TEN DAYS BEFORE the annual shareholder's meeting.\n\nNow onto notice. Last year, GameStop gave around 60 + days notice for the record date prior to the meeting. I know this because Justin Dopierla (DOMO dude) wrote about this date in his article on April 6, 2020, talking about the record date on April 20, 2020, for a shareholders meeting set on June 12, 2020. His brokerage basically on that day told him about the record date. We're right about that time now. Now, I'd link this article, but my DD yesterday was removed so many times, I'm not going to bother put it here.\n\nFor more confirmation, I'm pretty sure I'm right about this. A corporate law firm wrote about this procedure in a handbook of theirs:\n\nIII. SETTING THE RECORD DATE All state corporate statutes allow for the use of a record date to establish the persons eligible for notice of and voting at an annual meeting, whether as an alternative to or replacement of the closing of shareholder records for some time prior to the annual meeting. State corporate law generally allows the record date to be fixed in the bylaws of the company or established by a resolution of the board of directors. In addition, the record date must generally be no more than, nor fewer than, a fixed number of days before the date of the annual meeting. For example, under Delaware corporate law, the record date must be no more than 60, nor fewer than ten, days before the meeting date. See DGCL Section 213. Companies typically establish a record date far enough in advance to allow sufficient time for the solicitation of proxies prior to the meeting. Federal proxy rules require that companies contact institutional record holders at least 20 business days prior to the record date of the annual meeting to inquire whether other persons are the beneficial owners of the company\u2019s securities and the number of proxies and other soliciting material to supply to the record holder for such beneficial owners. See Rule 14a-13 of Regulation 14A. In February 2015, the NYSE amended its rules on the solicitation of proxies through member organizations, as set forth in Section 402.05 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, to make clear that companies or others soliciting proxy materials through brokers must comply with Rule 14a-13 of Regulation 14A.\n\nSource: https://www.lw.com/thoughtLeadership/LW-annual-meeting-handbook\n\nNow, I'm sure a share recall, which is what folks are MOST interested in, follows soon after (keep in mind this is discretionary; but if they find it important to vote this year, they will). However, I think this procedure is going to be in GameStop's bylaws. If someone can find it, that'd be nice. These bylaws are released in tandem for the shareholders meeting, I believe. Edit: Found the bylaws but they don't mention. Probably just up to shareholders when they get notice of the record date.\n\nHere's a good example of Coca Cola's for their 2015 annual shareholder's meeting that actually discusses a recall procedure:\n\nA person\u2019s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which (i) the person has loaned such shares, provided that the person has the power to recall such loaned shares on three (3) business days\u2019 notice; or (ii) the person has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the person. The terms \u201cowned,\u201d \u201cowning\u201d and other variations of the word \u201cown\u201d shall have correlative meanings. Whether outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company are \u201cowned\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21344/000002134415000034/exhibit32.htm\n\nLet's bring this together. A record date to be announced soon -- with a possible recall (at the discretion of HUGE shareholders) -- with the stock hovering around $191, and the world's eyes on it, it may be a little more say, interesting this time?\n\nDisclaimer: not financial or legal advice. ape on a computer.\n\nEdit 1: June 11th confirmed. Thanks, fellow Apes. https://www.reuters.com/companies/GME.N/events .\n\nEdit 2: GameStop's bylaws found:\n\nThis section discusses notice of the meeting to investors:\n\nSECTION 4. Notice of Meetings. Except as otherwise may be required by law, notice of each meeting of stockholders, whether an Annual Meeting or a special meeting, shall be in writing, shall state the purpose or purposes of the meeting, the place, date and hour of the meeting and, unless it is an Annual Meeting, shall indicate that the notice is being issued by or at the direction of the person or persons calling the meeting, and a copy thereof shall be delivered personally or sent by mail, facsimile transmission or e-mail, not less than 10 or more than 60 days before the date of said meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed or delivered by facsimile number or e-mail, such notice shall be directed to such stockholder at his mailing address, facsimile number or e-mail address, as applicable, as it appears on the stock records of the Corporation, unless he shall have filed with the Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices to him be mailed or delivered by facsimile transmission or e-mail to some other mailing address, facsimile number or e-mail address, as applicable, in which case it shall be directed to him at such other mailing address, facsimile number or e-mail address, as applicable. Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place to which the meeting is to be adjourned was announced at the meeting at which the adjournment was taken, unless (i) the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or (ii) the Board shall fix a new record date for such adjourned meeting after the adjournment.\n\nhttps://news.gamestop.com/node/14021/html\n\nDoes not discuss recall procedure.\n\nEdit 3: GameStop's record date procedure:\n\nSECTION 4. Record Date. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any meeting of stockholders, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the time for such other action as hereinbefore described; provided, however, that if no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held, and, for determining stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of rights or to exercise any rights of change, conversion or exchange of stock or for any other purpose, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts a resolution relating thereto.\n\nhttps://news.gamestop.com/node/14021/html\n\nEdit 4: Great explanation of voting rights when shares are shorted:\n\nDepending on who has the shares during the record date, that person gets the voting right. So if the loaned-out shares are not returned to the original owner by the record date, they do not get voting rights, only the investor that bought the shares when they were loaned out from an investor's margin account for the short sale does. Again, this is part of the margin account agreement.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortsalevotingrights.asp\n\nEdit 5: Good article on why last year Vanguard, Blackrock and Fidelity chose not to recall their shares, because it was better for their investors to lend rather than to recall. Maybe that will change?\n\nThe main reason for the disparity is that BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group and Fidelity Investments chose to loan out substantial GameStop shares for the rich stream of fees their investors stood to gain, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Firms from Dimensional Fund Advisors to State Street Global Advisors made similar choices to give up their full voting power.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/how-investing-giants-gave-away-voting-power-ahead-of-a-shareholder-fight-11591793863\n\nExample of how huge shareholders decide whether to recall or not, re Blackrock:\n\nWith regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock\u2019s approach is driven by our clients\u2019 economic interests. The decision whether to recall securities on loan to vote is based on a formal analysis of the revenue producing value to clients of loans, against the assessed economic value of casting votes. Generally, we expect that the likely economic value to clients of casting votes would be less than the securities lending income, either because, in our assessment, the resolutions being voted on will not have significant economic consequences or because the outcome would not be affected by BlackRock recalling loaned securities in order to vote. BlackRock also may, in our discretion, determine that the value of voting outweighs the cost of recalling shares, and thus recall shares to vote in that instance.\n\nCannot link source - perma-bans the post because it's from alpha.\n\nEdit 6: Getting a few comments that I want to address\n\n1. Few of you are saying this is old news. In fact, the top trending posts on this matter still seem to not know the exact date of the shareholder's meeting. To that end, I'm finally clearing up that confusion once and for all. Thus, I believe this brings value.\n2. I'm posting a date. Yes. Stop freaking out. This is a fact-based date. Whether or not anything happens is anyone's guess. That is absolutely not going to stop me from sharing fact-based info. And frankly, I think there's tremendous value. Here's why. GameStop is undergoing an incredible transformation. Imagine you had a twenty percent stake in GameStop. GameStop is electing new people to their leadership team. Wouldn't YOU want a say as a massive stakeholder for this very promising future? Perhaps, it is your fiduciary duty to act within the best interests of the investors of your fund, which, by then would mean voting?! Mind you, a fiduciary duty is a LEGAL duty to act reasonably within the best interests of the parties you're beholden to. Investment funds have a fiduciary duty to their investors. No question. That means this is an obligation, not a choice. If said act is within the best interests of your fiduciaries (here, the investors of said fund), you should do said act. Remember Vinny from the Big Short telling Mark to sell because they had a fiduciary duty? Perhaps in other years, the funds didn't give a damn. They were making so much money from lending, it made no sense to do so. Now, it seems different.\n3. For the wrinkle-brained of you, you may be getting what I am insinuating. I am arguing that it may be actually a fiduciary duty to vote. With lending rates so low, it is no longer profitable for the investors to have the funds continue their prior model. Rather, said fiduciary duty demands these funds to recall shares and ensure GameStop has a bright future for the investors. Hey, they might blow this opportunity off. But this is my argument.\n4. More ramblings: honestly, if you are a hedge fund short on this, what the hell were you thinking? I'm pretty sure hedge funds thought by this time around GameStop would be filing Chapter 11, so there would be no risk of share recall. I'm not going to roast them for that. That was an educated short play based on the fundamentals. But, I mean, think about it, if they shorted this knowing the true SI, a recall would be a death knell. I'm guessing they read GameStop's abysmal earnings reports during COVID and thought there was no chance GameStop was going to come out alive -- let alone for things to turn out like this. If they filed for bankruptcy, they wouldn't have to return the shares they borrowed. The problem is even after GameStop rose, they continued to short it. That was definitely just ego and likely their gravest error in all of this. Rather than placing a stop-loss, they just continued to play games. It may be that this is biggest royal fuck up in Wall Street history. If I am right, then their shorts are like puts, they have an expiration in April. These are just ramblings!",

        "selftext": "$GTII Naked Short Squeeze - Ultimate DD\n\n*This post is for new and existing longs that are looking for a better understanding of the situation. It goes deep into the important concepts to really help you understand the mechanics of what's at play. It's a bit lengthy but if you take the time to read it through, I'm confident that you'll find the outcome to be inevitable. I also recommend that you read it on desktop for the smoothest experience.*\n\n**TL;DR - GTII is primed and ready for a Naked Short Squeeze. There is a very high probability that the majority of shares in circulation are IOUs. GTII is fully aware of this and has already started issuing** ***special*** ***dividends*** **to expose the naked short sellers who created the IOUs. New and existing longs are in a position to make huge returns if they look at the evidence and follow the company's instructions with patience.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Glossary of Terms\n\n**Short selling** in general results in the creation of fake shares. *Legal short sellers* and *illegal naked short sellers* are both in the category of *short sellers* and it's very important to note the distinction between the type of fake shares that they each create.\n\n**Legal short sellers** open their short position by borrowing real shares from a lender and then selling them to a buyer in the market. The lender and the buyer are both considered owners of the shares, but since the buyer is in possession of the real shares, the lender is left holding a type of fake shares called synthetic shares. Owning synthetic shares is essentially like owning debt. The owner of the synthetic shares is owed real shares by the short seller who borrowed them. These synthetic shares can be traded just like real shares and therefore increase the number of shares in circulation. The short seller can only close his position by eliminating all the synthetic shares that he created. He does this by purchasing all the real shares that he borrowed and then returning them to the lender. At this point, the lender's synthetic shares dissolve into nothing and the real shares re-take their place.\n\n**Illegal naked short sellers** open their short position by inventing shares out of thin air and selling them to a buyer in the market. The buyer thinks that he has real shares but in reality, he just has a bunch of fake shares called IOUs. Owning an IOU is *kind of* like owning a synthetic share, except that the real share owed to you by the short seller literally doesn't exist. Now because an IOU is *electronically identical* to real shares, they can be traded as such and therefore increase the number of shares in circulation. The short seller can only close his position in by either:\n\n* getting all of the IOUs that he created completely out of circulation by buying them back from the market, or\n* getting the company to issue him brand new real shares to deliver on his IOUs\n\nThe former causes a spike in price because of the sudden increase in demand for shares, while the latter causes an official dilution of the float by converting the IOUs into real shares.\n\n*Note that short selling in general causes an immediate dilution of the total shares in circulation and this is why it is perceived as inherently evil. Both types are bad for the company being sold short, but illegal naked short selling in particular is more like economic terrorism because there is no limit to how many shares you can create out of thin air. In other words, there's no cap on the dilution of the total shares in circulation.*\n\n*Also note that the term short seller can be used to refer to both types. If the context is not clear, I'll explicitly refer to them as 'legal short sellers' and 'illegal naked short sellers'. However, if I just use the term short seller, the context should be sufficient to understand if I'm talking about a legal short seller, an illegal naked short seller, or both.*\n\n**Real Shares** are the shares issued directly by the company\n\n**Float** is all of the company's Real Shares in existence\n\n**Synthetic Shares** are the shares created by legal short selling.\n\n**IOUs** are the shares created by illegal naked short selling.\n\n**Fake Shares** refer to any shares that were not directly issued by the company (synthetic shares and IOUs)\n\n**Shares in Circulation** refer to the Float as well as all Fake Shares (Float + total Fake Shares)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Perfect Set Up\n\nThis Naked Short Squeeze is facilitated by the GTII management strategically issuing cashless dividends to shareholders. It has nothing to do with GTII's fundamentals, financials, revenue, etc. **It's simply a strategic play based on the mechanics of securities when short selling meets a cashless dividend... and GTII appears to be the orchestrator.**\n\nTo understand what's happening, you first need to be familiar with:\n\n* Death spiral financing\n* Dividends in the context of short selling\n\nLet's quickly review these concepts before getting into how they enable GTII's strategy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Death Spiral Financing\n\nNaked short sellers are notorious for using [death spiral financing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathspiral.asp) to profit off a company's desperation for cash. It uses **illegal naked short selling** with something called a **toxic convertible loan** in order to quite literally send a company into a death spiral. They specifically target small companies on the OTC Market because the lack of regulation facilitates the illegal naked short selling. Here's how it works:\n\nA naked short seller (let's call him **Shorty**) gives a toxic convertible loan to a struggling company XYZ. It's *toxic convertible* because if XYZ cannot repay the loan on time, then Shorty is allowed to convert the debt into brand new real shares of XYZ and dilute the float. For example, let's assume that the XYZ float is 20 million shares and Shorty gives them a *simple* toxic convertible loan of $100,000. Table 1 shows the number of shares that Shorty can redeem at different stock prices if the loan is not paid off in time.\n\n***Table 1:***\n\n|*Stock Price*|*Redeemable Shares*|*New Float*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|$5|20,000|20,020,000|\n|$2|50,000|20,050,000|\n|$1|100,000|20,100,000|\n|$0.50|200,000|20,200,000|\n|$0.25|400,000|20,400,000|\n|$0.10|1,000,000|21,000,000|\n|$0.01|10,000,000|30,000,000|\n|$0.001|100,000,000|120,000,000|\n|$0.0001|1,000,000,000|1,020,000,000|\n\nIt's worth noting that the terms and conditions of these loans are usually much more aggressive. A slightly more aggressive example would be Shorty stipulating that the debt is convertible to shares at a 25% discount. Table 2 shows the number of shares redeemable with this stipulation in place.\n\n***Table 2:***\n\n|*Stock Price*|*Discounted Stock Price*|*Redeemable Shares*|*New Float*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$5|$3.75|26,667|20,026,667|\n|$2|$1.50|66,667|20,066,667|\n|$1|$0.75|133,333|20,133,333|\n|$0.50|$0.375|266,667|20,266,667|\n|$0.25|$0.1875|533,333|20,533,333|\n|$0.10|$0.0750|1,333,333|21,333,333|\n|$0.01|$0.0075|13,333,333|33,333,333|\n|$0.001|$0.00075|133,333,333|153,333,333|\n|$0.0001|$0.000075|1,333,333,333|1,353,333,333|\n\nThe main take away is that *the lower the Stock Price goes, the more shares Shorty can redeem.* And if the company files for bankruptcy (definitely can't repay the loan) with a [low enough stock price](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/subpenny612faq.htm), Shorty can convert the debt into a virtually *unlimited* number of shares. This is where the Naked Short Selling comes in.\n\nShorty is confident that XYZ won't be able to pay off the loan, so he teams up with a **rogue brokerage** and tells them that he wants to start short selling shares of XYZ. He tells the rogue brokerage that he hasn't found a lender, but that doesn't matter because in just 6 months, he'll be able to convert his debt into new shares that he can use to deliver. The rogue brokerage smells an opportunity to make a huge commission so they agree to illegally and secretly sell IOUs on behalf of Shorty, thereby creating his **illegal naked short position**. These IOUs then spread across the brokerage network because electronically, they are identical to real shares and the OTC market lacks the regulation to prevent this.\n\nNow let's assume that Shorty and the rogue brokerage sell an average of 250,000 IOUs a day for the duration of the 6 month loan. This means that on every trading day, they collect $(250,000 x sale price) from buyers in exchange for these fake shares. In other words, a lot money goes into their pocket every day for selling shares that don't exist to these *innocent and unaware buyers.*\n\nIt also means that on every trading day, the total shares in circulation increases by 250,000 shares. This continuously increases the supply of shares while the demand stays the same. As a result, the stock price begins to decline, causing investors to lose confidence and begin a wave of panic selling, which then serves to drive the price down even further. This cycle continues until the stock price eventually hits the ground.\n\nNow if we assume that there are 20 trading days in a month, then by the end of the loan period, Shorty and the rogue brokerage would have sold 30 million IOUs. Shorty converts his debt into 30 million brand new real shares and then closes his naked short position by handing them over to the rogue brokerage, who then uses those real shares to deliver on the 30 million IOUs.\n\n[Before Shorty closes his position](https://preview.redd.it/4xe6dpl8sfv61.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=142ee4c9a04782c5013c209fea19568e34ed9a1a)\n\n[After Shorty closes his position](https://preview.redd.it/wcbp5peasfv61.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c24a6995a4b9fcf23e833c1b795846941825cdf)\n\n**The results:**\n\n* XYZ's float is officially diluted from 20 million shares to 50 million shares\n* XYZ's stock price is in pennies, if not fractions thereof\n* Shorty and the rogue brokerage walk away with the all money they ~~earned~~ **stole** from innocent investors who were unaware that they were receiving IOUs\n\n**The innocent victims:**\n\n* All XYZ management\n* All XYZ clients\n* All XYZ shareholders\n\n*It's also important to note that the rogue brokerage is the facilitator of the Naked Short Selling. Once the rogue brokerage starts selling IOUs on behalf of Shorty, those IOUs end up* ***electronically*** *diffusing across the entire brokerage network. For example, suppose that I have an account with the rogue brokerage, you have an account with Fidelity, and Tommy has an account with TD. The rogue brokerage sells me 10 IOUs of XYZ on behalf of Shorty. A few weeks later, I decide to sell 8 and you decide to buy them. The rogue brokerage and Fidelity arrange the trade and now you have 8 IOUs held* ***electronically*** *in Fidelity. If you decide to sell 4 IOUs and Tommy buys them, then Fidelity and TD arrange the trade and Tommy now has 4 IOUs held* ***electronically*** *in TD. All the while, us shareholders, Fidelity, and TD all think that the IOUs are real shares, but in reality, Shorty and the rogue brokerage invented them out of thin air.*\n\nAt this point though, the IOUs being spread across the brokerage network doesn't scare Shorty and the rogue brokerage. XYZ has already collapsed and shareholders have lost faith. Shorty converted his debt into shares and gave them to the rogue brokerage. They now have enough shares to deliver on the IOUs, *just in case* Fidelity, TD, or any other brokerage comes knocking for the physical shares. So lo and behold, Shorty and the rogue brokerage end up winning.\n\nAnd that's how naked short sellers use [death spiral financing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathspiral.asp) to profit off a company's desperation for cash. Now let's talk about Dividends in the context of both legal short selling and illegal naked short selling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Dividends in the Context of Short Selling\n\nWhen a company announces a dividend, it usually involves a **record date** and an **issue date**. Only shareholders as of the record date are entitled to the dividend on the issue date.\n\nFor example, let's assume that XYZ announces a *cash dividend* of $2 a share with a record date of April 1st and an issue date of April 8th. Tommy buys 1 million shares and they settle in his account *before* EOD on April 1st. If he holds his shares through EOD on April 1st, then he becomes a **shareholder of record** and is entitled to $2 million in dividends on April 8th. *It doesn't matter if he sells his shares before the issue date as long as he held his shares through EOD on the record date.*\n\nNow the thing about dividends is that the company only pays them to shareholders of real shares. So let's see how it works in the context of legal short selling and illegal naked short selling. We'll recycle the cash dividend from XYZ above to illustrate this.\n\n**Legal:** Suppose a legal short seller borrows 1 million shares from a lender and sells them to Tommy before EOD on April 1st.\n\n[Legal Short Selling](https://preview.redd.it/h8sxa65rffv61.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16da8561ddc685ede0a957e7170820550135a467)\n\nTommy and the lender are both considered owners of the shares, so they are equally entitled to any dividends issued by the company once they hold their shares through EOD on April 1st. When the issue date arrives, XYZ pays Tommy $2 million and the legal short seller is obligated to pay the lender $2 million.\n\n**Illegal:** Suppose that a naked short seller teams up with a rogue brokerage to sell 1 million IOUs to Tommy before EOD on April 1st.\n\n[Illegal Naked Short Selling](https://preview.redd.it/xi110n4tffv61.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59e7e0d7bfbd56efb913504d8f4ffc816a59afbc)\n\nTommy thinks these IOUs are real shares so he expects to receive any dividends issued by the company once he holds his shares through EOD on April 1st. When the issue date arrives, the naked short seller must pay Tommy $2 million *to avoid exposing his illegal activities*.\n\nThe main takeaway here is that in both scenarios, **the short seller is obligated to supply the dividend for all the fake shares that he created**. If he doesn't want to pay the dividend, then he has to close his entire short position before EOD on April 1st.\n\n[Short sellers pay dividends for the fake shares they created](https://preview.redd.it/074xcfg3wkv61.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=687072fc16e39c8a3d0afcf937f291e2617c92d0)\n\n**But what if the dividend wasn't cash though?** What would the short sellers do if it was something more unique like a *non-replicable* keychain that could only be produced by the company? Well let's take a look at an example:\n\nAssume that company XYZ has a float of 20 million shares, with an additional 10 million fake shares in circulation from short sellers, and suppose that they announce a keychain dividend whereby shareholders of record will receive 1 keychain for every 2 shares held. I'll refer to those who hold real shares through the record date as ***real-shareholders of record*** and those who hold fake shares through the record date as ***fake-shareholders of record***.\n\nNow remember that a company only issues dividends for real shares, so XYZ will create and supply no more than 10 million unique keychains. As a result, if the short sellers do not close their positions by EOD on the record date, they end up on the hook for the outstanding 5 million.\n\n[Dividend Delivery Status 1](https://preview.redd.it/sdew3q0nelv61.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=944a2fa8dd7db5bb6d2aaba5f4dedd5fb4c15c77)\n\nIf the short sellers do decide to hold through the record date, then when the issue date arrives, they **must** buy 5 million keychains from real-shareholders of record in order to deliver them to fake-shareholders of record.\n\n[Dividend Delivery Status 2](https://preview.redd.it/1y7uumj5nlv61.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5303d56345b5e8dc9963b140904dea10e7da3cb1)\n\nThis gives some power to the real-shareholders of record that received their keychains because they can dictate the price that they sell at. However, the total supply of keychains is more than the total demanded by the short sellers so technically the short sellers have some leverage. But let's see what happens when the number of fake shares greatly exceeds the float. Assume that XYZ has 50 million fakes shares in circulation through the record date instead of 10 million. XYZ still only creates and supplies 10 million unique keychains, so the short sellers would therefore be on the hook for the outstanding 25 million if they don't close their position by EOD on the record date.\n\n[Dividend Delivery Status 3](https://preview.redd.it/n4o8fxhjnlv61.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8788be034c6881be37d00814413c399150e7f84f)\n\nWe can clearly see that as long as the number of outstanding keychains is greater than the total supply, the holders of the keychains can sell them for any price that they want because the short sellers are obligated to buy them.\n\n*It is also worth noting that if the short sellers instead opted to close their position before EOD on the record date to avoid having to deliver the dividend, it would cause a spike in demand and as a result, a spike in the stock price.*\n\nNow let's quickly talk about the mechanics of how the dividends are distributed behind the scenes. The SEC does not make information about fake shares (synthetic shares + IOUs) publicly available to anyone, so the record date is needed to create a *snapshot* of the share distribution across brokerages.\n\nThe company issuing the dividend hires a [transfer agent](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transferagent.asp) and then hands them the dividends for all the real shares. The transfer agent receives a list with the number of real shares held at each brokerage and then uses that to allocate and deliver the dividends to them appropriately. If a brokerage is holding 4 million shares but only receives dividends for 1 million, then they immediately realize that they are holding 3 million fake shares.\n\nAt this point, the brokerage holding the fake shares tracks down the brokerage that issued them in the first place and requests that the short seller deliver the outstanding dividends for those shares. Now short selling is very common on major stock exchanges so brokerages don't usually suspect illegal activities when they uncover fake shares there. They just assume that the shares are synthetic and then go about procuring the dividends from the source.\n\nThe thing about the OTC market though is that legal short selling is extremely uncommon because of the inherent volatility. Most brokerages make it very difficult to borrow shares because the risk exposure would be way too high. Now dividends are a rare thing on the OTC market, but if there is one and a brokerage happens to uncover an abundance of fake shares, they immediately know that those shares are illegal IOUs that originated from an illegal naked short seller (let's call him Shorty again) and a rogue brokerage.\n\nThese innocent brokerages want no part in the illegal activities of Shorty and the rogue brokerage, and they definitely won't stand for these criminals selling IOUs to their innocent customers. So once they track down the rogue brokerage, they demand that Shorty immediately does both of the following:\n\n* Deliver all the outstanding dividends for the IOUs that he created\n* Destroy all the IOUs that he created by buying them back from the market\n\n*A massive short term increase in demand like this would cause a tremendous spike in the price of both the company's stock and the delivered dividends (if they are cashless).*\n\nBut if Shorty and the rogue brokerage do not co-operate, then the innocent brokerages clean up the mess on their behalf. If the dividend is cash, then the innocent brokerage pays it to their clients that are fake-shareholders of record, *and they keep the receipt*. If the dividend is cashless, then they buy as many as they need from the supply, at whatever asking price is offered, and deliver to their clients that are fake-shareholders of record, *while they hold onto the receipt*. Then they go to the market and buy all the shares needed, at whatever asking price is offered, to destroy the IOUs held in their brokerage, *and they keep the receipt.*\n\nThis process of cleaning up takes a while though because it has to go through lawyers, management hierarchies, and closed door meetings, among other corporate fluff. It only begins when one innocent brokerage starts buying and initiates a domino effect that causes other innocent brokerages to follow suit. And once they're finished cleaning up the mess, they gather all the receipts and send them to the rogue brokerage, while filing a class action lawsuit to force reimbursement.\n\n*Again, this massive short term increase in demand would cause a tremendous spike in the price of both the company's stock and the delivered dividends (if they are cashless).* **In other words, once illegal IOUs are uncovered and exposed, the stock is guaranteed to experience an enormous short squeeze.**\n\nSo now you know enough about dividends in the context of short selling to understand how it can be weaponized, and this is where GTII comes in with their *declaration of war on short sellers*. Let's finally see how everything we covered fits into the context of what's currently happening with the company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# GTII fights back against Short Sellers\n\nGlobal Tech Industries Group, Inc (GTII) is a shell company that trades on the OTC market. It's worth noting that the [OTC market is a breeding ground for IOUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCiL4v7_z9E&amp;t=779s) because illegal naked short sellers can prey on the lack of regulation. As mentioned before, it's very rare to find legal short selling in an OTC stock due to the inherent volatility. So as a result, a lot of short volume tends to be from illegal naked short selling.\n\nAmong many other OTC stocks, GTII has been a victim of attack by these criminal short sellers for many years. Now remember that there's no limit to how many IOUs you can sell, especially in a highly unregulated market, so these short sellers keep selling more and more IOUs everyday to keep up their free income supply. For the past 10 years, GTII's stock price has been below $1 so although some of those short positions may have been closed\n\n**The speed started to pick up when a group called Geneva Roth Remark Holdings issued a toxic convertible loan with extremely aggressive terms to GTII, followed by a heavy increase in short volume from entities connected to the members of Geneva Roth**. Geneva Roth found a company (GTII) that was already being used as an income generator by other illegal naked short sellers and thought that they could use death spiral financing to get a piece of the action. **The members of Geneva Roth are extremely notorious for these practices and as such, this move is clear evidence for the presence of at least a decent number of IOUs in circulation** (see section on death spiral financing)\n\nNow u/FckMyStudentLoans did a really amazing job of chronologically laying out everything that has happened since then up until about a month ago. I honestly couldn't do it better myself so check it out in the subreddit Gtii and then come back. *It's important that you read the entire thing because I'll be building on it below.*\n\nSo continuing on the assumption that you've read the entire post linked above, GTII has essentially trapped the naked short sellers and declared war on them by issuing a sequence of cashless dividends to shareholders. It started with the announcement of a 'non-transferrable warrant' dividend and is continuing with imminent announcements of NFT dividends. You can see this by checking out their [Press Releases](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/search/tag/gtii) from March 10th go forward.\n\nThis is a carbon copy of when Patrick Byrne announced an NFT dividend to shareholders of OSTK in order to [purposefully squeeze the short sellers](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/how-patrick-byrne-s-final-act-at-overstock-crushed-short-sellers-1.1316720). The thing about OSTK though is that the short interest was only 13% of the float. On top of that, OSTK is traded on a major exchange (the NASDAQ) so these short positions were largely from legal short sellers. The NFT dividend was used to force all these shorts to close their positions because it would be way too expensive to buy the dividend for delivery to fake-shareholders of record, and it is bonafide impossible to counterfeit. This resulted in the stock price going from $3 to $128.\n\nNow GTII has a float of around 20 million shares and because of the attack by Geneva Roth, there is at minimum 5 million IOUs in circulation. This makes the illegal short interest at least 25% compared to OSTK's 13%, not to mention that the actual number of IOUs in circulation is estimated to be more in the range of 25 to 60 million due to Geneva Roth, years of compounded illegal naked short selling, and continued illegal naked short selling. But even if we use the stingy estimation of 25%, it's still more than enough to exceed the magnitude of OSTK's short squeeze.\n\nJust like Patrick Byrne, the management at GTII has been strategically designing this short squeeze ever since they retired the toxic convertible loan from Geneva Roth. The main difference between them though is that before announcing the NFT dividends to ultimately trigger the squeeze, GTII gifted their shareholders with a free non-transferrable [warrant](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/stock-option-warrant.asp) as a dividend.\n\nAllow me to explain why the warrant is a gift and why it simply adds fuel to the short squeeze that will happen when GTII officially announces the [Picasso NFT Dividend](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/23/2216226/0/en/GLOBAL-TECH-INDUSTRIES-GROUP-INC-ANNOUNCES-THE-PURCHASE-OF-AN-ORIGINAL-PICASSO-ETCHED-ENGRAVING-TO-ESTABLISH-DIGITAL-ART-PLATFORM.html).\n\nThe non-transferrable warrant was structured such that shareholders of record (both real and fake) received 1 warrant for every 10 shares held. In other words, each of those shareholders is entitled to an additional 10% of the shares that they held through the record date (warrants become shares when exercised).\n\nNow the warrants were purposely made as non-transferrable in order to prevent the short seller's ability to buy them from the real-shareholders of record and deliver them to the fake-shareholders of record. Theoretically, this should have forced all shorts to close their position before EOD on the record date because delivering a real warrant would be literally impossible. However, if the stock could stay below the $2.75 strike price, shareholders won't be able to exercise the warrants and as a result, outstanding dividends wouldn't be exposed. GTII predicted that instead of closing their position, the short sellers would try to keep the stock price under $2.75 to get shareholders to lose interest in the warrants. And just as expected, the stock continued to be heavily shorted into the record date with no signs of covering.\n\nBy design, this forced the short sellers to be on the hook for an abundance of warrants that don't exist and are impossible to buy.\n\n(*It's worth noting that at the time of writing, the warrants are in the money, so the short sellers are already deeply under water)*\n\nNow remember when we talked about cashless dividends in the context of short selling and what happens when innocent brokerages discover that they are holding an abundance of fake shares in an OTC stock? Well on the issue date for the warrants, all shareholders of record received an electronic placeholder in their brokerage account for their entitlement of warrants, and the transfer agent sent each brokerage their respective warrant allocations for real shares from the company.\n\nAt this point, even though there is a blatant discrepancy between the number of placeholders and allocations, the brokerages won't realize until all shareholders try to exercise their warrants. Because of this, GTII put out multiple Press Releases strongly advising shareholders to contact their brokerages and instead of exercising, demand that the warrants be reregistered with the company's transfer agent. When innocent brokerages get requests to transfer 4 million warrants but they only have allocations for 1 million, they immediately know that they're holding IOUs and are liable if they don't start cleaning up the mess. And this mess is a particular type of shit show because the real warrants are literally impossible to buy. Now remember that cleaning up takes a bit of time because of the corporate fluff, so this gives GTII long enough to prepare the Picasso NFT Dividend just in time for when the innocent brokerages are done getting ready to force the illegal naked short sellers out of their position.\n\nWhen this time comes, shareholders who own real warrants will get to make 10% more than they would have (the gift), and shareholders entitled to warrants that weren't delivered by the short sellers will most likely receive a lump sum payment (the gift) to settle due to class action lawsuits against the illegal naked short seller and the rogue brokerage. On top of that, new longs who become shareholders before the official NFT Dividend announcement will also stand to benefit greatly from the squeeze caused by the inevitable short covering.\n\nGTII has also announced plans to continue issuing NFT dividends on a regular basis after the Picasso. My **assumption** is that since the naked short interest is estimated to greatly exceed the float, GTII will purposefully make these NFT dividends transferrable so that if short sellers do not close their positions before the record date, they would be obligated to buy the NFTs at whatever price the market dictates in order to deliver. The purpose of doing this continuously would be to put severe pressure on the illegal naked short sellers until they completely cave and close their entire short position. *However, please note that I could be wrong about this particular assumption.*\n\n*...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there you have it. This should be more than enough information for you to get a good understanding of what's at play with GTII. Please note that no outcome is guaranteed. ***It is simply a high-probability setup that has the potential to be a huge black swan event.*** I've done my very best to simplify things as much as possible. Now it's up to you to do your own research and decide if you'd like to participate.\n\nThe nice thing about this strategy is that it does not require buying pressure from retail investors or institutions. It only needs patience and high conviction. So if you do chose to participate, I would suggest that you ***only invest what you can afford to lose and*** ***treat the investment like a high probability lottery ticket***. After that, set up some reasonable price alerts and then distract yourself until you get a notification.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are some additional resources to check out:\n\n* [The Systemic Risk of Naked Short Selling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCiL4v7_z9E&amp;t=2s)\n* [Failed lawsuit against OSTK for issuing NFT Dividends - Article](https://cointelegraph.com/news/court-tosses-out-short-sellers-lawsuit-targeting-overstock-s-digital-dividend)\n* [Failed lawsuit against OSTK for issuing NFT Dividends - Consolidated Complaint](https://www.cohenmilstein.com/sites/default/files/Overstock%20Consolidated%20Complaint%2003132020.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Disclaimer: This is not Financial Advice.

        "selftext": "RIDE: THE COMPLETE DUE DILIGENCE \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is my complete Due Diligence on Lordstown Motor Company. I have spent over 100 hours researching this company. Disclosure: I am long RIDE and hold many shares, but I will do my best to be brutally honest about the good, the bad, and the theoretical. Let's begin:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION, ORIGIN, AND BACKGROUND\n\nNOTE: As everything in Chapter 1 is not contested nor controversial, I have not sourced any of the information. After Chapter 1, I will try to provide sources for all information presented.\n\nStarting in 2015, a company called Workhorse began developing electric trucks. By 2018, Workhorse had built and sold 1,000 electric delivery trucks to UPS.  Around then, Workhorse received an order of 500 electric pickup trucks from Duke Energy. The company had a crossroads decision of whether to develop large delivery trucks or smaller pickup trucks. The company decided to focus on large delivery trucks. Then CEO, Steve Burns, decided to open a new company in late 2018 to focus on the pickup trucks. For a brief period, he was CEO of both companies until he stepped down from Workhorse in Feb 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, prior to 2019, the Lordstown, Ohio manufacturing plant was owned by GM and produced cars such as the Chevy Cruze, Cobalt, and Cavalier. It is a 6.2M sqft plant and at its height, produced 1 million cars per year. As those vehicles did not sell well, GM decided late 2018 to shut down the plant. Ohio is a very important political battleground state, and former President Trump promised to keep manufacturing open in Ohio; he threatened GM if they did not find a way to keep the plant open.\n\nGM's solution was to sell the plant to an EV company, Workhorse, however the deal was delayed by the united auto worker's union. Eventually in Nov of 2019, the plant was sold to Steve Burn's pickup truck company.\n\nThe plant was purchased for $40M as a loan underwritten by GM. In addition, GM invested $75M into the pickup truck company which now took the name: Lordstown Motor Company, which will be abbreviated as LMC for the rest of this write-up. Workhorse owns 10% of LMC, but in exchange, LMC has the right to use all technology developed while Steve Burns was at Workhorse. \n\nBy June of 2020, LMC unveiled its working prototype pickup truck: the Endurance. The Endurance is unique from other electric vehicles because it uses hub motors as the drive system reducing the number of moving parts which should increase the reliability.\n\nThen in October of 2020, LMC completed a reverse merger. This merger raised $675M for LMC which now trades under the symbol RIDE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 2: THE HINDENBURG REPORT\n\nSince going public, RIDE had been trading between $20-$30 per share in the last three months. CEO Steve Burns had been making the rounds with interviews on CNBC and FOX Business. On those shows, he made the claims of having 100,000 preorders and production date to begin in September 2021.\n\nIn early March 2021, a company named Hindenburg Research began shorting RIDE, and on March 12th, 2021, they released their article about LMC. The entire article can be found here: [https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/)\n\nHindenburg famously shorted and exposed another EV company, NKLA for claiming to have a working prototype when in reality, NKLA rolled a non-driving truck downhill.\n\nSummary of the CLAIMS by Hindenburg against LMC\n\n1) LMC does not really have 100,000 preorders. Those numbers are all non-binding letters of intent. Many of those letters are coming from people/companies that definitely do not have the means to buy that many trucks. LMC did not take deposits for these preorders. Furthermore, LMC paid commissions to get these \"fake\" preorders.\n\n2) Insiders of LMC have sold shares to pocket $28M.\n\n3) An early prototype of the Endurance truck spontaneously burst into flames in Jan of 2021.\n\n4) Steve Burns claimed that LMC was going to make batteries in house, but will not be able to.\n\n5) An unnamed source claimed LMC licensed the Hub Motor technology from a Slovenian company (Elaphe), not because it is good technology, but because it allowed them to save money.\n\n6) Hub Motor technology is unproven.\n\n7) An unnamed source claimed that the actual orders from Duke Energy and Ryder were not serious orders.\n\n8) An unnamed source claimed to be a former employee says LMC is 3-4 years out from production.\n\n9) An unnamed source claimed that Steve Burns was pushed out as CEO by Workhorse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCounter Arguments to Hindenburg's Claims\n\n1) All EV companies take non-binding preorders for their cars. Since Feb, preordering an Endurance does require a deposit of $100\n\n[https://lordstownmotors.com/25432293427/checkouts/2481b3672ab9a214b93bcd835468f0be](https://lordstownmotors.com/25432293427/checkouts/2481b3672ab9a214b93bcd835468f0be)\n\nHowever, the heart of this argument boils down to whether or not there will be demand.\n\nConsider the following\n\n\\- The top 3 selling cars in USA are pickup trucks (Ford F, Silverado, Ram)\n\n\\- 5 out of 10 of the best selling cars in the USA are pickups\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/pickup-trucks-dominate-americas-10-best-selling-vehicles-of-2020.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/pickup-trucks-dominate-americas-10-best-selling-vehicles-of-2020.html)\n\n\\- During the pandemic 2020, pickup trucks sold over 3 million trucks.\n\n[https://tfltruck.com/2021/01/2020-sales-report-news/](https://tfltruck.com/2021/01/2020-sales-report-news/)\n\n\\- The Endurance is faster, stronger, most likely more reliable, AND CHEAPER to own than ICE trucks. I think it is pretty obvious that there will be demand. The risk of investing in RIDE will not be the demand; it will be the production. If the Endurance is a well built reliable truck, it will sell.\n\n2) I have saved this topic of insider trading for Chapter 3.\n\n3) Prototype bursting into flames is also true, however, whether we are talking about any Tesla car, Kia Niro, Hyundai Kona, Chevy Bolt, to my knowledge, every single electric car has had an instance of spontaneous combustion. It all has to do with flawed battery packs or flawed battery assembly. It should be noted that Tesla has had many cases of spontaneously catching fire, but it argued, citing government data, that their EV's are 10 times less likely to catch fire than a gas car.\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/28/tesla-battery-fire/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/28/tesla-battery-fire/)\n\nIn the case of the Endurance prototype, it was a flaw in the hand assembly. However battery technology and the battery management computer programing is constantly getting better. This instance was a single hand made Endurance. Moving forward, they will be using LG Chem batteries.\n\n[https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108\\_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup)\n\n4) Yes, Burns originally stated they were going to make batteries in-house, but for the time being moving forward, they will be using LG Chem batteries.\n\nNOTE: LG Chem makes batteries for Tesla, but controversially, they have had to recently recall the batteries they make for the Hyundai Kona and Chevy Bolt.\n\n[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34672772/chevrolet-bolt-ev-recall-battery/#:\\~:text=Chevrolet%20is%20recalling%20more%20than,LG%20Chem%20in%20South%20Korea](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34672772/chevrolet-bolt-ev-recall-battery/#:~:text=Chevrolet%20is%20recalling%20more%20than,LG%20Chem%20in%20South%20Korea).\n\n[https://thedriven.io/2020/11/17/hyundai-turns-to-sk-innovation-batteries-instead-of-lg-chem-in-light-of-kona-ev-battery-fires/](https://thedriven.io/2020/11/17/hyundai-turns-to-sk-innovation-batteries-instead-of-lg-chem-in-light-of-kona-ev-battery-fires/)\n\nStill, LG Chem is a large reliable and safe company to partner up with. The solution to the recalls was to not charge the car to 100%. Many EV's now come with this restriction built in. When you charge the car to \"100%\" showing on your dashboard, you've only actually charged it to 80%-90%. The cars save some buffer room and literally do not allow you to charge to the actual 100%.\n\n5 and 6) Hub motor technology has actually been around since 1900. Many commuter busses use this technology. The main negative of Hub motor technology is unsprung mass. You can read about it here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsprung\\_mass#:\\~:text=The%20unsprung%20mass%20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsprung_mass#:~:text=The%20unsprung%20mass%20)(colloquially%20unsprung,components%20directly%20connected%20to%20them.&amp;text=Brakes%20that%20are%20mounted%20inboard,of%20a%20vehicle's%20sprung%20mass.\n\nThe weird thing about this claim is that current electric motor technology is very simple, hence the reliability. Tesla has opened their patents for anyone to use since 2014. \n\n[https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you](https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you)\n\nIt doesn't make sense to go pay another company for electric motor technology unless that technology really was better than the current electric motor technology. I will discuss the Baja San Felipe 250 race in a later chapter, however, it should be fair to say that the hub motor has been proven to be effective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7,8,9) The problem with these claims of un-named ex-employee sources is that there is no way to verify the validity of these claims. The claims could be true, but they could all be made up. We do  not have any way of proving it one way or another. The best lies are the ones that are sprinkled in between truths. Hindenburg Research is not a news company, and therefore is not held to journalist standards. At the bottom of their own article they even make the disclaimer: \n\n\"However, such information is presented \u201cas is,\u201d without warranty of any kind \u2013 whether express or implied. Hindenburg Research makes no representation, express or implied, as to the accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of any such information or with regard to the results to be obtained from its use. All expressions of opinion are subject to change without notice...\"\n\nThey literally have a disclaimer of, we might or might not be telling the truth!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 3: INSIDER TRADING AND THE SEC INVESTIGATION\n\nThe SEC is currently investigating LMC for fraudulent statements by Burns and insider trading.\n\n\\- The investigation of fraudulent statements is regarding the 100,000 preorders. You can watch the interviews online. This thread won't let me link the videos. Search MSNBC and Lordstown. \n\n[https://video.foxnews.com/v/6237427669001#sp=show-clips](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6237427669001#sp=show-clips)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn terms of the Insider Trading: here is the list:\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ride/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ride/insider-activity)\n\nSeems like insiders sold a lot of shares right? Well, let's look big picture:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRichard Schmidt (President): Executed Option 200k shares and sold 211,512 shares\n\nOverall, he was awarded 875,367 shares and sold 263,412 shares. He still owns 611,955 shares.\n\n[https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1827670.htm](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1827670.htm)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDarren Post (VP of Engineering) - Executed Option 10k shares and sold 10k shares.\n\nOverall, he was awarded 238,526 shares, and sold 10,000 shares. He still owns 228,526 shares.\n\n[https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1827681.htm](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1827681.htm)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShane Brown (Chief Production Officer): Executed option of 19,008 shares and sold 19,008 shares\n\nOverall, he was awarded 56,281 shares, and sold 19,008 shares. He still owns 37,273 shares. (Seems low, not sure if this was filed correctly).\n\n[https://sec.report/CIK/0001833107/Insider-Trades](https://sec.report/CIK/0001833107/Insider-Trades)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJulio Rodriguez (Chief Financial Officer): Sold 9k shares\n\nOverall, he was awarded 933,697, and sold 9,000 shares. I don't know why he currently owns 870,725 shares instead of 924,697... but, regardless, he is holding a lot of shares still.\n\n[https://sec.report/CIK/0001585843/Insider-Trades](https://sec.report/CIK/0001585843/Insider-Trades)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChaun Vo (VP of Propulsion): Sold 198.3k shares\n\nOverall, he was awarded 437,543 shares, and sold 198,300 shares. He still owns 239,243 shares.\n\n[https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1827679.htm](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1827679.htm)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, yes, a lot of shares were sold, but looking at the numbers they are still holding, does this look like they are selling out and abandoning ship, or does it look like they're cashing out a portion of their stocks for the first time so they can buy a nice house?\n\nManagement positions of the above officers:\n\n[https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 4: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n[https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020)\n\nHighlights:\n\n\\- Spent $101M in 2020. \n\n\\- Expects to spend $275M in 2021.\n\n\\- Had $630M cash on hand to start 2021, but also gained $82M from warrant exercising options, so should have $712M cash on hand.\n\n\\- Total liabilities $34M (the amount they still owe GM for the plant).\n\nConclusion: there's no way they're going bankrupt before they get the product out\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 5: STOCK LOCK-UP &amp; DILUTION\n\n1) WKHS' 10% and GM's estimated 7.5%-10% is locked up until April 23rd, 2021. I highly doubt they would sell at the current price.\n\n2) Steve Burns' has 25% ownership. Half of this (12.5%) is locked up until October 23rd, 2021. The other half (12.5%) is locked up until October 23rd, 2022.\n\n3) RIDE has authorized awards of 300M shares for a total of 468M shares. Currently, the shares outstanding is 176.58M shares. That means over time, your 1 share can be diluted to be worth .3773 shares. This is obviously a very big dilution, but it is simply how many startups work. They pay employees in stock for meeting targeted goals. I discuss how to put valuation to your shares in the face of being diluted in Chapter 10.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 6: THE BETA TRUCKS\n\nAfter releasing the 2020 full year report in Mid March, CEO Burns stated that the betas would be out by the end of March, and they were going to be producing 1 beta per day.\n\nOn March 31st, after the market closed, they revealed 2 beta trucks. EB-01-21 and EB-02-21. This is most likely code for: Endurance Beta - #01 &amp; #02 - 2021. \n\nThough not officially released, we also saw a picture for a 3rd truck that day: [https://i.redd.it/ynbllt3l5iq61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/ynbllt3l5iq61.jpg)\n\nSince then, LMC has officially released photos for 5 trucks. \n\n[https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/beta-counter](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/beta-counter)\n\nThe positive was that LMC was able to meet the deadline set by Burns of March 31st for the Betas. The risk is that exists right now is that by now, we should have around 20 Beta trucks, yet we've only seen 5-7 trucks in photos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 7: THE BAJA RACE\n\nSteve Burns has long touted that the Endurance will join the Baja 250 race on April 17th, 2021 as a test of the truck. He clearly stated that their goal was to finish the race. The truck ran out of battery after mile 38 and had to be towed to charge. After fully charging, it began driving a very confusing route all captured on GPS by the race officials.\n\n[https://www.race-dezert.com/home/2021-score-san-felipe-250-live-stream-tracking-updates-209786.html](https://www.race-dezert.com/home/2021-score-san-felipe-250-live-stream-tracking-updates-209786.html)\n\nLook at E414 route.\n\nI think this thread theorizes what happened better than I can explain it, so just go read, BUT NOTE: THIS IS UNCONFIRMED:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/lordstownmotors/comments/mt6nmc/heres\\_what\\_happened\\_in\\_baja/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lordstownmotors/comments/mt6nmc/heres_what_happened_in_baja/)\n\nThis thread tries to explain the 38 miles. ALSO UNCONFIRMED:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/lordstownmotors/comments/mtetge/endurance\\_40mile\\_battery\\_story/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lordstownmotors/comments/mtetge/endurance_40mile_battery_story/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTakeaways from Baja, The Bad:\n\n\\- Baja opened the track for trial runs April 2nd. Though Burns had made the claim about Baja since 2020, they did not complete the truck until 4/15/21, which means they were unable to trial run the course.\n\n\\- If they had done a trial run, they would've realized that in deep sand, their battery only goes 38-40 miles. Then they could've set something up like a charging truck to drive along the Endurance or set up charging stations every 30 or so miles. Instead, the truck had to bow out early in an embarrassing fashion.\n\n\\- Afterwards, LMC posted a statement congratulating themselves on a successful day. This was not a good statement. People are not so stupid that they can't see a fake congragulation trying to pretend a failure is actually a success. They should have admitted that the day did not go well. They were disappointed not to finish, and they vow to do better.\n\n\\- This shows signs of being behind schedule and a terrible PR department.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTakeaways from Baja, The Good:\n\n\\- The durability of the truck held up well.\n\n\\- The Hub motor technology has been proven to be effective. This is probably the single most important takeaway. They can be behind schedule; they can have poor PR, but their technology has to work, and it did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 8: THOUGHTS ON STEVE BURNS, THE CEO\n\nAccording to Warren Buffet, judging the CEO and the company management is one of the most important things that is often overlooked. So, let's examine the pros and cons of Steve Burns.\n\n1) Vision: The vision for this company is simple: EV trucks and vans. It's a good goal, enough said.\n\n2) PR Department: Prior to March, many people discussed how they like Burns as a calm, well spoken CEO that is a very big contrast to Elon Musk. After the Hindenburg report, everyone seemed to hate his interviews. I think it is clear that he is very good in friendly interviews, but does very poorly when facing hostile questioning. PR when facing negativity is definitely a weakness of his.\n\n3) Day to day interaction and motivation of employees: I really have no info about his abilities here.\n\n4) Ability to hire the right people: Also another category I don't have much information about.\n\n5) Deal making abilities: This is probably his biggest strength. \n\n\\- At WKHS he made deals with UPS and DUK\n\n\\- He was able to secure the GM deal to purchase the factory for pennies on the dollar (which is equivalent to Tesla's purchase of the Fremont Factory).\n\n\\- He also convinced GM to invest $75M, WKHS to give him all the tech they've developed.\n\n\\- He got former President Trump, Tim Ryan, Joe Burrow, Marcus Lemonis, Guy Fieri to endorse him and ally with LMC. I don't care if you're Democrat or Republican, it's good to have a CEO who can rub elbows with the rich and powerful.\n\n6) Managing expectations: I think it's clear that Burns has the same problem of over promising just like Elon Musk. The argument for this method is: setting unattainable goals will push your company to do more than if you set realistic goals that they can meet. I think it can be good to manage this way, but as investors, we have to take all their words and lower our expectations. Just like Tesla is a great company, but it has been promising full self-driving with no intervention since 2017. I believe anyone who invests in RIDE needs to prepare themselves for production not starting in September, but maybe by early 2022.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 9: THE SHORT ATTACK\n\nThere are currently two narratives as to why the price of RIDE has dropped so hard.\n\nNarrative 1: LMC is a fraudulent company that was exposed by Hindenburg. With a myriad of lawsuits and investigation for fraud, investors lost confidence and massively sold their shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNarrative 2: LMC is a vulnerable company under a short attack by a group of hedge funds with the intentions of making profits on the short sale side by sinking the stock, and then eventually buying in for cheap on the long. This play is most likely led by Hindenburg and Morgan Stanely's Adam Jonas.\n\nWhen the market price of RIDE was $30, he set the price target to $18\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDays after the Hindenburg Report,when the market price was $15, he lowered the price target to $12\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-ride-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-03/#:\\~:text=MarketBeat%20Podcast-,Lordstown%20Motors%20(NASDAQ%3ARIDE)%20Price%20Target%20Lowered,to%20%2412.00%20at%20Morgan%20Stanley&amp;text=They%20set%20a%20%22buy%22%20rating%20and%20a%20%2435.00,price%20target%20for%20the%20company](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-ride-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-03/#:~:text=MarketBeat%20Podcast-,Lordstown%20Motors%20(NASDAQ%3ARIDE)%20Price%20Target%20Lowered,to%20%2412.00%20at%20Morgan%20Stanley&amp;text=They%20set%20a%20%22buy%22%20rating%20and%20a%20%2435.00,price%20target%20for%20the%20company).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the same Adam Jonas that claimed Tesla could fall to $10 pre-split in 2019\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/morgan-stanley-tesla-shares-could-drop-to-10-in-worst-case-scenario.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/morgan-stanley-tesla-shares-could-drop-to-10-in-worst-case-scenario.html)\n\nFor those who don't remember: Tesla was trading around $350 pre split in late 2018, when it came under financial pressure and a short attack dropping the price to $180 pre split mid 2019. Later, it was disclosed that many of the firms that were spreading FUD about TSLA in mid 2019, including Morgan Stanley, ended up buying massive shares and going long. Now, Morgan Stanely, despite the astronomical gains and current valuations, is today, constantly pumping TSLA.\n\n[https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/11/adam-jonas-of-morgan-stanley-tesla-tsla-is-a-must-own-but-what-about-legacy-auto/](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/11/adam-jonas-of-morgan-stanley-tesla-tsla-is-a-must-own-but-what-about-legacy-auto/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWant proof?

Typical short selling requires borrowing shares to sell short. FTD HAPPENS WHEN ALL THE SHARES HAVE BEEN BORROWED AND THEY ARE STILL SHORT SELLING BEYOND WHAT THEY CAN BORROW. They had Failure to Deliver EVERY SINGLE DAY in the second half of March.\n\nGo look at Fintel, Fidelity, or whatever brokerage you use. You will find that the shares available to borrow to short RIDE are all gone. THIS STOCK IS BEING SHORT SOLD TO THE GROUND.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll sane humans have a strong psychological reaction towards loss aversion. (Read Prospect Theory by noble winning behavior economists: Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman). Here is a quick summary link: [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-loss-aversion/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-loss-aversion/)\n\nAs an investor, watching your account lose money is literally a form of mental torture. [https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/70374172.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/70374172.pdf)\n\nWhat an investor must understand about a short attack is that there are two clashing forces. The short attackers must withstand an ongoing interest payment for their short sales. The retail investor must withstand the ongoing metal torture from seeing losses in their portfolios. Whichever side breaks first will lose.\n\nThe more FUD the shorts put out there, the more retail investors will give up and sell at lower prices. The longer they keep the price subdued, the more it affects everyone's perception of the actual price of the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOTHER THINGS TO NOTE ABOUT THE SHORT SELLING ENVIRONMENT:\n\nStarting 4/22/21 SEC will be enforcing a Rule Change\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/staff-fully-paid-lending](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/staff-fully-paid-lending)\n\nWhat this means: Hedge fund A wants to short a stock. They execute their trade through a Bank A. The Bank brings the trade to the clearing house.\n\nStarting 4/22/21, the Bank must also provide cash to the clearing house for this trade to ensure that if Hedge fund A and Bank A go bankrupt, the shares can still be bought back and closed out.\n\nWe know Archegos used Credit Suisse, Nomura, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs to margin long and possibly short stocks. When Archegos could not meet their margin call, the four Banks began to liquidate, and Credit Suisse and Nomura at least are taking a major loss.\n\nNow, Archegos was leveraged 8 to 1, which apparently almost all the hedge funds are. If these failures of margin calls get numerous and massive enough, it could potentially cause a bank to go bankrupt. The law being changed is designed, so that in the event that the bank goes bankrupt, these shorts can still be unwound.\n\nWhat this means for the Banks. Banks actually like their short selling and margin long clients because the Banks make a lot of interest off these clients. However, this change in the rules will begin to tie up cash and require Banks to hold a lot more cash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWonder why JPM and BAC just reported amazing quarters of profit and then last week issued $13 billion and $15 billion in bonds? It probably has to do with this rule being implemented.\n\n[https://news.yahoo.com/bank-america-set-record-largest-181313888.html](https://news.yahoo.com/bank-america-set-record-largest-181313888.html)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/jpmorgan-sell-13-billion-bonds-184602000.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/jpmorgan-sell-13-billion-bonds-184602000.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat this means for short sellers. Because the banks had to issue these bonds to prepare to meet these requirements, you can bet that the interest rate for short sellers is going to go up significantly. The interest prior to these rules was around 1%-2% according to Fintel. The banks issue their bonds around 4%-5%, which means that short sellers will have to begin paying 5%-7% on their short positions. This will obviously put significantly more pressure on short sellers to close out their positions, but it isn't exactly overnight forced to liquidate. Still, this means that the prolonged shorting of a company will be much harder to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 10: THEORETICAL VALUE WITHOUT SHORTS OR HYPE\n\nThere are several ways to evaluate the price of a stock:\n\n1) Moving Averages and technical analysis are not my thing. Sorry.\n\n2) If you look at other research firms, they give RIDE:\n\n\\- Goldman Sachs: $31\n\n\\- RF Lafferty: $35\n\n\\- WOLFE: $27\n\n\\- BTIG: $40\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-ride-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-03/#:\\~:text=The%20Goldman%20Sachs%20Group%20began,target%20price%20for%20the%20company.&amp;text=They%20issued%20a%20%22sell%22%20rating,target%20price%20for%20the%20company](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-ride-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-03/#:~:text=The%20Goldman%20Sachs%20Group%20began,target%20price%20for%20the%20company.&amp;text=They%20issued%20a%20%22sell%22%20rating,target%20price%20for%20the%20company).\n\nBut they can be dishonest and we don't know how they came to those numbers.\n\n3) SO... let's do some theorycrafting! \\~Yay\\~\n\nI will be presenting valuations based on the method: projected future profit of this company discounted to present value at 10% compounding interest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMATH Pt 1: Profit per car sold. \n\n\\- The Endurance truck is based off of the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra 1500\n\n[https://www.caranddriver.com/lordstown/endurance](https://www.caranddriver.com/lordstown/endurance)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra make at least $17,000 PROFIT (Revenue - Parts - Labor - Dealership Holdback) per vehicle higher/middle end trucks.\n\n[https://gmauthority.com/blog/gm/chevrolet/silverado/2019-chevrolet-silverado/](https://gmauthority.com/blog/gm/chevrolet/silverado/2019-chevrolet-silverado/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The MSRP on the Silverado and Sierra are $35,000\n\n[https://www.chevrolet.com/trucks/silverado/1500](https://www.chevrolet.com/trucks/silverado/1500)\n\n[https://www.gmc.com/trucks/sierra/1500/sle-elevation-slt/build-and-price/config](https://www.gmc.com/trucks/sierra/1500/sle-elevation-slt/build-and-price/config)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Dealership Holdback is 3% for GM trucks\n\n[https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/how-much-does-a-new-car-dealer-make-on-a-deal/](https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/how-much-does-a-new-car-dealer-make-on-a-deal/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSO: $35,000 revenue - 17000 profit - $900 Dealership Hold Back = $17,100 cost of parts and labor to produce the truck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Next we have to add the cost of the battery for the Endurance: 109kWH costing $137/kWh should cost $15,000\n\n[https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-prices-cited-below-100-kwh-for-the-first-time-in-2020-while-market-average-sits-at-137-kwh/](https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-prices-cited-below-100-kwh-for-the-first-time-in-2020-while-market-average-sits-at-137-kwh/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Extra conservative estimate - Obviously LMC will not be producing trucks as efficiently as GM, and while LMC will not have to pay for a combustion engine, they do have to pay for 4 Hub Motors. For this reason, I will be conservative and estimate that it will cost an additional $10,000 per truck to produce in the first 5 years until LMC scales up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- No, let's be extra, extra conservative - Let's throw in another $5000 per car of unexpected unknown costs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProfit per Endurance sold in the first 5 years: $52500 - $17,100 - $15,000 - $10,000 - $5,000= $5,400 + Emission Credits\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow much are these emission credits worth? Well in q1 of 2020, TSLA made $428M off emission credits off 90,700 cars sold, so they are probably worth about $4718 per car.\n\n[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a32346670/other-automakers-paid-tesla-record-354-million/](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a32346670/other-automakers-paid-tesla-record-354-million/)\n\nHowever, GM has the right to buy the emissions credits off of LMC for the first 3 years at 75% the market price, or $3538 per car.\n\n[https://jalopnik.com/lordstown-motors-just-showed-one-reason-gm-was-surprisi-1846555417](https://jalopnik.com/lordstown-motors-just-showed-one-reason-gm-was-surprisi-1846555417)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n25 year forecast of profits per vehicle.\n\nYear 2022-2023: $10,400 + $3,538 = $8,938 per vehicle\n\nBoth Bidden and Republicans are on board with emission credits, so no matter who wins the 2024 election, emission credits should continue until 2028. After the first 3 years, they should return to market value of $4718.\n\nAfter 3 years, the cost per KWH battery should be bellow $100, lowering the cost of the battery to $11,000\n\nYear 2024-2028: $52500 - $17,100 - $11,000 - $10,000 + $4718 = $14,118\n\nSince many states are mandating no ICE cars sold after 2030, it is unreliable to estimate emission credits after 2028. However, by 2029, LMC certainly will have increased their production of scale, lowering production costs, so I will remove my conservative extra $10,000 cost.\n\nYear 2029-2045: $52500 - $17,100 - $11,000  = $19,400\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMATH Pt 2: Estimating Yearly Production\n\nWe will look at 4 cases for this model:\n\n\\- Case 1 (Bull Case): LMC produces 6,000 cars in 2021, then 60,000 cars in 2022, and eventually ramping up to 600,000 cars per year.\n\n\\- Case 2 (Bear Case): LMC struggles to scale up similar to how Tesla scaled up. I know what you're thinking, \"Are you crazy?! TSLA's scale up is a massive success. There's no way LMC has better engineers and production team than TSLA.\" \n\nI completely agree, hoping LMC becomes better than TSLA at production is not realistic, BUT keep in mind. \n\nTSLA had to: Develop a nonworking factory at Fremont, develop their own vehicle design, develop electric motors, develop battery technology, develop 3 different cars - including falcon wing doors, develop self driving AI, develop solar panel technology, develop their own media and user interface, develop their own computer chip for self driving AI, build GigaFactory Nevada, and Shanghai, all while the CEO was also developing reusable rockets, selling flamethrowers that are not flamethrowers, and digging underground tunnels for Las Vegas and Los Angeles.\n\nMeanwhile LMC has to: Retool their working factory, purchase truck parts from GM suppliers, purchase batteries from LG Chem, purchase Hub Motors from Elaphe, purchase computer chips and software from GM, and then slap it all together. Then they'll do it all again with Camping World's Vans for round 2.\n\nTesla had to face and overcome monumental challenges. Considering that LMC is tackling much fewer projects, I'm pretty confident that LMC will ramp up production faster than 2012 - 2018 Tesla.\n\nFor this bear case, I actually used the exact production numbers of TSLA from 2012-2020.\n\n\\- Case 3 (Hindenburg Case): This scenario will model zero production for 3 years and a ramp of the bear case 2 afterwards.\n\n\\- Case 4 (Ultimate bear case): LMC never produces a single truck for sale. JK, I'm not going to model this... the answer in this case is ZERO, DUH! If you truly thought this was the scenario, why the hell would you still be reading?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMATH Pt 3: Discounting Time Value of Money\n\nSince the SP500 seems to compound at 10% annually, we must take into consideration the opportunity cost of this 10% annual return.\n\nPresent Value = PV\n\nNumber of Years = Y\n\nFuture Value = FV\n\nSO\n\nPV\\*(1+10%)\\^Y = FV\n\nOR\n\nPV = FV/(1.10\\^Y)\n\nThis number will be found on the furthest left side of the table\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMATH Pt 4: Putting it all Together\n\nAdding the profit of the company discounted by the Time Value of 10% compounding should give us the total Market Cap. Then we assume full dilution of the 465M shares to give us a Price per share.\n\nHere are the results:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XKywmalHD7XxRZX\\_u5nI79GdF4ePxNcCKItGsdh2bv8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XKywmalHD7XxRZX_u5nI79GdF4ePxNcCKItGsdh2bv8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, EVEN in the worst case scenario they are 3 years out from production, we STILL have massive upside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 11: COMPARING RIDE TO OTHER CAR COMPANIES\n\nTSLA: The king of the EV futures: MKT Cap $685.94 B\n\nVolkswagen: A major player of European EV futures: MKT CAP - $96.7B\n\nBYD: A major player in China's EV futures: MKT CAP - $92.7B\n\nNIO: Really, another start-up. Now has a 696,960 sqft factory in Hefei. Their goal is to  produce 90,000 cars this year from that factory. All their previous cars were actually produced by JAC Motors and were sold at a lost for each car. MKT CAP  $60.26B\n\nGM: Big Brother or Big Sister ally. MKT CAP: $83.40B\n\nRIVIAN: The main competition. Has 2.6M Sqft factory in Illinois. Can be first to market with $69,000 truck June 2021.  Estimated MKT CAP to soon be: $50B\n\nFORD: The Big Brother to Rivian: Mkt Cap: $47.48B\n\nLucid Motors: Another start-up EV sedan with a factory in Arizona. Nothing against them or Arizona, but I think selling a $69,000 sedan to compete with Tesla S is the wrong direction: Mkt Cap: $5.06B\n\nNKLA: That actual fraud company that actually rolled a truck downhill and told investors it was a working prototype. Mkt Cap: $4.03B\n\nCanoo: The EV company that wants to make passenger vans that you cannot buy, but can only rent. With no factories and no partnerships. Mkt Cap: $1.97B\n\nRIDE: This EV Truck company with a 6.2M Sqft factory. $712M Cash on Hand. $34M Debt. Has working Beta trucks, partnerships with GM, Camping World, LG Chem. Will probably be second or third to market with $52,500 pickup truck. They are selling an Endurance that is less expensive than the Rivian truck and more traditional looking than the Cyber Truck. Mkt Cap: $1.62B\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe End. Thank you for reading.",

What did not make a whole lot of sense was the unbelievable ascent that took place immediately after.\n\nI\u2019m a grad student and so I don\u2019t have a job at the moment (will graduate next month though and finally start earning money hopefully), so I couldn\u2019t risk putting my savings in the markets and instead I sat in the sidelines watching everybody make a ton of money except me.\n\nBy the end of 2020, I finally said enough was enough and decided that it was time to stop watching from the sidelines and finally start an investment portfolio. That was my New Years resolution and by the middle of January I had finished my due diligence on all the companies and stocks I wanted to buy and I moved two-thirds of all the cash I had in my name into the stock market...\n\nIt was a very good few weeks for me after that, and then February happened...\n\nI felt like such a dumbass for watching all the gains take place and then as soon as I moved my money in a correction took place. Of course I was overweight on tech and growth and so I was down about 12% of my investments all within the first 4 weeks of when I started trading.\n\nIt was definitely a gut punch and made me question if I actually knew anything at all about stocks, but I knew that selling would be stupid so I just waited.\n\nIt was hard not checking my Fidelity app every single day, but I\u2019m happy to say that today I\u2019m finally back to where I started.

Come on dude, do better\"\n\nThe reason I pasted the 2 links, as a response to the post was to show that there are no updated positions as of 3/31/2021 from Black Rock Fund Advisors. There are no updates since 2017!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2- \"That 13F-HR is the most recent holdings report. Can you show me where BR-FA sold?\"\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. You can see that just after that date of the most recent 13F-HR (Filed 2017-02-10), Black Rock Fund Advisors has not submitted any more 13F-HR forms to note their positions.

The evolutions of those GME positions over time you can check for yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's come to the other point made by the user \n\n\"Also, in your Fidelity sale filing, pay attention to section 7. They moved the securities to another company.\n\n\"Item 7. Identification and Classification of the Subsidiary Which Acquired the Security Being Reported on By the Parent Holding Company.\n\nSee attached Exhibit A.\"\n\nHere he is referring to an old post that came out at the time of the Fidelity GME sale posted on the GME forum. I have already replied to this kind of comment and I paste one of my answers:\n\nI've already been shown the thread you mean ( you can find it in the comments on my post on s u p e r s t o n k ). The author of the post is simply wrong because:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1 - There is no reference whatsoever to a transfer of shares\n\n2- But let's say for sure that the author is right, where is the new SEC filing? Why on bloomberg terminal has disappeared fidelity from January 29 onwards?\n\n3- If there had been a real transfer there would be SEC filings with different C    I      K's.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to add that after reading what I have written here, it should be clearer why Fidelity has SOLD and not moved shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to conclude by saying that after posting my GME counter DD, I received many positive comments that understood what I was talking about but also many others that did not understand. It's okay to not understand some things, I didn't understand them when I started either. But I get annoyed by those who try to counter what I have written with really meaningless arguments that only show that they have not understood anything about the subject and have little knowledge on the subject. This is why I sometimes respond badly.",

        "selftext": "I see a lot of people asking about unit splits and determining cost basis after splitting, so I thought it might be helpful to just share a narrative of my recent experience with Fidelity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The Request***\n\nOn Monday 3/29/21, I called Fidelity's active trader line and was able to speak with a human within 10 minutes or less.  I told the broker that I wanted to split SPAC units into common shares and warrants for both CPUH and AACU, and he confirmed that Fidelity would submit the split requests to the SPACs.  He also confirmed that it would take 3-5 days to split, although he advised that it could be faster depending on the SPAC.  Once I was on the phone with him the process took maybe 20 minutes, although this likely would have been much quicker if I hadn't called the first morning CPUH was able to be split, as Fidelity was still finalizing the split instructions from CPUH when I called.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Cost Basis Determination***\n\nI also asked the broker to explain how my new post-split cost basis would be determined.  The broker advised that the unit split is a corporate action and thus Fidelity has no role in determining the post-split cost basis and can only submit the split request to the corporation (the SPAC).  The broker further advised that the SPAC itself actually has fairly wide discretion over determining the new cost basis, as long as they do so within applicable regulatory guidelines (which the broker did not point me to and with which I am not familiar).  In other words, the SPAC gets to divide your original cost basis between the common shares and warrants at their discretion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The Result***\n\nAs of this morning, 4/1/21, my AAC units have been split, and my account now shows shares and warrants.  My account shows CPUHU still in the process of splitting.   \n\nFor AAC, the pre/post-split cost basis breaks down as follows:\n\n\\- 1000 AACU original cost basis: $10.60/unit (total: $10,600)  \n\n\\- 1000 AAC common shares: $10.42/share (total: $10,415.88) \n\n\\- 200 AAC warrants: $0.92/warrant (total: $184.12)\n\n\\-------------------\n\nThat's all I've got.  Hope this is helpful and informative.",

        "selftext": "Why isnt this illegal?\n\nNobody talking seems to be talking the implications for *every single individual investor*\n\nIn the days prior to the covid investment cycle, competitors shorted the heck out of disruptive stocks like Tesla. They took on real risk to hold down their competition. \n\nAfter GME scared the heck out of these firms being an uncontrollabke wild card, \"share borrowing\" was invented.\n\nEssentially companies can short their competitors without risk of being locked into the short &amp; becoming illiquid. All they do is call one of the offering brokerage firms and pay to borrow the shares. They can then buy out their position with these and fidelity returns the shares to the owner whenever at their leisure. Their goals accomplished both matter if they earn physical dollar count or not. In the end:\n\n1. Broker makes money\n\n2. Shorter makes money (maybe)\n\n3. Technical structure and value of disruptive stock gets destroyed\n\n4. Loaner makes a few dollars cash,\n\n5. Everyone is happy right? Except loaner loses future value of their shares but isnt the wiser.\n\nThis is not just just slowing societal progress, its potentially murdering it.\n\nFor a roadmap into the who's who of disruption all need to do is look at the lists of companies brokers are asking to borrow shares for. Industries/commodities like vertical farming and graphene. In the last few months a few of these companies recieved spikes of higher short interest than GME at peak. \n\nI'll post a link to another I saw go down in the comments. \n\nThoughts?",

        "selftext": "RH and other brokerages contributed to the GME bust. You can argue the level of contribution but it appears they played a role. So a flood of retail investors switch to Fidelity; the knight in shining armor, right?\n\nI spent over an hour talking to three different experts on how Fidelity addresses PDT flags, margin, and spreads. I continued to be shocked the more answers I received and continued to ask more questions. Takeaway is that Fidelity is a boomer brokerage; they are not friendly to retail investors.\n\n***First and most importantly, Fidelity has no grace or probation period for pattern day trader (PDT) flags** \n\nIf you make more than 4 trades in a 5 day period, they will flag your account. So what, every brokerage does that. The difference with Fidelity is that your account will be flagged in perpetuity. Let that sink in. No warning flag, no 90 day probation period, no PDT reset, nothing. For all of your existence, they will require your account to have a $25k balance to ever execute a single day trade ever again...ever. They just changed this policy within the last 2-4 weeks, presumably influenced by the flood of retail investors.\n\n***Second, Fidelity removes all margin abilities if you have a PDT flag***\n\nIf your account receives a PDT flag and you cannot meet the $25k minimum at any point in your lifetime... no margin, none, zero. Read number one again and then read this. Your account is flagged PDT in perpetuity and you lose all margin abilities forever.\n\n***Third, Fidelity considers partial executions (blocks) to be independent day trades*** \n\nSay you have a group of options you're attempting to buy and sell back same day. It makes sense to sell as a limit order. However, if that limit order executes in multiple parts (partial execution) those individual executions will be considered separate day trades. This means you could get 5 day trade counts if your limit order on 5 contracts partially executes one at a time. The only way around this is to select \"all or none\" under \"conditions\". This one blows my mind. If I set a limit order, I have no control over how many blocks it takes. That is a function of the liquidity and order book. \n\n***Fourth, if you leg out of a spread (debit or credit) Fidelity retroactively recalculates margin as if you entered the short side naked***\n\nThis one makes zero sense to me. Say you've enter a call debit spread with a $20 call strike long (buy) and then $25 call strike short (sell). This reduces the cost of the call and you are protected from the infinite risk of the $25 sold call because you own the $20 call. Now say that you leg out by buying back the $25 call you sold. You're left with a simple $20 call. At no point, were you naked on the sold $25 call. Doesn't matter, as soon as you leg out, Fidelity recalculates margin requirements as if you sold the $25 call naked even if you aren't approved for level 4 options. They will issue a margin call to cover the margin of selling the call as if its naked. Makes no sense because it's protected the whole time. \n\n***Fifth, Fidelity's web and mobile UI suck. Unless you're using the desktop app, why are you using such crappy UI?***\n\nFidelity's web UI is terrible in so many ways but the most obvious is that lack of live charting. If you're planning to use Fidelity then get ready to click \"refresh\" one million times. On top of this, their mobile app is just terrible. For complex option strategies, forget about trading on the app because it's nearly impossible. \n\nI think a huge unknown for me... what other wacky policies does Fidelity have hiding out there? They are clearly approaching trading differently than other brokers. RH and Webull operate infinitely more logical and honestly to the benefit of retail investors. Fidelity does not care or want to provide a service to retail investors. They are perfectly content to serve the boomers. Look elsewhere folks.",

        "selftext": "JP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, recently noted that fintechs pose \"enormous competitive threats\" to banks and SF Federal Reserve board member, Jackie Reses, sees them \u201ctaking over and revolutionizing banking\u201d with \u201ca wholesale transition\u201d of \u201ca $16 trillion market cap\u201d.\n\nIn this context, fintech Paysafe (PSFE) is newly listed on the NYSE and introduced to the US market. Already well known in Europe, Paysafe reports a substantial $362 million in free cash flow, projects $100 billion in transactional volume, $1.5 billion in revenue, healthy double-digit growth and expanding $30%+ EBITDA margins, but, despite absolutely no negative news, the stock has taken a pounding which, in turn, has brought the bears out in force with some dubious arguments. Sorry for the long post, but I thought I'd address all of these arguments in one post:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCommon bear arguments:\n\n\\#1 Old business\n\n\\#2 Complex regulatory landscape / no moat\n\n\\#3 Growth by acquisition is risky and difficult\n\n\\#4 No growth\n\n\\#5 Slow growth\n\n\\#6 Too much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.\n\n\\#7 Not profitable\n\n\\#8 Blackstone made 3X and will sell\n\n\\#9 Founder share and warrant dilution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#1) Old business. \n\nPaysafe\u2019s extensive experience in risk management and its time-tested regulatory expertise over many regions globally is one of its greatest strengths. This is the reason that Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a rapidly moving space that is anticipated to grow 10X. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nMuch of Paysafe\u2019s business is in back-end payment processing so most don\u2019t even know they are using it, but Paysafe is considered to be at the forefront in its field: Winner \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d and they are rapidly expanding in the US with new partnerships (just last 3 months: Coinbase, Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto)\n\nIn Europe, where Paysafe is more known and used, Trustpilot (1) rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 25,000 reviews, and Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews.\n\nPaysafe has the No. 2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. They\u2019ve just integrated their digital wallet platforms, Neteller and Skrill, recently voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nAside from Coinbase, Luckbox and Microsoft, they are partnered with Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, among many others. They are currently moving quickly to integrate their services to offer easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into global banking as a service.\u00a0\n\nIn preparation for their plans, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone, two from CVC, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, and the Chairman of the Board of Fidelity.\n\nAs Chairman Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab\u2026I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet\u2026 It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\" This doesn't sound like an old company resting on its laurels. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#2) Complex regulatory landscape / no moat. \n\nBill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now also Paysafe\u2019s Chairman of the Board, calls Paysafe,\u201ca fortress. It\u2019s got a moat\u2026 We have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\" Their regulatory acumen is the reason they currently dominate globally in sports betting/iGaming and are integrating their global platforms to expand into banking as a service. There are 1.7 billion \"unbanked\" because so many in the world who have mobile devices, still don't have access to the essential ID metrics that most banks and credit cards require to open accounts. Paysafe's risk management and cross boarder regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant to go. Leaning into this strength, they've brought on PayPal's former CRO and added a multi-jurisdictional regulatory expert to their Board of Directors\n\nFrom SEC filed transcript (2) - Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh: \u201cTo be a true global player in the iGaming space, the level of payments regulation, of gaming regulation and certification is very, very complex. When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be a winner in this space, you\u2019re catering to some incredibly demanding clients. They want to be global, they want multiple APMs, but they want you to understand payment regulation in hundreds of countries in gaming and gambling regulation in hundreds of countries. That\u2019s something that Paysafe has developed very, very successfully in every market we\u2019ve entered.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#3) Growth by acquisition is hard. \n\nSynergistic inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a key pillar of Paysafe\u2019s forward growth strategy. Bill Foley's proven track record in quickly generating this kind of growth speaks for itself. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). Foley says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d (2, 4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#4) No growth. \n\nIt\u2019s true that Paysafe\u2019s revenue stagnated in 2020 resulting from business closures during Covid, but prior to that they reported a strong 27% CAGR (4,5), which is on par with high profile competitors:\n\n2017: $864 million rev\n\n2018 : $1.14 billion rev (+32%)\n\n2019 : $1.418 billion rev (+24%).\n\n2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)\n\nUnlike many fintechs, Paysafe has heavy exposure in brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed in 2020 due to Covid. During this market dislocation, they pivoted, \u201cexited low value referral channels\u201d and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and e-commmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.\n\nLooking at other brick-and-mortar payment processors hard-hit during the same period, like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:\n\n\u2014Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)\n\n\u2014 Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)\n\nNot claiming that Paysafe should be valued according to these two traditional payment processors but, given their commensurate slow down during Covid, it is interesting to note that their their averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46, which is very much in line with the valuation comps cited below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#5) Slow growth. \n\nGoing forward, Paysafe conservatively projects $10-13% annual growth over the next two years but they are careful so say that those growth projections exclude M&amp;A plans and expansion in iGaming which is expected to grow at 55% CAGR over the next several years. iGaming accounts for over a third of Paysafe\u2019s revenue so this growth is a significant exclusion.\n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso, who recently initiated coverage with a $19 price target (6) said, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d\n\nIn the short time since he wrote that, here are some of the headlines signaling a price target upgrade:\n\n1 \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n\n2 \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n\n3 New Hampshire: \"Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n\n4 \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n\n5 \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n\n6 \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n\n7 \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n\n8 \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n\n9 \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n\n10 \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n\n11 \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n\n12 \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n\n13 \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n\n14 \"Single-sports betting in Canada wins House vote, nears legalization\"\n\n15 \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n\n16 \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \\~12.5% (not far from Paysafe\u2019s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter eliminating outliers with highest multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes:\n\n1 Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.\n\n2 Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.\n\n3 As noted Paysafe\u2019s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&amp;A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.\n\n4 The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon\u2019s \"enormous competitive threats\" comment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#6) Too much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more. \n\nPaysafe just paid down $1.1 billion in debt. Why would they turn around and borrow again? As Fidelity\u2019s Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d\n\nTheir 3.6X Debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintech peers. Investopedia: \u201cDebt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. A high ratio result could indicate a company has a too-heavy debt load.\u201d Of the 11 fintech competitors I looked at, all but three (PYPL, ADYEY, NUVCF), have worse Debt/EBITDA ratios than Paysafe and many have negative EBITDA, making debt service that much more difficult:\n\nSquare: 77.8X\n\nRepay : 8.7X\n\nFiserv : $21.2B / $4.7B : 4.5X\n\nGPN : $10.27B / $2.8B : 3.67X\n\nShift4 : $1.8B / -$8M : negative EBITDA\n\nAffirm : $1.67B / -77.6M negative EBITDA\n\nPaysign : $4.3M / -$5.79M : negative EBITDA\n\nBill : $947M / -43.85M : negative EBITDA\n\nDepending on whether you include SQ and AFRM, the combined multiples of the above competitors (by EV/EBITDA, EV/free cash flow or EV/revenue) puts Paysafe\u2019s share price in the $45 to $90 range. Point being, their debt position is better than most and hardly a red flag. Further, management has said they\u2019ll be able to fund M&amp;A plans with expanding 32-35%+ EBITDA margins ($500 - 560 million, 21% CAGR) and $362 million in free cash flow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#7) Not profitable. \n\nPaysafe expects $900 million in gross profit with healthy 30-32% EBITDA margin. As one recent article pointed out, \u201cPaysafe has shown some intriguing projections in terms of its profitability. The company\u2019s projected gross margin is 63%, an impressive number compared to competitors like Square with a gross margin under 30%.\u201d\n\nThese fintech competitors are trading at much higher multiples but have worse EPS than Paysafe:\n\nRepay: -0.67,\n\nAffirm : -2.18,\n\nNuvei : -1.08,\n\nPaysign : -0.19.\n\nBill : -0.62,\n\nShift4 : -0.43\n\nAverage EV/EBITDA multiples of the above companies would put Paysafe's SP at $69\n\nIf you read their transcripts and presentations, you\u2019ll see that profit is being utilized to grow the business and integrate their global platforms into what they call Paysafe Unity. They\u2019ve recently completed the integration of Skrill and Neteller digital wallets into a single code. Foley has indicated further elimination of redundancies to create new efficiencies and increase margins to enhance M&amp;A activities. From what I can tell, Foley is all about the long game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#8) Blackstone made 3X and will sell. \n\nThe common myth is that Blackstone/CVC made 300% by paying $3 billion to take Paysafe private and receiving $9 billion in the recent deal to bring it public. The reality, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (8), is that Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private in 2017 for $3.9 Billion and they received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares on the recent deal. Adjusted for inflation, they paid $4.2 billion so it\u2019s more like a 33% return on a 4 year hold.\n\nImportantly, this came AFTER they grew revenue 65% ($864B to $1.426B), stewarded a billion in investments to grow the business, and the deal included paying down over $1.1 billion in debt. This suggests Foley cut a great deal for shareholders. It also explains why private equity has signaled that they'll stay on long term to reap much bigger gains through Foley\u2019s time-tested M&amp;A playbook.\n\nBlackstone itself says (9), \u201cThe term of private equity funds can be upwards of 7-10 years.\u201d With so much runway and comps pointing to a 3-4X valuation, why would Blackstone leave so much money on the table?\n\nBlackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler signals an ongoing interest in staying on: \u201cWe believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview Foley said, private equity\u2019s plan to stay on was part of what encouraged PIPE to invest $2 billion: \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d\n\nThis trust was reiterated in the SEC filed FTAC\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination: \u201cCommitment of Paysafe\u2019s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such stockholders\u2019 belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects of Paysafe going forward.\u201d\n\nThe PIPE investors are even less of a concern because they are title and life insurance companies known for long-term investment strategies, they are closely aligned with Foley and understand his both his M&amp;A track record and his ability to create mutually beneficial synergistic deals through what Bloomberg called the \u201cThe Foley Network\u201d (perhaps, for example, Paysafe will handle Fidelity\u2019s massive transactional volume). In a recent Bloomberg interview, Bill Foley said, \u201cThe thing that was different about our transaction is that we brought capital to the table. The companies that I\u2019m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset besides the fact that it\u2019s a great asset.\u201d\n\nBut, let's assume these funds do eventually sell a portion of their shares which, given Paysafe's $100B market share (similar to Square\u2019s, but more profitable), would allow index funds to accumulate larger positions. Just as large funds often drive price down to accumulate shares, they also can drive price up to sell into strength and do so via off-market trades, avoiding price slippage. This question is less about real risk than it is about short-term fear, which is ultimately why understanding the context and fundamentals is so critical.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#9) Founder share and warrant dilution. \n\nAccording to the 20F recently filed, roughly 53 million warrants pose potential dilution at a maximum of 7.5% (movement we've seen in a day), but the cashless conversion option, generally exchanging 3 warrants for a single share, can reduce that dilution by 2/3 to around 2.5%. It is very likely that many will use this option since most warrant holders do not have the extra cash to pay an additional $11.50 for each warrant conversion. It will probably be somewhere in the middle of the two scenarios (\\~5%) but this is not a major concern in the scheme of things.\n\nImportantly, the 20F also shows that all founder shares are already included in the current outstanding share count so there is no risk of dilution there.\n\nTotal FTAC Founder shares 175,292,458 24.2 %\u00a0\n\nBlackstone Investors 123,734,571 17.1 %\u00a0\n\nCVC Investors 156,006,433 21.6 %\u00a0\n\nOther Pre-Business Combination Paysafe Shareholders 53,701,074 7.4 %\u00a0\n\nCannae (excluding amounts included in Founder) 50,000,000 6.9 %\u00a0\n\nPIPE Investors (excluding Cannae) 165,000,000 22.8 %\u00a0\n\n723,734,536 100.0 %\u00a0\n\nBelow are some examples of the warrant cashless conversion rates per the chart in the S1 (7). Cash redemption is more profitable when commons trade above $18.\u00a0\n\n$18 : $6.50\n\n$17 : $6.08\u00a0\n\n$16 : $5.57\n\n$15 : $5.05\n\n$14 : $4.54\n\n$13 : $4.04\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite a lack of negative news, short sellers and bashers have been able to exploit a perfect storm of doubt created by seemingly unrelated events ranging from forced selling pressure coming from widely reported changes in margin requirements without prior notice, to simultaneous limits on buying resulting from excessive delays in the new PSFE ticker being available on many platforms, to things in the media that this sub will not allowed to be discussed.  In this context, it is hard not to see a month's worth of \u201cfake sell walls\u201d and HFS \u201cshort ladder attacks\u201d as anything other than opportunistic price manipulation but, speculation can only get you so far. \n\nI think Paysafe is undervalued and, very likely, a 3X from here. Given Paysafe's healthy fundamentals, large market share in a fintech space known for \u201csticky\u201d customers, and exposure to high growth verticals like iGaming, it seems inevitable that large funds are poised to benefit from these low prices, especially once the first audited quarterly numbers are available on May 11th.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPer their analyst presentation, here is Paysafe\u2019s minimum Q1 guidance to meet or beat:\n\n$360 million revenue\n\n$220 million gross profit\n\n$105 million EBITDA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I hold $600K in commons and warrants\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. All users should complete their own due diligence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n(1) Trustpilot\u00a0[https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(2) Transcript:\u00a0[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001818355/000119312520311318/d91054d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001818355/000119312520311318/d91054d425.htm)\n\n(3) 20F\u00a0[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc)\n\n(4) Investor Presentation:\u00a0[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(5) Analyst Presentation:\u00a0[https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(6) Analyst $19\u00a0[https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(7) S1:\u00a0[https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(8) WSJ:\u00a0[https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827)\n\n(9) Blackstone:\u00a0[https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the\\_life\\_cycle\\_of\\_private\\_equity\\_insights.pdf](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf)\n\n(10) Q1 earnings call:\u00a0[https://ir.paysafe.com/news-events/events/detail/9758/first-quarter-2021-earnings-call](https://ir.paysafe.com/news-events/events/detail/9758/first-quarter-2021-earnings-call)",

        "selftext": " \n\nMSTR is a business intelligence company providing analytics and enterprise tools for companies. Their customers in FY 2021 include Pfizer, ABC, VISA, and eBay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wlq7ycsn0su61.png?width=1879&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a2436c961b84c31b868f205841c31d69167e705\n\n \n\nAlthough it may seem like this is another BI company that has a lot of competitors, MSTR has one unique thing going for it\u2026 its coin holdings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/34dh57m40su61.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d849f18536c85cb517f2bf097bd9b29cc1f0a7ad\n\nThey have 90,859 coins and if we multiply that by the est. coin price on 4/27/2021 \u2192 55,000 -- &gt; they have about 4.25 bn worth of assets. What is MSTR\u2019s market cap right now? 6.2bn as of 4/22/2021. If you are bullish on the coin, then MSTR is heavily undervalued. IF the coin jumps to a $70,000 ATH (could be possible within months)... then MSTR\u2019s assets will increase to 6.36 bn. What is their market cap again? That\u2019s right, whenever the coin jumps high then MSTR will surely follow. Essentially, MSTR is a derivative of the coin. But it\u2019s more rewarding to get in on MSTR because the ROI is a lot bigger than the coin. Calls and shares whenever it dips are the play here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you take a look at the graph of MSTR, you will know what I am talking about,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[3 month graph of MSTR from Jan 22- Apr 22 \\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/rkrasm5s0su61.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=015a81d6717d6c48f24f5ccea8b7001d3581e2cc)\n\nAll these dips and rises. They're by $100-300. If you pick a somewhat floor like $600. And if the bull market for coin continues.. then there is no reason it should not be at $800+ again like the past. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRisk: I am not the biggest fan of the coin, however I am a fan of the bull market for it. Big institutions have bought in on this ex: Tesla, JP Morgan, Fidelity, PayPal, Visa, etc... the cat's out of the bag. Is the coin the future tho? Maybe on another discussion, but I doubt it. However, derivatives of the coin (where it falls and rises) I do not doubt. Because the market is overall confusing to me and too many factors are in play for me to consider, MSTR is something that is not. They are a derivative of the coin.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlays: Adding in shares here and there (been burned tho.. so I'm taking it easy with calls). And add in calls for July at the $800-1000 strike. \n\n \n\nPositions: 2 @ 639.43. Looking to add more shares / acquire a call for either 4/30 or july.",

        "selftext": "Most of the cash I have set aside for moonshots is in GME. However, I think Coinbase is a steal at its current market cap compared to BNB at 77 billion, and I'd like to gain some exposure at this price without paying a whole lot. I've examined the crypto market for a long time, and if you described calls to me my reaction is \"holy shit that sounds risky!\"\n\nNonetheless, I'd like to buy some calls on Coinbase, so as to not divert too many funds from the enormous gorilla. I think with a low enough strike price and enough time for the price to mature, it's not a bad bet. Coinbase is the backbone for integrating this new asset class in our society.\n\nSo why the hell won't Fidelity let me buy covered calls? Does anybody know what their minimum requirements are? Is there a better service I should use for this? I don't want to because that sounds like a pain in the ass, but apparently, Fidelity is going to patronize me for not being rich enough.

Proterra has three complementary  businesses:\n\n* **Proterra Powered**: Delivering industry-leading battery systems and electrification solutions to commercial vehicle manufacturers;\n* **Proterra Transit:** Leading North America as the market\u2019s #1 electric transit bus OEM; and\n* **Proterra Energy:** Offering end-to-end turnkey charging and energy management solutions.\n\nThe  Company\u2019s industry-leading battery systems have been proven in more  than 16 million service miles driven by its fleet of transit vehicles  and validated through partnerships with world-class commercial vehicle  OEMs, such as Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation (FCCC), Thomas  Built Buses, Van Hool, Bustech, and Optimal-EV. To date, Proterra has  produced and delivered more than 300 megawatt-hours of battery systems,  more than 550 heavy-duty electric transit buses and installed 54  megawatts of charging systems.\n\nProterra  operates manufacturing facilities in California and South Carolina, as  well as a state-of-the-art R&amp;D lab in Silicon Valley. The Company  recently announced the opening of a new battery production line  co-located in its electric transit bus manufacturing facility in Los  Angeles County.

With an incredible first-mover advantage (16mm driven/10  years production) and a massive lead on the market (50%+ US market  share), there is nothing stopping this stock from absolutely exploding  post-merger which is expected to happen end of March-first week in April  (although the official statement is \"the first half of this year\").\n\nThe  company is currently undervalued by 116.42% on fundamentals alone, and  that's on the \"fair\" end. When people realize what is actually happening  here and what this is about to become, I think the hype and excitement  has the potential to drive these prices much higher. I see a TSLA  situation brewing. No not because it's just another EV company, because  it's an established, well-connected, constantly growing *commercial* EV company.\n\n**Bear Case:**  I literally can't think of one aside from the merger falling apart. If  someone could provide a bear case in the comments for Proterra (assuming  the merger is successful) I would love to discuss it, because either  I'm missing something glaringly obvious or this might be my greatest  pick.\n\n**How to Play?**\n\nI  am long on this with my shares. I will be holding all my shares for  several years, my calls I will exercise half after the merger and sell  the rest for a nice profit. If you want to just play the merger that's  an option too. Meaning just hold until the merger date and sell at  whatever you think the peak is that very day.\n\n1. Buy shares, ACTC will change to PTRA after the merger. Shares will be 1:1\n2. Warrants, ACTCW, if you're not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of $11.50\n3. Calls, I think virtually anything listed is going to print (aside from 03/19)\n4. Selling puts, the premiums are hefty so either you'll get a nice premium or you'll own some shares at a really nice discount.\n\nDisclaimer:  Normally I wouldn't want to share this play with you guys lol , but  truthfully, it just doesn't matter with Proterra. Nothing could stop it  at this point. So buy it and leave, buy and hold forever, I don't care. I  did my job, you know it exists and you're welcome.\n\n**TL;DR**:  Proterra. ACTC. The best infrastructure play. This thing is gonna be  nuts. Buy it, hold it, forget about it. Or play it short term, idc. Not  FA.\n\nI don't just like the stock. I fucking love it.",

        "selftext": "[Vanguard slashes the price of financial advice](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-9482093/Vanguard-slashes-price-financial-advice.html)\n\nUS investment giant Vanguard aims to shake up the financial advice market with the launch of a cut-price service tomorrow.\n\nAlready known for low fees for its funds, which track markets rather than using skilled managers to pick investments, Vanguard will charge 0.79 per cent a year for financial advice \u2013 including the cost of the investment funds and platform fee.\n\nThe move could send shockwaves through an industry where the fees of fund managers and financial advisers often add up to more than double this.\n\nTraditional financial advisers charge an initial fee of 2.4 per cent, followed by 1.9 per cent a year in fund and advice costs on average, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nVanguard, the world's second largest asset manager, could also grab billions of pounds in business from the estimated nine out of ten people who do not currently get any financial advice \u2013 often because they fear they can't afford it.\n\nSean Hagerty, head of Vanguard Europe, says: 'For many investors the cost of advice is a barrier \u2013 it is not uncommon to see total fund management and advice costs of more than 2 per cent.'\n\nVanguard's service will not be as comprehensive as offered by independent financial advisers.\n\nFor example, its advice does not cover inheritance tax planning, property and other assets and insurance products.\n\nIt also does not enable savers to buy funds aside from its own.\n\nFor savers with complex finances, specific goals, or who want plenty of support, an independent financial adviser could still be the best solution. But for savers with straightforward finances, the Vanguard service could be ample.\n\nThis is not the first time Vanguard has thrown down the gauntlet to the financial industry with rock-bottom prices.\n\nIn 2017, it launched an online investment service costing just 0.15 per cent a year \u2013 considerably cheaper than the incumbents.\n\nAnd last year it added a self-invested personal pension charging 0.15 per cent a year \u2013 capped at \u00a3375. By comparison, wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown charges up to 0.45 per cent a year.\n\nVanguard hopes its new 'personal financial planning' service will appeal especially to people coming up to retirement and who want to turn savings into a secure income for their old age.\n\nIt will offer advice on how to achieve retirement targets by exploring a range of tax-efficient options. This will be particularly important for savers who risk breaching the pension saving lifetime allowance of \u00a31,073,100.\n\nAny money above this level taken as income incurs an extra 25 per cent charge and taken as a lump sum is taxed at 55 per cent.\n\nHagerty says: 'We see the lifetime allowance as something that could become a factor for many people \u2013 and we aim to provide support so clients are able to consider other tax-efficient options, such as individual savings accounts.'\n\nInitially the service will only be open to people with at least \u00a350,000 to invest and this money will have to be put into Vanguard's range of funds.\n\nThose with savings of \u00a350,000 to \u00a3100,000 will be offered a 'digital financial planning experience'.\n\nThey will also be able to talk through the details and their aims with an adviser over the phone.\n\nSavers with more than \u00a3100,000 can have video-based conversations as well as accessing phone support.\n\nMeanwhile those with more than \u00a3750,000 invested will get their own financial planner, who will also be able to offer face-to-face financial advice.\n\nHagerty says: 'Financial advice will be offered by real people \u2013 not robots. But once advisers have discussed retirement targets with clients, they will use technology to help manage a portfolio.'\n\n\nVanguard will use back office technology to set off alerts when it is time for a customer to move their money into different accounts or receive fresh advice. \n\nThese alerts will be triggered at points that customers have agreed in advance with advisers. They could include, for example, when a customer hits an investment goal, or needs to change the level of risk of their investments as they move closer to retirement.\n\nAdvice will not cover non-Vanguard-branded investments, though these could still be taken into account when coming up with a financial plan.\n\nVanguard offers more than 75 funds to choose from, which track indices such as the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE 100.\n\nHagerty says Vanguard is not trying to take money from independent financial advisers, as they play a vital role in the market.\n\nYet these advisers might still have plenty to fear \u2013 with Vanguard calculating that its low-cost model means an investor with a \u00a3250,000 lump sum could save more than \u00a3190,000 over 25 years if they pay 0.79 per cent a year in total charges for fund management and advice rather than 2.4 per cent of their investment upfront and 1.9 per cent a year thereafter. This is based on a projected return of 5 per cent a year.\n\nHagerty adds: 'With potential savings of hundreds of thousands of pounds, you may ask yourself whether paying for expensive managed funds and financial advice offers value for money.'\n\nMost independent financial advisers charge an annual fee calculated as a percentage of your investments, but some charge an hourly rate, generally about \u00a3150 an hour.\n\nNew player Bancroft Wealth offers financial advice for a competitive flat fee of \u00a3500 a year.\n\nJeremy Fawcett, founder of the consultancy Platforum, believes the new Vanguard service could steal customers from existing so-called robo-adviser services, such as Nutmeg, as well as DIY investment broker services that offer advice arms, such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Fidelity.\n\nNutmeg charges 0.99 per cent a year for managing funds, but requires a one-off \u00a3575 for 'personalised planning and advice'.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown charges an initial 1 per cent for 'investment advice' on the first \u00a31 million you have with it, with a minimum charge of \u00a3495 if you receive advice by phone.\n\nOngoing financial advice costs 0.365 per cent a year. The fees are separate from any fund charges.\n\nFidelity offers a 'Wealth Management' investment advice service charging 1 per cent of the amount to be managed and 0.5 per cent a year for a review. This levy is separate from any fund charges.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone. Been working my way towards a bogglehead-like investment future. So currently this is my situation.\n\nIm 28 years old. Single (probs be married in under 2 years). She has 2 kids. I make about 50k after tax. Currently in grad school and will graduate in 4 years. Will be making &gt;125k after that point. \n\nI already have my emergency fund set up. \n\nMy employer does a 401k that matches 5% and i contribute 5% (note this is weekly cause im paid weekly). Also have about 13k sitting in a transamerican account from an old employer. \n\nCurrently have a taxable investment account through webull (eventually going to transfer this to fidelity once it gets bigger). I hold 60% VTI, 20% QQQM, 20% SCHD. In about 3-5 years will decrease that to 70% VTI, 20% SCHD, 10% QQQM and plan to hold steady there. (Will possibly add VXUS in the future but thats been discussed and thats not my point of this post). The goal of my taxable account is in 15-20 years i will pay for my 2 kids colleges. (I contribute about $2k/ month sometimes more depending and once I graduate hope to increase that to $4-5k/ month). \n\nAnyways been doing a lot of reading about IRAs and wanna contribute to one but need some guidance. \n\nIf I understand it correctly i can contribute $6k/ year and that will be taxed when i add it? I also understand that IF i ever needed the principle (6k/ year) i can withdrawl that tax free before 59.5 but can not touch the gains before then? Then once i hit 59.5 i can withdrawl the principle and gains tax free? \n\nIn my case is does that make sense? To add the 6k to the roth IRA and then add the rest to my taxable account? \n\nI would most likely use fidelity for the roth. What funds are generally the most recommended for the roth? Seems like for this would want to mirror the total market (us/ intl.) Would i just buy into VT then? Is that how the roth funds work?\n\nWhat am i missing here? What would i do differently? I am open for all suggestions.",

        "selftext": "Yesterday, I did something stupid. I fought a Margin sell out. One may ask... How? Well, I had 3 Vertical Call Credit Spreads for $SPY that I bought towards the end of the trading day looking to make a quick buck. Within 5 minutes I got closed out by TDAmeritrades Margin Sell Out team at 3:02 PM CST. I decided to be a jackass and by the same 3 vertical spreads, because there was still money to be squeezed. MSO closed be out again at 3:12 PM CST. I then decided to further be a jackass and purchase the same 3 vertical spreads at 3:14 PM CST, one minute before options market closed. \n\nWell, both strikes from the 3 Vertical Call Credit Spreads were out of the money, so I thought I made a quick 30 bucks. Then, 25 minutes later the 418 Short leg says ITM, and within 8 - 10 minutes I receive a phone call from, Anthony. I love you Anthony, sorry for being a pain in the ass.\n\nAnthony asks \u201cIs this xxxxxx?\u201d I respond \u201cYes\u201d. He gets down to business, without even delaying and says \u201cDid you repurchase 3 vertical spreads I sold for you?\u201d I say \u201cYes\u201d. He proceed to get angry and says \u201cWhy would you do that?! You now owe $125,500, because you messed up. You were chasing a few dollars and for $10 you now owe $125,500.\u201d \n\nAt this point I am low key about to have a heart attack, because he was super angry on the phone. He proceed to say \u201cDo you have a $125,000 for this?\u201d I then begin to mutter... No. He yells once again \u201cWhy would you do such a thing? Your short leg is ITM, and your long leg expired worthless, so you are uncovered as of now, and whatever spreads I sold earlier you rebought them.\u201d At this point, Anthony, certainly scared me that I owe $125,000 \ud83d\ude05. He then says, Can you transfer in $125,000. I then mentioned that I have a Fidelity account with $150,000, so I might be able to wire transfer to TD. He then begins to cool down and says \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this. I am purchasing half of what you owe $125,000.\u201d Make sure you put all that money into your account tomorrow, or the next day or whatever.\n\nI then tell him. \u201cThank you for explaining everything to me.\u201d I look forward to your call tomorrow. He straight up said in a cocky attitude \u201cNo, you call us\u201d. I don\u2019t blame him \ud83e\udd23.\n\nAnyway, I called TDA like 4-5 times scared to death that I owe them a full $125,000, but apparently, since I had 3 contracts. My risk is 300 shares x however much about or below they are from the exercise price, so in this case $418.\n\nI\u2019m happy that this interaction happen, because he low key traumatized me, due to the lack of my knowledge. I mean, what if it was any other volatile stock that wasn\u2019t $SPY, and I ended up in a more messed up situation? This was certainly a wake up call. I can\u2019t tell if he got into character when scaring me, but i\u2019m going to call him later today and thank him, because this consumed me the whole day today, because I didn\u2019t know what would happen and he was sure to make it seem like I lost $125,000. Not the greatest idea...\n\nOne thing I didn\u2019t like is he made me think I lost $125,000. I mean, I was mentally strong to handle that, but what if someone wasn\u2019t as strong and killed themselves, while he may or may not been having fun by making them think otherwise? What\u2019s your take? I\u2019m going to chat with him about that tomorrow. I appreciate how he busted my balls and scared me, but I don\u2019t think everyone else will process it the same...",

        "selftext": "I'm an old crayon eater from way back during a time when crayons were probably made with lead based pigments. And when I say \"silver back ape\" I am only referring to the maturity of the ape in ape years, when the hair on our backs turns silver and NOT because I think I am (necessarily) an \"alpha\" ape that gets all the bitches in the ape tribe or whatever they are called.\n\nThat out of the way, I read a few things on here over the last couple weeks when I was late to the GME party and scared to make a move because I didn't understand what I was doing. Today (or rather 2 days ago) I still have no idea what I am doing, but I read a couple threads in WSB that got me thinking about MVIS and so I read more. \n\nFrom that point, I decided that the DD that was provided here, and in one of the linked articles in particular, I decided to give it a go. I must note, that I had set up an account at Fidelity back in March when I was tracking the GME thing and itching to get in the game, but I sat on it until 2 days ago, dragging my knuckles on the ground in anger because I didn't think I had enough information to make an educated guess on what to do. In fact, I once asked a question in a thread here, and was lambasted with \"you need to go read investopedia\" replies.  \n\n\nNow here we are, 2 days after buying 100 shares of MVIS @ $12.48/per. I sort of feel like I made the right move as I look at my $549.00 profit on a $1248.00 bet, were I to cash out right now and take profit. For the record, I have no intention of doing that.  \n\n\nI read investopedia for a minute, and was just as confused as I was before I started reading, because not only am I a crayon eating, knuckle drag'r, I am an aging crayon eating, knuckle drag'r.  \n\n\nAm I in the right place? P.S. This is the only way I could find on Fidelity to post up what my position looks like, so don't scald me for being lame... I am a knuckle drag'r.....and I eat crayons.\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3hnomo8do0v61.jpg?width=1101&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7abe0b54cebead32958a0e8a0bbbbc8e0feed7a9",

        "selftext": "I've found trading spreads, usually put credit spreads fairly far OTM with like around -0.2 delta, I can get anywhere from 10-15%, if not more, on a monthly basis. I've been trading options for a little while now, and I continue to read and educated myself on options trading in general. I'm young, and have a college fund that is managed through Fidelity and yields average results annually. Now, I'm not a complete idiot, but I have been thinking about the possibility of withdrawing around half of it and diversifying it among a handful of lower risk 30-45 DTE spreads, managing them as I need to. No high risk naked calls or puts or anything like that. I understand the risk and the way spreads work.\n\nBut for example, I have 2x AAPL 126/124 put credit spreads open, expiring on 5/21. In a very oversimplified way, I have essentially put up $400 saying that AAPL will be above 126 on 5/21. If it is, I would walk away with $400 and the $82 in credit, or a 20.5% gain. Of course, I may need to manage this position, perhaps walking away with less than that $82, or in a very unfortunate case, losing all my collateral to begin with. I don't by any means consider myself an expert either, nor am I over confident in my abilities and think that I can trade $500 to $10,000 in a week.\n\nAnyways, I feel as though it is a rather safe bet to say that AAPL will be above 126 on 5/21, or that MSFT will be above 245 by 5/28 (this is a bit riskier to be fair), or that QQQ will stay above 318 by 5/28. I understand that things can go wrong, and I understand the need to diversify across sectors. Ultimately though, I have been seriously considering using a portion of this fund to trade spreads. I would welcome any advice, condemnation, suggestions, etc. Thanks!",

        "selftext": " Hey all!! There's interest so I'm moving to share the knowledge and tactics I've learned 10 years of Wall St. starting with a simple step-by-step book!\n\nMy plan is to share as much as possible. Here's a fun one to start.\n\n**Shareholder ownership as a tool. TLDR:** Shareholder lists help you anticipate how stock moves, the quality of the business, and ideas potential \"catalysts.\" And be valuation flexible!\n\nIf you are interested, I'd love to hear your [feedback here](https://forms.gle/RyycWAxNRsGZSxwTA) (2 minutes!). Here is the [outline of the book.](https://henrychien.com/investing-book/)\n\nThere are three major institutional groups in the markets.\n\n**1 - Passive funds.** ETFs and funds that invest based on indexes (like $SPY). They are over 50% over equity assets and likely account for most buying / selling volume day to day. They buy with inflows (people buying the fund) and buy more when stocks goes higher (market-cap weighted).\n\nSo how do you use this insight?\n\nOne is pick stocks in macro / sector flow ($XLE, $XLF, $XLRE, $XLC - top returns YTD - oil prices, rates, real estate, retail - all higher), and style flows ($IJR and $IWD - top returns YTD - small-caps, value).\n\nThe more % shares are ETF (i.e. passive), the more the stock will move with the factor / sector.\n\nSecond and very importantly, ***you must be flexible on valuation.*** When company's growth improves, the value of the company increases, so passive funds will ***buy more*** of the stock.\n\nThis is exactly what happened with $TSLA. ETFs will buy MORE as it gets bigger.\n\nUse valuation to understand the business and its upside but know that valuation is NOT a reason (alone) to buy or sell something - the majority of funds don't even look at it.\n\n**2 - Hedge funds (HF)** These funds that invest with specialized strategies (provide \"alpha\"). Well-respected names like Lone Pine / WhaleRock for growth, or value HFs like Scion (Burry), Miller, Nuance.\n\nWhen you see a HF they are stock for a reason. There could be a catalyst (\"event\") or strategic business change, or some emerging \"secular\" trend.\n\nUse them source of interesting ideas. And check 13Fs for new positions.\n\nFor example, Lone Pine is playing the new growth of $SNAP and continuous glucose monitors $DXCM. Whale Rock is is in auto travel ($UBER, $CVNA). Pura Vida is in $INOV for its strategic pivot.\n\nNow the downside is HF activity can make the stock more *volatile.* A stock like $MSCI bounced around a lot last year as HFs came in and out.\n\nThe long/short (LS) funds Citadel, Point72 and Millennium don't show up on 13Fs - but they are also very active since they crowd in and out of names with leverage (i.e borrowed money). When volatility picks up like in February / March these funds all \"de-gross\" or reduce exposure and that can be an opportunity to pick up shares sold-off hard.\n\n**3 - Long only investors (LO)** \\- These are the mutual funds that manage retail retirement assets. Companies also love them as shareholders because they usually hold for many years.\n\nRespected names are Capital, Fidelity, TRowe, JP Morgan, American.\n\nHow is this useful?\n\nUse them to help assess the business. These funds are in high-quality companies (like $SPGI) where there is less risk of blowups like fraud. Fidelity and TRowe have management teams rotating in and out to see them -where they are grilled by specialized sector research teams. They do their diligence.\n\nThe stock will likely be less volatile since LO's don't trade and may buy dips to accumulate shares.\n\nNames like Baron, Ballie Gifford, Jennison are very respected at identifying growth / innovative companies. Use them as a vote of confidence in a new company. For example, Baron and Ballie were both early to invest in $TLSA and Jennison in $ADYEN, and have both done very well.\n\n**Happy investing!!**\n\n(You can see this information in Atom Finance ownership lists. And WhaleWisdom for 13Fs.)\n\n**Link to first post (what makes stocks move, how to value a stock, factors)**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/mwvp1d/learnings\\_from\\_10\\_yrs\\_of\\_wall\\_st\\_experience/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/mwvp1d/learnings_from_10_yrs_of_wall_st_experience/)",

Upon closing, Proterra\u2019s common stock is expected to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol PTRA. The transaction represents an enterprise value of $1.6 billion for Proterra.\n\n**Diversified Provider of EV Technologies**\n\nProterra is a high-growth commercial electric vehicle technology leader with over a decade of production experience. The Company has designed an end-to-end, flexible technology platform that delivers world-class performance and a low total cost of ownership to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and end customers. Proterra has three complementary businesses:\n\n* **Proterra Powered**: Delivering industry-leading battery systems and electrification solutions to commercial vehicle manufacturers;\n* **Proterra Transit:** Leading North America as the market\u2019s #1 electric transit bus OEM; and\n* **Proterra Energy:** Offering end-to-end turnkey charging and energy management solutions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s industry-leading battery systems have been proven in more than 16 million service miles driven by its fleet of transit vehicles and validated through partnerships with world-class commercial vehicle OEMs, such as Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation (FCCC), Thomas Built Buses, Van Hool, Bustech, and Optimal-EV. To date, Proterra has produced and delivered more than 300 megawatt-hours of battery systems, more than 550 heavy-duty electric transit buses and installed 54 megawatts of charging systems.\n\nProterra operates manufacturing facilities in California and South Carolina, as well as a state-of-the-art R&amp;D lab in Silicon Valley. The Company recently announced the opening of a new battery production line co-located in its electric transit bus manufacturing facility in Los Angeles County. This battery production line was established within a year and demonstrates Proterra\u2019s ability to bring its scalable and capital-efficient battery manufacturing process directly to commercial vehicle OEMs alongside their existing manufacturing.\n\nFollowing the close of the transaction, Jack Allen, Proterra\u2019s Chairman and CEO, will continue to lead the Company, and Jake Erhard, President, CEO and Director of ArcLight Clean Transition Corp., will join Proterra\u2019s board.\n\n**Management Comments**\n\n\u201cAfter delivering our first electric transit bus a decade ago, Proterra has transformed into a diversified provider of electric vehicle technology solutions to help commercial vehicle manufacturers electrify their fleets. Our success is in no small part thanks to a dedicated team of employees that are committed to innovation and forward-thinking solutions,\u201d said Jack Allen, Chairman and CEO of Proterra. \u201cThis transaction enables Proterra to take the next step towards our mission of advancing EV technology to deliver the world\u2019s best performing commercial vehicles. In addition, it introduces a partner in ArcLight that has a shared focus on sustainability and renewable energy. We look forward to working closely with the ArcLight team as we create value for our shareholders and customers, scale our business to new levels and benefit the world around us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe launched ArcLight Clean Transition with a clear goal of identifying and partnering with mission-driven companies with differentiated technology, compelling growth opportunities and a proven ability to execute,\u201d said Jake Erhard, President, CEO and Director of ArcLight Clean Transition Corp. \u201cWith a portfolio of leading-edge products, a substantial first-mover advantage over its competitors and a demonstrated ability to scale, Proterra perfectly fits these criteria. We look forward to working closely with the Proterra team to execute its strategic priorities and deliver shareholder value.\u201d\n\n**Strong Financial Foundation**\n\nProterra has generated strong results to date, including $193 million of expected 2020 revenue, $750 million in existing orders and backlog and 26% gross margin expansion over the last three years. Upon completion of the transaction, Proterra expects to have up to $825 million in cash to fund growth initiatives, including R&amp;D and the expansion of its next-generation battery program.

(Nasdaq: NGAC) (\"NextGen\"), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, announced today that they have entered into a definitive business combination agreement that will result in Xos becoming a publicly listed company. The combined company is expected to be traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under \u201cXOS\u201d.\n\nDakota Semler, Co-Founder and CEO of Xos, stated, \u201cIn 2016, my co-founder and I set out to build a company whose mission was to decarbonize transportation through the design, engineering and development of purpose-built commercial vehicles. Our aim was to provide customers a superior alternative to traditional fossil fuel vehicles. As former fleet operators, we gained a deep appreciation for the challenges of operating and maintaining commercial fleets, particularly in light of accelerating emissions requirements. Xos developed its technology and product portfolio in close collaboration with established fleet operators who have provided invaluable ongoing feedback that has informed every aspect of our vehicle design, product engineering, commercial manufacturing and service strategy. As a result, we have developed commercial EV solutions that uniquely incorporate customer requirements.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince 2019, we have had vehicles on the road and in the hands of our customers, which include UPS, Wiggins, Lonestar and Loomis, validating our durable and low-cost sustainable design. Today\u2019s announcement represents a major milestone that allows Xos to expand its vehicle and battery manufacturing capacity, advance our next generation battery and vehicle control systems, and put thousands more Xos vehicles on the road,\u201d said Xos\u2019 Co-Founder and COO, Giordano Sordoni.\n\nXos developed its vehicles to meet the demands and extended life cycles of last-mile, on-highway and vocational vehicles. Xos believes it is well positioned to capitalize on the electrification of the $100 billion total addressable market for medium- and heavy-duty last-mile commercial electric vehicles. The Company\u2019s more than 6,000-unit backlog of contracted and optional orders underscores robust market opportunities for Xos\u2019 vehicle products.\n\nDemand in the last-mile commercial EV market is expected to grow at a 35% CAGR through 2040 as electric vehicles replace traditional fossil fuel vehicles, driven by new emissions standards, continued growth of e-commerce and the relocation of fulfillment centers to areas closer to consumers. Xos\u2019 trucks are powered by its proprietary technology, developed to meet the needs of commercial fleets, and designed to achieve a TCO that is lower than traditional fossil fuel vehicles and other electric vehicle alternatives.\n\nThe Company offers Fleet-as-a-Service\u2013a bundled package that provides vehicle ownership services to fleet operators for a fixed monthly fee\u2014in coordination with partners such as DLL Group (financing services) and Dickinson Fleet Services (vehicle maintenance). The Fleet-as-a-Service package aggregates otherwise fragmented fleet service offerings and is projected to significantly increase Xos\u2019 lifetime revenue per vehicle.\n\n\"The strong secular tailwinds of climate change and e-commerce anchor our investment conviction in Xos,\" said George Mattson, Co-Founder and Co-Chairman of NextGen. \"Climate change is one of the world\u2019s greatest challenges, and commercial trucks are the largest emitters per capita of greenhouse gases in the transportation industry. Simultaneously, last-mile ecommerce delivery is growing, accelerated by changes in consumer purchasing behaviors post- COVID. The dual drivers of strong underlying industry growth and the imperative to transition traditional fossil fuel vehicles to zero emission vehicles, set the backdrop for strong underlying growth for years to come. Xos has successfully commercialized its cost competitive proprietary product offering and is now poised to scale delivery of its customer-validated vehicles with the growth capital that NextGen will provide.\"\n\n\u201cNextGen reviewed over a hundred potential merger opportunities and conducted in-depth evaluations of several companies in the EV and automotive technology sectors,\u201d added Gregory Summe, Co-Founder and Co-Chairman of NextGen. \u201cBased on our work, we believe that Xos is best-positioned to capture the rapidly growing demand for commercial electrical vehicles with a compelling customer offering. We look forward to working with Xos' leadership team by providing strategic, operating and governance experience to help Xos realize its vision of decarbonizing commercial transportation.\"\n\nIn addition to Dakota Semler and Giordano Sordoni, Xos will continue to be led by its existing management team including Chief Technology Officer, Robert Ferber, and Chief Financial Officer, Kingsley Afemikhe.\n\n## Transaction Overview\n\nThe business combination values the combined company at a $2.0 billion pro forma equity value, at a price of $10.00 per NextGen share and assuming no redemptions by NextGen shareholders. The transaction will provide $575 million of gross proceeds to the company, assuming no redemptions, including a $220 million oversubscribed and fully committed common stock PIPE at $10.00 per share anchored by Janus Henderson Investors, as well as a consortium of truck dealers led by Thompson Truck Centers.\n\nThe boards of directors of both Xos and NextGen have each unanimously approved the proposed business combination, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021, subject to, among other things, the approval by NextGen\u2019s shareholders of the business combination, the concurrent PIPE transaction, satisfaction of the conditions stated in the definitive agreement and other customary closing conditions, including that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) completes its review of the registration statement on Form S-4 and the proxy statement/prospectus, the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and approval by The Nasdaq Stock Market to list the securities of the combined company.\n\n## Advisors\n\nBofA Securities is serving as exclusive financial advisor to Xos, and Cooley LLP is serving as legal advisor to Xos.

(\u201cthe Company\u201d or \u201cSoFi\u201d), a leading next-generation financial services platform, has entered into a definitive agreement with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. V (\u201cSCH\u201d) (NYSE: IPOE), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, to bring a major consumer-focused financial technology business to the public markets. The transaction values the Company at an equity value of $8.65 billion post-money.\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nSoFi is a member-centric, one-stop shop for financial services including loan refinancing, mortgages, personal loans, credit cards, insurance, investing and deposit accounts, that has allowed more than 1.8 million members to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their money since its inception. SoFi\u2019s full suite of financial products offers members the speed, selection, content, and convenience that only an integrated digital platform can provide and allows them to manage their financial lives in one application, all on their phone.\n\nSoFi\u2019s consumer offering is augmented by its ownership and independent operation of Galileo, one of the leading providers of critical technology infrastructure services, including customer-facing and back-end capabilities, to fast-growing financial services providers. Galileo has approximately 50 million accounts on its platform.\n\nSoFi\u2019s consumer and enterprise businesses are highly complementary, enabling SoFi to provide faster product innovation and speed of service to both SoFi members and the customers of Galileo\u2019s clients. SoFi has experienced rapid acceleration with this strategy and has achieved six consecutive quarters of year-on-year member growth.\n\nSoFi received preliminary, conditional approval from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for a national bank charter in October 2020. If SoFi obtains final regulatory approval to own a bank, it would have a lower cost of funds to further support SoFi\u2019s growth.\n\nSoFi delivered over $200 million in total net revenue in the third quarter of 2020 and is on track to generate approximately $1 billion of estimated adjusted net revenue in 2021, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 60 percent, and full-year adjusted EBITDA profitability.\n\nThe Company\u2019s world-class management team, led by CEO Anthony Noto, will continue to lead SoFi following the transaction.\u00a0\n\n**Management Comments**\n\n**Anthony Noto, Chief Executive Officer of SoFi said:**\n\n\u201cSoFi is on a mission to help people achieve financial independence to realize their ambitions. Our ecosystem of products, rewards, and membership benefits all work together to help our members get their money right**.** With the secular acceleration in digital-first financial services offerings, SoFi is the only company providing a comprehensive solution all in one app. The new investments and our partnership with Social Capital Hedosophia signify the confidence in our strategy, the momentum in our business, as well as the significant growth opportunity ahead of us. We look forward to helping more people get their money right in the years to come.\u201d\n\n**Chamath Palihapitiya, Founder and CEO of Social Capital Hedosophia V, said:**\n\n\u201cSoFi\u2019s innovative, member-first platform has demystified financial services for millions of Americans and simplified the process for those looking to apply for loans, invest their money, obtain insurance and refinance their debt, among many other tasks that were previously arcane and needlessly complicated.\u00a0 Additionally, the acceleration of cross-buying by existing SoFi members has created a virtuous cycle of compounding growth, diversified revenue and high profitability. We look forward to partnering with Anthony and his team as they help even more members to achieve financial independence.\u201d\n\n**Transaction Overview**\n\nThe transaction is expected to deliver up to $2.4 billion of gross proceeds to the combined company, including the contribution of up to $805 million of cash held in SCH\u2019s trust account from its initial public offering in October 2020. The combination is further supported by a $1.2 billion PIPE at $10 per share led by Chamath Palihapitiya, Founder and CEO of SCH, and Hedosophia, with commitments from funds and accounts managed by Altimeter Capital Management, Baron Capital Group, BlackRock, Coatue Management, Durable Capital Partners LP,\u00a0 and Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP). SoFi also received a previous anchor investment from funds and accounts advised by T.

You may obtain free copies of these documents as described in the preceding paragraph.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws with respect to the proposed transaction between SoFi and SCH. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cstrategy,\u201d \u201cfuture,\u201d \u201copportunity,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cwill be,\u201d \u201cwill continue,\u201d \u201cwill likely result,\u201d and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this document, including but not limited to: (i) the risk that the transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect the price of SCH\u2019s securities, (ii) the risk that the transaction may not be completed by SCH\u2019s business combination deadline and the potential failure to obtain an extension of the business combination deadline if sought by SCH, (iii) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the consummation of the transaction, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the shareholders of SCH, the satisfaction of the minimum trust account amount following redemptions by SCH\u2019s public shareholders and the receipt of certain governmental and regulatory approvals, (iv) the lack of a third party valuation in determining whether or not to pursue the proposed transaction, (v) the inability to complete the PIPE Investment, (vi) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement, (vii) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the transaction on SoFi\u2019s business relationships, operating results, and business generally, (viii) risks that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations of SoFi and potential difficulties in SoFi employee retention as a result of the transaction, (ix) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against SoFi or against SCH related to the Merger Agreement or the proposed transaction, (x) the ability to maintain the listing of SCH\u2019s securities on a national securities exchange, (xi) the price of SCH\u2019s securities may be volatile due to a variety of factors, including changes in the competitive and highly regulated industries in which SCH plans to operate or SoFi operates, variations in operating performance across competitors, changes in laws and regulations affecting SCH\u2019s or SoFi\u2019s business and changes in the combined capital structure, (xii) the ability to implement business plans, forecasts, and other expectations after the completion of the proposed transaction, and identify and realize additional opportunities, and (xiii) the risk of downturns and a changing regulatory landscape in the highly competitive industry. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of SCH\u2019s registration on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-248915 and 333-249396), the registration statement on Form S-4 discussed above and other documents filed by SCH from time to time with the SEC. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and SoFi and SCH assume no obligation and do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Neither SoFi nor SCH gives any assurance that either SoFi or SCH, or the combined company, will achieve its expectations.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure and Related Information**\n\nThis press release references adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). These non-GAAP financial measures do not have a standardized meaning, and the definition of adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA used by SoFi may be different from other, similarly named non-GAAP measures used by others. In addition, such financial information is unaudited and does not conform to SEC Regulation S-X and as a result such information may be presented differently in future filings by the Company with the SEC. Management uses forward-looking non-GAAP measures to evaluate SoFi\u2019s projected financials and operating performance. Certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures are presented without corresponding GAAP reconciliations due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations.       \n\nSource: [https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-plans-to-go-public](https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-plans-to-go-public)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhat are your guys' thoughts and opinions on these stocks?

While these page 1 holders own 40.7% of the SPAC shares, post close that will decrease to 15.1%, meaning they will be net buyers.\n   * btw - I left out the top arb hedge fund holders\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8radj67n8nu61.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c568d4e564ce190c77555394dfb72358e7e4be29\n\n* However one thing to keep in mind, PIPE holders in this deal were restricted from shorting shares until deal close.  To the extent any hedge funds in the PIPE want to box their shares (get flat), there may be some shorting pressure on deal close.

        "selftext": " \n\nEdit: I had to re-upload this because it was getting downvoted to oblivion. Shills don't want you spreading the word\n\n......................................................................................................\n\nEver since I got into GME a month ago, I have kept it a secret. Even with all the DD, I was scared to tell my GF and family members. I keep seeing posts about how people are going to take care of there parents when this is all over. I myself felt a little pride that I would be able to take care of my parents when this is over. Then I realized something...\n\nWhy have I not told anybody about this?\n\nAt first I was worried that I may look like a lunatic and it would look like I got caught up in MLM (pyramid scheme). I was also worried that if I recommend the stock and then the price will plummet and then I would responsible for causing financial hardship on my loved ones.\n\nThis week we experienced a lot of great DD and I just had tell my GF about it. I thought she would think I was crazy and tell me to sell. She did the opposite, she bought 4 shares of Gamestop. I was surprised by her response, it was the opposite of what I thought. Then today I called up my parents and I told them about the situation. They didn't think I was crazy at all and then asked me how to set up a fidelity account.\n\nThen I realized something, I kept getting positive responses to my gamestop sales pitch because all the DD makes sense. We need to stop saying we are going to take care of our family when this is over. Its now FUD. Take care of them now and tell then about GME. Start Telling EVERYONE about it. This could really blow up. We have the power to make this big. Start writing \"Buy GME\" on a piece of paper and put it in plastic Easter eggs and then scatter them all over town. We need to get the word out. We are suppressing GME by not telling anyone. Don't be afraid. Easter is a great time to tell the whole family about it. Word of mouth is bigger then any upcoming catalyst.\n\nTLDR; It's time to take care of your family now by telling them about GME. Stop daydreaming about taking care of them afterwards. Word of mouth is more powerful then any upcoming catalyst.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been investing with Robinhood since 2018, but up until the GME craze it was purely passive ETF buys. GME sucked me into the world of individual stocks and, more recently, options. I\u2019m now neck deep in LEAPS and covered calls. After the whole GME debacle went down, I told myself I would leave Robinhood. I opened up a Fidelity account, but dragged my feet on the transfer because 1. I was holding a couple GME shares waiting for another takeoff, and 2. I was really not a fan of the Fidelity mobile app UI. Now that a couple months have passed, there are some key things about Robinhood that make me want to stick with them, and I\u2019m wondering if someone smarter than me can counter these things to convince me to leave. Reasons why I\u2019m wanting to stay with Robinhood over other brokerages:\n\n1.       Commission-free option trades. I recently opened a Tastyworks account to try out (and take advantage of the 100 free shares promo) and am paying $1.14 per option trade. I\u2019m on option trade #33 for April so far (30 of them on Robinhood). That would be $37 of fees for April alone thus far if I completely moved to Tasty. If it matters, I have no plans of expanding my options plays beyond LEAPS/CSPs/CCs.\n2.       Free and low-interest margin rates. Yes I pay $5 a month for access to margin, but with the first $1K being interest-free, that $1K used wisely can make up for the monthly fee and more. After the $1K, it\u2019s only 2.5%, way lower than the other brokerages I\u2019ve looked at (Tasty is at 8% for $0-25K).\n3.       Robinhood mobile UI is so intuitively easy. Yes I keep reading that \u201creal\u201d investors don\u2019t rely on mobile apps, but I\u2019m on the go at work for most of the trading day and have limited opportunity to access desktop applications. During the periods I can find the time to get onto Tasty, it feels a bit overwhelming with more info than I need (granted I haven\u2019t watched any tutorials yet).\n4.       Commission-free crypto. Yes I know it isn\u2019t true crypto, but I don\u2019t have much interest right now in owning true crypto, and I\u2019ve been having some fun lately playing around with the price swings between Doge and Bitcoin.\n\nI\u2019ve read and heard several times that once your account grows beyond the $50K-ish range, you need to graduate to a real brokerage, but honestly I\u2019m finding the benefits are outweighing the risks of staying with Robinhood.\n\nI also hear that we are Robinhood\u2019s products, not customers, and that they don\u2019t truly care about the retail investor. But do any of these brokerages actually care about the retail investor?\n\nWhy should I leave Robinhood?\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "Rocket builder ABL Space signed a long-term agreement for multiple launches with Lockheed Martin, agreeing to provide the defense giant with as many as 58 rockets through the end of the decade.\n\nLockheed Martin will buy up to 26 of ABL\u2019s RS1 rockets through 2025, with an option for up to 32 additional launches through 2029, ABL announced on Monday.\n\n\u201cHaving this assured access to space will accelerate our ability to demonstrate the spacecraft and associated payload technologies we are developing to the meet the future mission needs for our customers,\u201d Lockheed Martin Space executive vice president Rick Ambrose said in a press release.\n\nABL\u2019s RS1 rocket fits in the middle of the launch marketplace, between Rocket Lab\u2019s small Electron and SpaceX\u2019s large Falcon 9 vehicle. RS1 is nearly 90 feet tall and is designed to launch as much as 1,350 kg (nearly 1\u00bd tons) of payload to low Earth orbit.\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s venture arm is one of ABL\u2019s early investors, with the company having raised about $220 million in private capital so far \u2013 the majority of which came in a round from T. Rowe Price and Fidelity Management last month at a $1.3 billion valuation.\n\nABL declined to comment on the financial terms of the contract. Based on ABL\u2019s $12 million price tag for an RS1 rocket, the deal with Lockheed Martin is estimated to be worth nearly $700 million over eight years, assuming the maximum number of launches.\nNotably, as ABL\u2019s rockets utilize a mobile ground system called GS0 that can pack into a few shipping containers, Lockheed Martin may use a variety of launch facilities around the world \u2013 including U.S. Space Force facilities at Vandenberg in California and Cape Canaveral in Florida.\n\nWhile the defense giant did not specify which missions it plans to launch with ABL\u2019s rockets, Lockheed Martin previously announced in February that it had selected ABL to launch a mission from Scotland in 2022. Additionally, Lockheed Martin last month signed a strategic partnership with satellite start-up Omnispace, with the latter company planning to launch a constellation of satellites to build a 5G communications network in space.\n\nThe large contract represents a coup for ABL in the medium-lift segment of the launch market, where the company is competing with Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Orbit, which reached orbit a few months ago.\n\nOther competitors in that arena include Relativity Space and Firefly Aerospace, which are aiming to launch for the first time later this year. Meanwhile, Rocket Lab is developing a medium-lift rocket called Neutron that it expects to launch by 2024.\n\nABL continues to work toward its inaugural RS1 launch from Vandenberg.\n\nWhile ABL had previously hoped to be ready to launch as early as March, president Dan Piemont said that the company is now aiming \u201cfor flight readiness by June.\u201d The rocket builder recently finished acceptance testing on the first RS1 fuel tank, but Piemont said ABL expects the required launch site regulatory approvals will delay its first launch attempt to the third quarter of this year.",

        "selftext": " I'm  seeing some confusing option executing prices and am curious if anybody  knows precisely why. I assume it has something to do with market maker  execution algorithms but don't know since I'm (obviously) not a market  maker.\n\nIn short, it has to do with dropping your execution price and ending up getting a more favorable execution price.\n\nMy broker is Fidelity.\n\nA specific example is UWMC on which I was selling May 21, 2021 $9 calls today.\n\nThe  bid/ask spread as reflected on the trade ticket for that particular  option contract was pretty consistent over the couple hours I was  trading. It was reflected as Bid: 0.40 x 200 contracts and Ask: 0.45 x  85 contracts. The only variation was in the number of contracts for the  Bid/Ask spread, the 0.40 and 0.45 price points did not change.\n\nI  was looking to sell 60 contracts so I entered my trade ticket at 0.45 x  60 contracts. I'm doing regular \"good for the day or cancelled\" trade  entries, not \"fill or kill\" or \"immediate or cancel\" entries.\n\nThat  is, the type of order I was using is supposed to fill whatever  contracts it can at the execution price, it does not require all 60  contracts to be filled at once. So, if there is somebody willing to buy 1  contract at 0.45 then, in theory, 1 contract of the 0.45 x 60 contract  order would fill and the order would reduce to 0.45 x 59 contracts.\n\nWhen doing this 0.45 x 60 contract order, none would not get filled but instead the entire order would sit there.\n\nHowever,  if I broke that trade ticket into smaller contract sizes and lowered  the price to 0.40 then the order would get filled and all of the fills  were above 0.40, most at 0.45.\n\nFor  example, I would do 5 contract lot orders at 0.40, so I would do  multiple 0.40 x 5 contract orders instead of one 0.45 x 60 contract  order. Breaking it up this way most filled at 0.45.\n\nSo,  in effect, I would lower the price and the order size and actually get  the higher price I was originally shooting for. In contrast, under my  original 0.45 x 60 contract order, none would get executed at all.\n\nThe  fact that the smaller 0.40 x 5 contract orders would consistently fill  at 0.45 suggests there were outstanding bids of 0.45. Or at least people  out there willing to buy those contracts at 0.45.\n\nMy question is, if this is the case, why wouldn't some of the contracts for my 0.45 x 60 contract order fill instead of none?\n\nIt's  almost like lowering my ask to 0.40 prompts market makers, or whoever  is on the other side of the trade, to raise their bid to 0.45 and so my  trades then get executed at 0.45. Beneficial to me, but a bit confusing  nonetheless.\n\nI assume it has to do  with market maker algorithms, for example, market makers having sort of  standing/hidden \"test\" orders of small contracts sizes to test where  the market is going and that's what end up being hit when I lower my  execution price and the lot size. That's complete speculation by me.\n\nI'm curious if anybody knows for sure what's going on?\n\nThanks",

        "selftext": "Let me start off by saying this, I use Fidelity for my long term/dividend stocks and love it. Unfortunately I am always on the move and sadly the Fidelity App is catered more towards long term holding than actively trading/doing options. I have used Robinhood before and like the options section of the app. I was also looking at the ThinkOrSwim app but I feel like it has too much going on for a smartphone screen. I know many people decided to leave (not fully) after the whole GME craze which occurred recently. I was just wondering if Robinhood would still be a good choice as something I could do for fun playing with options and etc. Any help is extremely appreciated and suggestions are extremely welcome. Thank you again, hope you are all in the green for the time being.",

        "selftext": "I know there has been debate on this. I encourage anyone with concerns to call Horizons, as I did. When I called, the guy I spoke to said he'd received 100s of calls on this topic, and I suggested he might reduce that drastically by simply posting to Reddit to clarify. He laughed.\n\nAnyways, he told me that, yes, Horizons is \"legally unaffiliated\" with HPYSF. The reason is that HPSYF is a Fidelity product. Fidelity created it on their own to track PSYK without consulting Horizons, and short of killing PSYK, Horizons has no legal power to stop HPSYF. He told me Fidelity was receiving so many calls about PSYK that they found it within their interest to stop placing ad hock buys on NEO and to instead make a deal with some Canadian broker to exchange bulk shares of PSYK for a new product HPSYF. This explains why some people who requested trades via NEO early on by calling Fidelity later saw their ticker symbol change from PSYK to HPSYF.\n\nWhen I asked him \"but is HPSYF actually a simple pointer to PSYK\", he said &gt;!\"yes\"!&lt;. When I asked him \"is there any other way for non-Canadians to have exposure to PSYK other than through HPSYF\", he said &gt;!\"as of now, no\"!&lt;. He actually lamented this fact a bit and said they (Horizons) would much rather people buy shares directly from them, but recognized the obstacle to doing so for non-Canadians.\n\nI called Fidelity to confirm all of this, but the guy I spoke to there was confused about the mater himself. He did say HPSYF pointed to PSYK, but he has never heard of NEO before and was about as curious as I was about all of this.\n\nAnyways, if you hold shares of HPSYF, a Fidelity product, and it is not in fact a reflection of PSYK, despite being advertised as such, I suspect you'd have a fantastic case for litigation against Fidelity and would probably make more on that suit than on your measly investment in HPSYF/PSYK.\n\nBest of luck.  \n\n\nRELATED:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/shroomstocks/comments/lyhw2v/psyk\\_hpsyf\\_confirmed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/shroomstocks/comments/lyhw2v/psyk_hpsyf_confirmed/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/shroomstocks/comments/lq71qm/is\\_hpsyf\\_not\\_actually\\_the\\_otc\\_ticker\\_for\\_the\\_psyk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/shroomstocks/comments/lq71qm/is_hpsyf_not_actually_the_otc_ticker_for_the_psyk/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/shroomstocks/comments/lqllq6/official\\_horizons\\_response\\_to\\_otc\\_ticker\\_hpsyf/](https://www.reddit.com/r/shroomstocks/comments/lqllq6/official_horizons_response_to_otc_ticker_hpsyf/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/shroomstocks/comments/lnigcx/horizons\\_psyk\\_etf\\_now\\_on\\_otc\\_markets\\_ticker\\_hpsyf/](https://www.reddit.com/r/shroomstocks/comments/lnigcx/horizons_psyk_etf_now_on_otc_markets_ticker_hpsyf/)",

        "selftext": "If you already know about this then that's great! Hopefully this helps some of the people that make frequent trades. So it's very simple actually. I know this works on Fidelity for sure. It normally costs $50 to buy and to sell a foreign stock but you can convert some of your portfolio to the currency needed for a fee of course and then trade it just like you would any other stock. When you're finished you can trade back to USD or whatever you use. This is helpful if you want to buy and sell quite a few times for foreign OTC stocks. If you only planned on buying and selling once then this won't really help.",
