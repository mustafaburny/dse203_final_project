There wasn't an announcement of the earnings, so there wasn't really a warning they would be dropping this evening. This honestly doesn't change anything as this isn't a fundamental play and I wouldn't look to deep into AH movements on a low float stock like this. $IRNT will very likely resume it's run tomorrow unimpeded.*\n\nSince my last post the percentage of float claimed by institutional obligations has increased from 213% to **273%** as of close today with short interest (as of the last numbers) taking up 56% of the float and options ITM OI accounting for 217%.\n\nThe intraday movements of the past two days have indicated that tomorrow will likely be the \"start of the squeeze\". So with that, I offer some price targets should this start to run tomorrow (these are peak targets). I personally expect it to start running tomorrow and hit peak either Thursday or Friday, more-so weighted towards Friday.\n\nLikely Guaranteed: **$29**  \nLikely: **$40**  \nIf everything goes right: **$135**  \nIf it matches other squeezes: **$210**  \nIf it goes to the moon: **$530**\n\nTake these price targets with a grain of salt. The only two that should matter right now are the first two, once those are broken, the others become more relevant and probably *more likely* very quickly.\n\nAs I said in the other post, this situation is highly unusual and the low float on this stock enables it to run really fast and really hard when buy volume comes in. This also makes this play very risky so only partake with money that you can afford to lose.\n\n**Good luck and godspeed gentlemen.**\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise.",

        "selftext": " \n\nI've been following $IRNT since the post market jump when it went from $16 to $40 in AH. It had seemingly been written off despite the fact that it's been primed for a gamma squeeze at almost every moment since it came down from that run to $40. To be clear, this is a real gamma squeeze, not a meme-y play. This is a rare situation and that's why I'm calling attention to it.\n\nThe setup is simple:\n\n1. The float is currently 1.3M shares due to SPAC redemptions &amp; lockups and will be at this number until after options expiry on Sep 17th.\n2. It has options, which usually are only available for stocks over 7M float\n3. Almost 200% of those 1.3M shares are claimed by the already ITM open interest on the call options. This means that the squeeze has ALREADY been set in motion and you're just waiting for time to draw closer to expiration. The movement we saw Friday is what we refer to as a \"pre-squeeze\" movement, there is likely far more to come.\n4. On Friday the $20 strike became ITM and instantly doubled the amount of the float that is claimed by the open interest.\n5. As of this morning ORTEX shows 4.3M shares shorted which amounts to 336% SI with a cost to borrow of 628% on average. I have doubts about the accuracy of this specific data because that would put the amount of the float claimed by institutional obligations nearing 600%, so I'll stick with saying that the last reliable data seemingly had SI at around 13% with the same elevated cost to borrow.\n\nIf $IRNT runs, it could potentially be the first true infinity squeeze since VW and has the potential to beat the heights of $ORGO &amp; $GME.\n\n$IRNT will very likely start running some time before expiration on Sep 17th. It could be today, it could be Thursday, but at some point, the buy volume will likely come in and the IV on the options will spike to crazy heights almost instantly.\n\nBe warned, this play is incredible risky, if you choose to partake only do so with money you can afford to lose.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise.",

        "selftext": "This journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn\u2019t believe. I turned around and said \u201cSir\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that **last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food\u2026he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.** This conversation was just 3 weeks ago. \n\nSo\u2026when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I\u2019m not joking\u2026**at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high.** I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. **I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices.** Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nThe dollar index after J. POW\u2019s Jackson Hole Speech. \ud83d\ude02 https://imgur.com/a/hiN5OFy\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\n**This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.**\n\nHere is one from Thursday, September 2.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PE0F6F5\n\n**$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here**\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026but how was that even theoretically feasible? It\u2019s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why\u2026\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\n**Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!**\n\nFor fucks sake people, **THIS IS HUGE!!** This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n**\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d**\n\n**Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has an impact on some companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026** \n\n             Wall Street\u2018a High Expectations\n\nSo far, 88% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet.\n\nThe strong results put the S&amp;P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. \ud83d\ude33 So\u2026. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings\u2026.which I guarantee that will happen\u2026 it\u2019s going to be an earnings miss galore. \n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\n**So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.**\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nI like this one better compared to the DOW 30. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/cvYyXsB\n\nThe lumber/gold ratio **HAS PLUMMETED** in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\n**In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.**\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\n**They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you.**\n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\n**Let me be clear\u2026I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it\u2019s going to collapse our financial system possibly\u2026also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant \u201cMu\u201d and mass evictions will soon begin\u2026**\n\n**Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.**\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**This is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks.** https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\n**Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak.** https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don\u2019t get me started on the mass evictions as well\u2026and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities\u2026 The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.**\n\nNow\u2026**my positions.** Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\n**Short term:** sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\n**Long term:**\n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It\u2019s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. **There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS.** You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I\u2019m wrong) \n\n**My last position:**\n\n**$2,500 in Cash.**\n\nSimply put\u2026**cash is a position.** People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies\u2026 my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me\u2026 I already have my shopping list ready. \n\nGood luck out there guys. **Timing this is almost impossible**\u2026but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It\u2019s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!\n\n**The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a \u201cBlack swan event\u201dby purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs. Solid gold bars\u2026Let me remind you that they deal with information.**\n\nI\u2019m not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me, I\u2019m saying that maybe it\u2019s time to scale back a bit on the margin, move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big. Don\u2019t forget Sleepy Joe is going to raise long term capital gains tax, possibly very soon, from like 20% to as high as 43.4% if you make over $1m\u2026 another bearish catalyst for the market\u2026 I literally could go on and on guys\u2026. It\u2019s pretty obvious at this point\u2026we\u2019ll at least to me, but what do I know, I just got out of prison last December. \n\nEdit:\nTLTR: just read the bold shit\u2026",

        "selftext": "Elon Musk told employees that he agrees with Ark Invest that Tesla (TSLA) is worth $3,000 a share \u201cif they execute really well.\u201d The CEO has often commented on Tesla\u2019s stock price, but surprisingly, it was often to say that the price was too high. \n\nIn 2020, when Tesla\u2019s stock was reaching new high, Musk told his millions of followers on Twitters that he believed the stock was \u201ctoo high\u201d. It sent Tesla\u2019s stock crashing, but now it is even higher than when Musk made the comment.\n\nTesla is currently trading at $733 a share and the automaker is the most valuable automotive company in the world at over $730 billion.\n\nWall Street firms are divided on whether or not the company is overvalued, but a few of them believe that Tesla could be worth a lot more. Ark Invest is one of them. Though to be fair, the company is also a large Tesla shareholders through its investment funds.\n\nThis week, they released a new note claiming a $3,000 base stock price target by 2025 for Tesla. Cathie Wood said about the price target during an interview with Yahoo Finance: \u201cOur estimate for Tesla\u2019s success has gone up. The main reason for that is their market share. Instead of going down from year-end 2017 to today, it has actually gone up fairly dramatically,\u201d In its valuation models, Ark Invest believes that Tesla is going to deliver between 5 and 10 million vehicles as soon as 2025. That\u2019s a significant ramp considering Tesla likely will deliver less than 1 million vehicles this year. The firm is also betting on Tesla delivering a completely autonomous ride-hailing network, known as Tesla Network, that is going to bring in a lot of money with high margin.\n\nIn an email to Tesla employee obtained by Electrek, Elon Musk shared with employees Ark\u2019s new $3,000 price target and that he agrees with Ark: \u201cIf we execute really well, I agree with Ark Invest.\u201d A $3,000 share price would put Tesla\u2019s valuation at $3 trillion and make it the most valuable company in the world. \n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nSince Ark\u2019s new note was an update on their valuation model and price target, it is fair to say that Musk\u2019s email is basically a direct comment on Tesla\u2019s stock price. He believes that \u201cif executed really well\u201d, Tesla should be worth $3 trillion within the next 4 years.\n\n[https://electrek.co/2021/09/04/elon-musk-tesla-tsla-worth-3000-share/](https://electrek.co/2021/09/04/elon-musk-tesla-tsla-worth-3000-share/)",

They are not the only company though, other real-estate companies are also facing liquidity problems and it looks like the property bubble in China is collapsing.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/fitch-says-possible-china-evergrande-default-may-have-broader-effects-2021-09-15/](https://www.reuters.com/business/fitch-says-possible-china-evergrande-default-may-have-broader-effects-2021-09-15/)  \n\n\nGiven this scenario, how would you try to make a play here? There are 3 possible outcomes here: (1) Chinese government bails them out; (2) Chinese government step in and guide them to deflat slowly; (3) Full collapse.  \n\n\n(1) I think this is unlikely as there are too many real-estate companies in financial difficulties right now to bail all of them out successfully. Also a bit uncharacteristic of the government to do so.  \n\n\n(2) I believe this is the most likely scenario, but that would transfer the burden onto banks (both Chinese and international) as they will not be getting repayments for their loans to Evergrande. Would shorting bank stocks be a good idea here?  \n\n\n(3) Unlikely for now but could happen if scenario (2) goes badly. If so, the entire Chinese market will be bearish, so $YANG might be a good choice here.  \n\n\nAny other ideas they you can think of?",

        "selftext": "Fellow Degens,\n\nChill the fuck out and read.\n\nThe unique situation of $IRNT and $OPAD, is exactly that, extremely unique.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\nStock Redemption: Redemptions are\u00a0**when a company requires shareholders to sell a portion of their shares back to the company**. For a company to redeem shares, it must have stipulated upfront that those shares are redeemable, or callable. ... Shareholders are obligated to sell the stock in a redemption.\n\nShort Interest: Short interest is\u00a0**the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out**. Short interest, which can be expressed as a number or percentage, is an indicator of market sentiment. Extremely high short interest shows investors are very pessimistic (potentially overly-pessimistic).\n\nGamma Squeeze: The gamma squeeze happens\u00a0**when the underlying stock's price begins to go up very quickly within a short period of time**. As more money flows into call options from investors, that forces more buying activity which can lead to higher stock prices.\n\nPublic Float: Also known as public equity float.\u00a0**The portion of a company's outstanding shares that is in the hands of public investors**, as opposed to company officers, directors, or stockholders that hold controlling interests. These are the shares that are available for trading.\n\nWith that out the way, lets dive into why $IRNT and $OPAD is so unique and why this play is so rare.\n\nBoth $IRNT and $OPAD have had a stock redemption. Not a small redemption but a fucking massive redemption. $OPAD for example has around 92% of the public float that\u2019s redeemed.\n\nWhat\u2019s being shown as \u201cPublic Float\u201d on a lot of stock analytics websites is not the actual public float of $IRNT and $OPAD.\n\nThe number of shares that have been redeemed has reduced the current public float of $IRNT to 1.3M and $OPAD to 3.4M. A lot of post already explain the $IRNT redemption, but for $OPAD you can view this redditors post who explains it perfectly. The 8-k and definitive proxy agreement are hyperlinked in his post. So, I wont go into details on my post about the public float as it\u2019s already been written here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/pjn5rw/opad\\_the\\_despac\\_madness\\_continues/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/pjn5rw/opad_the_despac_madness_continues/)\n\nNow, with all this information what does this mean?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$IRNT](https://preview.redd.it/cwm8315r3yn71.png?width=2523&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c66c71d744939897af61b916b1a823dca320848)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$OPAD](https://preview.redd.it/wi6jl06t3yn71.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f6824257eba4ddd5f5c022661e875a166c12e9f)\n\nAs you can see, 764.21k is shorted for $IRNT. 764.21k /1.3M = 58% SI%.\n\n$OPAD has 3.72M shorted. The actual float after redemption is 3.4M. 3.72M/3.4M = 109% SI%.\n\nJust to clarify with everyone, these short interest percentages are on the low end. The actual float is anticipated to be shorted by a lot more than just these simple calculations, but this is easy math you can calculate on the open lagged data on the inter-web.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the Option Chain. Before I jump into that, let me explain something very important, 1 contract = 100 share. If an option contract is in the money, the holder of that contract must exercise their contract, if they do nothing and the contract expires, the broker will exercise that contract on their behalf. So, for every call option written that\u2019s in the money, those contracts will be exercised.\n\nWith that being said, look at the options contract for both of these stocks. Look at the open interest on the call options. \n\nSpecifically, $20, $25, $30, 31, $35, $37, &amp; fucking $40! For $IRNT and $15, $17.50, $20, &amp; fucking $25 for $OPAD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$IRNT](https://preview.redd.it/i6n9p44w3yn71.png?width=1758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e13c934ca372ef9e68339b4b4c7a1b32f619ea60)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$OPAD](https://preview.redd.it/9n0oa1ux3yn71.png?width=1780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43013db7d88ee6662cfdd363d6929bd09f82b57c)\n\nQuick mafs = MM &amp; SHF are seriously fucked. \n\nStop stressing out, yes, this is a high-risk trade, but an extremely unique, rare, and high probable odds that this will turn into exactly how we all think it\u2019s going to turn.\n\nThis is in fact a very high risk to high reward trade. As always, trade at your own risk. But for those who really wanted to see the full-blown potential here, I hope this helped.\n\nThis can very well turn out to be far larger then we can imagine. If a perfect setup was to occur the equation would look like this. \n\nSmall Float + High SI% + High OI% + About to expire ITM = Bananas ... well guess what two stocks have this equation completed?\n\nI\u2019ll see you in Valhalla ladies and gents.\n\nMods, for the love of trading, don\u2019t remove my post.\n\nTL;DR \u2013 You need to read the whole thing. No short cuts to this one.",

        "selftext": "TMC (The Metals Company) is a recent \"de-SPA C\" that started trading on Friday. It's a deep seas mining company with a market cap of $2.35 billion with 245 million shares outstanding (current price in the $9 - $10 range).\n\nThe key here though is that 231 million shares are locked up at least 6 months and the 11 million Pipe shares are locked for at least a month (but perhaps longer because 2/3 of their PIPE didn't pay up).\n\nOkay, so why dow we care? Here's why this is potentially one of the most explosive stocke we've ever seen this week:\n\nThe curren float is 2.72 million becasue 91% of the original 30 million shares redeemed for cash.\n\nThe short interest is around 1.77 million shares(or roughly 65% of the current float is short).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut here's the \"canary in the coal mine\": the open interest. Market makers were selling calls based on prior 30 million shares outstanding before last Friday, which means they've solde much more than the entrie current float.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are 25k calls for Friday 17 of september between $10 and $12.50. \n\nThat's 2.5 million shares. \n\nThere's another 8.2k calls for Friday 17 of september between $14 and $15\n\nThat's another 820k shares\n\n**That means if the stock is over $12.50 by Friday, MMs will need 92% of the current float to meet just September calls. If it's over $15 by Friday, MM's will need 120+% of the current float to meet those calls.**\n\nThat's just September. Add in those October calls (another 11.8k calls between $10 and $12.50 and another 7k calls between $14 and $15) and you'd require another 1.9 million shares for those...\n\n**So if TMC goes over $15, MMs would need 190% of the current float to account for September/October calls**\n\n(And as I mentioned above 65% of the current float is short).\n\nI'm gonna be honest, **credits to** u/....**,** it is his DD, but it got deleted due to the market cap. Now the market cap is large enough fort r/wallstreetbets.\n\nI have never seen a situation like this (because the level of redemptions for recent de-SPACs recently is unprecedented). MMs have to keep this pinned under $10 by Friday or hell will break loose.\n\nJust take a look at $IRNT.....\n\nOriginal post [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnfqig/tmc\\_stock\\_has\\_an\\_explosive\\_setup\\_for\\_this\\_week/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnfqig/tmc_stock_has_an_explosive_setup_for_this_week/)",

And instead of being afraid of stock market crash. My thoughts were why am I keeping so much cash in a savings account if inflation is eating away at it each year.\n\nMy thinking is even if my portfolio crashes 90%. I would still have enough to cover 6 months of expenses. But the thing is if that worst case happens and SPY/VOO/VTI crashed 90% there might be bigger issues in the world than the money I lost.

        "selftext": "\nThis journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn\u2019t believe. I turned around and said \u201cSir\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food\u2026he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.\n\nSo\u2026when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I\u2019m not joking\u2026at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high. I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices. Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\nThis was yesterday, Friday, September 3. \n\n$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026but how was that even theoretically feasible? It\u2019s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why\u2026\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\nAm I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!! \n\nFor fucks sake people, THIS IS HUGE!! This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d \n\nI can\u2019t make this shit up. I started writing my DD before they posted that article, before that you could only find a Seeking Alpha article that you have to pay to read\u2026 I discovered this off of my live updates of Bloomberg news. I\u2019m actually having trouble trying to find the article I originally read\u2026I wish I was joking. Whatever\u2026weird. \n\nGross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has a DIRECT impact on companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026\n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\nSo investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nThe lumber/gold ratio HAS PLUMMETED in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\nIn simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\nThey reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you. \n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\nLet me be clear\u2026I personally don\u2019t believe the delta variant has anything to do with this. I don\u2019t want to get politics involved in this post but it is imperative for me to do so but if I do I\u2019ll go down the rabbit hole in the post will probably get taken off. \n\nSince the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs. \n\nNo big deal right? \n\nThis is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks. https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\nMedian American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak. https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\nI mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. \n\nNow\u2026my positions. Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\nShort term: sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\nLong term: \n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It\u2019s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS. You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I\u2019m wrong) \n\nMy last position:\n\n$2,500 in Cash.\n\nSimply put\u2026cash is a position.

This was expected (for a change, lol) and the shares are subject to lockup.*\n\nSince my last post, the percentage of float claimed by institutional obligations has risen from 273% to **479%** of float.\n\nToday we saw movement confirming an active gamma squeeze. Tomorrow, after a gap up, should be the first day of ***full squeeze*** movement to be compared with AMC on 06/02 and GME on 01/26 with a peak occurring on Friday.

This DD is split into 8 parts, so feel free to jump to whichever section you\u2019re most interested in.\n\n**Part 1 \u2013 Introduction**\n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n**Part 3 \u2013 Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**Part 4 \u2013 Recent Updates**\n\n**Part 5 \u2013 Financials and Valuation**\n\n**Part 6 \u2013 Bear Case**\n\n**Part 7 \u2013 SI and Squeeze Potential**\n\n**Part 8 \u2013 TL;DR**\n\n**Part 1 \u2013 Introduction**\n\nIt was a warm Monday morning on August 23rd almost a month back, when seemingly for no reason \u2013 **GOEV shot up from ~$5.9 to ~$8, a 30% gain on the day.** The next day \u2013 GME popped, for a 30% gain as well, with AMC and BB also making up big gains, leading to the \u2018meme mania\u2019 we\u2019ve been experiencing for the last couple of weeks. \n\nWhy\u2019d this happen? Well there were no company/industry catalysts. The only event that seemed to occur in the prior week was the expiration of monthly options. One of the theories going around is that there\u2019s an almost quarterly cycle going on at this point where FTD\u2019s are leading to a surge in prices in the next cycle for \u2018meme stocks\u2019 which tend to be heavily shorted for the most part. How accurate this is I have no clue and whether this applies to GOEV I don\u2019t know, haven\u2019t investigated that particular theory but there\u2019s plenty of posts/comments floating around for you to look into if you\u2019re so inclined. \n\nThe quick point I\u2019m trying to make here is that if a heavily shorted stock is popping 30% in a day, with no major catalyst for the industry or the company in question \u2013 and that company is now advancing towards realizing its major milestones with favorable tailwinds expected for the sector, it could pop a lot more than 30% in the months to come. **GOEV is among the youngest EV companies - having been around for less than 5 years, with arguably the most unique vehicles coming out (on schedule \u2013 seems to be pretty amazing in the EV space) that very few, if any, of the established or other up and coming competitors are producing, and has been shorted more it seems \u2013 for the failure of its peers than any real fault of its own.**\n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n* From an investment into equities point of view \u2013 S&amp;P 500 has fallen about 0.5%, on average, during the month of September. Stocks have tended to go up, on average, during every other month \u2014 other than a slight dip in February \u2014 over the past half century [link]( https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/investing/stock-market-september/index.html). However, this may soon be coming to an end as in the past week Investors stampeded into stocks and out of cash as global equity funds witnessed their biggest inflows since March 2021 while large-cap U.S. funds enjoyed a record haul, a weekly round-up by BofA showed. [link](https://www.investing.com/news/economy/monster-reallocations-to-stocks-as-us-tax-threat-recedes--bofa-2619022) \n\n* Let\u2019s take a look at the EV market dynamics and upcoming catalysts before getting into GOEV specifically, so we get a high-level understanding of the bigger picture. The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021 [source](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/electric-vehicle-market). This is expected to grow to $1.007 trillion by 2027 which is an average of 2 sources - [source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/electric-vehicle-market-analysis-size-regional-outlook-competitive-strategies-and-forecasts-to-2027-2021-07-12?tesla=y), [source 2](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-market-size-to-be-valued-at-1-212-1-billion-by-2027-owing-to-rising-number-of-government-initiatives-globally-to-promote-manufacturing--adoption-of-evs--million-insights-301238118.html), another source actually has the market valued at $2.5 trillion but it\u2019s a bit of an outlier compared to the other 2 [source 3](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/11/2227050/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html).   \n\n* Global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. [link](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html) \n\n* In November 2018, an article came out stating that the number of EVs on U.S. roads was projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. Annual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. About 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure. [link]( https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx). \n\n* As it turns out, that number of annual EV sales of 3.5 million vehicles in 2030 was revised to almost double of that in a November 2020 report, just 2 years after the previous article. The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. Over 90% of states offered incentives for setting up EV charging infrastructure, with meaningful quality of life incentives and exemptions are offered across 39 states in the US, including easier payment plans for the purchase of EVs, limited-time incentives to accelerate EV adoption/conversion and lack of requirements for emission inspections across several states. [link]( https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)\n\n* President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 [link 1](https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/40-percent-evs-2030/), [link 2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-set-target-50-evs-by-2030-industry-backs-goal-2021-08-05/) which is double of the 20% forecast just three years earlier in 2018, and would likely occur only with strong support on the supply side through infrastructural and other support that would enable EV manufacturers to develop the capacity to produce the target number of vehicles, and demand side with respect to incentivizing people to purchase EVs. \n\n* EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. This bill adds $4,500 to the current $7,500 tax credit available for a total of $12,500 potentially available to EV buyers. It includes passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The proposal calls for $160 billion to fund subsidies and purchase incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ev-tax-credit-bill-biden/) \n\n* The proposed EV credits in the budget blueprint would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase. In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs. The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/11/us-democrats-propose-dramatic-expansion-of-ev-tax-credits-that-favors-big-three.html) \n\n* Furthermore, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, titled the American Jobs Plan, includes billions of dollars for other electrification efforts and for a national charging network. Specifically, the bipartisan plan includes $7.5 billion for a network of EV charging stations across the country. It also includes another $7.5 billion for electric buses and other transportation methods. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/biden-infrastructure-ev-subsidies-charging-network/)  \n\n* States area also providing EV incentives to residents e.g. Gov. JB Pritzker signed Illinois\u2019 clean energy law which includes a $4,000 rebate for residents to buy an electric vehicle (EV). [link](https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/illinois-wants-to-give-you-4000-to-buy-an-electric-vehicle/). \n\n* By 2030, there\u2019s expected to be an 8% divergence between EV demand estimates and production plans, meaning there needs to be a massive scaling up of infrastructure/capacity of EV manufacturers over current projections in order to fill the gap in the market. [link](https://gyazo.com/66173e4431b4c6b30ac7ed0662f13f1c) \n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**Before we look into what\u2019s happened since my last post, let\u2019s go over a quick refresher on what the company does.** Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 650 employees [link](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/65/canoo-receives-initial-aa-esg-leader-rating-from-msci) from leading technology and automotive companies [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/). Canoo\u2019s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else\u2019s lineup\u2026 take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=1747). What makes this Canoo so special compared to other EVs is their modular platform, which is purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. \n\nIt is this modular platform that led to Apple\u2019s interest and having talks with Canoo (the talks are assumed to have fallen apart because Canoo was looking for an investor while Apple was looking to for an acquisition), as the platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car\u2019s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).\n\nApple wasn\u2019t the only major company interested in Canoo, Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai and Kia\u2019s parent company) actually went a lot farther than Apple did with Canoo, announcing a partnership in February 2020 to develop new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by Canoo [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). This was extremely unusual and referred to as a significant victory for Canoo, as \u2018pretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal\u2026 Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of 2017, when its founders started the company\u2019 [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). \n\nUltimately this partnership did not go ahead because Canoo\u2019s chairman didn\u2019t feel as though it was worth it for Canoo, saying that the original deal with Hyundai didn\u2019t factor in the value of Canoo\u2019s IP, so a shift in strategy was made from licensing out the technology to protecting the IP and manufacturing and selling Canoo\u2019s own vehicles to commercial operators [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev) \n\nRegarding the technology/IP - Canoo has developed the world\u2019s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the lifestyle vehicle, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo\u2019s suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video).\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the current automotive model and see how Canoo\u2019s approach and the use of the skateboard platform add so much more value than conventional ICE manufacturers [link](https://gyazo.com/041f5f426804ab087740da6c5b0b1aeb), currently the model is broken because 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit is only generated after the first owner. The current model is geared towards the first owner and nothing more, with an assortment of OEMs/spare parts retailers/3rd party installers servicing vehicles after the initial sale. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same [link](https://gyazo.com/272959d52f3e8c169c711e9b18dbd98c). \n\nThe use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions [link](https://gyazo.com/7ade9dac03f0e6fcbffc6b8f3942eb4c), with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo\u2019s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that in traditional ICE, it would be exceptional if Bill of Materials cost carryover across variants reached 25%, with Canoo, this is exceeding 50%. The specific savings include:\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants\n\n* &gt;70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nThese enable the development of space efficient cabins that integrate simply onto platform [link](https://gyazo.com/0a5777ed4387d9d9916a0c0d949f452e), and provide the key basis for engineering Canoo\u2019s new value proposition of having a harmonized and articulated 3 \u2013 layer vehicle concept that keeps fresh and returns capital over an entire vehicle lifecycle [link](https://gyazo.com/7992fbead2e3c724ec002333b8c909c8). This image also showcases how Canoo aims to capture the full vehicle lifecycle value [link](https://gyazo.com/ca0abdaece1006dbb34ad42b60bb2977) \n\nThe three vehicles that Canoo has publicly announced as part of its lineup are:\n\nLifestyle vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/) - Fully electric, highly versatile and offering more utility inside and out for city explorers, businesses, families and adventurers. The multi-purpose platform unlocks SUV-size interior space on a smaller exterior footprint. It\u2019s pretty hard to put into an image of the vehicle into words so I\u2019d recommend clicking on the above link to check it out for yourself.

The picup truck is as strong as the toughest trucks out there and includes features for people who use trucks on the job, weekend, and adventure. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):\n\n* Launching as early as 2023.\n\n* Price \u2013 Not currently listed, but during the Q&amp;A portion of the investor day portion on June 30th, somebody asked what the base pricing for the pickup was, given that the Ford lightning F-150 base price was being advertised at $32,000. Chairman Tony Aquila said Canoo was not prepared to announce the pricing at that time, but Canoo would not be beaten in this category \u2013 you can check it out at the following link [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=10908)  \n\n* Targeted HP \u2013 500+\n\n* Payload Capacity \u2013 1800 lbs\n\n* Range \u2013 200+ mi\n\n* Powertrain \u2013 AWD or RWD\n\nThere\u2019s actually a fourth vehicle as well that hasn\u2019t been listed anywhere officially but was found by /u/Mcardiel007 when he was having issues communicating with Canoo and went to their Torrance location and spotted them unloading what is potentially the new sedan.

The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup). One of the fastest growing segments is delivery vans, with ~2M more delivery vehicles needed globally by 2030 [link](https://gyazo.com/309703e692c4a4fa96cd91096b593ac4). It\u2019s important to keep in mind existing fleet conversion to EV as well. Using the common platform provides a pivot-ability to focus on high margin products and is a large and profitable opportunity \u2013 highly lucrative and accretive to overall margin [link](https://gyazo.com/51a7448bc7b0c236d6c4b528eb662dda). \n\nCanoo is also looking at car data and not just strictly being a vehicle manufacturer \u2013 with an opportunity for harmonizing hardware and software + superior cleaning leading to actionable data instead of the status quo of outsourced hardware + poor cleaning leading to disjointed data. Each connected vehicle offers 1 \u2013 2 TB of raw data per day, with car data monetization globally valued at $250 Billion - $400 Billion [link](https://gyazo.com/d1e6a55ce2f1bb3777020592281afe8f).\n\nTo sum it up \u2013 Canoo is well-positioned for success with a differentiated business model [link](https://gyazo.com/6b0ce0f9af42b090b04e970aafe696fe), developing exceptional products that are aimed at the most profitable segments ($115B+ for 90% 2020 profit pool) in the US, addressing upfitting and accessories market in the US by monetizing full vehicle lifetime value with emphasis on 2nd, 3rd and 4th customers (valued at $24B+), and monetization of car data globally through customer-centric, software ecosystem generating exponential network effect ($250B+).\n\n**Part 4 \u2013 Recent Updates**\n\n**Now let\u2019s take a look at some of the hires that the company\u2019s been making (note that almost all of these hires have happened since the last quarter, with most being in the last two months, and this is not an exhaustive list).

The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant. Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar).\n\nPartnering with VDL Nedcar as a contract manufacturing partner to manufacture the Lifestyle Vehicle for the US &amp; EU markets while it builds its US-based mega micro-factory. By parallel pathing contract and owned manufacturing Canoo will meet its commitment to start production and deliver vehicles in Q4, 2022. Canoo Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that VDL Nedcar \u2018is the top trusted European manufacturer building high quality products for leading OEMs, and they significantly outcompeted the other contenders. VDL is also independently owned by the van der Leegte family of entrepreneurs - which aligns with our commitment to support businesses that form the backbone of communities. This strategic partnership will enable us to deliver vehicles to market while we build our Phase 2 factory in Oklahoma. It also strongly positions us for geographic expansion in Europe and builds a lasting relationship with VDL Groep of companies. Our investment will help us scale quickly and fulfill our mission to bring affordable, purpose-built EVs to Everyone.\u201d The Nedcar facility is slated to build up to 1000 units for both the US and European markets in 2022 with a target of 15,000 units in 2023 [link]( https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner)\n\nDe-risking the path to market, Canoo designed, built and tested beta for its lifestyle vehicle [link](https://gyazo.com/e9e9bee044f83da1536c1ab57809dece), with highlights including:\n\n* &gt;$250M invested in Beta\n\n* ~1.5M hours of engineering\n\n* ~500k miles of testing\n\n* 13 beta runners / 32 beta properties tested\n\n* US NCAP 5-star overall rating targeted, with simulated, sled and vehicle level crash testing.\n\nUndertaking the Gamma Phase with SOP on track for Q4 2022 [link]( https://gyazo.com/772813dd1ab4b30255dfdfa9674006ce), with key highlights including:\n\n* &gt;12 months of testing\n\n* ~120-150 vehicles will be built and validated\n\n* ~70 crash tests\n\n* 30 sled tests\n\n* Full slate of vehicle tests; no shortcuts\n\n* 80% of all components are sourced\n\n* 63% of all engineering is released\n\n* 54% of tooling is committed\n\nPartnering with the frontdoor collective for 10,000 MPDVs, the frontdoor collective are a network of delivery service partners that provide dependable last-mile delivery experience, with founders and executives with experience from FedEx, Walmart, XPO, Amazon, Instacart and the U.S. military.

Lafferty - $19 [link](https://www.investing.com/news/rf-lafferty-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-canoo-2568124) \n\n* H.C. Wainright - $15 [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-goev-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-09/) \n\n* Bank of America - $5 (can\u2019t find the article at the moment but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen it somewhere)\n\nAverage = $13, current SP = $6.7\n\nAs of Canoo\u2019s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million [link](https://investors.canoo.com/financial-information/balance-sheet), which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing its first products to markets [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=9398). \n\nThe company could raise $273M from warrants if the SP is greater than $18 for 20 out of 30 days.\n\nAt a pre-revenue stage there\u2019s not too much to say in this department, other than to note that value of a couple of orders:\n\n* Over 9,500 non-binding preorders \u2013 which if they are followed through with would be worth at least $313,500,00 (assuming 9,500 orders of the cheapest vehicle which is the base model MPDV).\n\n* 10,000 MPDVs for the frontdoor collective which would be worth at least $330,000,000 (assuming cheapest MPDV).\n\nAs far as valuations go, let\u2019s divide the pre-revenue EV manufacturers into tiers for an easier look \u2013 based on their market cap. I\u2019m sure some are missing because I only took a few, let me know and I\u2019ll add them in later. These market caps were taken within a few moments of each other on 9/21 from yahoo finance.\n\n* Lucid Motors \u2013 $41.23B, 11,000 pre-orders, delivery delayed to fall 2021\n\n* Nikola Corporation - $4.25B, lowered delivery guidance of 25/50 vehicles for 2021 \n\n* Fisker Inc - $3.917B, &gt;17,000 pre-orders, value of $637,483,000 \n\n* Faraday Future - $3.66B, 300 FF 91 Vehicles, value of $54,000,000 delivery in 2022 \n\n* Canoo \u2013 $1.63B, 19,500 pre-orders (9,500 individual + 10,000 front door collective), value of $643,500,000, delivery fall 2022 for LV, 2023 for MPDV \n\n* Company A (market cap too low, has a DOJ investigation ongoing and issued a going concern for whether it would have cash to make it to production) - $1.2B\n\nJust looking at a couple of examples here it would seem that Canoo is undervalued purely on a pre-orders/revenue perspective. Fisker and Faraday Future, which are both expected to deliver in 2022 as is the case with Canoo, have over double the market cap despite Canoo having similar preorder value (compared to Fisker) or much higher (compared to Faraday Future). Haven\u2019t done a cash flow analysis of every company but even taking into consideration Fisker having $400M more in cash on hand [source](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/), there\u2019s a significant discrepancy. Faraday Future meanwhile has less than half of Canoo\u2019s cash on hand at $230M [link](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/).  \n\n**Part 6 \u2013 Bear Case**\n\nWith anything pre-revenue, the biggest issue is always going to be do we have enough cash to get the product off the ground imo. I could write a really long paragraph but yea that\u2019s pretty much it in a sentence. Since I\u2019m on the bullish side for the company, I\u2019ll lay out a few reasons why I think Canoo won\u2019t be running out of $$$ before it comes to market \u2013 these have mostly been stated here and there throughout this document but I\u2019ll summarize them below:\n\n* As of Canoo\u2019s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing the Lifestyle Vehicle to market. \n\n* Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility.\n\n* EV funding is a significant portion of the upcoming budget, this is less grounded than the others but there is assumedly some hopium that Canoo would be able to receive some federal support if needed.\n\n* The company could take on debt to assist in getting to production \u2013 H.C. Wainwright in their coverage indicated that they expect $500M to $525M in funding could be raised in debt to 2023. Tony has previously stated that they are looking for as non-dilutive an approach as possible, and given the current SP it wouldn\u2019t make much sense to go the additional equity route.\n\n* In May, the SEC opened a fact-finding inquiry into Canoo as it did with many former EV SPACs, unlike others such as NKLA and (Company A) \u2013 nothing further has come as of yet, nor have any DOJ investigations been launched.\n\n**Part 7 \u2013 SI and Squeeze Potential**\n\nI know y\u2019all have just been waiting for this so I\u2019ll get right down to it. Famously developed by the esteemed /u/pennyether, the SMELL system is going to help us take a look at some key numbers that\u2019ll help understand GOEV\u2019s squeezability.\n\n* Short Interest \u2013 31.8 million shares, 32% of free float \n\n* Market Cap \u2013 $1.63 Billion, not big enough that it\u2019s immovable, not small enough that shorts would be able to cover without investing a decent amount of capital\n\n* Extremely Memeable \u2013 I mean\u2026 GOEV, like Go\u2026 EV, idk I think it ticks off the memeability criteria\n\n* Low Liquidity \u2013 Average volume per yahoo finance is 2.7M shares, which is 2.7% of the free float so any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on Canoo for cheap, with institutional inflows of $177M and only $2.56M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOEV/institutional-ownership/)\n\n* Low Risk (IV) \u2013 Yep, current IV is 77.1% for 9/24 and 10/1 options. Please do NOT consider this financial advice, like at all, but if you\u2019re one of the folks who look to just buy options for the sake of contributing to a gamma squeeze, take a look at the post by /u/ChemaKyle on how buying far OTM options and how it\u2019s not the best idea if you want the MMs to hedge. There\u2019s not much of a need to hedge vs something that doesn\u2019t have a ramp up and no OI at the ATM values. I\u2019d agree with his/her post and the commentators that buying ATM options and the underlying shares would have a greater chance at causing a gamma squeeze, but this is something you should research and do your own DD on as well based on your risk tolerance and investment threshold.\n\n**Part 8 \u2013 TL;DR**\n\nThe global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021, with total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. \n\nPresident Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030, to support this EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in the proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. Either way, this is huge for Canoo which is offering base models of the Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV at &lt;$35,000, with the base pickup model expected to be priced similarly. \n\nCanoo aims to disrupt the current automotive model by taking a piece of the 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit which is generated after the first owner and traditionally ignored by manufacturers. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same. Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup) and targeting one of the fastest growing segments of delivery vans, for which ~2M more delivery vehicles will be needed globally by 2030, with its MPDV.\n\nTo facilitate this disruption, Canoo has developed the world\u2019s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Canoo\u2019s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else\u2019s lineup\u2026 take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle. The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo\u2019s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next.\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants (compared to ~25% on ICE)\n\n* &gt;70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nIf we take a look at the funding incentives being proposed for consumers e.g. with the LV, the maximum federal rebate would be $12,500, and if we add in state incentives e.g. Illinois with it\u2019s $4,000 rebate \u2013 that turns into $16,500. The LV is priced at $34,750 which means that post-rebates you\u2019re getting it at almost half the price, pretty ridiculous in comparison to ICE vehicles, add in tighter emissions standards for ICE vehicles and Canoo starts looking pretty good.\n\nIf you made it this far, I\u2019d like to thank you for reading this \u2013 I\u2019d like to give a big shoutout to the community over on the canoo subreddit (not sure if I can link other subs so won\u2019t). They\u2019re extremely dedicated individuals who provide a wealth of knowledge on the ongoings of the company \u2013 from driving to HQ and coincidentally finding an unrevealed product to attending EXPOs and other showcase events and sharing vehicle images and detailed write-ups.

        "selftext": "I have been avidly learning the great minds of WallStreetBets and have gained extensive knowledge on investing, risk management, and portfolio growth. WSB has introduced me to the great world of options, and it has completely changed my life. \n\n**Pre-WSB**\nI am ashamed to admit\u2026 but I used to be a\u2026 *Boglehead*. In my early investing days (~5 months ago) the dinosaur Vanguard lentil eaters told me it is *impossible* to beat the market. They all accepted an early defeat that they\u2019ll never be rich, so they default to 6% yearly returns and averaging into the occasional 40% crash. Rather than risking my money on something *totally risky* like Apple (which holds $300B+ in cash and literally only goes up), I should own Apple and 5000 other companies that nobody knows or cares about.\n\nUnfortunately, these boomers convinced me and I threw my entire portfolio into VT and BND. \u201cOwn the market and you will get rich\u2026. when you\u2019re 500 years old\u201d. After holding for 2 weeks and losing 1.3%, I sold all my shares and started a new adventure. \n\n\n**Learning from WSB**\nAs I came to WSB, I saw a skilled trader lose $100k in seconds. His life: destroyed. In the next post, I saw another investor make $100k in seconds. His life: changed! I was in awe. The Bogleheads made me lose 1.2% of my account and told me to \u201chold for the next 60 years\u201d. Meanwhile I saw someone make 10,000% in a few minutes on some SPY calls. So I did what any logical person would do and opened a Robinhood account. I promptly applied for options, and Vlad personally gave me approval. He told me that life in Bulgaria was very difficult, but through options he was able to get out of the poor eurozone and into the United States. \n\nMy first trade was a massive success. I made 20% on an SPY call. I made 3 years worth of the Bogleheads dream in minutes. These losers can\u2019t compete. In the subsequent few months, I have 100x my account. Through a series of 0-1 DTE SPY calls, I have found great success trading complex financial derivatives that I do not understand. It\u2019s amazing. My life has been changed and I cannot thank WSB enough. \n\n\n**THANK YOU**\nI would like to thank WSB for fundamentally changing my life. Not only have you made me 100x richer, but you have taught me the importance of risk taking. I would still be a Vanguard boglehead loser if I didn\u2019t discover the power of 0-1DTE SPY calls (I do not buy puts since they\u2019re anti-American \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udcaa). If WSB was not filled with such intellectuals, I would have not trusted the numerous great DDs.\n\nThis leads me to my question:\n**Why doesn\u2019t everyone trade options?**\nI don\u2019t think it makes sense to buy and hold something for DECADES and hope for a 100% return after 20 years. I have made 100x in 3 months and could not imagine how pathetic I would look still holding VT and BND. I have leveraged all my accounts through a series of all in trades. I now have a Tesla arriving soon all thanks to the YOLO and WSB. \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t everyone do this?! It seems like free money.",

        "selftext": "Uranium.\n\nSure, there are no flashing LEDs like CRSR adds to all of their products, but that\u2019s because we don\u2019t need it. Uranium already glows in the dark! (No, radioactive things don\u2019t really glow in the dark. You have to mix trace radioactive material with a fluor to do that.)\n\nMaybe Uranium isn't as sexy as some over-hyped under-developed threadmill with an iPad glued to it that kills babies, and it is lacking in buzzwords like \"cloud data analytics,\" but uranium is energy. And everything we do takes energy, and this is the cleanest, densest, most likely candidate for the immediate future. There are already big incumbents in energy that need to get shouldered aside, so this will be a slower play than the up 50% in a week flavors of the month (which then fall 90%), but this is the real deal. With calls you can still get that 50%, or 500%, but shares will take some time. That said, many of these names are up 15% in a week, just barely OTM calls up 500%. That's not exactly [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/).\n\nUranium has a serious bull case of ahead of it. A new fund is in town (Sprott) who is buying up all the physical uranium. Get ready to gap up. Yes you have heard some of this before, and I peddled Uranium a full on year ago, but this fund is a market mover and it changes everything.\n\nSorry if you saw this quickly deleted multiple times. F'ing automod.\n\nTLDR, 1) since 2019 supply has been below demand for uranium as the market continues to deal with a supply overhang and over-investment by miners from the previous market cycle. COVID then reduced supply by a further 30% through mine closures that have continued for 2021 and the supply overhang is finally gone. 2) More nuclear reactors are being built worldwide than decommissioned, developing nations have hopped on board the nuclear train, and 3) if any country is serious about getting to carbon neutral then the only realistic avenue is via massive expansion of the nuclear fleet. Lastly, 4) there is a new physical trust (Sprott) busy buying up all of the uranium and driving up the spot price. It\u2019s working.\n\nUranium spot is $34.60 right now, 2007 was $137. That\u2019s a lot of upside baby. Oh, and did I mention that the Uranium market is small? Tiny. Super tiny. WSB could blow this thing up. There isn\u2019t an entire industry of traders, hedgers, and dilatants (that\u2019s a nice way of saying degenerates) trading U like there are for oil or other commodities.\n\n**1. The Setup**: Uranium is already on a 5 year trend line of tendies\n\nUranium has been in a bear market since 2007. It started to finally sell through the over supply and over investment of the last market cycle and has been climbing from its low of $18.50 in 2016. This was already a 4 year trend line, and then COVID came along.\n\nCOVID changed the uranium market in two main ways. First, it dramatically reduced global supply by about 30% in 2020 and 2021 due to mine closures by many of the majors and juniors. These closures have allowed the sticky overhang from the last decade to finally get put on the spot market. Second, there appears to be an OPEC+ of uranium forming. Miners, no doubt still traumatized from last time they aggressively expanded productions, are not opening new minds even as spot prices surge. Instead, they continue to provide quarterly guidance that they are operating below capacity for the rest of the year, and are selling old supply instead of starting new mines. They aren\u2019t formally a cartel like OPEC is, but there seems to be some game theory going on here. It is miner\u2019s best interest to try to exactly match the demand of U on a global scale and then be able to dictate the price. Since fuel costs are just 2% of the operating costs of a nuclear reactor, utilities can also stomach significant increases in spot prices without effecting their generation rates of \\~ $.02/KwH.\n\nU is $34.60 right now which is 75.24% below its peak in 2007. In a market with all-time highs all over the place, U has a long way to run. What will miner prices be if U hits $100+ again? Massive.\n\n**2. New Demand**: Global demand has outpaced supply\n\nPlanned Reactor Starts in Gross MWe of new capacity (from world-nuclear.org)\n\n* 2021: 5,711\n* 2022: 13,559\n* 2023: 13,276\n* 2024: 7,569\n* 2025: 5,112\n* 2026: 6,997\n* 2027: 4,100\n\nCredit Suisse offers their own global view of supply &amp; demand here. Get your sunglasses on as this assumes the US fleet is shrinking into 2030. That likely won\u2019t be the case. See comments #1, automod doesn't like my links.\n\nFirst, if you are from the US then you are likely biased against nuclear. Get over it. The US has a very old fleet and has been periodically retiring plants rather than performing maintenance. I\u2019ll get back to the US later, but the global view is very, very positive. Globally, many developing nations are starting to add, or start, a nuclear fleet. It\u2019s cheap and it doesn\u2019t pollute. India, Slovakia, Belarus, and Pakistan all have new plants started or starting in the next year. France continues to expand and sell energy, while China seems serious about cutting CO2 emissions and is massively expanding their existing fleet, as well as breaking ground on the world\u2019s first SMR earlier this year.\n\nSo back to the USA\u2014the US mostly acts as a drag. A reactor in New York just closed, and others throughout the country are always wavering on edge of retirement. This is set to change, but it depends upon politics, so we\u2019ll see (and the right likes nuclear too, it\u2019s not just about CO2). The Secretary of Energy is committed to keeping every single US plant operating as it prepares to transition to a fleet of fast breeding, small modular reactors (SMR\u2019s) in the \u201clate 2020s, early 2030s.\u201d (this just means highly fuel efficient with far, far less waste, and reactors the size of a 3-4 story apartment building instead of a city block. Each will power 500,000+ homes, so they can be \u201cclose\u201d to cities they power and also reduce infrastructure costs.) She is working with legislatures to allow all currently operating plants to essentially receive carbon credits as an incentive for utilities to keep the plants running and well maintained until the SMR roll-out.\n\nYes, this is a long horizon for the US, but the US is only one part of the uranium market and a very minor part of this bull case. Globally, supply/demand are already tight, and the world fleet is slated to expand. Utilities can see the writing on the wall and will want to start placing orders now for future delivery (spot market for Uranium is quite different from other commodities\u2014purchasing, delivery, enrichment, and feeding take years. You can bet these utilities are looking at supply/demand graphs and already panicking. Spot is going to start gapping up instead of ticking.\n\n**3. Green Energy**: The Elephant in the Room\n\nNuclear power is the greenest mass-scalable energy on the planet. Hydro destroys entire riparian ecosystems, wind and solar are both CO2 heavy in terms of manufacturing and are slow ROI on the carbon expenditure as well as having short functional commercial lifespans, while geothermal is quite literally tied to very specific locations (OK, I don\u2019t know anything about tidal, but other than reading about some plans being nixed by NIBY Boomers I\u2019m not seeing it either).\n\nThese renewable forms of power generation have another cost: land. Aside from geothermal, these are not power dense generators. Here is an article working through the cost in land to electrify just British Colombia\u2019s transport grid. The takeaway is that nuclear wins by a landslide: 2.4 m2/kWh versus solar\u2019s 36.9m2, hydro\u2019s 54 m2, and wind\u2019s 72.1 m2. If you want to electrify the US transport grid then you can either build some nuclear plants, or convert all of Nevada to a giant solar farm. I mean, what is Nevada good for anyway?\n\nNumbers on energy density coming from here: damn you automods, see comments for links.\n\nThe latest generation of nuclear plants, SMRs, are small and safe. They can be built alongside cities to save CO2 and money that would otherwise go into infrastructure. How many more fires are we going to see every fire season as PG&amp;E and other utilities run millions of miles of hot lines all over the country? This too is a cost of the current way to locating and distributing energy. This all changes with SMRs, and all for the better.\n\nBiden has made some surprisingly strong claims about aiming the US at net zero, and we\u2019re hardly a climate activist country. If this happens in other countries, and perhaps the US, then it means we are looking at hundreds upon hundreds of new nuclear power plants in the next two decades, not just the few dozen currently in the planning stages over the coming 2020s. This will be the renaissance of nuclear, and it is coming.\n\nThink about it. If there is any chance in hell of reducing carbon emissions, then nuclear is the path forward. Everything else is a half measure.\n\n**4. The Dinosaur in the Room**: Sprott Physical Uranium Trust\n\nThis is a new fund from an old hand in physical trusts. Sprott\u2019s Physical Uranium Trust (U.U \u2013 Canadian listed, NYSE coming in \\~4m) purchases uranium on the spot market and then warehouses it. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the whole plan. This is gigantic.\n\nAs shares of U.U are issued Sprott takes that money and buys uranium, which increases their NAV. So long as they have a premium to NAV they keep buying. They\u2019ve only been buying physical uranium for two weeks now, but **they\u2019ve already purchased 13.3% of the estimated global uranium production for all of 2021**. Read that sentence again. 20.59m lbs of the projected world supply of 154m lbs. Jesus Christ are these guys a market force to be reckoned with. How is this not illegal?\n\nLook at spot price versus their holdings. They march up and up in tandem. Spot has gone up 7.1% in the last month, with all of those gains coming within days of when Sprott started buying.\n\nSee comment link for google spreadsheet of Sprott and spot rate.\n\n**5. There are short sellers here**\n\nSome entities sell naked uranium deliveries. In a market as slow moving and opaque as uranium is this probably seemed like a good idea at the time. How much of a factor would this be? I don't honestly know. Uranium is not like other commodities with all their nifty reporting and data. We'll find out?\n\n**Positions or Ban:** OK, we know you all just skipped to the end anyway\n\nGo long anything uranium.\n\nMiners/Exploration:\n\n* CCJ\n* NXE\n* Google as many are too small by marketcap for me to list here, but they are mostly small for a reason\n* U.U (This is Sprott. Buy this, but only if Canadian. Imagine what will happen when this gets NYSE listed in 2022!)\n\nURA: ETF of major and minor miners, equipment production, all things uranium\n\n*Options*:\n\nAs we all know, there are only a few times when dealers work with your play instead of hedging against it, and one of those is when you buy far OTM calls. When you buy a far OTM call the dealer will also purchase or adjust their position matching your direction.\n\nSo, if you are buying calls (I would recommend calls *and* shares) then far OTM calls skew delta in our favor.\n\nThat out of the way, the Uranium market is slow, but Sprotts has started to speed things up.\n\nURA 10/22 $25c is about as high as I would go without going longer dated.\n\nAfter that, June 2022 $30+ is cheapish. No doubt you will all ignore this and buy something idiotic like front month $30. Really, don\u2019t do that.\n\nNXE 2/22 or 12/22 $5 or $7. I did a few call debit spreads of buying 12/22 $5, selling $7. Probably should be greedier, but it seems so safe. What could go wrong?\n\n*Shares*:\n\nI like NXE from the miners/explorers the most, but CCJ is also a very solid miner. Google smaller marketcap ones on your own.\n\nMy positions:\n\n* URA &amp; NXE shares (some other too small of marketcap to list)\n* URA 10/22 $25c\n* URA 6/22 $28c &amp; 30c\n* NXE 9/17 $5c\n* NXE 12/22 $5c\n* NXE 12/22 $7c",

        "selftext": "Hey, do you guys remember when 14 days ago I got banned for posting that [IRNT was about to go nuclear](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/phc0uk/irnt_glitched_float_whale_oi_nuclear_gamma_ramp/)? At the time it was $14.00 and 9/17 $20 calls were something like $0.30 each. Remember my post on WSB? No, you don't. It got deleted. That didn't stop IRNT from hitting $40 in AH and opening the following day at like $26.\n\nHow about a stock called TMC? Remember when [I posted about its similar set-up](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/pnjll5/tmc_high_gamma_high_short_interest_but_high_iv/) Monday? You don't remember that? Oh, right, I didn't post it to WSB because I didn't want to get banned again. Well, it seems to be doing fine.\n\nLast night, rather than sleep, I decided to spent hours filling out a spreadsheet with every deSPAC I could find (if you're deep in the deSPAC craze, you know the list); complete with the new floats, IV, gamma values, percent of float deltahedged, estimated SI, Utilization, and CTB -- you know... the only things that really matter to us. (It's not like \"fundamentals\" could fit in a spreadsheet column, anyway.)\n\nNow I'm letting off some steam by once again partaking in the lost ancient art form of writing a DD for WSB. This time it's about what I think is best deSPAC play that is currently available for WSB to blindly dump its collective IRNT winnings into: VLTA.\n\ntldr:\n\n* **MARKET CAP IS $2B NO BAN PLS**\n* Low IV (currently) -- Make money from the MMs, not from each other.\n* High gamma -- Even after Sep options expire.\n* Some short interest (\\~10% of float) -- but more importantly 0 shares to borrow to keep this dog down. CTB getting \"up there\" at 47%.\n* The company does stuff.. not sure what, but I'm sure it's great world-changing stuff. Their name is Volta, so they must have *potential*... get it?\n* **The set-up looks suspiciously good, so I might be missing something. Perhaps wait for some wrinkle brain to shit on my thesis here.**\n\n# 0. The Market Cap\n\nI'm not actually salty about being banned; the mods have a tough job sorting through all the bullshit. I mean, just look at the titles of DDs these days... people just put in zero effort. At the time I posted about IRNT, the reported market cap on it varied from source to source due to the fucked up situation with outstanding shares and float. I assume the mods thought I was trying to sneak one by 'em. No hard feelings. I don't blame the mods for erring on the side of caution.\n\nAnyway, this time around **I'm certain VLTA meets the market cap requirements.**\n\nJust ask TDA: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r55bbd7uo2o71.png?width=521&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0347f40d4e7fa12524b1bfaa7e1b95b3caa7b48a\n\nOr Google: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/40wwwftuo2o71.png?width=1053&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=896255bbdf4c1b89c96fc60ce9757deebcd21ac8\n\nNo! Wait! Wait!  ... I meant this google: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tlcwr8fwo2o71.png?width=865&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6a696e86837c55d3dfce2491ee14442f5ff7d6c\n\nAlright. $2.0B &gt; $1.5B. Let's move on.\n\n# 1. The Process\n\nHow did I find VLTA? It's simple. I don't have a life and I spent all night making a spreadsheet, running calculations on gamma, and throwing in SI data from Ortex for tickers that look interesting.\n\nHere's a screenshot:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Lots of pretty colors. Must be legit.](https://preview.redd.it/8f39xl4xo2o71.png?width=1223&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3094fd899041cbe76974ba16a5215aae82349781)\n\nI blurred a lot of the tickers, per market cap rules. (If you're a true deSPAC degen, you'll know where the tickers and float numbers came from.)\n\nWhat I looked for were tickers with a lot of bright green squares. Most importantly, I want that low IV -- which to me indicates MMs asking to get reamed. Just like momma always says -- Low IV is how 10+ baggers are made.\n\nI was surprised to see that VLTA had the 5th highest current gamma value, behind TMC, OPAD, REDACTED, and IRNT. All of these have seen significant price action lately. Yet, the IV on VLTA was incredibly low... only bested by tickers with higher market caps and non-existent gamma. Wake up, MMs. (Or, again I'm missing some piece of the puzzle here.)\n\nOh, before you ask about IV -- I'm using 30d ATM IV as my baseline. I compute it myself by interpolating IV between strikes and expirations. In reality, each ticker will have it's own IV skew so don't yell at me when you see the OTM FDs aren't 80% IV.\n\nAs for the SI column: some tickers (the gray ones) had bonkers Estimated Short Interest. For these tickers, I used 60% of the On Loan value to estimate the estimated short interest. If you want hopium, upper bound for SI is about 1.6x the gray values.\n\n# 2. The Set-up\n\nTo summarize VLTA:\n\n* It's a deSPAC\n* With high OI relative to it's new float\n* With some short interest (not much)\n* But no shares available to borrow\n* With sustained bullish order flow\n* **And it's IV is priced as though all of the above is not true.**\n\n## deSPAC\n\nIt's a deSPAC.\n\nIf you don't know what that means, well, you're shit out of luck. I'm not going to explain how SPACs have huge floats and are allowed to have options traded on them, but then when they go through with a merger a lot of that float vanishes due to redemptions (but the options don't), so there ends up being a ton of options and not a lot of float, and MMs might not be aware of the change in the float and might think it's easy to buy shares to deltahedge but in reality there isn't a lot of float at all and when they deltahedge they push the price up making things worse for themselves. Same goes for shorts trying to cover.\n\nNo, I'm just not going to explain deSPACs to you at all.\n\nIn case you're wondering, VLTA completed August 26th with a 70% redemption rate. That's a lot lower than 90%+ we see with the IRNT, OPAD, TMC wonderkids.  So beware, a lower redemption rate means shareholders were more confident in Volta -- it might actually not be a completely shitty company.\n\n## OI relative to float\n\nA lot of people are going to shit on VLTA because it has a \"high float\" of 10,277,713 shares relative to the grab bag of deSPACs out there. Yes, compared to IRNT (\\~1.3m), TMC (\\~2.7m), OPAD (\\~3.4m), 10m is a bigger number.

High gamma does not guarantee a gamma squeeze. A squeeze implies a runaway effect. What we want here is *momentum*. Think of a puck gliding on ice. High gamma = less friction.\n2. High gamma makes it easy to go up, but it also makes it easy to go down. Just like the puck gliding on ice. Easy to slide one way, easy to slide the other.\n\n## Short Interest and Utilization\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k32ay110p2o71.png?width=1723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39cd6c0b8c0f67242e10eb88e805486577a91255\n\nOrtex doesn't estimate SI for this one, but they do have the amount On Loan. It's 1,664,307, or 16.19 % float. That's the upper bound -- the real SI is generally lower than the amount that Ortex reports On Loan. If I had to guess, about 60% of it, so around 1m shares shorted, which is about 10% of float. Not a big story here.\n\nAlso of note is the *rising* value of the On Loan average age. It's going up -- which means that most shares borrowed were done so in the past. Think of it this way: if older loans were closed and new ones opened, the average age would go down.\n\nThe average age is 18 days, which is around Aug 30, when share price was $10.00. So to the extent that there are shorts, they're underwater just a bit.\n\nSI isn't super compelling. What's more encouraging, to me, is the Utilization pegged near 100%, and CTB in high double digits. This means there are no shares to short, and when there are, they are expensive. This is generally good news when you want the stock to go up.\n\n## Order Flow\n\nThe past several days have seen an influx of buyers, and I don't know where exactly they are coming from. I don't find very many mentions of this ticker on Reddit. Well, I did find [one post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pp0fu2/vlta_look_at_me_over_here_fomo_just_want_to_be/). As of now, I'm the only upvote. I just left a comment.\n\nHere's the orderflow, per MarketChameleon:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/exkzkyl0p2o71.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38a8b3c93fc7e1f8346312e45da286d543f14199\n\nBullish enough for me.\n\n## The Implied Vol\n\n**Here's the part I don't understand.**  Given all of the above, how is it that MMs did not ramp up IV on this deSPAC like they did on all others?\n\nVLTA 10/15 ATM calls are sitting at around \\~100% IV right now. That seems pretty low to me. Even further OTM, $17.50's are sitting at \\~126%.\n\nAccording to MarketChameleon, which does some weighted averaging type of stuff across strikes and expirations, the 30d IV to be 91%.\n\nFor comparison, here are the *pre-jump* 30d IVs of some famous deSPACs:\n\n* IRNT (Sep 1): 127%\n* IPOD (Sep 10): 134%\n* TMC (Sep 14): 178%\n* VLTA (now): 91%\n\nI'm not sure why this is, but I'll take a bargain when I see one.\n\n## Other\n\nVLTA is currently on the threshold securities list. I don't really think carries a lot of weight, but it's worth noting.\n\n# 3. The Play\n\nAlright, I assume you saw a really long DD with pretty pictures and tables and just want to throw money into something.\n\n## Risks/Rewards\n\nLet me first tell you the risks:\n\n* There is no real gamma. Perhaps all the OI is spreads. Or covered calls.\n* MMs are anticipating for this (despite the low IV signifying otherwise). Instead of milking them, we're circle jerking one another while playing hot-potato-options until everyone gets bored.\n* **I could be completely off about the float or some other mechanic, like PIPE shares unlocking or something.** To the best of my knowledge, this thing has just been sitting quietly under the radar since redemption... aside from the run-up.\n\nAnd here are the rewards:\n\n* MMs, for some reason, overestimated the float. The buy-in is relentless, and they decide it best to do one or both: a) buy back expensive calls, or b) bite the bullet and accumulate shares, pushing prices up.\n* IV going from X% to 300%.\n* That hole in yourself you feel for not buying/holding IRNT, OPAD, TMC, etc -- this can provide closure. (Or it can be salt.)\n\n## What to buy\n\n* October calls.\n* Shares\n\n## When to sell\n\nLook, I have no idea what happens here, and when it happens. I see a good set-up, and I see a deSPAC frenzy all around me, so I think this is a good bet.\n\n**What I will recommend, however, is to keep a very close eye on the IV.** Regardless of price, IV roughly tells you how much \"acceleration\" is priced in. If you're holding an option and the IV jumps up, you need to ask yourself:  will interest in this stock and/or share price accelerate or decelerate? Will inflows continue or reverse? As IV goes up, the margin of error in your judgement decreases -- small errors will cost you bigly, as IV is *generally* correlated to actual volatility.\n\nAt which IV and/or price to sell at is a judgement you need to make for yourself based on whatever it is you do, and the risk you can tolerate. It can be TA, gauging sentiment, momentum, technicals (float, gamma, etc), or you just feel it in your plums.\n\nFor me, personally, I'm a little bitch and will probably be out at around 300% IV, just like I was with all the other deSPACs. I have faith gamma pushes this upwards, but at some point, the MMs are milked and it becomes a game of hot-potato. Not for me.\n\n# My positions:\n\nOct Calls: $12.50, $15.00, $17.50",

Citing sources familiar with the meeting, Electrek reported Thursday that Musk held a company-wide call and said the Cybertruck should be ready for production in late 2022.\n\nIf the company plans for beta trucks later this year, that leaves nowhere near enough time to start actual production in late 2021.\n\nFollowing his comments, Tesla updated the Cybertruck's reservation page to note production will fire up in 2022. Though, according to Musk, we're not looking at early 2022 or anything like that. And as we suspected, the CEO underscored the electric truck's volume models may not be ready until sometime in 2023. If Tesla follows this timeline, we'll get the priciest tri-motor model in 2022, then the dual- and single-motor trucks in 2023.\n\nLink: [https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-production-delay-elon-musk/](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-production-delay-elon-musk/)\n\nElon Musk confirmed that Tesla has delayed the new Roadster program to 2023, and even then, that\u2019s only going to happen with a big \u201cif.\u201d  \nThe new electric hypercar is now three years behind its original timeline.   \nWhen first unveiling the next-generation Tesla Roadster in 2017, Musk said that it will come to market in 2020.\n\nTesla started taking reservations for the impressive electric supercar with a 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds and over 600 miles of range at the unveiling event.  \nPeople who wanted to be first in line to get the vehicle had to put down between $50,000 and $250,000 in deposits.  \nThe vehicle program was later delayed, as the CEO said that it wasn\u2019t a priority for Tesla.

Thoughts crossed my mind \u201cwhy did I buy calls Friday?\u201d \u201cWhy the fuck didn\u2019t I buy spy puts?\u201d But the past is the past and here we are.\n\nWhat happened today was a classic overreaction due to Evergrande and their housing debt crisis and had in no way anything to do with the American market. We are still recovering from a major pandemic and have a lot of fuel left in this bull run. Remember back in July when Spy dropped from $435 to $425 over the weekend? The next week it rose back to ATH and ended the week near $440. I predict the same thing will happen here and put us back at $450 by the end of September.\n\nThe only thing that will bring this market down is a full blown nuclear war, another lockdown from covid, or some other catastrophe that none of us will see coming.\n\nYou think America gives a fuck about what happens in China? All we care about is buying a new electric car, getting the iPhone 13, and having same day delivery for massive green dildos. I for one have been loading up on calls and am buying the fucking dip \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPrepare for Turnaround Tuesday and as always, an obligatory fuck \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b",

        "selftext": " **TL;DR - stock with gamma squeeze potential and 157% short interest of float gets my dick hard. If OPAD reaches $16 market makers will need to hedge nearly 100% of float--and stock already reached $16 last Thursday. Market makers &amp; short sellers fucked.**\n\nNo doubt you've seen the IRNT posts about the unique situation arising from a low float and high call options. Well I've got news for you: I've been watching $OPAD like a hawk and it looks to be ramping up into the exact same situation as IRNT, and yet somehow you apes haven't realized this yet. If you're sad you missed out on IRNT and you think underwater mining is bullshit, then have I got the play for you. And you can actually seemingly get in early on this one too. I've been accumulating my position in OPAD since last Tuesday while watching the gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential increase every day. Read on for what I know, and buckle up cause this is a big one\u2026\n\n[OPAD is where IRNT was two weeks ago](https://preview.redd.it/0z9j53b2bon71.png?width=1659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f0f1c45bdd00818c3f61abc3640cd686efde050)\n\n*This is not financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Please keep in mind this is a high risk play and I am a random stranger on the internet - so make sure you do your own research! Don't blame me if you're a dumbass who YOLOs their whole account into 150% OTM 3 DTE calls and this doesn't materialize.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Background\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, some background on the company. Offerpad ($OPAD) is an iBuyer company with a current market cap of 2.636B.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wxq4xw4bon71.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3beaf0d4855963388afc86057c8f74523ca2c797\n\nAn iBuyer is basically a company that uses their technology to make quick offers to home sellers, then re-sell those homes themselves for profit. Think Redfin, Zillow, Opendoor - those are OPAD's competitors.\n\nOfferpad de-SPACed just a few weeks ago and started trading as OPAD on September 2. For some reason investors fucking hated this thing, so prior to the ticker change the SPAC had a huge percent of redemptions just like IRNT - a whopping 92% redemption rate. As a result, there are now only 3,387,913 shares in the free float until PIPE unlocks (TBD at this point). And, just like IRNT, OPAD has fallen into this retarded loophole created by the genius SEC where it somehow has options even though the current float is technically too small for listing options.\n\n[Redemption info from OPAD's super 8K filing - a legal filing our SEC overlords make each SPAC file when it completes its merger and de-SPACs](https://preview.redd.it/1vjw8d48bon71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75752ce6d62b95ac0731442ef2fdb5da9c49580b)\n\nAs a result of the low float the stock has been extremely volatile since it began trading as OPAD on 9/2. It's seen 10-20% intraday swings pretty much every day since the ticker change. If you had just been trading those dips you'd actually probably be pretty fucking rich by now. OPAD even reached a high of $16 last Thursday. Just as it was starting to gamma squeeze into orbit, though, it was shorted to shit Thursday into Friday and eventually closed Friday down almost 40% from that $16 high. More on that shorting below - point is, this is super volatile and therefore also a high risk play. If that's too scary for you, though, then why the fuck are you on [r/WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/) in the first place? Go back to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and your 3 fund portfolio.\n\nAlso, if you're a smooth brain who obsesses over technical analysis - OPAD looks to have had a nearly perfect gap fill yesterday and has since started to take off into orbit (up 29% from that low end of day Tuesday).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qheyfjjdbon71.png?width=1669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b58b811614984f2013a2cdfb05a2259e7195d04\n\nClosed 9/3 at $8.63 and gapped up to open 9/7 at $10.09. On 9/3 retraced back down to $8.60 for all of one minute before bouncing back up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Gamma Squeeze - Market Makers Fucked\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, now to the really good stuff. I know as soon as you read \"gamma squeeze\" in the title your itty bitty micropeen got hard as a thumbtack, so let me give you some porn to jack off to.\n\nJust like IRNT, OPAD's options can put market makers in the position where they would need to buy over 100% of OPAD's current float in order to hedge their risk from writing options to retards like you all on WSB - and frankly, it's not that hard for OPAD to reach the point where this would happen. As further OTM call options become in the money, market makers will have to buy more and more of these shares to sell to you if you decide to exercise the contract. This is because of the options Greeks Delta and Gamma. Now normally I know that for you retards \"options Greeks\" usually means the options your wife's Greek boyfriend tells you to buy, but for this play Delta and Gamma are super important.\n\nSince I know you dgaf about options Greeks, let me try to dumb it down for you apes with a picture:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2pluvjwjbon71.png?width=1747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892bf16fa9e8a9325c69b8808fbad066e460a6bb\n\nBased on the options open interest as of yesterday, if OPAD reached $16 then market makers would need to hedge 98.21% of the current float. At Wednesday's close price, only 29.72% of the float would need to be hedged - still a huge amount, but clearly this thing has room to run. And on top of that, OPAD already managed to reach $16 last Thursday before it was swatted down by short sellers.\n\nRight now, as the price increases past $16 market makers would need to buy less and less additional stock to hedge since the stock price becomes further and further from the open options interest. If more people buy more OTM options, though, then the price could run even higher because market makers would need to buy even more stock even after the price runs (aka the situation IRNT is in right now). This is delta and gamma at play, and what can create a gamma squeeze. This covering would be incredibly difficult for market makers to do because of the low number of stock available in the float. OPAD already briefly reached $16 last Thursday and OPAD's options volume and open interest has been steadily increasing, so who knows what the fuck could happen over the next few days as we head into September options expiration.\n\nAlso, since you're a degenerate and have likely already started to buy options on this shit before even finishing my DD you may have noticed that OPAD's options open interest and volume is much lower than IRNT's. For one, this is probably because you apes haven't caught wind of OPAD until right now and haven't yet started buying large amounts of retardedly OTM calls. However, even with the lower overall open interest there is still a ton of potential.\n\nHere is OPAD's total open interest and volume since I started tracking it last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ahxfhvmbon71.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=592b7835a2304db6ab812fdccfd9fb680b477ab8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/puvnpdmobon71.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e5d576a1ba05856cbe93449daa6b8c72cae3791\n\nHere's OPAD's OI and most recent volume for September expiration compared to IRNT, as of the end of the day Wednesday:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||OPAD|IRNT|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Puts - OI|3,326|25,276|\n|Calls - OI|19,369|58,031|\n|Put-Call Ratio - OI|0.17|0.44|\n|Puts - Volume|1,605|9,719|\n|Calls - Volume|16,205|41,787|\n|Put-Call Ratio - Volume|0.10|0.23|\n\nWhile the total number of calls (for all strikes and for September) is lower than IRNT, there are pretty much no puts open for OPAD whereas IRNT has almost half as many open puts as calls. Puts that market makers sell counteract the hedging that market makers need to do when price increases in order to cover the calls they sell, so for OPAD a much lower relative number of puts means that the open calls could still require market makers to hedge a large volume of shares even if there are less total calls than IRNT. To dumb it down for you apes - less put mean slightly less call still go big boom.\n\nAnd all of this isn't even accounting for you dumbass apes who love short-dated OTM options. Just like GME, stock buying is what can really get this going. But, more options open interest means that the gamma squeeze potential will only increase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Short Interest - Short Sellers Fucked\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y56rygbybon71.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb999d9ecbf55fe076aae8dbf20f5f8cc49a7977\n\n[I know short squeezes are like crack to you people, and I'm here to feed your addiction.](https://preview.redd.it/jck8gau0con71.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc05bf4a5ebb91d0c4ceba8067c56f69ad856da5)\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, ever since OPAD started to run last week it's been getting hammered by short sellers. To begin with, even taking out the gamma squeeze considerations with OPAD it's a retarded idea to short this stock right now. OPAD is a legitimate growth stock with many signs that it's significantly undervalued right now and could likely be a nice return even if you were to just buy and hold. For example, OPAD's 2021 projected revenue is $1.7-$1.85 billion. With their current market cap, they would only be trading at a 1.55 multiple; OPAD's peers are trading at multiple times higher than that. Even if all outstanding warrants are executed and after PIPE unlock, this stock will still be undervalued relative to its peers.\n\nThe crazy thing about the shorting is that according to Ortex, short sellers have now managed to accumulate a total short interest of 5.33 million - which is **157% of the current float**. Short interest **increased 36% yesterday**, cost to borrow reached as high as **220.08%**, and **utilization is at 99.98%** (aka there are pretty much no shares left to short).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/btsivxm2con71.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=684fd041c0a8b15af0761fed6ed835d88b9a1634\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0fvtcdr3con71.png?width=1259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1948a30365647cadf2459096e789bbe99c1c211\n\nShort sellers would already need to purchase 1.5x the current float to fully cover their positions. However - remember what I said earlier about the market makers needing to buy stocks to cover the calls they're writing to you retards? Because the market makers are doing that, there would be even less shares for short sellers to cover with. This is how you get to infinity squeeze potential - there just wouldn't be nearly enough shares available for everyone to buy what they need to cover. This gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential is also exactly what happened with GME back in January. It's almost like these dumbass short sellers haven't learned a damn thing.\n\nIt also seems that these short sellers caught on to this risk and really don't want this thing to blast off. And I take offense to that - I want my tendies. These huge drops in price were rally killers. If you check the open interest from Ortex above you'll see the huge increase in short interest after last Thursday.\n\n[Shorts fucking with OPAD when it started to take off last Thursday](https://preview.redd.it/mr2cfuu4con71.png?width=1666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=359769d5f4676a797ecff357c00ad0f47fe90927)\n\n[Shorts fucking with OPAD again when it started to take off Wednesday](https://preview.redd.it/dpsq83p5con71.png?width=1670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79f80e9a93511d65bb9c10f457249823e70a8b07)\n\nWhat's great is that even though this has been significantly beaten down by short sellers, OPAD has come right back after each dip you see above. This thing just cannot be beaten.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eht6wkq7con71.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=570e9c1bd82e51863c34106b5666d0e8fa91e483\n\nMore importantly, though, is that since these short sellers seem to just keep doubling down each time this thing starts to blast off they will be extra mega-fucked once it actually does achieve liftoff. Each time they double down on their shorting they are just adding more fuel to the fire. More than that, if the folks shorting OPAD are the same ones shorting other low float stocks like IRNT, and OPAD pops alongside those other stocks - we very well could see short sellers getting margin called from multiple positions turning extremely against them all at once just like we saw back in January/February with GME, AMC, etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4s8y6k8con71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=572dfc1c1e7a6baf03e1fe610864b755ce7b8547\n\nSo, there you have it--yet another gamma squeeze/short squeeze stock for you to go apeshit over. Good luck, this one should be lit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/up8fm599con71.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92991b84268635c27e5f743f9584bb74c1c6d7d7\n\nOh, also - positions below. I didn't sell last Thursday during the run, instead I've been steadily buying more. This baby still has lots of room to run and has yet to truly pop.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpjcqs3acon71.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8f2449319bc5ee538da2015162549ea25434b2c",

        "selftext": "TMC (The Metals Company) is a recent \"de-SPA C\" that started trading on Friday.  It's a deep sea mining company with a market cap of $2.35 billion with 245 million shares outstanding (current price in the $9-9.50 range).\n\nThe key thing here though is that 231 million shares are locked up at least 6 months and the 11 million PIPE shares are locked for at least a month (but perhaps longer because 2/3 of their PIPE didn't pay up).\n\nOkay, so why do we care? Here's why this is potentially one of the most explosive stocks we've ever seen this week:\n\nThe current float is 2.72 million because 91% of the original 30 million shares redeemed for cash.\n\nThe short interest is around 1.77 million shares (or roughly 65% of the current float is short).\n\nBut here's the \"canary in the coal mine\": the open interest.  Market makers were selling calls based on the prior 30 million shares outstanding before last Friday, which means they've potentially sold much more than the entire current float:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/823tys3ci9n71.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=493a7a66e8ffbe60cf7c4ae599e422c9b9779f09\n\nThere's 25k calls for 9/17 between $10 and $12.50.  That's 2.5 million shares.  There's another 8.2k calls for 9/17 between $14 and $15.  That's another 820k shares.\n\n**That means if the stock is over $12.50 by Friday, MMs will need 92% of the current float to meet just September calls.**  **If it's over $15 by Friday, MMs will need 120+% of the current float to meet those calls.**\n\nThat's just September.  Add in those October calls (another 11.8k calls between $10 and $12.50 and another 7k calls between $14 and $15) and you'd require another 1.9 million shares for those...\n\n**So if TMC goes over $15, MMs would need 190% of the current float to account for September/October calls.**\n\n(And as I mentioned above 65% of the current float is short).\n\nI'm gonna be honest, I have never seen a situation like this (because the level of redemptions for recent de-SP ACs recently is unprecedented).  MMs have to keep this pinned under $10 by Friday or all hell will break loose.\n\nEasiest way/lowest risk way to play this is just buy stock (which should go up 200-300% in a \"gamma + short squeeze\" scenario).  September calls are super risky but will pay off in 5/10/15 baggers if the stock actually gets past $15 and rockets.\n\nOctober calls are lower risk than September but should still turn in 4/6/8 baggers if it gets past $15.\n\nPositions: 1000 shares of stock. 250 $12.50 calls, 200 $15 calls for Sept.  \n\nAs always do your own DD, I think this is the most explosive setup ever, but it may just stay pinned under $10 and then the calls are worthless.  Good luck.",

        "selftext": "**The setup**\n\nNike reports earnings tonight for their first financial quarter of 2022 (covering the months June-August 2021). The consensus revenue estimate calls for 12.54bn in revenue (1.6% q-o-q increase), with the highest estimate pegged at 12.9bn in revenue (4.6% q-o-q increase). Estimates call for EPS of 1.12, which has recently been revised downward slightly as people are worried about supply chain issues in Vietnam (more on that later). \n\nNike's brand strength and pricing power is unparalleled among retailers, and I think they will outdo the revenue expectations and see a decent upwards bump in price. Store reopenings in Europe and coastal USA should work in their favor this quarter, while they still benefit from tremendously strong digital channels. \n\nLululemon, a company that is somewhat comparable to Nike recently reported blowout earnings on September 08, so I will be comparing their performance to Nike throughout the DD.\n\n**Store visits**\n\nIn terms of store visits, Nike looks about as strong as Lululemon. While May and June were comparatively weak, according to this data Nike did very well in July and August to make up for it. They outperformed especially in New York and California, while being approximately on par with Lulu in Texas and Florida. According to Linkedin, they have also increased their sales personnel by 3% over the past 6 months, compared to Lululemon which actually decreased their in-store sales personnel by 6% (and still posted great earnings).\n\nCaveat: this is the first time I\u2019m using this data source for store visits, so I\u2019m not sure how reliable this data truly is. It seems to at least match up with other data sources in terms of the peak months for each brand. \n\n \n\n[Source: Safegraph](https://preview.redd.it/30mnepsf3ap71.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f594c93cf7e9e01fb786bc9ea1b77bdd9078e4bf)\n\n**Website visits**\n\nNike has also seen a nice uptick in website hits in recent months. According to Similarweb, their website had a total of 361.5 million from June-August, compared to 330 million in the previous 3 months, for a 10% increase (compared to a 4% increase for Lululemon). \n\n[Source: Similarweb](https://preview.redd.it/h0d8v7434ap71.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e678a285becc8731fa2224b7fc43694bbb99d3d)\n\n**Vietnam supply chain issues**\n\nThe big question mark and story to watch out for will be supply chain disruptions in Vietnam due to Covid lockdowns. [Here](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/16/coronavirus-restrictions-retailers-reconsider-vietnam-manufacturing.html) is a good overview of the topic if this is totally new to you. A lot of analysts seem to be expecting an outsized effect of this on Nike's EPS (as they move towards airfreight to quickly get product out) as well as a potential negative effect on revenue guidance, which has caused Nike to drop about 9% from their recent ATH (in line with comparable retailers with exposure to Vietnam). \n\nNike is one of the retailers most exposed to Vietnam with roughly 50% of their products going through final assembly in Vietnam. Notably, BTIG Research recently published a note estimating a production loss of about 160 million pairs of sneakers, which I think is a big overestimate. If other analysts are expecting the issue to be similarly large, I think the call might surprise analysts to the upside for a couple different reasons:\n\n* Lululemon reported earnings on September 08, already deep into factory closures and had this to say: \n\n&gt; So in terms of Vietnam, we source approximately 30% of our finished goods. And the impact of the Southern Vietnam closure is currently impacting approximately 20% of our second half inventory. \\[...\\]   At the end of Q3, we expect inventory levels to increase approximately 15% to 20% relative to Q3 2020. While this level of inventory can support our increased revenue guidance I'm going to walk through in a moment, it is lower than we had initially targeted due to supply chain challenges. \\[...\\]  We are assuming that Southern Vietnam begins of Phase 3 opening mid-September and that's what's implied in our guidance. \n\nIn short, despite a huge upside revenue and guidance surprise, Lululemon wasn't expecting huge disruptions as late as September 8th. They went into the quarter with about 1.5 months of revenue worth of inventory, the same exact number as Nike. As a huge company and great I expect Nike to have even greater operating leverage and pricing power to mitigate the impacts of the Vietnam issue\n\n* People might be overestimating the impact of the lockdowns on Nike. While they have lots of manufacturing in Vietnam, only 10% of it is in Ho Chi Minh, the hardest hit region. Roughly 50% of their footwear production is located in Dng Nai region, which was comparably less hit, with an additional 25% across Long An, Tay Ninh and Thanh Hoa (the latter of which escaped the effects of Covid [almost entirely](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1103568/vietnam-coronavirus-cases-by-region/).  In fact, the cities of Thanh Phu (biggest Nike Factory in Vietnam) and Xuan Loc (4th biggest factory in the state) were designated as [green zones weeks ago](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/dong-nai-targets-return-to-normalcy-by-mid-october-4355875.html). (Source for their footprint in the country is Nike's own manufacturing map). \n* People might be underestimating the speed of reopening in Vietnam. The government has signaled an end to their uber strict policies in early September. More importantly, they have as of now allowed factories to go back to essentially normal operations provided that their workers have gotten the first jab (yes, just the first shot). Consequently the government has given the first shot to 80%++ of adults in [Dng Nai](http://baodongnai.com.vn/english/society/202109/dong-nai-implements-socio-economic-recovery-plan-3079836/), [Ho Chi Minh city](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/13/1036533872/vietnam-speeds-up-vaccinations-with-over-a-million-jabs-in-hanoi-over-the-weeken) and [other big cities](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-sets-sept-15-deadline-vaccinate-biggest-cities-adults-2021-09-05/), although their country-wide first-shot vaccination rate hovers just around 30%. They have also almost completely foregone second shots so far (with full vaccination rate in Dng Nai at just 4%), which leads me to believe they are hyper-aware of any further economic losses and are doing everything they can to ramp production back up again. \n\n**Risks**\n\nThis is probably one of the riskier plays I\u2019ve posted here since expectations for Nike are actually quite high. The main reason I\u2019m even posting it is that they dropped quite a lot in the past weeks and it\u2019s looking oversold, and the overall market looks strong right now. Don\u2019t bet the house on this one. \n\nNike had fantastic earnings and a huge jump 3 months ago, and is now trading a couple percent above that level. It's somewhat uncommon (but not unheard of) for stocks to have 2 big jumps after consecutive earnings reports. \n\nThe Put-call open interest ratio is skewed towards put, which indicates people are generally bullish. This play more or less goes along with the consensus view, which isn\u2019t always the right move.\n\nSupply chain issues might be worse than I estimate. Even if they aren\u2019t, Nike might decide to lowball guidance to play it safe. I'm not Vietnamese, don't read Vietnamese, and don't know anyone in Vietnam. I have no idea how bad the supply chain issue will be - I am simply making an educated guess based on publicly available English-language sources.\n\n**My positions**\n\nAs usual I have taken a relatively conservative position with ITM calls that expire next week. As long as Nike hits 162 by next week (a 2% move up) I will breakeven.\n\nAn even more conservative play would be to do bull spreads, e.g. by selling puts at strike 155 and simultaneously buying puts at strike 150. As long as Nike stays above 155 you would make max profit. I think this theta play is relatively safe for some small gains, since 2 days ago Nike bounced off pretty hard at 152-153, the same level it reached right after its last earnings call.\n\nA less conservative play would be calls at strike 235 expiring tomorrow. They cost just 3 dollars today, so all of you can participate in this play if you skip the chicken nuggets today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5q222er3ap71.png?width=409&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8461a621bd7324b8604e4813b0d03352288163a",

We always kept crypto out of /r/wallstreetbets because it just isn't what this community is about. With so many people trading crypto now, times have changed and crypto does seem to belong here.  Going into this there was opposition against it and while there were valid points to both sides it's not easy to change someone's mind who stands a hard line.

The Nasdaq-100 tracking QQQ exchange-traded fund [**QQQ,** **0.14%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/QQQ?mod=MW_story_quote) is trading at a 70% premium to its 200-week moving average, the biggest since 1999/2000. \n2. \u201cBlank-check\u201d or special-purpose acquisition companies where investors have no idea what the investment will be. \u201cThe last time SPACs were as big as they are today?

Similar to 1920 and 2000, margin debt has shot to new highs, which is fine until it starts heading the other way.

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone and thank you for taking the time to read my post. Happy Sunday and I hope you all are enjoying this longer weekend. I think this is a very important topic because it will put the minds of every trader together to come out with 5 tickers or at least 3 that have been winners for you this year. This way people that have been negative now, or all year can have an idea of what they can do, or need to do in order to turn the ship around.\n\nWe all have different strategies. I for one am a day trader so my 5 will be extremely different from a long term holder or swing trader. Do to the fact that I am a day trader. I will also list 5 stocks that I unfortunately allowed to go parabolic on me, but indeed I did trade them when they were far cheaper. For myself, I have something called \u201cPlays\u201d this is a special watch list of tickers that I am ready to trade now, that I feel safe, and I select my symbols off of this list. This list is well over 100 tickers. When a stock has gone up far to much, I no longer feel safe about it and do not trade it at all!\n\nPlease try and be honest with ourselves and do not just try and pick the best gainers because this practice is for everyone to watch a new symbol or have an idea of how you played it to be a success. Thank you, share thoughts and please help one another:\n\nMy 5 as a Day Trader:\n\nRKT \u2013 This stock is about 17 dollars, however I have traded this symbol so much that I have probably about 30 dollars in profits. I have traded this all year and even last year as well for 25 cents to a dollar\n\nUWMC \u2013 This is in the same sector as RKT, it stands at just 7.50 but I have traded this for probably close to 20 dollars, for many months I traded this 15-50 cents\n\nTIGR \u2013 This is about 13 dollars, I have traded this all year this year and also last year as well, I have probably 30+ dollars in profits on this one (25-75 cents a trade)\n\nCPNG \u2013 I know this stock is near a 52 week low (I actually have shares at 30.25) but I have traded in and out of this since IPO and have garnered about 50 in profits! (30 cents to 1.25)\n\nCRSR \u2013 I have traded this all year as well, no current position. I traded this as high as 40 and have easily made about 40 on this. (25 cents to 1.50)\n\nThese are 5 that I owned and traded often but they just took off and I could not find myself trading them anymore\n\nBILL \u2013 This has gone insane, I traded this until about 100\u2026 I am actually very negative at these prices, yes, I missed out, but I made a lot on it\n\nMRNA \u2013 I know, I know, but when I was trading this, It was still a bio pharma with no vaccine yet! I actually traded this as low as 30 and stopped at 100\u2026\n\nSE \u2013 I absolutely loved this company and traded it as low as 30-40 all the way to 150 and said to myself this is crazy! Look at it now, jesus\n\nCMG \u2013 OK, I did not trade this within 52 weeks but last March this dipped to 500! I was trading it all the way thru 750. Small blocks of 250 shares\u2026 What the heck are they selling EVs in the back? Mining in the basement????\n\nZM- Boy when covid first hit I was destroying it on this from mid 60s all the way until 150!\n\nI hope this helps others get an idea and thank you everyone.",

        "selftext": "# The Black Swan Cometh\n\nEarlier this month, a black swan flew into the plaza of Tiananmen Square, stirring speculation on what this would symbolically mean. China has already had a rough last couple of months; dealing with floods, typhoons, hailstorms, sandstorms, landslides, and a pandemic to boot. Surely this swan is of no significance right? \n\n[Honk Honk, motherfucker. ](https://preview.redd.it/kyfhdq7nyko71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fb963e892a0b61f496c0c83e31dc4a4a08b11bf)\n\n# The Problem\n\nEnter the Chinese housing bubble. Unlike Americans which diversify into stocks, bonds, real estates etc, China largely invest in real estate. Furthermore, 40-60% of the price of real estate in mainland china is the cost of the land and taxes collected by local governments. This has led to a rapid unsustainable rise in the price of housing in some parts of China.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqil004lblo71.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4439bbf3b4bc31a936197e76c01e547920eb4ab\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5u9t6w8gelo71.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a51ac007bcfb913e4fbdc0245fc76aab77eef494\n\nAnd what does all that get you? Some shit-ass [tofu-dreg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu-dreg_project) construction housing, that makes Haitian building codes look good. Built using concrete that's more reminiscent of dirt, rebar that's more reminiscent of twigs, these buildings were built by developers to turn a profit as quickly as possible, and bought by individuals who seek to sell them at a higher price to the next sucker. This process can perpetuate itself until a catalyst presents itself.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9cukb29oblo71.png?width=553&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c94d9474d77a150b3cb2ce66888aa224a66d1bf\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The catalyst: Evergrande\n\nEnter the catalyst to China's housing bubble, Evergrande: China's second largest real estate developer. On September 8th, Evergrande Wealth, which offers wealth management products to clients in China, failed to deliver interest payment to its clients. As a result, victims and clients have staged large scale protests at Evergrande HQ for several days in a row.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ef3gorv34lo71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78722f8ffcce2762446c593a28534263a7a97b54\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[People take turns talking shit at an Evergrande Wealth exec while some lady is passed out on the floor.](https://preview.redd.it/o8z9f8ckulo71.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6db2ae9c7feec465d0be2169cc0865d534ef4f0)\n\nOn August 31, Evergrande confessed that work on 1.5 million properties have been halted due to delays in payment to its creditors, suppliers, and contractors. After absorbing $7.5B USD in wealth product deposits, Evergrande Wealth purchased $12.4B of junk assets that Evergrande could not sell.\n\n[Unfinished 'ghost city' properties](https://preview.redd.it/6rx9okgpulo71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c474a852f5493b66dcd7e0b7a6241b1bf9f30c7)\n\n# The Problem\n\nEvergrande was due a loan payment today (September 20), but told banks it was unable to pay it. Evergrande is due to pay $83.5 million in interest on **September 23** for its March 2022 bond. It has another $47.5 million in interest due on **September 29** for its March 2024 notes. Being unable to pay any of these loan obligations, Evergrande has resorted to offering it's properties as payment, triggering a fire sale. This is similar to the firesale of mortgage backed securities back in 2008.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/24z895o4clo71.png?width=1885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8435469f9054774085502485c3be757afd303567\n\n# The Contagion\n\nChina Evergrande Group employs over 200,000 full time employees across multiple sectors including real estate, renewable energy vehicles, tourism, sports, finance, and health; and indirectly provides over 38 million jobs across China. Over 1.5m customers / clients have a vested interest in Evergrande. If Evergrande defaults, it could create an unemployment crisis and panic sale of real investment properties, perpetuating the cycle above, popping the bubble. From here, we can reasonably identify the following as potential contagions.\n\n* Holders of Evergrande Bonds maturing soon: HSBS, UBS, Blackrock all have sizeable positions.\n* Commodities / Precious Metals: China is known to hold metal reserves and can/will dump them.\n* Chinese consumer discretionary sector: Consumer discretionary spending in China should fall should a recession hit the Country\n* Chinese financials sector: They are too interwoven into the real estate sector.\n* Chinese real estate sector: Self explanatory.\n* China trade partners (deficit): China has a trade deficit of $140B to Taiwan, $61B to Australia, and $60B to South Korea as of 2020.

        "selftext": "Greetings to the most intelligent people on the planet!\n\nI've been playing with GME and the other charts recently, and it all accumulated into a massive piece of delicious TA,  which I didn't really plan to post to WSB originally - because I felt like some of the honorable WSB residents might be a little tired from that particular stonk. However, after seening [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pppfro/tmc_spotted_the_cock_and_balls_upside_down_head/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pph9f0/as_you_can_see_tmc_is_forming_a_classic_nut_sack/) beautiful examples of intellectual superiority, I just couldn't resist sharing my hard work with you, dear WSB!(If you, dear reader, are the one who is fed up with GME, then I would recommend you stop reading now and follow the two links above to appreciate HQ TA on other stonks).\n\nFor those, who stayed - enjoy the read!\n\nIt all started from my \u201cL'Oreal shampoo commercial\u201d-like hair bet post, where, in its third chapter, I was theorizing about GME's negative beta (particularly in light of the late January events, when the buy button was disabled) and the current general market setup - how it might influence subsequent GME moves. So, I decided to dive deeper into those correlations and deviations between the price movements of GME and other major assets, using January sneeze as the starting point. This led me to a fascinating, tits-jacking discovery that points at the upcoming inevitable volatile price action!\n\nBuckle up for the TA journey of your life, let\u2019s ~~dive~~ fly in!\n\nOh, almost forgot to quote Jack Black:\n\n&gt;\u201cThis is not the financial advice, no.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is just a tribute.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Couldn't remember becoming a financial advisor, no.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is a tribute, oh, to the greatest stonk in the world, alright!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst things first, it\u2019s a good idea therefore to revisit **late Jan events**, which in my opinion was the moment of revelation and a preview of inevitable storm, when:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I. The North Remembers:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GME v VIX v SP, 30 min chart](https://preview.redd.it/yu1zzckpa2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e10bd82e172e82ea16a68da5c9c4a9c3e07f70ff)\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a single day,\n* and injuring SP badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, the thesis should sound something like GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99=SP\ud83c\udd98, and vice versa. It will be developed further in the next chapters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, quoting my bet post here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Pepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Categorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, I should recommend  you reading u/peruvian_bull Endgame series, and/or u/Criand the Bigger Short in order to develop the understanding of the fundamental processes taking place under the hood of the financial markets. To sum up the core idea: the financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standards, it is heading to the next, coming soon, financial crisis. And, in my opinion, what you can see on the charts above, was a sneak peak of the house of cards collapsing. Disabling the buy button was the only option for the big moni guys to stop (or rather to postpone) the system failing miserably. By bringing this dirty trick into play they were able to ~~buy~~ steal some time, which was necessary for deploying emergency measures and urgent market mechanisms (such as new DTCC/NSCC rules) - which, in turn, are aimed at mitigating the inevitable financial hail**shit**storm, ready to hit the fans.\n\nThere is a plenty of outstanding fundamentals DD on that topic (start from clicking profiles in the paragraph above). As for me, I am the TA type of a wrincle-brained ape, so...\n\nLet me speak from my ~~heart~~ charts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# II. Negative beta more beautiful than Catherine Zeta\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's start from something that you must have heard about many times, but did you really dive into GME exceptional beta? So, what's that thing and why is it so negative? For the sake of saving my and your time, let me quote the almighty Inve**stop**edia:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In investing, beta does not refer to fraternities, product testing, or old videocassettes. Beta is a measurement of market risk or volatility. That is, it indicates how much the price of a stock tends to fluctuate up and down compared to other stocks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The value of any stock index, such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index, moves up and down constantly. At the end of the trading day, we conclude that \"the markets\" were up or down. An investor considering buying a particular stock may want to know whether that stock moves up and down just as sharply as stocks in general. It may be inclined to hold its value on a bad day or get stuck in a rut when most stocks are rising; whereas the beta is the number that measures a stock's volatility, the degree to which its price fluctuates in relation to the overall stock market. In other words, it gives a sense of the stock's risk compared to that of the greater market's.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Beta is used also to compare a stock's market risk to that of other stocks. Analysts use the Greek letter '\u00df' to represent beta.Beta is calculated using regression analysis. A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price tends to move with the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security's price tends to be more volatile than the market. A beta of less than 1 means it tends to be less volatile than the market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Negative beta**: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely.\n\nEssentially, negative beta asset is an asset that tends to move in the opposite direction from the general market. Famous precious metal is one of the good examples: gold and gold stocks have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines. That is exactly the reason why investors cherish this asset in the turbulent time of recessions, market crashes and corrections, or general uncertainty and volatility - historically gold tends to perform well during such periods, providing the 'safe heaven' to market participants and acting as a hedge. Noice, but this turbulent time we have something special on the horizon.\n\n\\*\\*Le wild negative beta unicorn appears\\*\\*\n\n[Captain GME to gold](https://preview.redd.it/rpv734w9c2o71.png?width=471&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56080fa590e5ecb6f65ad1a72329cd4d12569014)\n\nMany of you must have seen -\u00df posts, but math and numbers are for geniuses, retards only understand crayons and visuals, so...\n\nLadies and gentleapes, with the great pleasure I present you the new negative beta king:\n\n[GME v SP, daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/iwtaoohhc2o71.jpg?width=2039&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67b2824b31bf155c6f7d5f992c5141f67a82cdfb)\n\nWhat you see on the chart above is a vivid illustration of GME's negative beta behavior, which commenced during/after the January sneeze. As for SP, the stable uptrend with the minor corrections is evident, while the asset is achieving ATHs on a regular basis. Looking at the GME now and connecting its highs with the median line, we may observe the opposite trend, as the line is descending. All in all, there is a big-ass convergence manifesting between the two assets, which most probably will result in the increased volatility and the explosive GME breakout / trend reversal for SP. Who will blink first?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GME v SP daily chart + Tower of Pisa](https://preview.redd.it/3fiwmwwqc2o71.jpg?width=2033&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63ecddcaa4651b946a4df8541409c8d8e547d435)\n\nNext, take a look at this chart. Don't worry about GME's Pisa offset here, as it is insignificant for the point I'm making (and I had some struggles overlaying the charts in this case). If the previous chart indicates a longer term negative correlation, the one above is like a zoom in: there is an obvious series of divergences and convergences highlighted yellow and blue respectively, which illustrate negative beta again, but on a smaller scale and with local trends. As you can see, as soon a GME bullrun commences and accelerates, SP dips, and vice versa. I hope, that the examples provided are persuasive, and that they helped you to reach the same conclusion as I did, namely: sstonk goes up when stonks go down, while when stonks go up, GME is suppressed = GME\ud83c\udd99SP\ud83c\udd98. Should that correlation continue manifesting itself (which I'm pretty damn confident it will), the exciting times are on the way.\n\nOk, so \ud83c\udd99\ud83c\udd98 is a simple concept, but why is it important, you may ask.\n\nWell, that's why:\n\n[SP, daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/6b41eaewc2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9ae4bdc7758ecdbc84425e6ea567e1d4243f9e1)\n\nSP has been forming a powerful bearish technical formation called the rising wedge, through the past year and a half. Currently it is narrowing down, and the point of breakout is not far away - typically it is to the downside for such a technical setup. Add GME with its negative beta to this equation - if you know, you know.\n\n[SP 4H chart, I called it \u2018Head of Penis\u2019 formation ](https://preview.redd.it/sbs9va8od2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce9b57e1a6fa2020ac1c91218ad5d462ceda5d07)\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more!\n\n[SP, monthly chart ](https://preview.redd.it/1goqfoa2e2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3eefcd4720f38907877a2791ea642c3955122b5)\n\nIn one of my TA longwrites, the Big Short 2.0, I identified a beautiful, long term, juicy Elliott 1-2-3-4-5 impulse wave structure on SP, take a look! The investors are currently riding the top of the fifth wave, which is usually the most fun, euphoric and crazily risky. Everything in the nature works in cycles, and all the things that go up, must go down eventually! Considering the current bullrun being one of the (if not THE) most powerful and longest bullruns in history, you can imagine how nasty the retrace may look this time. Especially, when you take into account the fact that current financial markets are filled with shitty synthetic derivatives, excessive leverage of a bad quality, unthinkable level of risk, and... plain fucking crime. The financial world is craving for the correction (like Sahara for rainfall) and a proper bear market, as the deleveraging will make it healthier, and maybe, just maybe, it will bring price discovery back to life from the grave where it has been rolling for I don\u2019t know how long.\n\nMan, I wish there was a safe heaven asset that would protect me from the upcoming financial typhoon, the price of which would move the opposite way from the overdue nasty correction on all financial markets, which have been enjoying the most powerful bullrun in history for more than ten fucking years... Oh, wait!\n\n[Vasco da Gama can\u2019t be wrong ](https://preview.redd.it/gt1rnbz7e2o71.png?width=571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f6db503236cce3d87f8c4511221e8b5e30f91bb)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# III. Chew it Over with VIX\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext, let\u2019s talk about Volatility Index - what I noticed recently, is that VIX is often being neglected in the TA discussions, and in general also, so it\u2019s a good idea to show it some love. Especially since GME and VIX correlate to a considerable fucking extent, but later on that.\n\nTo begin with,\n\n[VIX, monthly chart ](https://preview.redd.it/1fcd3vlge2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78c23f899b3d623552b4b402c0abe74266108223)\n\nThe chart above is provided for the visual explanation of how this instrument behaves. In short, markeds kaboom TWIX wroom wroom. In essence, the Cboe Volatility Index is a market sentiment tracking index that represents the market participants expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. Volatility, or the severity of price fluctuations, is usually helpful to gauge market sentiment, particularly the degree of fear and uncertainty spreading on the financial markets. Investors use VIX to measure the level of risk, fear, or stress in the market when making investment decisions. It is an important index in the world of finance because it provides a quantifiable measure of market risk and investors' sentiments.\n\nAnd who would have guessed, throughout the year VIX spikes have been accompanying almost every single GME major run, but for one:\n\n[GME v VIX, daily log chart](https://preview.redd.it/ksd03p5pe2o71.jpg?width=1969&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=835dee5dd6c8b5367088857995e01a720f41f13a)\n\nJust one major outlier to that tandem is late November 2020 run. Speaking of outliers, also VIX middle of June 2021 spike seems to stand out from the crowd, as there is no relevant proportionate positive price action on the GME side. Outside of those two occasions, the correlational behaviour of these two instruments is evident. Moreover, VIX and GME runs correlate to the extent that their peaks match time-wise in several run ups. Furthermore, take a look at how starting 2021 four out of five major VIX spikes correspond with the occasions when GME\u2019s price action was trialling $230-ish level (margin call level, it seems) - the price territory, around which my concept of the \u2018Purple Haze\u2019 resistance (\u201cbreak to initiate the squeeze\u201d) is established, refer to the short squeezes comparisons post to explore the concept. The correlational behaviour described above, to my understanding, points at two big conclusions: the first and the most obvious one, is GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99; secondly, it seems that GME is currently the biggest risk for the market! - too much synchronicity is present between the two, for this to be a mere coincidence. Remember, VIX represents volatility, fear and stress - wut feelin Kenny?\n\nOh, and did I mention?\n\n[VIX, daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/q0hb68xue2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcfaadcd5304e1c57307f4b954759dd402f33f8)\n\nDuring the year and a half, the instrument\u2019s price action has been consolidating into a beautiful bullish formation, called the descending wedge - which is exactly the opposite of what SP is consolidating into. VIX descending wedge + SP rising wedge + GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99SP\ud83c\udd98, quick math, and\n\n[We get an ape\u2019s best friend, Gator the Bubbles Deflator \\(the Greater\\).](https://preview.redd.it/2fzj2pdye2o71.jpg?width=2032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecbdb4676a65c16dee75b9d3613fde91cecf7335)\n\nIf you know, you know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# IV. This is the tits-jacking part. Achtung! You have been warned!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, that was quiet a TA journey. I hope that the discussion above helped you to build the solid understanding of what's happening on broader financial markets and how those correlations and tendencies are affecting GME price action, and will probably add the fuel to the rocket in the upcoming major GME moves. Now, the focus of the discussion is back on the GME current TA status quo! (yeah, finally!) And, what can I say, it is so fucking juicy!\n\nFirstly, let me remind you about this TA of mine, which aged like a fine wine:\n\n[GME, daily log chart ](https://preview.redd.it/ibiauo96f2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4645e967977f6c91ad71f07546993dc6140fda1)\n\nThe log chart support above proved itself to be an ape's ultimate best friend! As you can see, during the year, each time the price action approached the lower support, a sharp re-bounce followed - August and September confirmed the price line as THE most important support, manifesting the steadfast buying pressure. That pressure is currently confronting the most important resistance for GME in 2021 (magenta line). The battle will be legendary! (Hint: remember the current market setups discussed in II, and III, and the correlations? Based solely on that, what do you think the GME breakout will look like?)\n\nBut wait, there's more!

Retardos love triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarnate the flattening of the price accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is theatre stonk\u2019s price action after the breakout. \\*\\* GME: \"Hold my beer\" \\*\\* I'm pretty much convinced, that the triangle on GME chart above is how the Mother Of All Triangles must look like.\n\nButth waaitt, therrz moooore!

        "selftext": "The [dunning-kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) effect is a psychological phenomenal measured in humans, where unskilled people fail to recognize their own incompetence. Not just general intelligence but incompetence in individual fields. \n\nIf you haven't beaten the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you got a bit unlucky. If you've managed to beat the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you're an investing god. That ego can make you broke, and now is the time for a humility check. \n\nYou're in this subreddit. If you're reading this, do you think you're better than the top investors out there- Burry, Dalio, Wood, Buffet? Well, maybe you are, but statistically, you're probably not. \n\nSo, what do the top investors say lately? Here's my interpretation:\n\nBurry: We're in the biggest speculative bubble of all time in all things.   \nAssets under management (AUM): $635 million\n\nDalio: US Bonds are crap, US equities are frothy, tech is bubble-ish. Get into emerging markets. China isn't so bad.   \nAUM: $140 billion\n\nBuffet: I'll reduce my positions and wait for a better entry.  \nAUM: $632 billion\n\nWood: Innovation will lead to enormous GDP and productivity growth over the next 5-10 years.   \nAUM: $53 billion\n\n=============================================\n\nIf you've been following financial news this year you probably know that Burry started shorting TSLA back in Dec 2020 and has been crying wolf that we're in a bubble since this spring. Ever since then the market has gone up a lot. Doesn't that make him wrong this time? Not necessarily, no. In fact, that means we might be in an even bigger bubble than we were earlier this year. Luckily for him, seems like he learned from last time to hedge his shorts too, and bought FB and GOOG calls in case the market continues to rocket, which have printed hard. \n\n Speculation is at an all-time high. Look at this chart of subscriber count for WSB:\n\n[I'm guessing most of these new subscribers aren't YOLOing on OTM SPY puts every week.](https://preview.redd.it/50kiiie6zbn71.png?width=3010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c4c7817c548515eae1823cc2f0e986565522ea9)\n\nTake a look at this chart of TSLA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhh5i2tfzbn71.png?width=2492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c354ae8100a048cf81176d619ddaaa5f51b4dda\n\nAnd compare it to the standard asset bubble chart here:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hngourvbycn71.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9175668887dbb1f5639fd54ce395c38865b0a879\n\nNow with fundamentals way off, TA lining up, and lots of possible macroeconomic issues in the near future, this looks to me like a great setup for a short. Now of course, nothing is certain in the markets. BUT, if the bubble is about to pop, this could be the trading opportunity of a lifetime. That's why I'm going short. \n\n\"Burry is a value-shill permabear\"\n\nBurry was long on a bunch of equities at the bottom of the pandemic last year, he bought GME at $5. [https://www.yahoo.com/now/michael-burry-doubles-money-3-174031896.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/michael-burry-doubles-money-3-174031896.html). He has consistently beaten the market in bad years and good years too. \n\n\"Burry is smart but he is wrong about TSLA\"\n\nIf you won't follow Burry, then how about following Wood?[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/09/09/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-110-million-in-tesla-stock-as-insiders-also-dump-shares/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/09/09/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-110-million-in-tesla-stock-as-insiders-also-dump-shares/)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/technology/cathie-woods-ark-funds-bought-246-million-coinbase-shares-2021-04-15/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cathie-woods-ark-funds-bought-246-million-coinbase-shares-2021-04-15/)\n\n\"Cathie Wood gives TSLA a $3k price target\"\n\nWood, Dalio, and Buffet have such high AUM that their positions can be highly illiquid. That is, even if they knew they positions were overvalued, they aren't always able to get out of before causing panic in the underlying. For this reason, you always have to take what they say with a grain of salt. Wood, who is a brilliant investor, would obviously not say that TSLA is overvalued, same that Dalio will not say that BABA is a risky stock to hold. It's a perfect case of \"do as I say, not as I do.\" So instead of listening to what they say, which is always going to be biased, try looking at what they do. \n\nAnd lately, Wood has been selling TSLA. When the **bulls start selling**, it might be a good time to get out. \n\nTSLA JAN 2022 670 PUT\n\nThis is not financial advice, do your own DD.",

        "selftext": "Lehman brothers was a critical part of the financial system that, when it went down, caused credit freezes that domino'd into more financial crisis. Due to the nature of their business, it makes sense them blowing up could really domino, but..\n\nEvergrande is just a real estate developer. Investors will get screwed, sure, but how can this really cause financial dominos like in 2008? The bears seem really excited about this and keep posting articles and charts about how BLK and other US and international firms are the biggest bagolders. But when I look further into this I see that these firms are hardly exposed. It's pennies in their portfolios and probably less than they'd lose on a bad 1 minute candle in the equity markets.\n\nThey quote the $300b worth of bonds that will be worthless, but that's not that much to the global economy, realistically. More wealth is destroyed on a bad day for $AAPL. Additionally these were junk bonds for a long time. Were not talking triple a mortgage bonds that were \"too big to fail\" and unsinkable like the titanic.\n\nThis all also assumes that the chinese government will sit on their hands and watch a crisis unfold, when that seems super unlikely. Say what you will about the CCP, but they're not gonna let all their stellar economic growth crumble when they have:\n1. More power and political will than the US did to tackle such a crisis\n2. The ability to plan their economy to recover from any domino effects unlike more \"free market\" economies \n3. Knowledge of previous global housing crashes/financial crises to draw from\n\nMaybe I'm an idiot but I just don't see how anybody should think this will cause a serious bear market in the US or elsewhere. Chinese stocks are already beat down hard so I can't see those selling off too much more either. I'm inclined to buy the dip if it keeps dippening into this week.

        "selftext": "Ever since GMREEEE this sub has been filled with people from r/all calling for the end of payment for order flow for a variety of reasons.  Now the front page has a news article talking about how the SEC chair is thinking about ending payment for order flow.  I just wanted to say that if you're against payment for order flow there's probably a 95 percent chance that you don't know what a call condor spread is.  PFOF gives you no or reduced commissions and also makes the options market more liquid.  Here are some arguments against PFOF that I've seen on this sub:\n\n1. HedGe FuNd GiVe BAd FiL.\n\n       In reality you can set the price for what you want your options to be filled at.  This can be done by making a FUCKING LIMIT ORDER.  There is probably not a single professional option trader that buys or sells options with a market order.  Options are, by their nature, illiquid on a majority of underlyings given that you have thousands of combinations of strikes and dates to choose from.  Again, especially if you trade spreads, you should be placing limit orders for your positions.  Also, if you remove PFOF this liquidity issue will only get worse.  This is just the reality of gutting several billion dollar firms that write and buy options.  Less money in the options market means less liquidity.\n\n2. HooDgE FunD ManiPuLaeT MarkET wItH my OrDeR InForMatIoN\n\n       I can right now go on my think or swim platform and scan for options orders under 10k (or however large you want) and look at the bid/ask spread to tell if this trader bought or sold these options.  If I really wanted to I could go into the API and make a robot that does this for me and organizes all this information into some sort of bullshit spreadsheet.  Small orders like these (the kind retail makes) provide a reasonable guess as to where retail is positioned.  I'm just some jack off wsb troll with a think or swim account and I have already laid how how to detect retail positions.  If I can do it then the big dogs certainly can do the same even without payment for order flow.  \n\n   One more thing: If you lose money on your 10 delta put it's because it was a bad trade, not because some Algo picked out your 5 lot position and spent millions of dollars manipulating the market to shake you out of your 200 dollar position.",

        "selftext": "I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t seen any explanations on WSB (at least in recent months) about how the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust works, and how it helps to fuel the epic short squeeze going on in Uranium right now.\n\nThe physical trusts offered by Sprott are closed-end funds, meaning that when investors sell the fund, Sprott does not have to go out and also sell Uranium to fund outflows.\n\nIn other words, once uranium hits the Sprott vaults, it might as well be declared retired forever. \n\nThey are structurally diamond handed, which is important for a short squeeze to continue.\n\nSo how does more metal enter the fund?\n\nSprott has filed an \u2018at the money\u2019 share offering where they can issue new shares of the fund any time it trades at a premium to the fund\u2019s net asset value.\n\nEssentially whenever investors get excited and bid up the price of the ETF such that that shares are being bought for more than their underlying value, Sprott will issue new shares, sell them into the market (which helps bring down the premium), and then use this cash to buy more uranium for the fund.\n\nIn the span of a month investors already added enough uranium to the fund to exhaust Sprott\u2019s $300 million offering.\n\nLast week they filed a new offering to increase it from a $300 million program, to a $1,300 million ($1.3 billion) program.\n\nWhile this filing process has been ongoing the past few days, Sprott has not been issuing new shares. So inflows into the fund are driving up the premium to NAV.\n\nThe premium now sits at a record high 28.5%.\n\nFor perspective, during the Uranium surge that took price from the $20s to the $40s over the past month, the typical premium for the fund was in the mid single digit %s.\n\nSo 28.5% is absolutely remarkable. This is a dam about to break and drown everyone who lives on the other side. Once Sprott is able to issue shares once again, it will now be able to buy more uranium out of the market than anyone thought possible. $180-$200 is entirely possible here as a blow off top (currently at $45 a pound).\n\nAnd this is a minuscule market, so sprott\u2019s buying directly drives the price up. And because market participants know the price of uranium is effectively guaranteed to rise because of this guaranteed source of pent up demand, they are are willing to pay for the premium in the uranium fund to get a piece of the action. \n\nThis of course only drives the premium of the fund up further, allowing Sprott to issue even more shares, buy even more uranium, sending the uranium price up further, exciting more investors who will buy the fund, and the cycle repeats \n\nThis is effectively a short squeeze where the buying is being telegraphed ahead of time. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the short squeeze has begun, but buying here is the equivalent of buying GME a when it was in the $50-$100 range on the initial surge.\n\nSo what tickers can be offered up here? \n\nNot many, because the uranium space is tiny and WSB has a $1.5 billion market cap minimum.\n\nOptions? You can, but premiums are absurd now that the squeeze has already begun.\n\n$CCJ is one ticker you\u2019ve likely heard of, and it\u2019s the only one with mkt cap large enough to mention directly.  \n\nSprott Uranium Trust is the vehicle I\u2019ve written about here where you can buy uranium directly (rather than miners), and directly contribute to the squeeze, but I also can\u2019t post the ticker yet due to mkt cap concerns. It\u2019s also only available in Canadian and otc markets, but Sprott is trying to get it listed on the NYSE as well for the future. You can buy it via Fidelity and a few other brokers right now though. \n\nNorthshore uranium etf has lots of miners in it but a mkt cap of $350m so no ticker\n\nWant to sell shovels rather than set out on a mining adventure yourself? Sprott the company owns the uranium trust driving this whole thing and collects fees from it. Benefiting from the inflows into the fund as well as the underlying price appreciation of uranium.  They also have direct exposure to several uranium miners they\u2019ve invested in. They also aren\u2019t big enough yet at $1 billion to post the ticker.\n\nThis uranium short squeeze, powered by the Sprott physical trust is everything the silver squeeze should and could have been back in the first quarter.  If silver squeezers had bought the Sprott physical fund, PSLV, rather than ishares SLV, silver would be far higher now. Let this be an example of what\u2019s possible in commodities when physical demand overwhelms a relatively limited supply of available metal!",

These small 20-5 cent fighhts each day dont mean shit to me.\n\nAnother example , tesla oh shit its been inthe 600-700 range for a while , idc cause im holding for a few years.\n\nInvesting is buying into a company that you believe due to dd is going to be worth more over the long run and you  **dont give 2 fucks about the daily /weekly price battles.** \n\ntrading on the other hand is = whats the catalyst? Trading is in my opinion figuring out what the catalyst us and using that catalyst ti your advantage.\n\nHere let me put it like this spce had a catalyst which was that launch thing(space mission) . Tradrers bought a position before the launch and after the launch they sold off. Really it was right b4 the launch actually happened. But you see what i mean. \n\nShit nvidia had a stock split announcement , thats a catalyst for traders to buy lots of shares of it and sell off on the split date.  Again trading on a catalyst .\n\nShit the catalyst could be a TA for instance netflix was trading in a 500-600 channel. When netflix dropped close to its support traders bought into it as it bounced off the 500 support and ran back to the 600 resistance ... yall see?\n\n**Trading is finding a catalyst for a stock and then figuring out how it will effect the stock price in the short term and using it to your advantage.**\n\nTHis isnt financial advice.

        "selftext": "Cam across this today:\n\nTrading memestonks on your phone is all fun and games -- that is, until you get slapped with an $800k tax bill.\n\nHow? If inexperienced traders run afoul of the \u201cwash sale rule,\u201d taxes could outweigh gains.\n\nA what sale?\nA wash sale is when you sell a security at a loss, then buy it or a [\u201csubstantially identical\u201d](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substantiallyidenticalsecurity.asp) security 30 days before or after the sale.\n\nThe wash sale rule means you can\u2019t take a tax deduction on that loss. It\u2019s to stop people from using wash sales to increase tax benefits, but you can trigger it without even knowing it exists.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\nYou buy 100 shares at $10/share for $1k\nLater, you sell them at $7/share for $700 -- a loss of $300\nThe next week, you repurchase them at $6/share for $600\nDue to the wash sale rule, that loss is added to the cost basis, meaning your $600 repurchase becomes $900.\n\nWhen you sell your shares again, your original loss is applied to the adjusted cost basis. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll use on your taxes.\n\nSo, how do you get an $800k tax bill?\nThat example\u2019s an outlier, but the unidentified retail trader told financial advisor Brian Wruk he did it by going berserk on Robinhood, per [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaharziv/2021/03/26/robinhood-trader-may-face-800000-tax-bill/?sh=4792a11a67c7)\n\nThe man opened a Robinhood account in 2020. He put up $30k, but Robinhood gave him $90k on margin. He then did 10 to 50 trades daily.\n\nHe ultimately:\n\nGenerated $45m (yep, million) in gross proceeds\nProfited by $45k\nHad $1.4m in capital gains tax\nAnd a potential tax bill of $800k+\n\u201cHe booked a profit but was disallowed all the losses because he never once waited the 30 days on those stocks to book the loss,\u201d Wruk said.\n\nAnd short-term gains are taxed like ordinary income. Yikes.\n\nThe moral of the story: Let your stocks marinate at least 30 days, lest you become a cautionary tale!\n\n\nAnother article: https://mullooly.net/800k-taxes-45k-profits/",

        "selftext": "This post is going to be about why IRNT presents one of the greatest squeeze opportunities that WSB and retail investors have ever seen. Because the company has only been trading for 2 weeks, it's hard to analyze technicals other than volume. Thankfully, the short interest and float are the main reasons why this stock presents such a great opportunity, so those will be analyzed below.\n\n**\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Investing is risky and high short interest plays are even riskier. You should talk to a financial professional before making any investment decisions and should do your own research\\***\n\n**Short Interest Stats and Analysis**\n\nTo put it simply, the short interest on IRNT is absolutely insane. Combine that with the fact that it's a newly trading company (and susceptible to more volatility) and has a VERY low float, and you have a recipe for an absolute slam dunk.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at Fintel and iBorrow desk. iBorrowdesk has consistently shown the borrow fee to be over 500% and the available shares to be far below 10,000. Similarly, fintel has consistently showed less than 1,000 shares available to borrow. Though some people don't trust these sites, the similarities in the data help to add credibility\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qubmtqnjxjn71.png?width=1270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e966aee1e3deb1b3f19bb4edfebeb4090e3bb1a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yuuj6skkxjn71.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97cbe756d2845006ddb0c35e624032935587c4a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0vhzl9lxjn71.png?width=986&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=082680490a232aa61f456c8a4492050d51e5baef\n\nI'd also like to turn your attention to [this post by another WSB user](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/). This post analyzes how the extremely low float of this stock due to it being a new stock and the insane option OI presents the opportunity for a legitimate gamma squeeze - not some fake hype run up - a legitimate gamma squeeze similar to GME's first run up.\n\nIf you look at websites like Baron's they'll tell you that the SI as a % of the float is only 1.79% (about 700,000 shares). This is correct but doesn't tell the whole story. Because of redemptions and lockups, the actual float is 1.3m shares, which makes the real short interest on tradable shares about 56%. Interestingly, [Ihor's tweet](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1437512870351282177?s=19) shows that the borrow fee is asininely high, which again shows the difficulty of borrowing of this stock and thus the easy possibility of a short squeeze. 56% short interest is an amazing number in and of itself, but that's not the whole story. The thing about this stock that really gets me going is the options activity. The OI on options of this stock is absolutely bananas right now. Remember when I said that there are about 1.3M tradable shares due to it being a new stock post-merger? Well, at a $20 price, almost double that amount is held in ITM calls alone. THAT is why the stock has serious gamma squeeze potential. Remember, both the GME and VW squeezes happened because ITM options OI outnumbered the float of companies that were already heavily shorted - this is the power of a gamma squeeze. Most meme stocks that have been \"squeezing\" recently have been small short squeezes due to retail traders and HFs taking advantage of social sentiment. The reason that we haven't seen a violent squeeze recently is because there hasn't been a stock with options activity like this - until IRNT.\n\nAdditionally, you probably saw that the stock went up to almost $40 last week out of nowhere. Again, this is the power of a low float stock with high ITM call OI. If this stock starts picking up, the low float and call OI could propel it to meme stock legend status.\n\nFurthermore, data from ortex has also consistently shown a SI of over 300% and a cost to borrow over 500%, which is consistent with the sources listed above. Yes, the SI is definitely a plus, but again, the real power here is the gamma squeeze potential.\n\n(The above four paragraph's were heavily borrowed from the originally linked user, so please check out his post).\n\nMany people will probably not believe some of these shorting numbers and will consider them unreliable because of how new the stock is. That's understandable. However, if you're in that camp, let me present to you this: the NYSE's regulationSHO FTD list. Per SEC regulations, stocks that reach over a certain amount of FTDs are placed on regulation SHO's threshold list. This is a very small list and identifies stocks that are grossly over-shorted (FTDs being the evidence of that). GME was on this list for a very long time before it squeezed. So if you don't believe the websites's SI numbers, then you at least have to believe the NYSE's numbers about FTDs. When a stock has too many FTDs, it means that it is extremely hard to locate shares and repay borrowers, which is a sign of over-shorting. Here is the NYSE list:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z5q0vbtmxjn71.png?width=2710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e76c960abd9f88936b898b3dbebbf5d82519a9cb\n\nNotice the second to last one? DING DING DING. Though being on the threshold list signifies overshorting, there is yet another thing that we can take from this - forced covering. IRNT has been on that list since 9/2. Per regulationSHO, after 6 TRADING days on the list (9/10), stricter location requirements for shorting are put in place. Take a look at the giant green uptick that we saw on 9/10. 13 TRADING days on the list and forced coverings start taking place where a market-maker is subject to fines and loses his or her market making abilities if this regulation is violated. 13 TRADING days after 9/2 is 9/21. Remember all of those call options I talked about above, well they will be exercised on Friday 9/17. So, let's review what we have: an extremely high reported short interest (you can believe it's 600%, 300%, 56%, whatever), an extremely low an restricted float, ITM options expiring on Friday that outnumber the total float, the stock being on the threshold list indicating over-shorting, forced coverings taking place right around when those options would have to be delivered. Again, this is exactly what we saw with GME. It's important to note however, that this is also an issue of timing - the stock is likely to have a gamma squeeze sometime late this week and through next week. After that, there's a good chance that covering could lead to the stock being taken off of the threshold list.\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nThink that IRNT is just a squeezable meme stock with no long term potential as an investment? Wrong. The stock is not like most meme stocks - it actually is a good underlying business. According to an article by a website not allowed on here (just copy and past the quote in google to find it), \"With the company\u2019s international expansion, M&amp;A initiatives, and cloud acceleration, under my most optimistic case scenario, the company is worth $55 per share. If IronNet continues to sign agreements with nation states and companies like CrowdStrike did, I believe that the upside potential is significant.\" The article discusses how the company's AI initiatives, cyber security focus, and cloud acceleration, all of which are some of the most important and up and coming technology sectors, poise it to go up in value significantly. Additionally, the company also just reported earnings. Though the earnings were lower than expected, take a look at the after hours activity - the shorts have no juice left.\n\n**Conclusion/TL;DR**\n\nSo there you have it. in my opinion, IRNT is an EXTREMELY good stock fundamentally so I will be holding it long term. HOWEVER, the stock also presents a rare gamma squeeze - short squeeze opportunity that retail hasn't seen since GME. The stock has an extremely high reported short interest, an extremely small float, open interest on ITM call options that outnumbers the current float, is on the regulationSHO threshold list indicating that it has extremely high short interest and possible naked shorting, has been on that list for a significant amount of time, and the ITM options that outnumber the float are expiring right around when shorts would be forced to cover their FTDs. In other words, an absolute grand slam.\n\n**\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Investing is risky and high short interest plays are even riskier.

Investors (Debtors) would have purchased these credit default swap contracts for Evergrande.   \n\n\nNow, apparently this week is full of holidays for China - so TOMORROW, when a good chunk of China is back to work AND when China is expected make an announcement as to whether or not they will SAVE Evergrande or let it default, THEN we  will find out how the markets truly respond to this catastrophe.  \n\n\n**What would be the effect of the credit default swaps on the rest of the financial markets?** Obviously, we don't know who the insurers are, but I'd imagine that that insurer is probably issuing securities out of its pooled credit default payments.

        "selftext": "**\\*\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Investing in plays like this is extremely risky and you should do your own research or consult with a financial advisor prior to making financial decisions\\*\\***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello everyone, yesterday I made a post about why I think IRNT is one of the best opportunities retail has ever seen. Generally, this post got very good reactions but there were definitely some people who said I was retarded and that the play was dead. Though I definitely am retarded, the play is clearly not dead. Now that I have your attention about the potential of IRNT and you've seen SOME of it's potential, I'd like to discuss the stock more.  \n\nFirst, I wanted to link the recent DDs of IRNT that have been on this sub: \n\n[My recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/poe2gb/irnt_is_the_one_of_the_greatest_opportunities/)\n\n[The post I referenced in my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/)\n\n[An update to the above post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pobzn6/update_irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_273_of_float/)\n\nThere are probably others as well but these are the ones that I based my DD off of\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Summary of the IRNT play**\n\nIRNT recently started trading. Websites are reporting a short interests of 56% 233% and all the way up to 550%. Websites like iBorrowdesk and Fintel are consistently reporting less than 1000 borrowable shares. Because of redemptions and lockups, the float is extremely limited to about 1.3m shares. Unlike most stocks in this position, the stock has options that would only be available to a stock with 10x larger float. Additionally, the amount of options that are ITM and are expiring ITM on Friday outnumbers the total float. In most stocks on this sub that have squeezed, short interest has been the only factor. This stock, however, is similar to AMC and GME in that it has a disgustingly high short interest AND the ITM options expiring on Friday out number the float. That is why this stock has the highest squeeze potential since GME and AMC. Additionally, the stock is on NYSE threshold list, which indicates that it has too many FTDs, which is further evidence for this play. Very few stocks make it on this list and it is a sign of over-shorting. The stock has been on that list since 9/2 and, per regulationSHO, forced deliveries of FTDs will begin next week. The aligning of forced delivery of FTDs, option delivery, and an insanely low float presents a unique opportunity. There has been some confusion as to whether this play ends on Friday or if it goes into next week. The answer is unequivocally that the play goes into next week - that will be explained below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Next week is the real play**\n\nThere has been great confusion about this play regarding the lockup period. I have had several people message me and comment saying that the lockup period ends on Friday, which would allow more shares to come into the market and would end the play. This confusion comes from how people have interpreted point 1. of u/stonkgodcapital first post:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6v7id3mcrpn71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=278bdafec942c361184281add312aa739542f170\n\nI have talked to the user to clarify this and have done my own research to ensure this is accurate. When I talked to him, he confirmed that he was saying the redemptions and lockups will keep the float at 1.3 million AFTER options expire Friday. He was not saying the lockup ends on Sept 17. He was saying that the float will remain small WELL AFTER options expire this week, so when options must be delivered next week and the float is still small, a squeeze could happen because the shares that must be delivered outnumber the float. I also did further digging. I could not find a single source that said ANYTHING about more shares being added to the float anytime soon, lockups ending soon, etc. I looked at [IRNT's form 8-k](https://docoh.com/filing/1777946/0001193125-21-263381/IRNT-8K) and found that the lockup ends 180 days after August 26, 2021. This makes sense because that is a typical length for SPAC lockup periods. So, in case you did not understand: THE LOCKUP DOES NOT END FRIDAY AND THE FLOAT WILL REMAIN MINISCULE NEXT WEEK WHICH WILL ALLOW A SQUEEZE TO HAPPEN.\n\nTherefore, the real play here is next week because: the float will still be small, shares will have to be delivered next week and the amount will outnumber the float because of the current OI on options expiring Friday, and forced delivery of FTDs will also occur next week due to the stock being on the threshold list since 9/2. HOWEVER, because of the low float and high Reddit interest, I do expect this stock to continue trending up for the rest of the week - so we very well could see extremely high prices come friday but I still believe that next week is when we see the peak.\n\nWhat happened last week was after IRNT initially popped, then people lost interest, so it fell back down. Today, the stock got more interest and absolutely took off - that's the power of a low float stock. However, this stock presents a special opportunity because it has a low float AND the number of ITM options that could be exercised next week outnumbers the current float of the stock - that's why this is one of the best opportunities WSB has ever seen. If this stock continues to gain traction, there is nothing that can stop it because of its low float. \n\n**Earnings**\n\nIRNT also reported earnings yesterday (it's called a surprise earnings and is because it's newly trading). The earnings report showed a wider than expected loss. An earnings report of that kind should make the stock go down or, at the very least, be flat for the day. Being up 20%+ makes no sense, so the only explanation is that the squeeze theory for this stock is correct. Please note that this is a side bar and has basically no bearing on the play - I just included it because earnings happened yesterday. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIRNT is the first play since GME and AMC to have a disturbingly high short interest, extremely low float, and ITM options expiring in the near term that outnumber the float. This stock has both short squeeze and gamma squeeze potential. It is important to note that the lockup DOES NOT end on Friday, it ends 180 days from August 26. Because the lockup does not end soon (keeping the float small), ITM options will have to be delivered next week, and regulationSHO will require delivery next week, this play GETS BIG next week - we will probably see more gains this week, but next week is when it gets real. \n\nI am still in on the play and have no touched my position since yesterday. See my previous post for a screenshot of my position. I plan to hold all of my shares until well into next week. Depending on price action, I may sell my options for deep OTM calls at an earlier horizon to take advantage of next week's price jump. \n\n**\\*\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.

        "selftext": "Chewy is an e-commerce retailer of pet food and supplies, mainly active in the USA. Last quarter they posted USD 2.14bn in revenue from 19.8 million customers (600k of which were new additions). For Q2 they project 2.15-2.17 billion in revenue for a very modest 1% q-o-q growth. \n\nI think they'll outdo their (very conservative) revenue guidance, but fall short on customer additions for the quarter and revenue guidance for the following quarters. Chewy is currently trading at the upper end of its historical P/S ratio, (save for a brief time in Jan/Feb 2021 when it was even higher than today). It\u2019s P/S of 4.76 is relatively high for its industry (as it is a low margin retailer, not a platform business). It\u2019s actually higher than Amazon, which I would argue is too high to make sense and I expect a short-term downside re-evaluation of Chewy after earnings.\n\n**Reasons**\n\n* **Competition catching up**\n\nThe key investment thesis for Chewy has been \"Fast-growing pet e-commerce industry\" and \"growing faster than its competition in its fast-growing industry\". I believe the second reason may be moderating. While Chewy is the clear market leader, I'm seeing several signs that its competitors (in both e-commerce and retail) are slowly catching up. Walmart (biggest brick and mortal pet retailer) just reported a big revenue beat. Petsmart (brick and mortar focused) is looking to increase revenue this year following a bad 2020. Petco reported great earnings two weeks ago. \n\nThese good results could be because the overall market (\"pet ecommerce\") is expanding. I don't think so. The market expansion took place in 2020, the number of adopted pets is on a clear downtrend. If most other big players are doing quite well, I suspect they are doing so at the expense of Chewy. \n\n* **Low net customers additions**\n\nIn Q1 2021 Chewy added a net 600k customers, their lowest absolute increase in two years. I expect them to report even lower additions this quarter as they follow up Q2 of 2020, their biggest quarter of customer additions ever. 1 year is a very typical \"cliff\" during which many former customers start to churn (according to Chewy CEO Sumit Singh). Since they haven't increased their marketing spend significantly this Q, I expect high churn and low gross additions, which is a bad early sign for growth companies. \n\n[Customer additions per quarter](https://preview.redd.it/dkmcffawmxk71.png?width=799&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5521fbd76802f34cacbc31617550af9f34177b9e)\n\n* **Moderating growth rates in a fast-growth industry**\n\nChewy's app store rankings in Q2 have been at its lowest level since February 2019. Who downloads apps from the store? New customers, usually. Remember the part where I think they will have unexpectedly low gross customer additions this quarter?\n\n[Petco App gaining ground on Chewy](https://preview.redd.it/z5yvwgzjnxk71.png?width=1616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38c746658cf948bc19a514b436ada7ed21cc071a)\n\nPetco is clearly aggressively promoting their app which is currently nearly as popular as Chewy's. You can see how their spikes coincide with drops in Chewy's ranking, leading me to believe that Chewy is losing more business than usual to its competition.\n\n* **Profitability**\n\nWhile profitability is less relevant for Chewy, on Q1 earnings they were relatively sanguine about their expected costs for 2021. Since then I expect hiring, material and logistics costs to have gone up quite a bit, which might result in them offering a more pessimistic profitability guidance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary: Chewy has achieved a high PS ratio thanks to its promise of outgrowing its competitors in a market that is already fast-growing in itself. I believe their competitive advantage is eroding ever so slightly and will result in earnings that Wall Street doesn't like. \n\n**Short interest**\n\nChewy currently has what I would consider a relatively large short interest considering its relatively strong fundamentals. As of August, 16.4% of the short was floated. Make of that what you will. \n\n**Risks**\n\n* A lot of Chewy customers actually use autoship, which may distort the data I'm looking at and allow them to surprise to the upside on revenue\n* I do all my shopping for my pets on Chewy\n\n**Positions**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpekcjdcpxk71.png?width=331&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6c05b0d43d825435b4e3ef664c4ca05d062dd67",

        "selftext": "Are we done?\n\nNo, of course not.\n\nDidn't have time earlier, but wanted to explain how shorts are actively attacking your options positions and in doing so leave themselves open to future regulations. \n\n**Post summary (tldr)**\n\n\\- Shorts attempting to knock price below strikes are hurting themselves when the MM(s) hedge.\n\n\\- Short interest at 49mil should be understood next to the 97mil float of which 86mil shares are owned by institutions. This means that short interest in **500% larger** than daily trading float.\n\n\\- CTB is increasing significantly, by multiples now and the result of which is likely FTD regulation.\n\n**Short strategies**\n\nWe're seeing the same pattern after hours currently that we saw the last couple days.\n\nShort playbook\n\n1. Destroy momentum by shorting any perceived breakout (there were net 1.2mil shares shorted today). \n2. Market sell huge orders to encourage strike breaking and selling to also achieve this.\n\nBut... Didn't work so well, because when price moves beyond the strike threshold, the MM(s) generally choose to hedge their risk. This is well known, but I took some crayons to draw the picture to make it easily understandable.\n\n[Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/v2fao3x355o71.png?width=3219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98447970ab5457d1f0ede10d79d3e2433eaf40bf)\n\nThis is happening after hours right now. I'm curious what will end up happening here. Short's goals are to knock it down below $6.5 by market extended close at 8:00pm set to render calls useless. From the looks right now, seems like it's not working.\n\n**Constrained float**\n\nThis is why I'm extremely bullish. Stupidly bullish.\n\nTurns out institutions own so much of the float that the actual daily trading float is only 1/5th the size of the amounts of shorts. That's right. **There are 500% more shorts than typically available shares to trade**.\n\n[Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/ck4kijx555o71.png?width=1509&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f40592f07ad91ef0d443411775a8ba135b09f33)\n\n**Total float: 96,000,000** (Bloomberg)\n\n**Institution shares: 86,000,000** (Bloomberg)\n\n**Actively traded float: 10,000,000**\n\nRead that again. There are 10,000,000 (10mil) shares generally traded unless an institutions offloads which happens rarely.\n\n**Shorts: 49,000,000** (Ortex)\n\nYou read that right.\n\nThere are 49mil shares compared to an actively traded float of 10mil. Literally 5 to 1. 500%. This is insane. So what will happen to price? Nobody knows - but here are the price levels. Price moves quite quickly between stops since high frequency alto's run this all.\n\n[More crayons](https://preview.redd.it/hftm51m755o71.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f877a0800068d845c31bed37258c33e7fc5ce2b0)\n\n**Future FTDs?**\n\nAlmost assuredly. CTB is spiking - this means there is extreme demand for shorts and limited supply. FTDs are when shorts are lent to sell short but aren't actually available in the Dealer's inventory to deal out. When this happens enough, securities are placed on the [FTD regulation list](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=RegSHO) which means significantly more restrictions and forced closeouts - highly bullish to price.\n\nHere's the chart of CTB. \n\n[CTB spike](https://preview.redd.it/mkxzrfq855o71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d71c3b9894accd2aa6819d4bfcabef1f286432c)\n\nThis is beginning to move from linear to exponential and implies severe pressure on dealers to keep up with demand. In my opinion, it's a short amount of time before this happens.\n\nIn tandem with the reg SHO list comes our favorite short squeezes (GME, AMC, IRNT, SPIR, etc etc etc). Except this company has 80% institutional holdings and no lockups expiring... Think you can see where I'm heading here.\n\n**Positions**\n\nAlready submitted my positions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppf22c/sdc_80k_yolo_45million_short_shares_aint_no_joke/) and have additionally bought 8,000 more shares at $6.72.\n\nCheers folks",

There was a lot of uncertainty whether China is shutting itself off from foreign capital and how it could lead to delisting of ADRs like BABA, BIDU, JD, PDD, NIO, etc. But I guess they won't be turning their heads away from foreign investors anytime soon.**\n\nBEIJING, Sept 6 (Reuters) - China will further open its capital markets to foreign investors, the country's top securities regulator said on Monday, adding that it will pursue pragmatic cross-border cooperation to regulate overseas-listed Chinese companies.\n\nGlobal investors have been spooked in recent months by a flurry of Chinese regulations targeting sectors ranging from technology to private tutoring. U.S. plans to kick non-compliant Chinese firms off American exchanges has fuelled concern.\n\n\"Opening-up and cooperation is the inevitable trend in the integrated development of global capital markets,\" China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Yi Huiman told a conference organised by the World Federation of Exchanges.\n\nChina is studying further measures, including expanding the scope of the stock connect scheme linking China and Hong Kong and improving the Shanghai-London Stock Connect program, Yi said in a speech posted on CSRC's website.\n\nMeanwhile, CSRC will conduct \"pragmatic\" cooperation in areas such as supervision of overseas-listed Chinese companies, cross-border auditing and law enforcement, he added.\n\nYi said that given interwoven global markets, governments should abandon the mentality of a \"zero-sum game\", as companies and investors share both the boom and the doom.\n\nGlobal financial centres should facilitate cross-border financing, \"rather than become the platforms and tools governments use to sanction other countries\", Yi said, without mentioning the United States.\n\nYi's speech came a day after CSRC vice chairman Fang Xinghai made similar pledges to further deregulate China's markets.\n\nChina will expand the channels for foreign capital to invest in Chinese securities and futures markets, and will further facilitate the issuance of yuan-denominated \"Panda bonds\" by foreign institutions, Fang told a separate conference on Sunday.\n\nChina will also improve domestic listing rules for overseas entities, as well as regulations on overseas listings of Chinese companies, Fang said in a speech also posted on CSRC's website.\n\nFang also vowed to safeguard Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre, saying that Beijing supports domestic companies listing in Hong Kong.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-will-improve-opening-up-capital-market-securities-regulator-2021-09-06/",

        "selftext": "Perhaps a lot of us here hold some GME (myself included) because you believe in it, or just want to hop in on the fun. But I'm having trouble finding logical answers to basic questions regarding the theoretical squeeze. It's a cult over in superstonk and GME subs, can't get straight answers. \n\nThe squeeze theory at it's core hinges on hedge funds needing to cover a massive short that includes millions of synthetic Gamestock shares. When it eventually must reconcile, the share price will moon to 5K, 50K, 500K etc. Per share. Some even believe a single share could reach millions of dollars. (!) \n\nMy question I can't seem to get an answer to is: who actually pays this theoretical megafortune out? If billion or trillions are owed to cover, the hedgefunds go under. The market makers go under, and there's a domino effect. The US economy tanks. Is that the idea? Or the gov steps in for a bailout, which at this scale also would be a catastrophic event. Either way, what would the USD be worth in those scenarios, even if you had millions of it. \n\nDo apes truly believe the endgame is something like this? Or am I missing something...",

        "selftext": "A lot of people said Tesla is an \"AI\" company, not an electric car company from this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjlah0/disney\\_is\\_to\\_netflix\\_as\\_x\\_is\\_to\\_tesla/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjlah0/disney_is_to_netflix_as_x_is_to_tesla/)\n\nThe thesis is that Tesla is far ahead in its self-driving capabilities that other car makers just can't catch up. And because they already have cars on the road now, they are collecting more data which is making their lead wider.\n\nMy thoughts are below. Agree or disagree?\n\n* Self-driving tech will be a commodity, not concentrated in a few\n* Carmakers who can't create their own will license it from third parties like Waymo, Cruise, Aurora, and [40+ other companies.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/autonomous-driverless-vehicles-corporations-list/)\n* If 40+ companies are looking to create this tech, it shows that self-driving is hard but still doable for so many companies big and small. This is an indication that there isn't any moat in self-driving capabilities.\n* There is actually a Udemy course on creating a self-driving car. No, you can't take this course and then create an autonomous car on the road. But it is a sign that self-driving capabilities will be a commodity that many companies will have. There isn't a Udemy course on how to create a Facebook competitor with billions of users. That's moat. Self-driving doesn't have moat.\n* I live in San Francisco, and Cruise, Waymo, Uber (before they sold their unit), Apple, and a few others have been testing self-driving cars on the road for 4-5 years. It's very common to see a self-driving car (with a driver) on the road here that is not a Tesla.\n* Regarding data gathering advantage: Companies can gather data without selling cars. Waymo has been doing this for a decade. No car company is going to release self-driving software expecting it to have deficiencies and expecting data gathered from consumers to fix those deficiencies. This isn't like a beta app. It's life and death. No one wants to be in a beta self-driving car.  All self-driving cars will meet a minimum standard due to regulation.\n* If any company is way ahead in self-driving, it's actually Waymo, not Tesla. They just launched a self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, a dense city with weird roads and many pedestrians.",

There wasn't an announcement of the earnings, so there wasn't really a warning they would be dropping this evening. This honestly doesn't change anything as this isn't a fundamental play and I wouldn't look to deep into AH movements on a low float stock like this. $IRNT will very likely resume it's run tomorrow unimpeded.*\n\nSince my last post the percentage of float claimed by institutional obligations has increased from 213% to **273%** as of close today with short interest (as of the last numbers) taking up 56% of the float and options ITM OI accounting for 217%.\n\nThe intraday movements of the past two days have indicated that tomorrow will likely be the \"start of the squeeze\". So with that, I offer some price targets should this start to run tomorrow (these are peak targets). I personally expect it to start running tomorrow and hit peak either Thursday or Friday, more-so weighted towards Friday.\n\nLikely Guaranteed: **$29**  \nLikely: **$40**  \nIf everything goes right: **$135**  \nIf it matches other squeezes: **$210**  \nIf it goes to the moon: **$530**\n\nTake these price targets with a grain of salt. The only two that should matter right now are the first two, once those are broken, the others become more relevant and probably *more likely* very quickly.\n\nAs I said in the other post, this situation is highly unusual and the low float on this stock enables it to run really fast and really hard when buy volume comes in. This also makes this play very risky so only partake with money that you can afford to lose.\n\n**Good luck and godspeed gentlemen.**\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise.",

        "selftext": " \n\nI've been following $IRNT since the post market jump when it went from $16 to $40 in AH. It had seemingly been written off despite the fact that it's been primed for a gamma squeeze at almost every moment since it came down from that run to $40. To be clear, this is a real gamma squeeze, not a meme-y play. This is a rare situation and that's why I'm calling attention to it.\n\nThe setup is simple:\n\n1. The float is currently 1.3M shares due to SPAC redemptions &amp; lockups and will be at this number until after options expiry on Sep 17th.\n2. It has options, which usually are only available for stocks over 7M float\n3. Almost 200% of those 1.3M shares are claimed by the already ITM open interest on the call options. This means that the squeeze has ALREADY been set in motion and you're just waiting for time to draw closer to expiration. The movement we saw Friday is what we refer to as a \"pre-squeeze\" movement, there is likely far more to come.\n4. On Friday the $20 strike became ITM and instantly doubled the amount of the float that is claimed by the open interest.\n5. As of this morning ORTEX shows 4.3M shares shorted which amounts to 336% SI with a cost to borrow of 628% on average. I have doubts about the accuracy of this specific data because that would put the amount of the float claimed by institutional obligations nearing 600%, so I'll stick with saying that the last reliable data seemingly had SI at around 13% with the same elevated cost to borrow.\n\nIf $IRNT runs, it could potentially be the first true infinity squeeze since VW and has the potential to beat the heights of $ORGO &amp; $GME.\n\n$IRNT will very likely start running some time before expiration on Sep 17th. It could be today, it could be Thursday, but at some point, the buy volume will likely come in and the IV on the options will spike to crazy heights almost instantly.\n\nBe warned, this play is incredible risky, if you choose to partake only do so with money you can afford to lose.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise.",

        "selftext": "This journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn\u2019t believe. I turned around and said \u201cSir\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that **last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food\u2026he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.** This conversation was just 3 weeks ago. \n\nSo\u2026when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I\u2019m not joking\u2026**at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high.** I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. **I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices.** Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nThe dollar index after J. POW\u2019s Jackson Hole Speech. \ud83d\ude02 https://imgur.com/a/hiN5OFy\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\n**This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.**\n\nHere is one from Thursday, September 2.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PE0F6F5\n\n**$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here**\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026but how was that even theoretically feasible? It\u2019s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why\u2026\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\n**Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!**\n\nFor fucks sake people, **THIS IS HUGE!!** This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n**\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d**\n\n**Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has an impact on some companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026** \n\n             Wall Street\u2018a High Expectations\n\nSo far, 88% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet.\n\nThe strong results put the S&amp;P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. \ud83d\ude33 So\u2026. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings\u2026.which I guarantee that will happen\u2026 it\u2019s going to be an earnings miss galore. \n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\n**So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.**\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nI like this one better compared to the DOW 30. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/cvYyXsB\n\nThe lumber/gold ratio **HAS PLUMMETED** in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\n**In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.**\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\n**They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you.**\n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\n**Let me be clear\u2026I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it\u2019s going to collapse our financial system possibly\u2026also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant \u201cMu\u201d and mass evictions will soon begin\u2026**\n\n**Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.**\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**This is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks.** https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\n**Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak.** https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don\u2019t get me started on the mass evictions as well\u2026and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities\u2026 The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.**\n\nNow\u2026**my positions.** Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\n**Short term:** sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\n**Long term:**\n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It\u2019s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. **There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS.** You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I\u2019m wrong) \n\n**My last position:**\n\n**$2,500 in Cash.**\n\nSimply put\u2026**cash is a position.** People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies\u2026 my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me\u2026 I already have my shopping list ready. \n\nGood luck out there guys. **Timing this is almost impossible**\u2026but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It\u2019s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!\n\n**The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a \u201cBlack swan event\u201dby purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs. Solid gold bars\u2026Let me remind you that they deal with information.**\n\nI\u2019m not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me, I\u2019m saying that maybe it\u2019s time to scale back a bit on the margin, move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big. Don\u2019t forget Sleepy Joe is going to raise long term capital gains tax, possibly very soon, from like 20% to as high as 43.4% if you make over $1m\u2026 another bearish catalyst for the market\u2026 I literally could go on and on guys\u2026. It\u2019s pretty obvious at this point\u2026we\u2019ll at least to me, but what do I know, I just got out of prison last December. \n\nEdit:\nTLTR: just read the bold shit\u2026",

Ark Invest is one of them. Though to be fair, the company is also a large Tesla shareholders through its investment funds.\n\nThis week, they released a new note claiming a $3,000 base stock price target by 2025 for Tesla. Cathie Wood said about the price target during an interview with Yahoo Finance: \u201cOur estimate for Tesla\u2019s success has gone up. The main reason for that is their market share. Instead of going down from year-end 2017 to today, it has actually gone up fairly dramatically,\u201d In its valuation models, Ark Invest believes that Tesla is going to deliver between 5 and 10 million vehicles as soon as 2025. That\u2019s a significant ramp considering Tesla likely will deliver less than 1 million vehicles this year. The firm is also betting on Tesla delivering a completely autonomous ride-hailing network, known as Tesla Network, that is going to bring in a lot of money with high margin.\n\nIn an email to Tesla employee obtained by Electrek, Elon Musk shared with employees Ark\u2019s new $3,000 price target and that he agrees with Ark: \u201cIf we execute really well, I agree with Ark Invest.\u201d A $3,000 share price would put Tesla\u2019s valuation at $3 trillion and make it the most valuable company in the world. \n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nSince Ark\u2019s new note was an update on their valuation model and price target, it is fair to say that Musk\u2019s email is basically a direct comment on Tesla\u2019s stock price. He believes that \u201cif executed really well\u201d, Tesla should be worth $3 trillion within the next 4 years.\n\n[https://electrek.co/2021/09/04/elon-musk-tesla-tsla-worth-3000-share/](https://electrek.co/2021/09/04/elon-musk-tesla-tsla-worth-3000-share/)",

        "selftext": "Quick summary: Evergrande is a real-estate developer from China that has $305 billion of liabilities and cannot pay of their debt. They are not the only company though, other real-estate companies are also facing liquidity problems and it looks like the property bubble in China is collapsing. Right now, the Chinese government is doing what they can to control the situation (allowing them to default on loans, setting a price floor on property). [https://www.reuters.com/business/fitch-says-possible-china-evergrande-default-may-have-broader-effects-2021-09-15/](https://www.reuters.com/business/fitch-says-possible-china-evergrande-default-may-have-broader-effects-2021-09-15/)  \n\n\nGiven this scenario, how would you try to make a play here? There are 3 possible outcomes here: (1) Chinese government bails them out; (2) Chinese government step in and guide them to deflat slowly; (3) Full collapse.  \n\n\n(1) I think this is unlikely as there are too many real-estate companies in financial difficulties right now to bail all of them out successfully. Also a bit uncharacteristic of the government to do so.  \n\n\n(2) I believe this is the most likely scenario, but that would transfer the burden onto banks (both Chinese and international) as they will not be getting repayments for their loans to Evergrande. Would shorting bank stocks be a good idea here?  \n\n\n(3) Unlikely for now but could happen if scenario (2) goes badly. If so, the entire Chinese market will be bearish, so $YANG might be a good choice here.  \n\n\nAny other ideas they you can think of?",

        "selftext": "Fellow Degens,\n\nChill the fuck out and read.\n\nThe unique situation of $IRNT and $OPAD, is exactly that, extremely unique.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\nStock Redemption: Redemptions are\u00a0**when a company requires shareholders to sell a portion of their shares back to the company**. For a company to redeem shares, it must have stipulated upfront that those shares are redeemable, or callable. ... Shareholders are obligated to sell the stock in a redemption.\n\nShort Interest: Short interest is\u00a0**the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out**. Short interest, which can be expressed as a number or percentage, is an indicator of market sentiment. Extremely high short interest shows investors are very pessimistic (potentially overly-pessimistic).\n\nGamma Squeeze: The gamma squeeze happens\u00a0**when the underlying stock's price begins to go up very quickly within a short period of time**. As more money flows into call options from investors, that forces more buying activity which can lead to higher stock prices.\n\nPublic Float: Also known as public equity float.\u00a0**The portion of a company's outstanding shares that is in the hands of public investors**, as opposed to company officers, directors, or stockholders that hold controlling interests. These are the shares that are available for trading.\n\nWith that out the way, lets dive into why $IRNT and $OPAD is so unique and why this play is so rare.\n\nBoth $IRNT and $OPAD have had a stock redemption. Not a small redemption but a fucking massive redemption. $OPAD for example has around 92% of the public float that\u2019s redeemed.\n\nWhat\u2019s being shown as \u201cPublic Float\u201d on a lot of stock analytics websites is not the actual public float of $IRNT and $OPAD.\n\nThe number of shares that have been redeemed has reduced the current public float of $IRNT to 1.3M and $OPAD to 3.4M. A lot of post already explain the $IRNT redemption, but for $OPAD you can view this redditors post who explains it perfectly. The 8-k and definitive proxy agreement are hyperlinked in his post. So, I wont go into details on my post about the public float as it\u2019s already been written here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/pjn5rw/opad\\_the\\_despac\\_madness\\_continues/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/pjn5rw/opad_the_despac_madness_continues/)\n\nNow, with all this information what does this mean?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$IRNT](https://preview.redd.it/cwm8315r3yn71.png?width=2523&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c66c71d744939897af61b916b1a823dca320848)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$OPAD](https://preview.redd.it/wi6jl06t3yn71.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f6824257eba4ddd5f5c022661e875a166c12e9f)\n\nAs you can see, 764.21k is shorted for $IRNT. 764.21k /1.3M = 58% SI%.\n\n$OPAD has 3.72M shorted. The actual float after redemption is 3.4M. 3.72M/3.4M = 109% SI%.\n\nJust to clarify with everyone, these short interest percentages are on the low end. The actual float is anticipated to be shorted by a lot more than just these simple calculations, but this is easy math you can calculate on the open lagged data on the inter-web.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the Option Chain. Before I jump into that, let me explain something very important, 1 contract = 100 share. If an option contract is in the money, the holder of that contract must exercise their contract, if they do nothing and the contract expires, the broker will exercise that contract on their behalf. So, for every call option written that\u2019s in the money, those contracts will be exercised.\n\nWith that being said, look at the options contract for both of these stocks. Look at the open interest on the call options. \n\nSpecifically, $20, $25, $30, 31, $35, $37, &amp; fucking $40! For $IRNT and $15, $17.50, $20, &amp; fucking $25 for $OPAD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$IRNT](https://preview.redd.it/i6n9p44w3yn71.png?width=1758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e13c934ca372ef9e68339b4b4c7a1b32f619ea60)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$OPAD](https://preview.redd.it/9n0oa1ux3yn71.png?width=1780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43013db7d88ee6662cfdd363d6929bd09f82b57c)\n\nQuick mafs = MM &amp; SHF are seriously fucked. \n\nStop stressing out, yes, this is a high-risk trade, but an extremely unique, rare, and high probable odds that this will turn into exactly how we all think it\u2019s going to turn.\n\nThis is in fact a very high risk to high reward trade. As always, trade at your own risk. But for those who really wanted to see the full-blown potential here, I hope this helped.\n\nThis can very well turn out to be far larger then we can imagine. If a perfect setup was to occur the equation would look like this. \n\nSmall Float + High SI% + High OI% + About to expire ITM = Bananas ... well guess what two stocks have this equation completed?\n\nI\u2019ll see you in Valhalla ladies and gents.\n\nMods, for the love of trading, don\u2019t remove my post.\n\nTL;DR \u2013 You need to read the whole thing.

        "selftext": "TMC (The Metals Company) is a recent \"de-SPA C\" that started trading on Friday. It's a deep seas mining company with a market cap of $2.35 billion with 245 million shares outstanding (current price in the $9 - $10 range).\n\nThe key here though is that 231 million shares are locked up at least 6 months and the 11 million Pipe shares are locked for at least a month (but perhaps longer because 2/3 of their PIPE didn't pay up).\n\nOkay, so why dow we care? Here's why this is potentially one of the most explosive stocke we've ever seen this week:\n\nThe curren float is 2.72 million becasue 91% of the original 30 million shares redeemed for cash.\n\nThe short interest is around 1.77 million shares(or roughly 65% of the current float is short).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut here's the \"canary in the coal mine\": the open interest. Market makers were selling calls based on prior 30 million shares outstanding before last Friday, which means they've solde much more than the entrie current float.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are 25k calls for Friday 17 of september between $10 and $12.50. \n\nThat's 2.5 million shares. \n\nThere's another 8.2k calls for Friday 17 of september between $14 and $15\n\nThat's another 820k shares\n\n**That means if the stock is over $12.50 by Friday, MMs will need 92% of the current float to meet just September calls. If it's over $15 by Friday, MM's will need 120+% of the current float to meet those calls.**\n\nThat's just September. Add in those October calls (another 11.8k calls between $10 and $12.50 and another 7k calls between $14 and $15) and you'd require another 1.9 million shares for those...\n\n**So if TMC goes over $15, MMs would need 190% of the current float to account for September/October calls**\n\n(And as I mentioned above 65% of the current float is short).\n\nI'm gonna be honest, **credits to** u/....**,** it is his DD, but it got deleted due to the market cap. Now the market cap is large enough fort r/wallstreetbets.\n\nI have never seen a situation like this (because the level of redemptions for recent de-SPACs recently is unprecedented).

        "selftext": "\nThis journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn\u2019t believe. I turned around and said \u201cSir\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food\u2026he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.\n\nSo\u2026when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I\u2019m not joking\u2026at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high. I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices. Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\nThis was yesterday, Friday, September 3. \n\n$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026but how was that even theoretically feasible? It\u2019s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why\u2026\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\nAm I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!! \n\nFor fucks sake people, THIS IS HUGE!! This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d \n\nI can\u2019t make this shit up. I started writing my DD before they posted that article, before that you could only find a Seeking Alpha article that you have to pay to read\u2026 I discovered this off of my live updates of Bloomberg news. I\u2019m actually having trouble trying to find the article I originally read\u2026I wish I was joking. Whatever\u2026weird. \n\nGross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has a DIRECT impact on companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026\n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\nSo investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nThe lumber/gold ratio HAS PLUMMETED in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\nIn simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\nThey reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you. \n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\nLet me be clear\u2026I personally don\u2019t believe the delta variant has anything to do with this. I don\u2019t want to get politics involved in this post but it is imperative for me to do so but if I do I\u2019ll go down the rabbit hole in the post will probably get taken off. \n\nSince the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs. \n\nNo big deal right? \n\nThis is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks. https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\nMedian American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak. https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\nI mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. \n\nNow\u2026my positions. Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\nShort term: sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\nLong term: \n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It\u2019s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS. You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I\u2019m wrong) \n\nMy last position:\n\n$2,500 in Cash.\n\nSimply put\u2026cash is a position. People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies\u2026 my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me\u2026 I already have my shopping list ready. \n\nGood luck out there guys. Timing this is almost impossible\u2026but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It\u2019s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!",

This was expected (for a change, lol) and the shares are subject to lockup.*\n\nSince my last post, the percentage of float claimed by institutional obligations has risen from 273% to **479%** of float.\n\nToday we saw movement confirming an active gamma squeeze. Tomorrow, after a gap up, should be the first day of ***full squeeze*** movement to be compared with AMC on 06/02 and GME on 01/26 with a peak occurring on Friday.

        "selftext": "I have been avidly learning the great minds of WallStreetBets and have gained extensive knowledge on investing, risk management, and portfolio growth. WSB has introduced me to the great world of options, and it has completely changed my life. \n\n**Pre-WSB**\nI am ashamed to admit\u2026 but I used to be a\u2026 *Boglehead*. In my early investing days (~5 months ago) the dinosaur Vanguard lentil eaters told me it is *impossible* to beat the market. They all accepted an early defeat that they\u2019ll never be rich, so they default to 6% yearly returns and averaging into the occasional 40% crash. Rather than risking my money on something *totally risky* like Apple (which holds $300B+ in cash and literally only goes up), I should own Apple and 5000 other companies that nobody knows or cares about.\n\nUnfortunately, these boomers convinced me and I threw my entire portfolio into VT and BND. \u201cOwn the market and you will get rich\u2026. when you\u2019re 500 years old\u201d. After holding for 2 weeks and losing 1.3%, I sold all my shares and started a new adventure. \n\n\n**Learning from WSB**\nAs I came to WSB, I saw a skilled trader lose $100k in seconds. His life: destroyed. In the next post, I saw another investor make $100k in seconds. His life: changed! I was in awe. The Bogleheads made me lose 1.2% of my account and told me to \u201chold for the next 60 years\u201d. Meanwhile I saw someone make 10,000% in a few minutes on some SPY calls. So I did what any logical person would do and opened a Robinhood account. I promptly applied for options, and Vlad personally gave me approval. He told me that life in Bulgaria was very difficult, but through options he was able to get out of the poor eurozone and into the United States. \n\nMy first trade was a massive success. I made 20% on an SPY call. I made 3 years worth of the Bogleheads dream in minutes. These losers can\u2019t compete. In the subsequent few months, I have 100x my account. Through a series of 0-1 DTE SPY calls, I have found great success trading complex financial derivatives that I do not understand. It\u2019s amazing. My life has been changed and I cannot thank WSB enough. \n\n\n**THANK YOU**\nI would like to thank WSB for fundamentally changing my life. Not only have you made me 100x richer, but you have taught me the importance of risk taking. I would still be a Vanguard boglehead loser if I didn\u2019t discover the power of 0-1DTE SPY calls (I do not buy puts since they\u2019re anti-American \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udcaa). If WSB was not filled with such intellectuals, I would have not trusted the numerous great DDs.\n\nThis leads me to my question:\n**Why doesn\u2019t everyone trade options?**\nI don\u2019t think it makes sense to buy and hold something for DECADES and hope for a 100% return after 20 years. I have made 100x in 3 months and could not imagine how pathetic I would look still holding VT and BND. I have leveraged all my accounts through a series of all in trades. I now have a Tesla arriving soon all thanks to the YOLO and WSB. \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t everyone do this?! It seems like free money.",

        "selftext": "Uranium.\n\nSure, there are no flashing LEDs like CRSR adds to all of their products, but that\u2019s because we don\u2019t need it. Uranium already glows in the dark! (No, radioactive things don\u2019t really glow in the dark. You have to mix trace radioactive material with a fluor to do that.)\n\nMaybe Uranium isn't as sexy as some over-hyped under-developed threadmill with an iPad glued to it that kills babies, and it is lacking in buzzwords like \"cloud data analytics,\" but uranium is energy. And everything we do takes energy, and this is the cleanest, densest, most likely candidate for the immediate future. There are already big incumbents in energy that need to get shouldered aside, so this will be a slower play than the up 50% in a week flavors of the month (which then fall 90%), but this is the real deal. With calls you can still get that 50%, or 500%, but shares will take some time. That said, many of these names are up 15% in a week, just barely OTM calls up 500%. That's not exactly [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/).\n\nUranium has a serious bull case of ahead of it. A new fund is in town (Sprott) who is buying up all the physical uranium. Get ready to gap up. Yes you have heard some of this before, and I peddled Uranium a full on year ago, but this fund is a market mover and it changes everything.\n\nSorry if you saw this quickly deleted multiple times. F'ing automod.\n\nTLDR, 1) since 2019 supply has been below demand for uranium as the market continues to deal with a supply overhang and over-investment by miners from the previous market cycle. COVID then reduced supply by a further 30% through mine closures that have continued for 2021 and the supply overhang is finally gone. 2) More nuclear reactors are being built worldwide than decommissioned, developing nations have hopped on board the nuclear train, and 3) if any country is serious about getting to carbon neutral then the only realistic avenue is via massive expansion of the nuclear fleet. Lastly, 4) there is a new physical trust (Sprott) busy buying up all of the uranium and driving up the spot price. It\u2019s working.\n\nUranium spot is $34.60 right now, 2007 was $137. That\u2019s a lot of upside baby. Oh, and did I mention that the Uranium market is small? Tiny. Super tiny. WSB could blow this thing up. There isn\u2019t an entire industry of traders, hedgers, and dilatants (that\u2019s a nice way of saying degenerates) trading U like there are for oil or other commodities.\n\n**1. The Setup**: Uranium is already on a 5 year trend line of tendies\n\nUranium has been in a bear market since 2007. It started to finally sell through the over supply and over investment of the last market cycle and has been climbing from its low of $18.50 in 2016. This was already a 4 year trend line, and then COVID came along.\n\nCOVID changed the uranium market in two main ways. First, it dramatically reduced global supply by about 30% in 2020 and 2021 due to mine closures by many of the majors and juniors. These closures have allowed the sticky overhang from the last decade to finally get put on the spot market. Second, there appears to be an OPEC+ of uranium forming. Miners, no doubt still traumatized from last time they aggressively expanded productions, are not opening new minds even as spot prices surge. Instead, they continue to provide quarterly guidance that they are operating below capacity for the rest of the year, and are selling old supply instead of starting new mines. They aren\u2019t formally a cartel like OPEC is, but there seems to be some game theory going on here. It is miner\u2019s best interest to try to exactly match the demand of U on a global scale and then be able to dictate the price. Since fuel costs are just 2% of the operating costs of a nuclear reactor, utilities can also stomach significant increases in spot prices without effecting their generation rates of \\~ $.02/KwH.\n\nU is $34.60 right now which is 75.24% below its peak in 2007. In a market with all-time highs all over the place, U has a long way to run. What will miner prices be if U hits $100+ again? Massive.\n\n**2. New Demand**: Global demand has outpaced supply\n\nPlanned Reactor Starts in Gross MWe of new capacity (from world-nuclear.org)\n\n* 2021: 5,711\n* 2022: 13,559\n* 2023: 13,276\n* 2024: 7,569\n* 2025: 5,112\n* 2026: 6,997\n* 2027: 4,100\n\nCredit Suisse offers their own global view of supply &amp; demand here. Get your sunglasses on as this assumes the US fleet is shrinking into 2030. That likely won\u2019t be the case. See comments #1, automod doesn't like my links.\n\nFirst, if you are from the US then you are likely biased against nuclear. Get over it. The US has a very old fleet and has been periodically retiring plants rather than performing maintenance. I\u2019ll get back to the US later, but the global view is very, very positive. Globally, many developing nations are starting to add, or start, a nuclear fleet. It\u2019s cheap and it doesn\u2019t pollute. India, Slovakia, Belarus, and Pakistan all have new plants started or starting in the next year. France continues to expand and sell energy, while China seems serious about cutting CO2 emissions and is massively expanding their existing fleet, as well as breaking ground on the world\u2019s first SMR earlier this year.\n\nSo back to the USA\u2014the US mostly acts as a drag. A reactor in New York just closed, and others throughout the country are always wavering on edge of retirement. This is set to change, but it depends upon politics, so we\u2019ll see (and the right likes nuclear too, it\u2019s not just about CO2). The Secretary of Energy is committed to keeping every single US plant operating as it prepares to transition to a fleet of fast breeding, small modular reactors (SMR\u2019s) in the \u201clate 2020s, early 2030s.\u201d (this just means highly fuel efficient with far, far less waste, and reactors the size of a 3-4 story apartment building instead of a city block. Each will power 500,000+ homes, so they can be \u201cclose\u201d to cities they power and also reduce infrastructure costs.) She is working with legislatures to allow all currently operating plants to essentially receive carbon credits as an incentive for utilities to keep the plants running and well maintained until the SMR roll-out.\n\nYes, this is a long horizon for the US, but the US is only one part of the uranium market and a very minor part of this bull case. Globally, supply/demand are already tight, and the world fleet is slated to expand. Utilities can see the writing on the wall and will want to start placing orders now for future delivery (spot market for Uranium is quite different from other commodities\u2014purchasing, delivery, enrichment, and feeding take years. You can bet these utilities are looking at supply/demand graphs and already panicking. Spot is going to start gapping up instead of ticking.\n\n**3. Green Energy**: The Elephant in the Room\n\nNuclear power is the greenest mass-scalable energy on the planet. Hydro destroys entire riparian ecosystems, wind and solar are both CO2 heavy in terms of manufacturing and are slow ROI on the carbon expenditure as well as having short functional commercial lifespans, while geothermal is quite literally tied to very specific locations (OK, I don\u2019t know anything about tidal, but other than reading about some plans being nixed by NIBY Boomers I\u2019m not seeing it either).\n\nThese renewable forms of power generation have another cost: land. Aside from geothermal, these are not power dense generators. Here is an article working through the cost in land to electrify just British Colombia\u2019s transport grid. The takeaway is that nuclear wins by a landslide: 2.4 m2/kWh versus solar\u2019s 36.9m2, hydro\u2019s 54 m2, and wind\u2019s 72.1 m2. If you want to electrify the US transport grid then you can either build some nuclear plants, or convert all of Nevada to a giant solar farm. I mean, what is Nevada good for anyway?\n\nNumbers on energy density coming from here: damn you automods, see comments for links.\n\nThe latest generation of nuclear plants, SMRs, are small and safe. They can be built alongside cities to save CO2 and money that would otherwise go into infrastructure. How many more fires are we going to see every fire season as PG&amp;E and other utilities run millions of miles of hot lines all over the country? This too is a cost of the current way to locating and distributing energy. This all changes with SMRs, and all for the better.\n\nBiden has made some surprisingly strong claims about aiming the US at net zero, and we\u2019re hardly a climate activist country. If this happens in other countries, and perhaps the US, then it means we are looking at hundreds upon hundreds of new nuclear power plants in the next two decades, not just the few dozen currently in the planning stages over the coming 2020s. This will be the renaissance of nuclear, and it is coming.\n\nThink about it. If there is any chance in hell of reducing carbon emissions, then nuclear is the path forward. Everything else is a half measure.\n\n**4. The Dinosaur in the Room**: Sprott Physical Uranium Trust\n\nThis is a new fund from an old hand in physical trusts. Sprott\u2019s Physical Uranium Trust (U.U \u2013 Canadian listed, NYSE coming in \\~4m) purchases uranium on the spot market and then warehouses it. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the whole plan. This is gigantic.\n\nAs shares of U.U are issued Sprott takes that money and buys uranium, which increases their NAV. So long as they have a premium to NAV they keep buying. They\u2019ve only been buying physical uranium for two weeks now, but **they\u2019ve already purchased 13.3% of the estimated global uranium production for all of 2021**. Read that sentence again. 20.59m lbs of the projected world supply of 154m lbs. Jesus Christ are these guys a market force to be reckoned with. How is this not illegal?\n\nLook at spot price versus their holdings. They march up and up in tandem. Spot has gone up 7.1% in the last month, with all of those gains coming within days of when Sprott started buying.\n\nSee comment link for google spreadsheet of Sprott and spot rate.\n\n**5. There are short sellers here**\n\nSome entities sell naked uranium deliveries. In a market as slow moving and opaque as uranium is this probably seemed like a good idea at the time. How much of a factor would this be? I don't honestly know. Uranium is not like other commodities with all their nifty reporting and data. We'll find out?\n\n**Positions or Ban:** OK, we know you all just skipped to the end anyway\n\nGo long anything uranium.\n\nMiners/Exploration:\n\n* CCJ\n* NXE\n* Google as many are too small by marketcap for me to list here, but they are mostly small for a reason\n* U.U (This is Sprott. Buy this, but only if Canadian. Imagine what will happen when this gets NYSE listed in 2022!)\n\nURA: ETF of major and minor miners, equipment production, all things uranium\n\n*Options*:\n\nAs we all know, there are only a few times when dealers work with your play instead of hedging against it, and one of those is when you buy far OTM calls. When you buy a far OTM call the dealer will also purchase or adjust their position matching your direction.\n\nSo, if you are buying calls (I would recommend calls *and* shares) then far OTM calls skew delta in our favor.\n\nThat out of the way, the Uranium market is slow, but Sprotts has started to speed things up.\n\nURA 10/22 $25c is about as high as I would go without going longer dated.\n\nAfter that, June 2022 $30+ is cheapish. No doubt you will all ignore this and buy something idiotic like front month $30. Really, don\u2019t do that.\n\nNXE 2/22 or 12/22 $5 or $7. I did a few call debit spreads of buying 12/22 $5, selling $7. Probably should be greedier, but it seems so safe. What could go wrong?\n\n*Shares*:\n\nI like NXE from the miners/explorers the most, but CCJ is also a very solid miner. Google smaller marketcap ones on your own.\n\nMy positions:\n\n* URA &amp; NXE shares (some other too small of marketcap to list)\n* URA 10/22 $25c\n* URA 6/22 $28c &amp; 30c\n* NXE 9/17 $5c\n* NXE 12/22 $5c\n* NXE 12/22 $7c",

        "selftext": "Hey, do you guys remember when 14 days ago I got banned for posting that [IRNT was about to go nuclear](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/phc0uk/irnt_glitched_float_whale_oi_nuclear_gamma_ramp/)? At the time it was $14.00 and 9/17 $20 calls were something like $0.30 each. Remember my post on WSB? No, you don't. It got deleted. That didn't stop IRNT from hitting $40 in AH and opening the following day at like $26.\n\nHow about a stock called TMC? Remember when [I posted about its similar set-up](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/pnjll5/tmc_high_gamma_high_short_interest_but_high_iv/) Monday? You don't remember that? Oh, right, I didn't post it to WSB because I didn't want to get banned again. Well, it seems to be doing fine.\n\nLast night, rather than sleep, I decided to spent hours filling out a spreadsheet with every deSPAC I could find (if you're deep in the deSPAC craze, you know the list); complete with the new floats, IV, gamma values, percent of float deltahedged, estimated SI, Utilization, and CTB -- you know... the only things that really matter to us. (It's not like \"fundamentals\" could fit in a spreadsheet column, anyway.)\n\nNow I'm letting off some steam by once again partaking in the lost ancient art form of writing a DD for WSB. This time it's about what I think is best deSPAC play that is currently available for WSB to blindly dump its collective IRNT winnings into: VLTA.\n\ntldr:\n\n* **MARKET CAP IS $2B NO BAN PLS**\n* Low IV (currently) -- Make money from the MMs, not from each other.\n* High gamma -- Even after Sep options expire.\n* Some short interest (\\~10% of float) -- but more importantly 0 shares to borrow to keep this dog down. CTB getting \"up there\" at 47%.\n* The company does stuff.. not sure what, but I'm sure it's great world-changing stuff. Their name is Volta, so they must have *potential*... get it?\n* **The set-up looks suspiciously good, so I might be missing something. Perhaps wait for some wrinkle brain to shit on my thesis here.**\n\n# 0. The Market Cap\n\nI'm not actually salty about being banned; the mods have a tough job sorting through all the bullshit. I mean, just look at the titles of DDs these days... people just put in zero effort. At the time I posted about IRNT, the reported market cap on it varied from source to source due to the fucked up situation with outstanding shares and float. I assume the mods thought I was trying to sneak one by 'em. No hard feelings. I don't blame the mods for erring on the side of caution.\n\nAnyway, this time around **I'm certain VLTA meets the market cap requirements.**\n\nJust ask TDA: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r55bbd7uo2o71.png?width=521&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0347f40d4e7fa12524b1bfaa7e1b95b3caa7b48a\n\nOr Google: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/40wwwftuo2o71.png?width=1053&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=896255bbdf4c1b89c96fc60ce9757deebcd21ac8\n\nNo! Wait! Wait!  ... I meant this google: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tlcwr8fwo2o71.png?width=865&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6a696e86837c55d3dfce2491ee14442f5ff7d6c\n\nAlright. $2.0B &gt; $1.5B. Let's move on.\n\n# 1. The Process\n\nHow did I find VLTA? It's simple. I don't have a life and I spent all night making a spreadsheet, running calculations on gamma, and throwing in SI data from Ortex for tickers that look interesting.\n\nHere's a screenshot:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Lots of pretty colors. Must be legit.](https://preview.redd.it/8f39xl4xo2o71.png?width=1223&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3094fd899041cbe76974ba16a5215aae82349781)\n\nI blurred a lot of the tickers, per market cap rules. (If you're a true deSPAC degen, you'll know where the tickers and float numbers came from.)\n\nWhat I looked for were tickers with a lot of bright green squares. Most importantly, I want that low IV -- which to me indicates MMs asking to get reamed. Just like momma always says -- Low IV is how 10+ baggers are made.\n\nI was surprised to see that VLTA had the 5th highest current gamma value, behind TMC, OPAD, REDACTED, and IRNT. All of these have seen significant price action lately. Yet, the IV on VLTA was incredibly low... only bested by tickers with higher market caps and non-existent gamma. Wake up, MMs. (Or, again I'm missing some piece of the puzzle here.)\n\nOh, before you ask about IV -- I'm using 30d ATM IV as my baseline. I compute it myself by interpolating IV between strikes and expirations. In reality, each ticker will have it's own IV skew so don't yell at me when you see the OTM FDs aren't 80% IV.\n\nAs for the SI column: some tickers (the gray ones) had bonkers Estimated Short Interest. For these tickers, I used 60% of the On Loan value to estimate the estimated short interest. If you want hopium, upper bound for SI is about 1.6x the gray values.\n\n# 2. The Set-up\n\nTo summarize VLTA:\n\n* It's a deSPAC\n* With high OI relative to it's new float\n* With some short interest (not much)\n* But no shares available to borrow\n* With sustained bullish order flow\n* **And it's IV is priced as though all of the above is not true.**\n\n## deSPAC\n\nIt's a deSPAC.\n\nIf you don't know what that means, well, you're shit out of luck. I'm not going to explain how SPACs have huge floats and are allowed to have options traded on them, but then when they go through with a merger a lot of that float vanishes due to redemptions (but the options don't), so there ends up being a ton of options and not a lot of float, and MMs might not be aware of the change in the float and might think it's easy to buy shares to deltahedge but in reality there isn't a lot of float at all and when they deltahedge they push the price up making things worse for themselves. Same goes for shorts trying to cover.\n\nNo, I'm just not going to explain deSPACs to you at all.\n\nIn case you're wondering, VLTA completed August 26th with a 70% redemption rate. That's a lot lower than 90%+ we see with the IRNT, OPAD, TMC wonderkids.  So beware, a lower redemption rate means shareholders were more confident in Volta -- it might actually not be a completely shitty company.\n\n## OI relative to float\n\nA lot of people are going to shit on VLTA because it has a \"high float\" of 10,277,713 shares relative to the grab bag of deSPACs out there. Yes, compared to IRNT (\\~1.3m), TMC (\\~2.7m), OPAD (\\~3.4m), 10m is a bigger number. But there's also **a significant amount of OI** to make up for.\n\nWhat really matters for gamma is the *ratio* of OI to float.\n\nSo let's take a looksee at the 'ole deltaflux table:\n\n## DeltaFlux / Gamma\n\nOnce again, I'll throw out this disclaimer about deltaflux tables: **They are an approximation, and they make incorrect assumptions**.\n\nSome assumptions the table makes that make it inaccurate:\n\n* It assumes MMs deltahedge via black scholes model\n* Continuously and completely\n* Based on the options' IVs\n* For every single option in the chain\n\nPretty much all of those assumptions are false. Just because the table says the net delta is X% of float *does not* mean \"MMs must buy this many shares or else they fuk!!\". **The table is meant to present values that are useful to compare** ***across time*** **and** ***across tickers*****.**\n\nOk. Let's continue:\n\n## VLTA -- $12.35 (-$0.11 [-0.88%]) -- [DeltaFlux Tables Explained](https://old.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/ms7z36/deltaflux_tables_explained/)\n\n**OI as of:** Fri Sep 17 (at open) - **Date used for DTE**: Fri Sep 17, 2021 10:01 EST  \n**Weighted Avg IV:** 101.38%, **Shares:** 151,830,000, **Float:** 10,277,713, **Avg Vol (10d):** 1,205,400\n\n|Theo Price|Net Delta|\u2190 % Float|Gamma (1% Price \u2206flux)|\u2190 % Float / % Avg Vol|24hr \u2206flux (sh)|\u2190 % Float / % Vol|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$7.00|\\-1,352,677|\\-13.16|41,371|0.40 / 3.43|\\-14,593|\\-0.14 / -1.21|\n|$8.00|\\-637,502|\\-6.20|64,750|0.63 / 5.37|38,983|0.38 / 3.23|\n|$9.00|174,333|1.70|81,733|0.80 / 6.78|26,700|0.26 / 2.22|\n|$10.00|1,070,164|10.41|96,717|0.94 / 8.02|14,983|0.15 / 1.24|\n|$11.00|1,931,753|18.80|89,527|0.87 / 7.43|\\-1,269|\\-0.01 / -0.11|\n|$12.00|2,722,050|26.48|94,575|0.92 / 7.85|\\-47,094|\\-0.46 / -3.91|\n|**c - $12.35**|2,990,077|29.09|89,795|0.87 / 7.45|11,830|0.12 / 0.98|\n|**o - $12.46**|3,068,014|29.85|86,611|0.84 / 7.19|\\-3,086|\\-0.03 / -0.26|\n|$13.00|3,409,660|33.18|75,612|0.74 / 6.27|\\-7,674|\\-0.07 / -0.64|\n|$14.00|3,948,008|38.41|71,248|0.69 / 5.91|\\-15,873|\\-0.15 / -1.32|\n|$15.00|4,421,121|43.02|66,049|0.64 / 5.48|\\-10,381|\\-0.10 / -0.86|\n|$16.00|4,828,532|46.98|59,940|0.58 / 4.97|978|0.01 / 0.08|\n|$17.00|5,176,359|50.36|54,840|0.53 / 4.55|3,120|0.03 / 0.26|\n|$18.00|5,478,193|53.30|50,554|0.49 / 4.19|4,591|0.04 / 0.38|\n|$19.00|5,738,823|55.84|45,806|0.45 / 3.80|5,598|0.05 / 0.46|\n|$20.00|5,963,015|58.02|41,432|0.40 / 3.44|5,865|0.06 / 0.49|\n\nI like to represent gamma by \"how many shares need to be deltahedged (as a percentage of float) per a 1% movement in price\".

High gamma does not guarantee a gamma squeeze. A squeeze implies a runaway effect. What we want here is *momentum*. Think of a puck gliding on ice. High gamma = less friction.\n2. High gamma makes it easy to go up, but it also makes it easy to go down. Just like the puck gliding on ice. Easy to slide one way, easy to slide the other.\n\n## Short Interest and Utilization\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k32ay110p2o71.png?width=1723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39cd6c0b8c0f67242e10eb88e805486577a91255\n\nOrtex doesn't estimate SI for this one, but they do have the amount On Loan. It's 1,664,307, or 16.19 % float. That's the upper bound -- the real SI is generally lower than the amount that Ortex reports On Loan. If I had to guess, about 60% of it, so around 1m shares shorted, which is about 10% of float. Not a big story here.\n\nAlso of note is the *rising* value of the On Loan average age. It's going up -- which means that most shares borrowed were done so in the past. Think of it this way: if older loans were closed and new ones opened, the average age would go down.\n\nThe average age is 18 days, which is around Aug 30, when share price was $10.00. So to the extent that there are shorts, they're underwater just a bit.\n\nSI isn't super compelling. What's more encouraging, to me, is the Utilization pegged near 100%, and CTB in high double digits. This means there are no shares to short, and when there are, they are expensive. This is generally good news when you want the stock to go up.\n\n## Order Flow\n\nThe past several days have seen an influx of buyers, and I don't know where exactly they are coming from. I don't find very many mentions of this ticker on Reddit. Well, I did find [one post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pp0fu2/vlta_look_at_me_over_here_fomo_just_want_to_be/). As of now, I'm the only upvote. I just left a comment.\n\nHere's the orderflow, per MarketChameleon:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/exkzkyl0p2o71.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38a8b3c93fc7e1f8346312e45da286d543f14199\n\nBullish enough for me.\n\n## The Implied Vol\n\n**Here's the part I don't understand.**  Given all of the above, how is it that MMs did not ramp up IV on this deSPAC like they did on all others?\n\nVLTA 10/15 ATM calls are sitting at around \\~100% IV right now. That seems pretty low to me. Even further OTM, $17.50's are sitting at \\~126%.\n\nAccording to MarketChameleon, which does some weighted averaging type of stuff across strikes and expirations, the 30d IV to be 91%.\n\nFor comparison, here are the *pre-jump* 30d IVs of some famous deSPACs:\n\n* IRNT (Sep 1): 127%\n* IPOD (Sep 10): 134%\n* TMC (Sep 14): 178%\n* VLTA (now): 91%\n\nI'm not sure why this is, but I'll take a bargain when I see one.\n\n## Other\n\nVLTA is currently on the threshold securities list. I don't really think carries a lot of weight, but it's worth noting.\n\n# 3. The Play\n\nAlright, I assume you saw a really long DD with pretty pictures and tables and just want to throw money into something.\n\n## Risks/Rewards\n\nLet me first tell you the risks:\n\n* There is no real gamma. Perhaps all the OI is spreads. Or covered calls.\n* MMs are anticipating for this (despite the low IV signifying otherwise). Instead of milking them, we're circle jerking one another while playing hot-potato-options until everyone gets bored.\n* **I could be completely off about the float or some other mechanic, like PIPE shares unlocking or something.** To the best of my knowledge, this thing has just been sitting quietly under the radar since redemption... aside from the run-up.\n\nAnd here are the rewards:\n\n* MMs, for some reason, overestimated the float. The buy-in is relentless, and they decide it best to do one or both: a) buy back expensive calls, or b) bite the bullet and accumulate shares, pushing prices up.\n* IV going from X% to 300%.\n* That hole in yourself you feel for not buying/holding IRNT, OPAD, TMC, etc -- this can provide closure. (Or it can be salt.)\n\n## What to buy\n\n* October calls.\n* Shares\n\n## When to sell\n\nLook, I have no idea what happens here, and when it happens. I see a good set-up, and I see a deSPAC frenzy all around me, so I think this is a good bet.\n\n**What I will recommend, however, is to keep a very close eye on the IV.** Regardless of price, IV roughly tells you how much \"acceleration\" is priced in. If you're holding an option and the IV jumps up, you need to ask yourself:  will interest in this stock and/or share price accelerate or decelerate? Will inflows continue or reverse? As IV goes up, the margin of error in your judgement decreases -- small errors will cost you bigly, as IV is *generally* correlated to actual volatility.\n\nAt which IV and/or price to sell at is a judgement you need to make for yourself based on whatever it is you do, and the risk you can tolerate. It can be TA, gauging sentiment, momentum, technicals (float, gamma, etc), or you just feel it in your plums.\n\nFor me, personally, I'm a little bitch and will probably be out at around 300% IV, just like I was with all the other deSPACs. I have faith gamma pushes this upwards, but at some point, the MMs are milked and it becomes a game of hot-potato. Not for me.\n\n# My positions:\n\nOct Calls: $12.50, $15.00, $17.50",

Citing sources familiar with the meeting, Electrek reported Thursday that Musk held a company-wide call and said the Cybertruck should be ready for production in late 2022.\n\nIf the company plans for beta trucks later this year, that leaves nowhere near enough time to start actual production in late 2021.\n\nFollowing his comments, Tesla updated the Cybertruck's reservation page to note production will fire up in 2022. Though, according to Musk, we're not looking at early 2022 or anything like that. And as we suspected, the CEO underscored the electric truck's volume models may not be ready until sometime in 2023.

        "selftext": " **TL;DR - stock with gamma squeeze potential and 157% short interest of float gets my dick hard. If OPAD reaches $16 market makers will need to hedge nearly 100% of float--and stock already reached $16 last Thursday. Market makers &amp; short sellers fucked.**\n\nNo doubt you've seen the IRNT posts about the unique situation arising from a low float and high call options. Well I've got news for you: I've been watching $OPAD like a hawk and it looks to be ramping up into the exact same situation as IRNT, and yet somehow you apes haven't realized this yet. If you're sad you missed out on IRNT and you think underwater mining is bullshit, then have I got the play for you. And you can actually seemingly get in early on this one too. I've been accumulating my position in OPAD since last Tuesday while watching the gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential increase every day. Read on for what I know, and buckle up cause this is a big one\u2026\n\n[OPAD is where IRNT was two weeks ago](https://preview.redd.it/0z9j53b2bon71.png?width=1659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f0f1c45bdd00818c3f61abc3640cd686efde050)\n\n*This is not financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Please keep in mind this is a high risk play and I am a random stranger on the internet - so make sure you do your own research! Don't blame me if you're a dumbass who YOLOs their whole account into 150% OTM 3 DTE calls and this doesn't materialize.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Background\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, some background on the company. Offerpad ($OPAD) is an iBuyer company with a current market cap of 2.636B.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wxq4xw4bon71.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3beaf0d4855963388afc86057c8f74523ca2c797\n\nAn iBuyer is basically a company that uses their technology to make quick offers to home sellers, then re-sell those homes themselves for profit. Think Redfin, Zillow, Opendoor - those are OPAD's competitors.\n\nOfferpad de-SPACed just a few weeks ago and started trading as OPAD on September 2. For some reason investors fucking hated this thing, so prior to the ticker change the SPAC had a huge percent of redemptions just like IRNT - a whopping 92% redemption rate. As a result, there are now only 3,387,913 shares in the free float until PIPE unlocks (TBD at this point). And, just like IRNT, OPAD has fallen into this retarded loophole created by the genius SEC where it somehow has options even though the current float is technically too small for listing options.\n\n[Redemption info from OPAD's super 8K filing - a legal filing our SEC overlords make each SPAC file when it completes its merger and de-SPACs](https://preview.redd.it/1vjw8d48bon71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75752ce6d62b95ac0731442ef2fdb5da9c49580b)\n\nAs a result of the low float the stock has been extremely volatile since it began trading as OPAD on 9/2. It's seen 10-20% intraday swings pretty much every day since the ticker change. If you had just been trading those dips you'd actually probably be pretty fucking rich by now. OPAD even reached a high of $16 last Thursday. Just as it was starting to gamma squeeze into orbit, though, it was shorted to shit Thursday into Friday and eventually closed Friday down almost 40% from that $16 high. More on that shorting below - point is, this is super volatile and therefore also a high risk play. If that's too scary for you, though, then why the fuck are you on [r/WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/) in the first place? Go back to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and your 3 fund portfolio.\n\nAlso, if you're a smooth brain who obsesses over technical analysis - OPAD looks to have had a nearly perfect gap fill yesterday and has since started to take off into orbit (up 29% from that low end of day Tuesday).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qheyfjjdbon71.png?width=1669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b58b811614984f2013a2cdfb05a2259e7195d04\n\nClosed 9/3 at $8.63 and gapped up to open 9/7 at $10.09. On 9/3 retraced back down to $8.60 for all of one minute before bouncing back up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Gamma Squeeze - Market Makers Fucked\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, now to the really good stuff. I know as soon as you read \"gamma squeeze\" in the title your itty bitty micropeen got hard as a thumbtack, so let me give you some porn to jack off to.\n\nJust like IRNT, OPAD's options can put market makers in the position where they would need to buy over 100% of OPAD's current float in order to hedge their risk from writing options to retards like you all on WSB - and frankly, it's not that hard for OPAD to reach the point where this would happen. As further OTM call options become in the money, market makers will have to buy more and more of these shares to sell to you if you decide to exercise the contract. This is because of the options Greeks Delta and Gamma. Now normally I know that for you retards \"options Greeks\" usually means the options your wife's Greek boyfriend tells you to buy, but for this play Delta and Gamma are super important.\n\nSince I know you dgaf about options Greeks, let me try to dumb it down for you apes with a picture:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2pluvjwjbon71.png?width=1747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892bf16fa9e8a9325c69b8808fbad066e460a6bb\n\nBased on the options open interest as of yesterday, if OPAD reached $16 then market makers would need to hedge 98.21% of the current float. At Wednesday's close price, only 29.72% of the float would need to be hedged - still a huge amount, but clearly this thing has room to run. And on top of that, OPAD already managed to reach $16 last Thursday before it was swatted down by short sellers.\n\nRight now, as the price increases past $16 market makers would need to buy less and less additional stock to hedge since the stock price becomes further and further from the open options interest. If more people buy more OTM options, though, then the price could run even higher because market makers would need to buy even more stock even after the price runs (aka the situation IRNT is in right now). This is delta and gamma at play, and what can create a gamma squeeze. This covering would be incredibly difficult for market makers to do because of the low number of stock available in the float. OPAD already briefly reached $16 last Thursday and OPAD's options volume and open interest has been steadily increasing, so who knows what the fuck could happen over the next few days as we head into September options expiration.\n\nAlso, since you're a degenerate and have likely already started to buy options on this shit before even finishing my DD you may have noticed that OPAD's options open interest and volume is much lower than IRNT's. For one, this is probably because you apes haven't caught wind of OPAD until right now and haven't yet started buying large amounts of retardedly OTM calls. However, even with the lower overall open interest there is still a ton of potential.\n\nHere is OPAD's total open interest and volume since I started tracking it last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ahxfhvmbon71.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=592b7835a2304db6ab812fdccfd9fb680b477ab8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/puvnpdmobon71.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e5d576a1ba05856cbe93449daa6b8c72cae3791\n\nHere's OPAD's OI and most recent volume for September expiration compared to IRNT, as of the end of the day Wednesday:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||OPAD|IRNT|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Puts - OI|3,326|25,276|\n|Calls - OI|19,369|58,031|\n|Put-Call Ratio - OI|0.17|0.44|\n|Puts - Volume|1,605|9,719|\n|Calls - Volume|16,205|41,787|\n|Put-Call Ratio - Volume|0.10|0.23|\n\nWhile the total number of calls (for all strikes and for September) is lower than IRNT, there are pretty much no puts open for OPAD whereas IRNT has almost half as many open puts as calls. Puts that market makers sell counteract the hedging that market makers need to do when price increases in order to cover the calls they sell, so for OPAD a much lower relative number of puts means that the open calls could still require market makers to hedge a large volume of shares even if there are less total calls than IRNT. To dumb it down for you apes - less put mean slightly less call still go big boom.\n\nAnd all of this isn't even accounting for you dumbass apes who love short-dated OTM options. Just like GME, stock buying is what can really get this going. But, more options open interest means that the gamma squeeze potential will only increase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Short Interest - Short Sellers Fucked\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y56rygbybon71.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb999d9ecbf55fe076aae8dbf20f5f8cc49a7977\n\n[I know short squeezes are like crack to you people, and I'm here to feed your addiction.](https://preview.redd.it/jck8gau0con71.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc05bf4a5ebb91d0c4ceba8067c56f69ad856da5)\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, ever since OPAD started to run last week it's been getting hammered by short sellers. To begin with, even taking out the gamma squeeze considerations with OPAD it's a retarded idea to short this stock right now. OPAD is a legitimate growth stock with many signs that it's significantly undervalued right now and could likely be a nice return even if you were to just buy and hold. For example, OPAD's 2021 projected revenue is $1.7-$1.85 billion. With their current market cap, they would only be trading at a 1.55 multiple; OPAD's peers are trading at multiple times higher than that. Even if all outstanding warrants are executed and after PIPE unlock, this stock will still be undervalued relative to its peers.\n\nThe crazy thing about the shorting is that according to Ortex, short sellers have now managed to accumulate a total short interest of 5.33 million - which is **157% of the current float**. Short interest **increased 36% yesterday**, cost to borrow reached as high as **220.08%**, and **utilization is at 99.98%** (aka there are pretty much no shares left to short).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/btsivxm2con71.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=684fd041c0a8b15af0761fed6ed835d88b9a1634\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0fvtcdr3con71.png?width=1259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1948a30365647cadf2459096e789bbe99c1c211\n\nShort sellers would already need to purchase 1.5x the current float to fully cover their positions. However - remember what I said earlier about the market makers needing to buy stocks to cover the calls they're writing to you retards? Because the market makers are doing that, there would be even less shares for short sellers to cover with. This is how you get to infinity squeeze potential - there just wouldn't be nearly enough shares available for everyone to buy what they need to cover. This gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential is also exactly what happened with GME back in January. It's almost like these dumbass short sellers haven't learned a damn thing.\n\nIt also seems that these short sellers caught on to this risk and really don't want this thing to blast off. And I take offense to that - I want my tendies. These huge drops in price were rally killers. If you check the open interest from Ortex above you'll see the huge increase in short interest after last Thursday.\n\n[Shorts fucking with OPAD when it started to take off last Thursday](https://preview.redd.it/mr2cfuu4con71.png?width=1666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=359769d5f4676a797ecff357c00ad0f47fe90927)\n\n[Shorts fucking with OPAD again when it started to take off Wednesday](https://preview.redd.it/dpsq83p5con71.png?width=1670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79f80e9a93511d65bb9c10f457249823e70a8b07)\n\nWhat's great is that even though this has been significantly beaten down by short sellers, OPAD has come right back after each dip you see above. This thing just cannot be beaten.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eht6wkq7con71.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=570e9c1bd82e51863c34106b5666d0e8fa91e483\n\nMore importantly, though, is that since these short sellers seem to just keep doubling down each time this thing starts to blast off they will be extra mega-fucked once it actually does achieve liftoff. Each time they double down on their shorting they are just adding more fuel to the fire. More than that, if the folks shorting OPAD are the same ones shorting other low float stocks like IRNT, and OPAD pops alongside those other stocks - we very well could see short sellers getting margin called from multiple positions turning extremely against them all at once just like we saw back in January/February with GME, AMC, etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4s8y6k8con71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=572dfc1c1e7a6baf03e1fe610864b755ce7b8547\n\nSo, there you have it--yet another gamma squeeze/short squeeze stock for you to go apeshit over. Good luck, this one should be lit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/up8fm599con71.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92991b84268635c27e5f743f9584bb74c1c6d7d7\n\nOh, also - positions below. I didn't sell last Thursday during the run, instead I've been steadily buying more. This baby still has lots of room to run and has yet to truly pop.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpjcqs3acon71.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8f2449319bc5ee538da2015162549ea25434b2c",

        "selftext": "TMC (The Metals Company) is a recent \"de-SPA C\" that started trading on Friday.  It's a deep sea mining company with a market cap of $2.35 billion with 245 million shares outstanding (current price in the $9-9.50 range).\n\nThe key thing here though is that 231 million shares are locked up at least 6 months and the 11 million PIPE shares are locked for at least a month (but perhaps longer because 2/3 of their PIPE didn't pay up).\n\nOkay, so why do we care? Here's why this is potentially one of the most explosive stocks we've ever seen this week:\n\nThe current float is 2.72 million because 91% of the original 30 million shares redeemed for cash.\n\nThe short interest is around 1.77 million shares (or roughly 65% of the current float is short).\n\nBut here's the \"canary in the coal mine\": the open interest.  Market makers were selling calls based on the prior 30 million shares outstanding before last Friday, which means they've potentially sold much more than the entire current float:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/823tys3ci9n71.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=493a7a66e8ffbe60cf7c4ae599e422c9b9779f09\n\nThere's 25k calls for 9/17 between $10 and $12.50.  That's 2.5 million shares.  There's another 8.2k calls for 9/17 between $14 and $15.  That's another 820k shares.\n\n**That means if the stock is over $12.50 by Friday, MMs will need 92% of the current float to meet just September calls.**  **If it's over $15 by Friday, MMs will need 120+% of the current float to meet those calls.**\n\nThat's just September.  Add in those October calls (another 11.8k calls between $10 and $12.50 and another 7k calls between $14 and $15) and you'd require another 1.9 million shares for those...\n\n**So if TMC goes over $15, MMs would need 190% of the current float to account for September/October calls.**\n\n(And as I mentioned above 65% of the current float is short).\n\nI'm gonna be honest, I have never seen a situation like this (because the level of redemptions for recent de-SP ACs recently is unprecedented).  MMs have to keep this pinned under $10 by Friday or all hell will break loose.\n\nEasiest way/lowest risk way to play this is just buy stock (which should go up 200-300% in a \"gamma + short squeeze\" scenario).  September calls are super risky but will pay off in 5/10/15 baggers if the stock actually gets past $15 and rockets.\n\nOctober calls are lower risk than September but should still turn in 4/6/8 baggers if it gets past $15.\n\nPositions: 1000 shares of stock. 250 $12.50 calls, 200 $15 calls for Sept.  \n\nAs always do your own DD, I think this is the most explosive setup ever, but it may just stay pinned under $10 and then the calls are worthless.  Good luck.",

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone and thank you for taking the time to read my post. Happy Sunday and I hope you all are enjoying this longer weekend. I think this is a very important topic because it will put the minds of every trader together to come out with 5 tickers or at least 3 that have been winners for you this year. This way people that have been negative now, or all year can have an idea of what they can do, or need to do in order to turn the ship around.\n\nWe all have different strategies. I for one am a day trader so my 5 will be extremely different from a long term holder or swing trader. Do to the fact that I am a day trader. I will also list 5 stocks that I unfortunately allowed to go parabolic on me, but indeed I did trade them when they were far cheaper. For myself, I have something called \u201cPlays\u201d this is a special watch list of tickers that I am ready to trade now, that I feel safe, and I select my symbols off of this list. This list is well over 100 tickers. When a stock has gone up far to much, I no longer feel safe about it and do not trade it at all!\n\nPlease try and be honest with ourselves and do not just try and pick the best gainers because this practice is for everyone to watch a new symbol or have an idea of how you played it to be a success. Thank you, share thoughts and please help one another:\n\nMy 5 as a Day Trader:\n\nRKT \u2013 This stock is about 17 dollars, however I have traded this symbol so much that I have probably about 30 dollars in profits. I have traded this all year and even last year as well for 25 cents to a dollar\n\nUWMC \u2013 This is in the same sector as RKT, it stands at just 7.50 but I have traded this for probably close to 20 dollars, for many months I traded this 15-50 cents\n\nTIGR \u2013 This is about 13 dollars, I have traded this all year this year and also last year as well, I have probably 30+ dollars in profits on this one (25-75 cents a trade)\n\nCPNG \u2013 I know this stock is near a 52 week low (I actually have shares at 30.25) but I have traded in and out of this since IPO and have garnered about 50 in profits! (30 cents to 1.25)\n\nCRSR \u2013 I have traded this all year as well, no current position. I traded this as high as 40 and have easily made about 40 on this. (25 cents to 1.50)\n\nThese are 5 that I owned and traded often but they just took off and I could not find myself trading them anymore\n\nBILL \u2013 This has gone insane, I traded this until about 100\u2026 I am actually very negative at these prices, yes, I missed out, but I made a lot on it\n\nMRNA \u2013 I know, I know, but when I was trading this, It was still a bio pharma with no vaccine yet! I actually traded this as low as 30 and stopped at 100\u2026\n\nSE \u2013 I absolutely loved this company and traded it as low as 30-40 all the way to 150 and said to myself this is crazy! Look at it now, jesus\n\nCMG \u2013 OK, I did not trade this within 52 weeks but last March this dipped to 500! I was trading it all the way thru 750. Small blocks of 250 shares\u2026 What the heck are they selling EVs in the back? Mining in the basement????\n\nZM- Boy when covid first hit I was destroying it on this from mid 60s all the way until 150!\n\nI hope this helps others get an idea and thank you everyone.",

        "selftext": "# The Black Swan Cometh\n\nEarlier this month, a black swan flew into the plaza of Tiananmen Square, stirring speculation on what this would symbolically mean. China has already had a rough last couple of months; dealing with floods, typhoons, hailstorms, sandstorms, landslides, and a pandemic to boot. Surely this swan is of no significance right? \n\n[Honk Honk, motherfucker. ](https://preview.redd.it/kyfhdq7nyko71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fb963e892a0b61f496c0c83e31dc4a4a08b11bf)\n\n# The Problem\n\nEnter the Chinese housing bubble. Unlike Americans which diversify into stocks, bonds, real estates etc, China largely invest in real estate. Furthermore, 40-60% of the price of real estate in mainland china is the cost of the land and taxes collected by local governments. This has led to a rapid unsustainable rise in the price of housing in some parts of China.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqil004lblo71.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4439bbf3b4bc31a936197e76c01e547920eb4ab\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5u9t6w8gelo71.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a51ac007bcfb913e4fbdc0245fc76aab77eef494\n\nAnd what does all that get you? Some shit-ass [tofu-dreg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu-dreg_project) construction housing, that makes Haitian building codes look good. Built using concrete that's more reminiscent of dirt, rebar that's more reminiscent of twigs, these buildings were built by developers to turn a profit as quickly as possible, and bought by individuals who seek to sell them at a higher price to the next sucker. This process can perpetuate itself until a catalyst presents itself.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9cukb29oblo71.png?width=553&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c94d9474d77a150b3cb2ce66888aa224a66d1bf\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The catalyst: Evergrande\n\nEnter the catalyst to China's housing bubble, Evergrande: China's second largest real estate developer. On September 8th, Evergrande Wealth, which offers wealth management products to clients in China, failed to deliver interest payment to its clients. As a result, victims and clients have staged large scale protests at Evergrande HQ for several days in a row.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ef3gorv34lo71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78722f8ffcce2762446c593a28534263a7a97b54\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[People take turns talking shit at an Evergrande Wealth exec while some lady is passed out on the floor.](https://preview.redd.it/o8z9f8ckulo71.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6db2ae9c7feec465d0be2169cc0865d534ef4f0)\n\nOn August 31, Evergrande confessed that work on 1.5 million properties have been halted due to delays in payment to its creditors, suppliers, and contractors. After absorbing $7.5B USD in wealth product deposits, Evergrande Wealth purchased $12.4B of junk assets that Evergrande could not sell.\n\n[Unfinished 'ghost city' properties](https://preview.redd.it/6rx9okgpulo71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c474a852f5493b66dcd7e0b7a6241b1bf9f30c7)\n\n# The Problem\n\nEvergrande was due a loan payment today (September 20), but told banks it was unable to pay it. Evergrande is due to pay $83.5 million in interest on **September 23** for its March 2022 bond. It has another $47.5 million in interest due on **September 29** for its March 2024 notes. Being unable to pay any of these loan obligations, Evergrande has resorted to offering it's properties as payment, triggering a fire sale. This is similar to the firesale of mortgage backed securities back in 2008.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/24z895o4clo71.png?width=1885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8435469f9054774085502485c3be757afd303567\n\n# The Contagion\n\nChina Evergrande Group employs over 200,000 full time employees across multiple sectors including real estate, renewable energy vehicles, tourism, sports, finance, and health; and indirectly provides over 38 million jobs across China. Over 1.5m customers / clients have a vested interest in Evergrande. If Evergrande defaults, it could create an unemployment crisis and panic sale of real investment properties, perpetuating the cycle above, popping the bubble. From here, we can reasonably identify the following as potential contagions.\n\n* Holders of Evergrande Bonds maturing soon: HSBS, UBS, Blackrock all have sizeable positions.\n* Commodities / Precious Metals: China is known to hold metal reserves and can/will dump them.\n* Chinese consumer discretionary sector: Consumer discretionary spending in China should fall should a recession hit the Country\n* Chinese financials sector: They are too interwoven into the real estate sector.\n* Chinese real estate sector: Self explanatory.\n* China trade partners (deficit): China has a trade deficit of $140B to Taiwan, $61B to Australia, and $60B to South Korea as of 2020. Companies in these countries that are dependent on Chinese trade may take a hit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Cataclysm\n\nIf China's real estate bubble bursts, it can take out China's financials and Real Estate companies. S&amp;P Global reported that over $50b in Real Estate bonds are due in 2021, and the rate of companies defaulting on bonds is rising. This contagion can easily spread to world financial sectors that are overexposed in Chinese real estate Junk Bonds.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/27i8h9yv9mo71.png?width=1264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c524d7577b81b5e4e431b64e01bf5600e9c532c3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lpqmwojy9mo71.png?width=1238&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3345c6a1aa65ab751b10b3a686e9e145aa18ce21\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/grp68v7r4lo71.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5be06ab6c9d032f80e51cabcfad8efb7de28af7e\n\n# Salt the Wound\n\nTo make matters worse, recent events in China is throwing in bonus catalysts into the mix, potentially magnifying the fallout of a total collapse.\n\n* Business and Stock Market crackdown / interference: The CCP has prevented companies from listing on US stock exchanges (thus preventing its companies from acquiring new liquidity), applied regulatory pressures to the gaming, communications, education, and media sectors.

        "selftext": "Greetings to the most intelligent people on the planet!\n\nI've been playing with GME and the other charts recently, and it all accumulated into a massive piece of delicious TA,  which I didn't really plan to post to WSB originally - because I felt like some of the honorable WSB residents might be a little tired from that particular stonk. However, after seening [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pppfro/tmc_spotted_the_cock_and_balls_upside_down_head/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pph9f0/as_you_can_see_tmc_is_forming_a_classic_nut_sack/) beautiful examples of intellectual superiority, I just couldn't resist sharing my hard work with you, dear WSB!(If you, dear reader, are the one who is fed up with GME, then I would recommend you stop reading now and follow the two links above to appreciate HQ TA on other stonks).\n\nFor those, who stayed - enjoy the read!\n\nIt all started from my \u201cL'Oreal shampoo commercial\u201d-like hair bet post, where, in its third chapter, I was theorizing about GME's negative beta (particularly in light of the late January events, when the buy button was disabled) and the current general market setup - how it might influence subsequent GME moves. So, I decided to dive deeper into those correlations and deviations between the price movements of GME and other major assets, using January sneeze as the starting point. This led me to a fascinating, tits-jacking discovery that points at the upcoming inevitable volatile price action!\n\nBuckle up for the TA journey of your life, let\u2019s ~~dive~~ fly in!\n\nOh, almost forgot to quote Jack Black:\n\n&gt;\u201cThis is not the financial advice, no.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is just a tribute.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Couldn't remember becoming a financial advisor, no.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is a tribute, oh, to the greatest stonk in the world, alright!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst things first, it\u2019s a good idea therefore to revisit **late Jan events**, which in my opinion was the moment of revelation and a preview of inevitable storm, when:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I. The North Remembers:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GME v VIX v SP, 30 min chart](https://preview.redd.it/yu1zzckpa2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e10bd82e172e82ea16a68da5c9c4a9c3e07f70ff)\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a single day,\n* and injuring SP badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, the thesis should sound something like GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99=SP\ud83c\udd98, and vice versa. It will be developed further in the next chapters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, quoting my bet post here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Pepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Categorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, I should recommend  you reading u/peruvian_bull Endgame series, and/or u/Criand the Bigger Short in order to develop the understanding of the fundamental processes taking place under the hood of the financial markets. To sum up the core idea: the financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standards, it is heading to the next, coming soon, financial crisis. And, in my opinion, what you can see on the charts above, was a sneak peak of the house of cards collapsing. Disabling the buy button was the only option for the big moni guys to stop (or rather to postpone) the system failing miserably. By bringing this dirty trick into play they were able to ~~buy~~ steal some time, which was necessary for deploying emergency measures and urgent market mechanisms (such as new DTCC/NSCC rules) - which, in turn, are aimed at mitigating the inevitable financial hail**shit**storm, ready to hit the fans.\n\nThere is a plenty of outstanding fundamentals DD on that topic (start from clicking profiles in the paragraph above). As for me, I am the TA type of a wrincle-brained ape, so...\n\nLet me speak from my ~~heart~~ charts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# II. Negative beta more beautiful than Catherine Zeta\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's start from something that you must have heard about many times, but did you really dive into GME exceptional beta? So, what's that thing and why is it so negative? For the sake of saving my and your time, let me quote the almighty Inve**stop**edia:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In investing, beta does not refer to fraternities, product testing, or old videocassettes. Beta is a measurement of market risk or volatility. That is, it indicates how much the price of a stock tends to fluctuate up and down compared to other stocks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The value of any stock index, such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index, moves up and down constantly. At the end of the trading day, we conclude that \"the markets\" were up or down. An investor considering buying a particular stock may want to know whether that stock moves up and down just as sharply as stocks in general. It may be inclined to hold its value on a bad day or get stuck in a rut when most stocks are rising; whereas the beta is the number that measures a stock's volatility, the degree to which its price fluctuates in relation to the overall stock market. In other words, it gives a sense of the stock's risk compared to that of the greater market's.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Beta is used also to compare a stock's market risk to that of other stocks. Analysts use the Greek letter '\u00df' to represent beta.Beta is calculated using regression analysis. A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price tends to move with the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security's price tends to be more volatile than the market. A beta of less than 1 means it tends to be less volatile than the market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Negative beta**: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely.\n\nEssentially, negative beta asset is an asset that tends to move in the opposite direction from the general market. Famous precious metal is one of the good examples: gold and gold stocks have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines. That is exactly the reason why investors cherish this asset in the turbulent time of recessions, market crashes and corrections, or general uncertainty and volatility - historically gold tends to perform well during such periods, providing the 'safe heaven' to market participants and acting as a hedge. Noice, but this turbulent time we have something special on the horizon.\n\n\\*\\*Le wild negative beta unicorn appears\\*\\*\n\n[Captain GME to gold](https://preview.redd.it/rpv734w9c2o71.png?width=471&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56080fa590e5ecb6f65ad1a72329cd4d12569014)\n\nMany of you must have seen -\u00df posts, but math and numbers are for geniuses, retards only understand crayons and visuals, so...\n\nLadies and gentleapes, with the great pleasure I present you the new negative beta king:\n\n[GME v SP, daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/iwtaoohhc2o71.jpg?width=2039&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67b2824b31bf155c6f7d5f992c5141f67a82cdfb)\n\nWhat you see on the chart above is a vivid illustration of GME's negative beta behavior, which commenced during/after the January sneeze. As for SP, the stable uptrend with the minor corrections is evident, while the asset is achieving ATHs on a regular basis. Looking at the GME now and connecting its highs with the median line, we may observe the opposite trend, as the line is descending. All in all, there is a big-ass convergence manifesting between the two assets, which most probably will result in the increased volatility and the explosive GME breakout / trend reversal for SP. Who will blink first?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GME v SP daily chart + Tower of Pisa](https://preview.redd.it/3fiwmwwqc2o71.jpg?width=2033&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63ecddcaa4651b946a4df8541409c8d8e547d435)\n\nNext, take a look at this chart. Don't worry about GME's Pisa offset here, as it is insignificant for the point I'm making (and I had some struggles overlaying the charts in this case). If the previous chart indicates a longer term negative correlation, the one above is like a zoom in: there is an obvious series of divergences and convergences highlighted yellow and blue respectively, which illustrate negative beta again, but on a smaller scale and with local trends. As you can see, as soon a GME bullrun commences and accelerates, SP dips, and vice versa. I hope, that the examples provided are persuasive, and that they helped you to reach the same conclusion as I did, namely: sstonk goes up when stonks go down, while when stonks go up, GME is suppressed = GME\ud83c\udd99SP\ud83c\udd98. Should that correlation continue manifesting itself (which I'm pretty damn confident it will), the exciting times are on the way.\n\nOk, so \ud83c\udd99\ud83c\udd98 is a simple concept, but why is it important, you may ask.\n\nWell, that's why:\n\n[SP, daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/6b41eaewc2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9ae4bdc7758ecdbc84425e6ea567e1d4243f9e1)\n\nSP has been forming a powerful bearish technical formation called the rising wedge, through the past year and a half. Currently it is narrowing down, and the point of breakout is not far away - typically it is to the downside for such a technical setup. Add GME with its negative beta to this equation - if you know, you know.\n\n[SP 4H chart, I called it \u2018Head of Penis\u2019 formation ](https://preview.redd.it/sbs9va8od2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce9b57e1a6fa2020ac1c91218ad5d462ceda5d07)\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more!\n\n[SP, monthly chart ](https://preview.redd.it/1goqfoa2e2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3eefcd4720f38907877a2791ea642c3955122b5)\n\nIn one of my TA longwrites, the Big Short 2.0, I identified a beautiful, long term, juicy Elliott 1-2-3-4-5 impulse wave structure on SP, take a look! The investors are currently riding the top of the fifth wave, which is usually the most fun, euphoric and crazily risky. Everything in the nature works in cycles, and all the things that go up, must go down eventually! Considering the current bullrun being one of the (if not THE) most powerful and longest bullruns in history, you can imagine how nasty the retrace may look this time. Especially, when you take into account the fact that current financial markets are filled with shitty synthetic derivatives, excessive leverage of a bad quality, unthinkable level of risk, and... plain fucking crime. The financial world is craving for the correction (like Sahara for rainfall) and a proper bear market, as the deleveraging will make it healthier, and maybe, just maybe, it will bring price discovery back to life from the grave where it has been rolling for I don\u2019t know how long.\n\nMan, I wish there was a safe heaven asset that would protect me from the upcoming financial typhoon, the price of which would move the opposite way from the overdue nasty correction on all financial markets, which have been enjoying the most powerful bullrun in history for more than ten fucking years... Oh, wait!\n\n[Vasco da Gama can\u2019t be wrong ](https://preview.redd.it/gt1rnbz7e2o71.png?width=571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f6db503236cce3d87f8c4511221e8b5e30f91bb)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# III. Chew it Over with VIX\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext, let\u2019s talk about Volatility Index - what I noticed recently, is that VIX is often being neglected in the TA discussions, and in general also, so it\u2019s a good idea to show it some love. Especially since GME and VIX correlate to a considerable fucking extent, but later on that.\n\nTo begin with,\n\n[VIX, monthly chart ](https://preview.redd.it/1fcd3vlge2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78c23f899b3d623552b4b402c0abe74266108223)\n\nThe chart above is provided for the visual explanation of how this instrument behaves. In short, markeds kaboom TWIX wroom wroom. In essence, the Cboe Volatility Index is a market sentiment tracking index that represents the market participants expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. Volatility, or the severity of price fluctuations, is usually helpful to gauge market sentiment, particularly the degree of fear and uncertainty spreading on the financial markets. Investors use VIX to measure the level of risk, fear, or stress in the market when making investment decisions. It is an important index in the world of finance because it provides a quantifiable measure of market risk and investors' sentiments.\n\nAnd who would have guessed, throughout the year VIX spikes have been accompanying almost every single GME major run, but for one:\n\n[GME v VIX, daily log chart](https://preview.redd.it/ksd03p5pe2o71.jpg?width=1969&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=835dee5dd6c8b5367088857995e01a720f41f13a)\n\nJust one major outlier to that tandem is late November 2020 run. Speaking of outliers, also VIX middle of June 2021 spike seems to stand out from the crowd, as there is no relevant proportionate positive price action on the GME side. Outside of those two occasions, the correlational behaviour of these two instruments is evident. Moreover, VIX and GME runs correlate to the extent that their peaks match time-wise in several run ups. Furthermore, take a look at how starting 2021 four out of five major VIX spikes correspond with the occasions when GME\u2019s price action was trialling $230-ish level (margin call level, it seems) - the price territory, around which my concept of the \u2018Purple Haze\u2019 resistance (\u201cbreak to initiate the squeeze\u201d) is established, refer to the short squeezes comparisons post to explore the concept. The correlational behaviour described above, to my understanding, points at two big conclusions: the first and the most obvious one, is GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99; secondly, it seems that GME is currently the biggest risk for the market! - too much synchronicity is present between the two, for this to be a mere coincidence. Remember, VIX represents volatility, fear and stress - wut feelin Kenny?\n\nOh, and did I mention?\n\n[VIX, daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/q0hb68xue2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcfaadcd5304e1c57307f4b954759dd402f33f8)\n\nDuring the year and a half, the instrument\u2019s price action has been consolidating into a beautiful bullish formation, called the descending wedge - which is exactly the opposite of what SP is consolidating into. VIX descending wedge + SP rising wedge + GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99SP\ud83c\udd98, quick math, and\n\n[We get an ape\u2019s best friend, Gator the Bubbles Deflator \\(the Greater\\).](https://preview.redd.it/2fzj2pdye2o71.jpg?width=2032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecbdb4676a65c16dee75b9d3613fde91cecf7335)\n\nIf you know, you know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# IV. This is the tits-jacking part. Achtung! You have been warned!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, that was quiet a TA journey. I hope that the discussion above helped you to build the solid understanding of what's happening on broader financial markets and how those correlations and tendencies are affecting GME price action, and will probably add the fuel to the rocket in the upcoming major GME moves. Now, the focus of the discussion is back on the GME current TA status quo! (yeah, finally!) And, what can I say, it is so fucking juicy!\n\nFirstly, let me remind you about this TA of mine, which aged like a fine wine:\n\n[GME, daily log chart ](https://preview.redd.it/ibiauo96f2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4645e967977f6c91ad71f07546993dc6140fda1)\n\nThe log chart support above proved itself to be an ape's ultimate best friend! As you can see, during the year, each time the price action approached the lower support, a sharp re-bounce followed - August and September confirmed the price line as THE most important support, manifesting the steadfast buying pressure. That pressure is currently confronting the most important resistance for GME in 2021 (magenta line). The battle will be legendary! (Hint: remember the current market setups discussed in II, and III, and the correlations? Based solely on that, what do you think the GME breakout will look like?)\n\nBut wait, there's more!

Retardos love triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarnate the flattening of the price accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is theatre stonk\u2019s price action after the breakout. \\*\\* GME: \"Hold my beer\" \\*\\* I'm pretty much convinced, that the triangle on GME chart above is how the Mother Of All Triangles must look like.\n\nButth waaitt, therrz moooore!

Not just general intelligence but incompetence in individual fields. \n\nIf you haven't beaten the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you got a bit unlucky. If you've managed to beat the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you're an investing god. That ego can make you broke, and now is the time for a humility check. \n\nYou're in this subreddit. If you're reading this, do you think you're better than the top investors out there- Burry, Dalio, Wood, Buffet? Well, maybe you are, but statistically, you're probably not. \n\nSo, what do the top investors say lately? Here's my interpretation:\n\nBurry: We're in the biggest speculative bubble of all time in all things.   \nAssets under management (AUM): $635 million\n\nDalio: US Bonds are crap, US equities are frothy, tech is bubble-ish. Get into emerging markets. China isn't so bad.   \nAUM: $140 billion\n\nBuffet: I'll reduce my positions and wait for a better entry.  \nAUM: $632 billion\n\nWood: Innovation will lead to enormous GDP and productivity growth over the next 5-10 years.   \nAUM: $53 billion\n\n=============================================\n\nIf you've been following financial news this year you probably know that Burry started shorting TSLA back in Dec 2020 and has been crying wolf that we're in a bubble since this spring. Ever since then the market has gone up a lot. Doesn't that make him wrong this time? Not necessarily, no. In fact, that means we might be in an even bigger bubble than we were earlier this year. Luckily for him, seems like he learned from last time to hedge his shorts too, and bought FB and GOOG calls in case the market continues to rocket, which have printed hard. \n\n Speculation is at an all-time high. Look at this chart of subscriber count for WSB:\n\n[I'm guessing most of these new subscribers aren't YOLOing on OTM SPY puts every week.](https://preview.redd.it/50kiiie6zbn71.png?width=3010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c4c7817c548515eae1823cc2f0e986565522ea9)\n\nTake a look at this chart of TSLA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhh5i2tfzbn71.png?width=2492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c354ae8100a048cf81176d619ddaaa5f51b4dda\n\nAnd compare it to the standard asset bubble chart here:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hngourvbycn71.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9175668887dbb1f5639fd54ce395c38865b0a879\n\nNow with fundamentals way off, TA lining up, and lots of possible macroeconomic issues in the near future, this looks to me like a great setup for a short. Now of course, nothing is certain in the markets. BUT, if the bubble is about to pop, this could be the trading opportunity of a lifetime. That's why I'm going short. \n\n\"Burry is a value-shill permabear\"\n\nBurry was long on a bunch of equities at the bottom of the pandemic last year, he bought GME at $5.

He has consistently beaten the market in bad years and good years too. \n\n\"Burry is smart but he is wrong about TSLA\"\n\nIf you won't follow Burry, then how about following Wood?[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/09/09/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-110-million-in-tesla-stock-as-insiders-also-dump-shares/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/09/09/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-110-million-in-tesla-stock-as-insiders-also-dump-shares/)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/technology/cathie-woods-ark-funds-bought-246-million-coinbase-shares-2021-04-15/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cathie-woods-ark-funds-bought-246-million-coinbase-shares-2021-04-15/)\n\n\"Cathie Wood gives TSLA a $3k price target\"\n\nWood, Dalio, and Buffet have such high AUM that their positions can be highly illiquid. That is, even if they knew they positions were overvalued, they aren't always able to get out of before causing panic in the underlying. For this reason, you always have to take what they say with a grain of salt. Wood, who is a brilliant investor, would obviously not say that TSLA is overvalued, same that Dalio will not say that BABA is a risky stock to hold. It's a perfect case of \"do as I say, not as I do.\" So instead of listening to what they say, which is always going to be biased, try looking at what they do. \n\nAnd lately, Wood has been selling TSLA. When the **bulls start selling**, it might be a good time to get out. \n\nTSLA JAN 2022 670 PUT\n\nThis is not financial advice, do your own DD.",

        "selftext": "Lehman brothers was a critical part of the financial system that, when it went down, caused credit freezes that domino'd into more financial crisis. Due to the nature of their business, it makes sense them blowing up could really domino, but..\n\nEvergrande is just a real estate developer. Investors will get screwed, sure, but how can this really cause financial dominos like in 2008? The bears seem really excited about this and keep posting articles and charts about how BLK and other US and international firms are the biggest bagolders. But when I look further into this I see that these firms are hardly exposed. It's pennies in their portfolios and probably less than they'd lose on a bad 1 minute candle in the equity markets.\n\nThey quote the $300b worth of bonds that will be worthless, but that's not that much to the global economy, realistically. More wealth is destroyed on a bad day for $AAPL. Additionally these were junk bonds for a long time. Were not talking triple a mortgage bonds that were \"too big to fail\" and unsinkable like the titanic.\n\nThis all also assumes that the chinese government will sit on their hands and watch a crisis unfold, when that seems super unlikely. Say what you will about the CCP, but they're not gonna let all their stellar economic growth crumble when they have:\n1. More power and political will than the US did to tackle such a crisis\n2. The ability to plan their economy to recover from any domino effects unlike more \"free market\" economies \n3. Knowledge of previous global housing crashes/financial crises to draw from\n\nMaybe I'm an idiot but I just don't see how anybody should think this will cause a serious bear market in the US or elsewhere. Chinese stocks are already beat down hard so I can't see those selling off too much more either. I'm inclined to buy the dip if it keeps dippening into this week.

        "selftext": "Ever since GMREEEE this sub has been filled with people from r/all calling for the end of payment for order flow for a variety of reasons.  Now the front page has a news article talking about how the SEC chair is thinking about ending payment for order flow.  I just wanted to say that if you're against payment for order flow there's probably a 95 percent chance that you don't know what a call condor spread is.  PFOF gives you no or reduced commissions and also makes the options market more liquid.  Here are some arguments against PFOF that I've seen on this sub:\n\n1. HedGe FuNd GiVe BAd FiL.\n\n       In reality you can set the price for what you want your options to be filled at.  This can be done by making a FUCKING LIMIT ORDER.  There is probably not a single professional option trader that buys or sells options with a market order.  Options are, by their nature, illiquid on a majority of underlyings given that you have thousands of combinations of strikes and dates to choose from.  Again, especially if you trade spreads, you should be placing limit orders for your positions.  Also, if you remove PFOF this liquidity issue will only get worse.  This is just the reality of gutting several billion dollar firms that write and buy options.  Less money in the options market means less liquidity.\n\n2. HooDgE FunD ManiPuLaeT MarkET wItH my OrDeR InForMatIoN\n\n       I can right now go on my think or swim platform and scan for options orders under 10k (or however large you want) and look at the bid/ask spread to tell if this trader bought or sold these options.  If I really wanted to I could go into the API and make a robot that does this for me and organizes all this information into some sort of bullshit spreadsheet.  Small orders like these (the kind retail makes) provide a reasonable guess as to where retail is positioned.  I'm just some jack off wsb troll with a think or swim account and I have already laid how how to detect retail positions.  If I can do it then the big dogs certainly can do the same even without payment for order flow.  \n\n   One more thing: If you lose money on your 10 delta put it's because it was a bad trade, not because some Algo picked out your 5 lot position and spent millions of dollars manipulating the market to shake you out of your 200 dollar position.",

        "selftext": "I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t seen any explanations on WSB (at least in recent months) about how the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust works, and how it helps to fuel the epic short squeeze going on in Uranium right now.\n\nThe physical trusts offered by Sprott are closed-end funds, meaning that when investors sell the fund, Sprott does not have to go out and also sell Uranium to fund outflows.\n\nIn other words, once uranium hits the Sprott vaults, it might as well be declared retired forever. \n\nThey are structurally diamond handed, which is important for a short squeeze to continue.\n\nSo how does more metal enter the fund?\n\nSprott has filed an \u2018at the money\u2019 share offering where they can issue new shares of the fund any time it trades at a premium to the fund\u2019s net asset value.\n\nEssentially whenever investors get excited and bid up the price of the ETF such that that shares are being bought for more than their underlying value, Sprott will issue new shares, sell them into the market (which helps bring down the premium), and then use this cash to buy more uranium for the fund.\n\nIn the span of a month investors already added enough uranium to the fund to exhaust Sprott\u2019s $300 million offering.\n\nLast week they filed a new offering to increase it from a $300 million program, to a $1,300 million ($1.3 billion) program.\n\nWhile this filing process has been ongoing the past few days, Sprott has not been issuing new shares. So inflows into the fund are driving up the premium to NAV.\n\nThe premium now sits at a record high 28.5%.\n\nFor perspective, during the Uranium surge that took price from the $20s to the $40s over the past month, the typical premium for the fund was in the mid single digit %s.\n\nSo 28.5% is absolutely remarkable. This is a dam about to break and drown everyone who lives on the other side. Once Sprott is able to issue shares once again, it will now be able to buy more uranium out of the market than anyone thought possible. $180-$200 is entirely possible here as a blow off top (currently at $45 a pound).\n\nAnd this is a minuscule market, so sprott\u2019s buying directly drives the price up. And because market participants know the price of uranium is effectively guaranteed to rise because of this guaranteed source of pent up demand, they are are willing to pay for the premium in the uranium fund to get a piece of the action. \n\nThis of course only drives the premium of the fund up further, allowing Sprott to issue even more shares, buy even more uranium, sending the uranium price up further, exciting more investors who will buy the fund, and the cycle repeats \n\nThis is effectively a short squeeze where the buying is being telegraphed ahead of time. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the short squeeze has begun, but buying here is the equivalent of buying GME a when it was in the $50-$100 range on the initial surge.\n\nSo what tickers can be offered up here? \n\nNot many, because the uranium space is tiny and WSB has a $1.5 billion market cap minimum.\n\nOptions? You can, but premiums are absurd now that the squeeze has already begun.\n\n$CCJ is one ticker you\u2019ve likely heard of, and it\u2019s the only one with mkt cap large enough to mention directly.  \n\nSprott Uranium Trust is the vehicle I\u2019ve written about here where you can buy uranium directly (rather than miners), and directly contribute to the squeeze, but I also can\u2019t post the ticker yet due to mkt cap concerns. It\u2019s also only available in Canadian and otc markets, but Sprott is trying to get it listed on the NYSE as well for the future. You can buy it via Fidelity and a few other brokers right now though. \n\nNorthshore uranium etf has lots of miners in it but a mkt cap of $350m so no ticker\n\nWant to sell shovels rather than set out on a mining adventure yourself? Sprott the company owns the uranium trust driving this whole thing and collects fees from it. Benefiting from the inflows into the fund as well as the underlying price appreciation of uranium.  They also have direct exposure to several uranium miners they\u2019ve invested in. They also aren\u2019t big enough yet at $1 billion to post the ticker.\n\nThis uranium short squeeze, powered by the Sprott physical trust is everything the silver squeeze should and could have been back in the first quarter.  If silver squeezers had bought the Sprott physical fund, PSLV, rather than ishares SLV, silver would be far higher now. Let this be an example of what\u2019s possible in commodities when physical demand overwhelms a relatively limited supply of available metal!",

These small 20-5 cent fighhts each day dont mean shit to me.\n\nAnother example , tesla oh shit its been inthe 600-700 range for a while , idc cause im holding for a few years.\n\nInvesting is buying into a company that you believe due to dd is going to be worth more over the long run and you  **dont give 2 fucks about the daily /weekly price battles.** \n\ntrading on the other hand is = whats the catalyst? Trading is in my opinion figuring out what the catalyst us and using that catalyst ti your advantage.\n\nHere let me put it like this spce had a catalyst which was that launch thing(space mission) . Tradrers bought a position before the launch and after the launch they sold off. Really it was right b4 the launch actually happened. But you see what i mean. \n\nShit nvidia had a stock split announcement , thats a catalyst for traders to buy lots of shares of it and sell off on the split date.  Again trading on a catalyst .\n\nShit the catalyst could be a TA for instance netflix was trading in a 500-600 channel. When netflix dropped close to its support traders bought into it as it bounced off the 500 support and ran back to the 600 resistance ... yall see?\n\n**Trading is finding a catalyst for a stock and then figuring out how it will effect the stock price in the short term and using it to your advantage.**\n\nTHis isnt financial advice. This is just a bunch of my opinions i want to share with yall",

        "selftext": "Cam across this today:\n\nTrading memestonks on your phone is all fun and games -- that is, until you get slapped with an $800k tax bill.\n\nHow? If inexperienced traders run afoul of the \u201cwash sale rule,\u201d taxes could outweigh gains.\n\nA what sale?\nA wash sale is when you sell a security at a loss, then buy it or a [\u201csubstantially identical\u201d](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substantiallyidenticalsecurity.asp) security 30 days before or after the sale.\n\nThe wash sale rule means you can\u2019t take a tax deduction on that loss. It\u2019s to stop people from using wash sales to increase tax benefits, but you can trigger it without even knowing it exists.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\nYou buy 100 shares at $10/share for $1k\nLater, you sell them at $7/share for $700 -- a loss of $300\nThe next week, you repurchase them at $6/share for $600\nDue to the wash sale rule, that loss is added to the cost basis, meaning your $600 repurchase becomes $900.\n\nWhen you sell your shares again, your original loss is applied to the adjusted cost basis. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll use on your taxes.\n\nSo, how do you get an $800k tax bill?\nThat example\u2019s an outlier, but the unidentified retail trader told financial advisor Brian Wruk he did it by going berserk on Robinhood, per [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaharziv/2021/03/26/robinhood-trader-may-face-800000-tax-bill/?sh=4792a11a67c7)\n\nThe man opened a Robinhood account in 2020. He put up $30k, but Robinhood gave him $90k on margin. He then did 10 to 50 trades daily.\n\nHe ultimately:\n\nGenerated $45m (yep, million) in gross proceeds\nProfited by $45k\nHad $1.4m in capital gains tax\nAnd a potential tax bill of $800k+\n\u201cHe booked a profit but was disallowed all the losses because he never once waited the 30 days on those stocks to book the loss,\u201d Wruk said.\n\nAnd short-term gains are taxed like ordinary income. Yikes.\n\nThe moral of the story: Let your stocks marinate at least 30 days, lest you become a cautionary tale!\n\n\nAnother article: https://mullooly.net/800k-taxes-45k-profits/",

        "selftext": "This post is going to be about why IRNT presents one of the greatest squeeze opportunities that WSB and retail investors have ever seen. Because the company has only been trading for 2 weeks, it's hard to analyze technicals other than volume. Thankfully, the short interest and float are the main reasons why this stock presents such a great opportunity, so those will be analyzed below.\n\n**\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Investing is risky and high short interest plays are even riskier. You should talk to a financial professional before making any investment decisions and should do your own research\\***\n\n**Short Interest Stats and Analysis**\n\nTo put it simply, the short interest on IRNT is absolutely insane. Combine that with the fact that it's a newly trading company (and susceptible to more volatility) and has a VERY low float, and you have a recipe for an absolute slam dunk.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at Fintel and iBorrow desk. iBorrowdesk has consistently shown the borrow fee to be over 500% and the available shares to be far below 10,000. Similarly, fintel has consistently showed less than 1,000 shares available to borrow. Though some people don't trust these sites, the similarities in the data help to add credibility\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qubmtqnjxjn71.png?width=1270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e966aee1e3deb1b3f19bb4edfebeb4090e3bb1a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yuuj6skkxjn71.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97cbe756d2845006ddb0c35e624032935587c4a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0vhzl9lxjn71.png?width=986&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=082680490a232aa61f456c8a4492050d51e5baef\n\nI'd also like to turn your attention to [this post by another WSB user](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/). This post analyzes how the extremely low float of this stock due to it being a new stock and the insane option OI presents the opportunity for a legitimate gamma squeeze - not some fake hype run up - a legitimate gamma squeeze similar to GME's first run up.\n\nIf you look at websites like Baron's they'll tell you that the SI as a % of the float is only 1.79% (about 700,000 shares). This is correct but doesn't tell the whole story. Because of redemptions and lockups, the actual float is 1.3m shares, which makes the real short interest on tradable shares about 56%. Interestingly, [Ihor's tweet](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1437512870351282177?s=19) shows that the borrow fee is asininely high, which again shows the difficulty of borrowing of this stock and thus the easy possibility of a short squeeze. 56% short interest is an amazing number in and of itself, but that's not the whole story. The thing about this stock that really gets me going is the options activity. The OI on options of this stock is absolutely bananas right now. Remember when I said that there are about 1.3M tradable shares due to it being a new stock post-merger? Well, at a $20 price, almost double that amount is held in ITM calls alone. THAT is why the stock has serious gamma squeeze potential. Remember, both the GME and VW squeezes happened because ITM options OI outnumbered the float of companies that were already heavily shorted - this is the power of a gamma squeeze. Most meme stocks that have been \"squeezing\" recently have been small short squeezes due to retail traders and HFs taking advantage of social sentiment. The reason that we haven't seen a violent squeeze recently is because there hasn't been a stock with options activity like this - until IRNT.\n\nAdditionally, you probably saw that the stock went up to almost $40 last week out of nowhere. Again, this is the power of a low float stock with high ITM call OI. If this stock starts picking up, the low float and call OI could propel it to meme stock legend status.\n\nFurthermore, data from ortex has also consistently shown a SI of over 300% and a cost to borrow over 500%, which is consistent with the sources listed above. Yes, the SI is definitely a plus, but again, the real power here is the gamma squeeze potential.\n\n(The above four paragraph's were heavily borrowed from the originally linked user, so please check out his post).\n\nMany people will probably not believe some of these shorting numbers and will consider them unreliable because of how new the stock is. That's understandable. However, if you're in that camp, let me present to you this: the NYSE's regulationSHO FTD list. Per SEC regulations, stocks that reach over a certain amount of FTDs are placed on regulation SHO's threshold list. This is a very small list and identifies stocks that are grossly over-shorted (FTDs being the evidence of that). GME was on this list for a very long time before it squeezed. So if you don't believe the websites's SI numbers, then you at least have to believe the NYSE's numbers about FTDs. When a stock has too many FTDs, it means that it is extremely hard to locate shares and repay borrowers, which is a sign of over-shorting. Here is the NYSE list:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z5q0vbtmxjn71.png?width=2710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e76c960abd9f88936b898b3dbebbf5d82519a9cb\n\nNotice the second to last one? DING DING DING. Though being on the threshold list signifies overshorting, there is yet another thing that we can take from this - forced covering. IRNT has been on that list since 9/2. Per regulationSHO, after 6 TRADING days on the list (9/10), stricter location requirements for shorting are put in place. Take a look at the giant green uptick that we saw on 9/10. 13 TRADING days on the list and forced coverings start taking place where a market-maker is subject to fines and loses his or her market making abilities if this regulation is violated. 13 TRADING days after 9/2 is 9/21. Remember all of those call options I talked about above, well they will be exercised on Friday 9/17. So, let's review what we have: an extremely high reported short interest (you can believe it's 600%, 300%, 56%, whatever), an extremely low an restricted float, ITM options expiring on Friday that outnumber the total float, the stock being on the threshold list indicating over-shorting, forced coverings taking place right around when those options would have to be delivered. Again, this is exactly what we saw with GME. It's important to note however, that this is also an issue of timing - the stock is likely to have a gamma squeeze sometime late this week and through next week. After that, there's a good chance that covering could lead to the stock being taken off of the threshold list.\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nThink that IRNT is just a squeezable meme stock with no long term potential as an investment? Wrong. The stock is not like most meme stocks - it actually is a good underlying business. According to an article by a website not allowed on here (just copy and past the quote in google to find it), \"With the company\u2019s international expansion, M&amp;A initiatives, and cloud acceleration, under my most optimistic case scenario, the company is worth $55 per share. If IronNet continues to sign agreements with nation states and companies like CrowdStrike did, I believe that the upside potential is significant.\" The article discusses how the company's AI initiatives, cyber security focus, and cloud acceleration, all of which are some of the most important and up and coming technology sectors, poise it to go up in value significantly. Additionally, the company also just reported earnings. Though the earnings were lower than expected, take a look at the after hours activity - the shorts have no juice left.\n\n**Conclusion/TL;DR**\n\nSo there you have it. in my opinion, IRNT is an EXTREMELY good stock fundamentally so I will be holding it long term. HOWEVER, the stock also presents a rare gamma squeeze - short squeeze opportunity that retail hasn't seen since GME. The stock has an extremely high reported short interest, an extremely small float, open interest on ITM call options that outnumbers the current float, is on the regulationSHO threshold list indicating that it has extremely high short interest and possible naked shorting, has been on that list for a significant amount of time, and the ITM options that outnumber the float are expiring right around when shorts would be forced to cover their FTDs. In other words, an absolute grand slam.\n\n**\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Investing is risky and high short interest plays are even riskier.

Investing in plays like this is extremely risky and you should do your own research or consult with a financial advisor prior to making financial decisions\\*\\***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello everyone, yesterday I made a post about why I think IRNT is one of the best opportunities retail has ever seen. Generally, this post got very good reactions but there were definitely some people who said I was retarded and that the play was dead. Though I definitely am retarded, the play is clearly not dead. Now that I have your attention about the potential of IRNT and you've seen SOME of it's potential, I'd like to discuss the stock more.  \n\nFirst, I wanted to link the recent DDs of IRNT that have been on this sub: \n\n[My recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/poe2gb/irnt_is_the_one_of_the_greatest_opportunities/)\n\n[The post I referenced in my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/)\n\n[An update to the above post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pobzn6/update_irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_273_of_float/)\n\nThere are probably others as well but these are the ones that I based my DD off of\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Summary of the IRNT play**\n\nIRNT recently started trading. Websites are reporting a short interests of 56% 233% and all the way up to 550%. Websites like iBorrowdesk and Fintel are consistently reporting less than 1000 borrowable shares. Because of redemptions and lockups, the float is extremely limited to about 1.3m shares. Unlike most stocks in this position, the stock has options that would only be available to a stock with 10x larger float. Additionally, the amount of options that are ITM and are expiring ITM on Friday outnumbers the total float. In most stocks on this sub that have squeezed, short interest has been the only factor. This stock, however, is similar to AMC and GME in that it has a disgustingly high short interest AND the ITM options expiring on Friday out number the float. That is why this stock has the highest squeeze potential since GME and AMC. Additionally, the stock is on NYSE threshold list, which indicates that it has too many FTDs, which is further evidence for this play. Very few stocks make it on this list and it is a sign of over-shorting. The stock has been on that list since 9/2 and, per regulationSHO, forced deliveries of FTDs will begin next week. The aligning of forced delivery of FTDs, option delivery, and an insanely low float presents a unique opportunity. There has been some confusion as to whether this play ends on Friday or if it goes into next week. The answer is unequivocally that the play goes into next week - that will be explained below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Next week is the real play**\n\nThere has been great confusion about this play regarding the lockup period. I have had several people message me and comment saying that the lockup period ends on Friday, which would allow more shares to come into the market and would end the play. This confusion comes from how people have interpreted point 1. of u/stonkgodcapital first post:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6v7id3mcrpn71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=278bdafec942c361184281add312aa739542f170\n\nI have talked to the user to clarify this and have done my own research to ensure this is accurate. When I talked to him, he confirmed that he was saying the redemptions and lockups will keep the float at 1.3 million AFTER options expire Friday. He was not saying the lockup ends on Sept 17. He was saying that the float will remain small WELL AFTER options expire this week, so when options must be delivered next week and the float is still small, a squeeze could happen because the shares that must be delivered outnumber the float. I also did further digging. I could not find a single source that said ANYTHING about more shares being added to the float anytime soon, lockups ending soon, etc. I looked at [IRNT's form 8-k](https://docoh.com/filing/1777946/0001193125-21-263381/IRNT-8K) and found that the lockup ends 180 days after August 26, 2021. This makes sense because that is a typical length for SPAC lockup periods. So, in case you did not understand: THE LOCKUP DOES NOT END FRIDAY AND THE FLOAT WILL REMAIN MINISCULE NEXT WEEK WHICH WILL ALLOW A SQUEEZE TO HAPPEN.\n\nTherefore, the real play here is next week because: the float will still be small, shares will have to be delivered next week and the amount will outnumber the float because of the current OI on options expiring Friday, and forced delivery of FTDs will also occur next week due to the stock being on the threshold list since 9/2. HOWEVER, because of the low float and high Reddit interest, I do expect this stock to continue trending up for the rest of the week - so we very well could see extremely high prices come friday but I still believe that next week is when we see the peak.\n\nWhat happened last week was after IRNT initially popped, then people lost interest, so it fell back down. Today, the stock got more interest and absolutely took off - that's the power of a low float stock. However, this stock presents a special opportunity because it has a low float AND the number of ITM options that could be exercised next week outnumbers the current float of the stock - that's why this is one of the best opportunities WSB has ever seen. If this stock continues to gain traction, there is nothing that can stop it because of its low float. \n\n**Earnings**\n\nIRNT also reported earnings yesterday (it's called a surprise earnings and is because it's newly trading). The earnings report showed a wider than expected loss. An earnings report of that kind should make the stock go down or, at the very least, be flat for the day. Being up 20%+ makes no sense, so the only explanation is that the squeeze theory for this stock is correct. Please note that this is a side bar and has basically no bearing on the play - I just included it because earnings happened yesterday. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIRNT is the first play since GME and AMC to have a disturbingly high short interest, extremely low float, and ITM options expiring in the near term that outnumber the float. This stock has both short squeeze and gamma squeeze potential. It is important to note that the lockup DOES NOT end on Friday, it ends 180 days from August 26. Because the lockup does not end soon (keeping the float small), ITM options will have to be delivered next week, and regulationSHO will require delivery next week, this play GETS BIG next week - we will probably see more gains this week, but next week is when it gets real. \n\nI am still in on the play and have no touched my position since yesterday. See my previous post for a screenshot of my position. I plan to hold all of my shares until well into next week. Depending on price action, I may sell my options for deep OTM calls at an earlier horizon to take advantage of next week's price jump. \n\n**\\*\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.

        "selftext": "Chewy is an e-commerce retailer of pet food and supplies, mainly active in the USA. Last quarter they posted USD 2.14bn in revenue from 19.8 million customers (600k of which were new additions). For Q2 they project 2.15-2.17 billion in revenue for a very modest 1% q-o-q growth. \n\nI think they'll outdo their (very conservative) revenue guidance, but fall short on customer additions for the quarter and revenue guidance for the following quarters. Chewy is currently trading at the upper end of its historical P/S ratio, (save for a brief time in Jan/Feb 2021 when it was even higher than today). It\u2019s P/S of 4.76 is relatively high for its industry (as it is a low margin retailer, not a platform business). It\u2019s actually higher than Amazon, which I would argue is too high to make sense and I expect a short-term downside re-evaluation of Chewy after earnings.\n\n**Reasons**\n\n* **Competition catching up**\n\nThe key investment thesis for Chewy has been \"Fast-growing pet e-commerce industry\" and \"growing faster than its competition in its fast-growing industry\". I believe the second reason may be moderating. While Chewy is the clear market leader, I'm seeing several signs that its competitors (in both e-commerce and retail) are slowly catching up. Walmart (biggest brick and mortal pet retailer) just reported a big revenue beat. Petsmart (brick and mortar focused) is looking to increase revenue this year following a bad 2020. Petco reported great earnings two weeks ago. \n\nThese good results could be because the overall market (\"pet ecommerce\") is expanding. I don't think so. The market expansion took place in 2020, the number of adopted pets is on a clear downtrend. If most other big players are doing quite well, I suspect they are doing so at the expense of Chewy. \n\n* **Low net customers additions**\n\nIn Q1 2021 Chewy added a net 600k customers, their lowest absolute increase in two years. I expect them to report even lower additions this quarter as they follow up Q2 of 2020, their biggest quarter of customer additions ever. 1 year is a very typical \"cliff\" during which many former customers start to churn (according to Chewy CEO Sumit Singh). Since they haven't increased their marketing spend significantly this Q, I expect high churn and low gross additions, which is a bad early sign for growth companies. \n\n[Customer additions per quarter](https://preview.redd.it/dkmcffawmxk71.png?width=799&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5521fbd76802f34cacbc31617550af9f34177b9e)\n\n* **Moderating growth rates in a fast-growth industry**\n\nChewy's app store rankings in Q2 have been at its lowest level since February 2019. Who downloads apps from the store? New customers, usually. Remember the part where I think they will have unexpectedly low gross customer additions this quarter?\n\n[Petco App gaining ground on Chewy](https://preview.redd.it/z5yvwgzjnxk71.png?width=1616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38c746658cf948bc19a514b436ada7ed21cc071a)\n\nPetco is clearly aggressively promoting their app which is currently nearly as popular as Chewy's. You can see how their spikes coincide with drops in Chewy's ranking, leading me to believe that Chewy is losing more business than usual to its competition.\n\n* **Profitability**\n\nWhile profitability is less relevant for Chewy, on Q1 earnings they were relatively sanguine about their expected costs for 2021. Since then I expect hiring, material and logistics costs to have gone up quite a bit, which might result in them offering a more pessimistic profitability guidance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary: Chewy has achieved a high PS ratio thanks to its promise of outgrowing its competitors in a market that is already fast-growing in itself. I believe their competitive advantage is eroding ever so slightly and will result in earnings that Wall Street doesn't like. \n\n**Short interest**\n\nChewy currently has what I would consider a relatively large short interest considering its relatively strong fundamentals. As of August, 16.4% of the short was floated. Make of that what you will. \n\n**Risks**\n\n* A lot of Chewy customers actually use autoship, which may distort the data I'm looking at and allow them to surprise to the upside on revenue\n* I do all my shopping for my pets on Chewy\n\n**Positions**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpekcjdcpxk71.png?width=331&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6c05b0d43d825435b4e3ef664c4ca05d062dd67",

        "selftext": "Are we done?\n\nNo, of course not.\n\nDidn't have time earlier, but wanted to explain how shorts are actively attacking your options positions and in doing so leave themselves open to future regulations. \n\n**Post summary (tldr)**\n\n\\- Shorts attempting to knock price below strikes are hurting themselves when the MM(s) hedge.\n\n\\- Short interest at 49mil should be understood next to the 97mil float of which 86mil shares are owned by institutions. This means that short interest in **500% larger** than daily trading float.\n\n\\- CTB is increasing significantly, by multiples now and the result of which is likely FTD regulation.\n\n**Short strategies**\n\nWe're seeing the same pattern after hours currently that we saw the last couple days.\n\nShort playbook\n\n1. Destroy momentum by shorting any perceived breakout (there were net 1.2mil shares shorted today). \n2. Market sell huge orders to encourage strike breaking and selling to also achieve this.\n\nBut... Didn't work so well, because when price moves beyond the strike threshold, the MM(s) generally choose to hedge their risk. This is well known, but I took some crayons to draw the picture to make it easily understandable.\n\n[Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/v2fao3x355o71.png?width=3219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98447970ab5457d1f0ede10d79d3e2433eaf40bf)\n\nThis is happening after hours right now. I'm curious what will end up happening here. Short's goals are to knock it down below $6.5 by market extended close at 8:00pm set to render calls useless. From the looks right now, seems like it's not working.\n\n**Constrained float**\n\nThis is why I'm extremely bullish. Stupidly bullish.\n\nTurns out institutions own so much of the float that the actual daily trading float is only 1/5th the size of the amounts of shorts. That's right. **There are 500% more shorts than typically available shares to trade**.\n\n[Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/ck4kijx555o71.png?width=1509&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f40592f07ad91ef0d443411775a8ba135b09f33)\n\n**Total float: 96,000,000** (Bloomberg)\n\n**Institution shares: 86,000,000** (Bloomberg)\n\n**Actively traded float: 10,000,000**\n\nRead that again. There are 10,000,000 (10mil) shares generally traded unless an institutions offloads which happens rarely.\n\n**Shorts: 49,000,000** (Ortex)\n\nYou read that right.\n\nThere are 49mil shares compared to an actively traded float of 10mil. Literally 5 to 1. 500%. This is insane. So what will happen to price? Nobody knows - but here are the price levels. Price moves quite quickly between stops since high frequency alto's run this all.\n\n[More crayons](https://preview.redd.it/hftm51m755o71.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f877a0800068d845c31bed37258c33e7fc5ce2b0)\n\n**Future FTDs?**\n\nAlmost assuredly. CTB is spiking - this means there is extreme demand for shorts and limited supply. FTDs are when shorts are lent to sell short but aren't actually available in the Dealer's inventory to deal out. When this happens enough, securities are placed on the [FTD regulation list](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=RegSHO) which means significantly more restrictions and forced closeouts - highly bullish to price.\n\nHere's the chart of CTB. \n\n[CTB spike](https://preview.redd.it/mkxzrfq855o71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d71c3b9894accd2aa6819d4bfcabef1f286432c)\n\nThis is beginning to move from linear to exponential and implies severe pressure on dealers to keep up with demand. In my opinion, it's a short amount of time before this happens.\n\nIn tandem with the reg SHO list comes our favorite short squeezes (GME, AMC, IRNT, SPIR, etc etc etc). Except this company has 80% institutional holdings and no lockups expiring... Think you can see where I'm heading here.\n\n**Positions**\n\nAlready submitted my positions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppf22c/sdc_80k_yolo_45million_short_shares_aint_no_joke/) and have additionally bought 8,000 more shares at $6.72.\n\nCheers folks",

        "selftext": "**This might be good news after the rout in China tech since Feb 2021. There was a lot of uncertainty whether China is shutting itself off from foreign capital and how it could lead to delisting of ADRs like BABA, BIDU, JD, PDD, NIO, etc. But I guess they won't be turning their heads away from foreign investors anytime soon.**\n\nBEIJING, Sept 6 (Reuters) - China will further open its capital markets to foreign investors, the country's top securities regulator said on Monday, adding that it will pursue pragmatic cross-border cooperation to regulate overseas-listed Chinese companies.\n\nGlobal investors have been spooked in recent months by a flurry of Chinese regulations targeting sectors ranging from technology to private tutoring. U.S. plans to kick non-compliant Chinese firms off American exchanges has fuelled concern.\n\n\"Opening-up and cooperation is the inevitable trend in the integrated development of global capital markets,\" China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Yi Huiman told a conference organised by the World Federation of Exchanges.\n\nChina is studying further measures, including expanding the scope of the stock connect scheme linking China and Hong Kong and improving the Shanghai-London Stock Connect program, Yi said in a speech posted on CSRC's website.\n\nMeanwhile, CSRC will conduct \"pragmatic\" cooperation in areas such as supervision of overseas-listed Chinese companies, cross-border auditing and law enforcement, he added.\n\nYi said that given interwoven global markets, governments should abandon the mentality of a \"zero-sum game\", as companies and investors share both the boom and the doom.\n\nGlobal financial centres should facilitate cross-border financing, \"rather than become the platforms and tools governments use to sanction other countries\", Yi said, without mentioning the United States.\n\nYi's speech came a day after CSRC vice chairman Fang Xinghai made similar pledges to further deregulate China's markets.\n\nChina will expand the channels for foreign capital to invest in Chinese securities and futures markets, and will further facilitate the issuance of yuan-denominated \"Panda bonds\" by foreign institutions, Fang told a separate conference on Sunday.\n\nChina will also improve domestic listing rules for overseas entities, as well as regulations on overseas listings of Chinese companies, Fang said in a speech also posted on CSRC's website.\n\nFang also vowed to safeguard Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre, saying that Beijing supports domestic companies listing in Hong Kong.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-will-improve-opening-up-capital-market-securities-regulator-2021-09-06/",

        "selftext": "A lot of people said Tesla is an \"AI\" company, not an electric car company from this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjlah0/disney\\_is\\_to\\_netflix\\_as\\_x\\_is\\_to\\_tesla/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjlah0/disney_is_to_netflix_as_x_is_to_tesla/)\n\nThe thesis is that Tesla is far ahead in its self-driving capabilities that other car makers just can't catch up. And because they already have cars on the road now, they are collecting more data which is making their lead wider.\n\nMy thoughts are below. Agree or disagree?\n\n* Self-driving tech will be a commodity, not concentrated in a few\n* Carmakers who can't create their own will license it from third parties like Waymo, Cruise, Aurora, and [40+ other companies.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/autonomous-driverless-vehicles-corporations-list/)\n* If 40+ companies are looking to create this tech, it shows that self-driving is hard but still doable for so many companies big and small. This is an indication that there isn't any moat in self-driving capabilities.\n* There is actually a Udemy course on creating a self-driving car. No, you can't take this course and then create an autonomous car on the road. But it is a sign that self-driving capabilities will be a commodity that many companies will have. There isn't a Udemy course on how to create a Facebook competitor with billions of users. That's moat. Self-driving doesn't have moat.\n* I live in San Francisco, and Cruise, Waymo, Uber (before they sold their unit), Apple, and a few others have been testing self-driving cars on the road for 4-5 years. It's very common to see a self-driving car (with a driver) on the road here that is not a Tesla.\n* Regarding data gathering advantage: Companies can gather data without selling cars. Waymo has been doing this for a decade. No car company is going to release self-driving software expecting it to have deficiencies and expecting data gathered from consumers to fix those deficiencies. This isn't like a beta app. It's life and death. No one wants to be in a beta self-driving car.  All self-driving cars will meet a minimum standard due to regulation.\n* If any company is way ahead in self-driving, it's actually Waymo, not Tesla. They just launched a self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, a dense city with weird roads and many pedestrians.",

        "selftext": "The IAA has been open for the last 4 days, but I hadn\u2019t been able to properly experience the MicroVision booth until now. I didn\u2019t want to distract Sumit Sharma, Dr. Luce, and the other 3 MVIS staff who attended from their B2B (business to business) goals. However, today was the first day that the general public were allowed to enter the conference halls, and Dave Allen from IR gave us the green light to go visit the booth.\n\nWhen I arrived at the booth with /u/MusicMaleficent5870, Sumit and Dr. Luce were nowhere in sight. We nevertheless decided to go in and speak to the MVIS staff. I personally spoke with Jonathan C (who I believe is the Director of Digital Engineering, thx Linkedin stalking). Jonathan walked me through the booth while MM5870 kept the other two MVIS staff members occupied. I introduced myself as a moderator of reddit and handed him my gag card..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ gag business card ](https://preview.redd.it/2zfx6lvzukm71.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8d919fd1ec5803c6f78d7c5c186b60c299b19b9)\n\n# Live Lidar Demo\n\nAn important note Jonathan mentioned was that two A-Samples were actively scanning the booth. One directly above the live demo screens (that sits on the *in*famous block of wood which I couldn\u2019t see even at a relative far distance), and one directly across from that in the back right hand corner.\n\nThe point of having two Lidars actively scanning is to showcase MicroVision\u2019s proprietary active scan lock architecture which allows the A-Sample to actively block out 99% of outside interference (as communicated to shareholders on multiple occasions in past earnings calls). As per past earnings calls the active scan lock architecture is based on proprietary technologies proven in their applications used in the Hololens 2.\n\nIn short, the Active Scan lock synchronizes the \u201csend\u201d and \u201creceiving\u201d side of the Gen 5 MEMS just as the Hololens 2 displays are sync\u2019d for the left and right eyes to prevent ocular discomfort (Sumit used a word I didn't recognize to describe that if the left eye and right eye images dont line up you get discomfort. I don\u2019t have education or background in this so could barely keep up). Each Lidar sensor is encoded its own laser signals and excludes interference even from similar identical units.\n\nFor example that if you were stuck in an intersection with 20 cars, each with their own set of short-range lidar (SRL), mid-range lidar (MRL), and long-range lidar (LRL). The IR light pollution and interference will overwhelm other sensors that do not have this feature that MicroVision owns IP for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ The second A-Sample live scanning acting as \\\\\"interference\\\\\" above the television which is showing the 1.8M Long Range Point Cloud. ](https://preview.redd.it/ien6mkf1vkm71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cb12842300f04b56ebe7c9fd7577c29351b7307)\n\nIt was explained to me that there is a filter on the live lidar demo. The filter removes the reflection of the floor for aesthetic reasons. They said that if they kept the floor in the final image, you would have been overwhelmed by extra data, but by removing them, the live stream data can be more easily interpreted. Additionally, there are indoor Class 1 EU regs that I believe are in play which made MVIS sandbag their sensor a bit (if anyone was noticing it isn\u2019t as sharp). Sumit says once all testing and certification is done there shouldn\u2019t be any issues seen specifically in the demo booth unit.\n\nThis is also a phenomenon you will notice in future Lidar demos, because the lidar sensor acts similar to the human eye does when it sees a mirage. There is a critical angle after which, the light seems to bounce to infinity. Therefore, the sensor will not return images of the road surface (due to it being a planar surface). All content which is 3 dimensional continues to be detected until the full range as advertised.\n\n# Elvis has Entered the Booth\n\nDuring the middle of conversation with Jonathan, I noticed Sumit and Dr Luce exiting from a meeting room behind the booth with an unidentified gentleman. They had obviously finished a meeting, and one of the helpers came out to return the A-Sample and the Gen 5 mems mirror back into the display (they were not there when we arrived).\n\nSumit walked over, I introduced myself as \u201cJay\u201d and he replied \u201cJay, nice to finally meet you, I\u2019ve been waiting for you all day!\u201d We arrived approximately 45 minutes before closing and I had been with Jonathan for approximately 15 minutes. Additionally, I had told Dave Allen I\u2019d try to swing by later in the afternoon, so I expect Sumit knew we were coming to visit eventually.\n\nSumit then whisked /u/MusicMaleficent5870 and I away toward the live lidar demo to start our proper tour.\n\n# The MicroVision A-Sample\n\nSumit asked us what our backgrounds were to get a grasp of our level of technical knowledge. Suffice it to say, we communicated that it was low lol. One of the biggest things Sumit wanted us to walk away with was the story he was trying to convey to investors. The specific story for investors to recognizing the true value of MicroVision\u2019s IP. The other story he\u2019s trying to convey is the inevitability for customers (from my interpretation of his explanation).\n\nTo give you an example, he spoke briefly about the Hololens 2 and Microsoft. Microsoft spent *years* trying to improve the display of the Hololens 2. It got to the point where they finally realized Microsoft could not achieve it alone (even with a group of ex-MVIS engineers on their engineer team \u2013 this is my addition for color). Alex Kipman himself mentions this in one of his talks in Zurich/digital streams in 2020. Microsoft eventually had to approach MicroVision to get the job done because of MicroVision\u2019s proprietary technology that they\u2019ve built in the past couple of decades. He also believes that **they would have never won that $22 Billion Dollar contract without them** (which I agree with. The Hololens 1 was head-to-head with Magic Leap which ate the dust after the Hololens 2 was released).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Microsoft's \\\\\"$22 Billion Dollar Contract\\\\\" ](https://preview.redd.it/5s1r48a5vkm71.jpg?width=934&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdaec6c00acd3bc87406771b920045079ea5bb43)\n\nThis story of inevitability is what customers are starting to realize. If you want the best technology that solves your problems rather than creating further problems, you need to use MicroVision technology and IP (their family jewels). Their custom ASICs (which is available in a digital form) is one of the biggest advantages over competitors in the L2 and L2++ field like Tesla and Mobileye with their Camera only Neural Networks.\n\nSumit started to go down the rabbit hole into how Neural Networks work. He wouldn\u2019t trust the safety of that technology with his family, and that we wouldn\u2019t either if we read the disclaimers and fine print for cars who use these systems. This also aligns with Mobileye\u2019s current plan in developing a secondary independent Radar + Lidar system to ensure there are true redundant safety systems for maximum passenger safety.\n\nThere is a joke Sumit likes to share from the Silicon Valley Episode \u201cHot Dog, Not Hot Dog\u201d which helped us understand where he was coming from about Neural Networks.\n\n# The Family Jewels\n\nSumit believes that the ADAS market is going to go \u201cgangbusters\u201d sooner rather than later. See the bidding war currently happening between Magna and Qualcomm over Veoneer (who IAA placed side by side in the conference with Veoneer squished in the middle).\n\nMicroVision has a lot of key advantages with their proprietary custom ASICs. The way Sumit explained it to us was it comes down to basic math and physics. They can do things with edge computing faster and quicker than anyone else with their Family Jewels. **It comes from their custom OS that is built in their chips.** While Microvision is building their ADAS Lidar Sensors from an established foundation and decade\u2019s worth of tech and IP, their friends Luminar are spending billions just to be able to do the same thing with no guarantee that they can do it better or quicker than how MVIS is doing it.\n\nLastly, one of the key praises that potential customers have been commenting on the A-Sample is how **slim in profile the A-Sample is** (Apologies for the photo, I should probably take it lower down).\n\n[ Cassette of Truth - Kanye West's \\\\\"Yeezus\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/278gj577vkm71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54eaf8c77f33d8cd7b98b594a74dc47ce23bad25)\n\n[ MicroVision A-Sample ](https://preview.redd.it/trskb249vkm71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de0bfd1d8dacce0f34aada825dab45be30581c7f)\n\nI plan to publish an album of photos sometime this week which compares the other lidars on display with MVIS\u2019 A-Sample using the \u201ccassette of truth\u201d which I have been photographing to give an idea of the size of all the Lidar sensors. From my observation, MVIS is best in class from a profile aspect, all other lidar sensors are much taller in comparison.\n\n# The Lidar Product Suite\n\nSumit Sharma wants to generate more revenue. While the Hololens 2 currently does not produce enough volume for the time being,  **he believes that will change soon** with the new Lidar Product family.\n\nSumit also shared that they were getting a lot of requests for small NREs (non-recurring engineering) about, \u201chey we already have a product for short-range Lidar for the time being, can you make something for mid-range only, or maybe long-range only?\u201d.  There was enough interest that it made sense for MicroVision perspective to produce the A-Sample which would be identical to their Dynamic View Lidar (DVL) hardware wise, but with limited features the customer require now to help generate that revenue.\n\nTheir Dynamic View Lidar is meant to be their premium/flagship lidar offering. Sumit also touched on the use case of the 905nm lasers which have a standard and secure supply chain unlike the 1550nm lasers which are either custom made or non-standard supply chains utilizing exotic materials (which Velodyne does a great job of explaining in this article: [https://velodynelidar.com/blog/guide-to-lidar-wavelengths/](https://velodynelidar.com/blog/guide-to-lidar-wavelengths/)).\n\nNot only do the lasers help MVIS scale, but with the launch of MicroVision\u2019s fifth-generation MEMS to a 200-millimeter wafer silicon they control the whole process. They own their IP, and nobody else does. This gives them the ability to manufacture it the way they want. More control for MicroVision means more stability for customers.\n\n# True Value\n\nI was honestly surprised how in tune Sumit was to investors. He is also very aware of trader activity, but that is out of his hands. He\u2019s here to get true value for MVIS long investors and the multiplier/upside is massive in his eyes.\n\nI came away from the 30minute discussion in awe to be honest. There was so much content packed into that meeting, and Sumit was exuding nothing but confidence. If there are any German investors in Munich, make sure you go visit the booth, it\u2019s an excellent opportunity to share in the excitement and bullishness Sumit is currently feeling.\n\nGLTALs, it's 3:30am and i'm going to bed.\n\nTLDR - bullish",

And as the population grows, urbanizes, and develops, this also requires\u2026 a fuck ton of metals.\n\nThe cleanest resource for critical metals are [Polymetallic nodules](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-020-0027-0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ushpohm7lao71.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fc67ab4fc3a2042435d6451a4f8bc4bdf6b8691\n\nThese ugly fuckers remind me of what my grandma had growing on her elbow before she preceded to cut it off in front of us and bleed profusely. (Her elbow wasn\u2019t the only thing scarred)\n\nBut these little guys, they bleed money. And I mean profusely.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q3yodmw8lao71.png?width=552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=def610525e2f4887be3908a05f9636c702046ab0\n\nThey contain the base metals needed to make **batteries**. Which alone is a $12 Billion industry growing at 8.2% rate. By 2027 it\u2019s estimated the battery metal market will be worth $20.5 Billion.\n\nTMC\u2019s main focus is supplying the electric vehicle market with the necessary metals. They do this through **deep sea mining**. They have some pretty neat tech like this thing:\n\n[subsea collector](https://preview.redd.it/47y79v6alao71.jpg?width=850&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f34d44c47d8aeb948519866613d34ce41c2ee51)\n\nIt goes along the ocean surface floor (with minimal disturbance) picking up the rocks, sends them up a tube to a ship vessel, where it gets filtered and then zoomed to shore. At the shore, inside a plant, they burn the nodules and extract the metals through some refining voodoo magic. The company also uses AI to do this the most efficient way possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The Metals Company now holds rights to exploration contracts granted by the International Seabed Authority via three subsidiaries: Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (NORI), sponsored by Nauru; Tonga Offshore Mining Ltd. (TOML), sponsored by the Kingdom of [Tonga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiKFYTFJ_kw); and Marawa, sponsored by the Republic of Kiribati.\n\nThe NORI area **alone** contains enough metal to potentially supply battery metals for **140 million electric vehicles**. Our studies estimate that the number of polymetallic nodules within our three exploration areas is enough to electrify a **quarter of the world\u2019s** passenger vehicle fleet (**approx. 280 million EVs**).\n\nTo put it into perspective; [Tesla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMimIZJiMp0) is the largest producer of electric vehicles, producing a total of 1.43 million cars as of March 2021.\n\nAnd $TMC is estimated to be sitting on 280 million cars worth of battery metals.\n\nHOLY MOLY\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of rocks.\n\nTheir plant is designed to produce **zero waste** and is run on **clean energy**. In the future they\u2019re looking to recycle the metals from car batteries  and put the metals back into circulation.\n\n[base station](https://preview.redd.it/09tncwkumao71.png?width=2646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9712be824ec6bd7835de1500b464c009a94a1ce)\n\n&gt;Our aim is to recycle battery metals in a closed-loop system of rental and redeployment partnerships with like-minded EV and battery manufacturers. This circular supply chain will grow over time and, as the need for new metals decreases, recycled metals will become our primary focus.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Our plan is simple and attainable: supply the necessary metals with the least possible impact, building enough metal stock to stop extracting from the planet and enabling society to live off recycled metals.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/853cc7udlao71.jpg?width=581&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3237cd820efde72e0b8747b4a290c8072b773ff1\n\nBut Junkyard-Razor74, don\u2019t we have metals on land that we\u2019re mining? Why yes but back to the planet thing. We\u2019re trying to save it right? Rightttt?\n\n[and that's just the beginning for climate spending](https://preview.redd.it/omfc8oxelao71.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1678ebb747bb9286258c6558085f31fcce8a605b)\n\nInfrastructure, auto industry, transit, power sector, buildings, innovative technologies.

Why the hell didn\u2019t they? Because you have an obsession with OTM call options.* \n\nFirst off, answer this question for me: Which call option strikes have the highest gamma? Go ahead, I\u2019m sure you YOLOing mother fuckers know that before you drop your 100k on **GAMMA** SQUEEZE, right?\n\nHere\u2019s some pictures I drew on to help you. These are the option chains for each of last week\u2019s favorites. I\u2019ll highlight the call strike that has the highest gamma. \n\n**TLDR in section III.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[  The Iron Giant \u2013 You degenerates saw $100 a share everywhere and really went for it. Look at all that open interest at $40. Those MFers were expensive. Look at that, by the end of Friday they only had a delta of 3.1, so about 3 shares hedged for each of those calls. Ouch. ](https://preview.redd.it/fj133ltavho71.jpg?width=1050&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3ae7fd171c61e4100e0aeb113bf72c50daac486)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ What strikes? First one in the money, first one out of the money. OPA! ](https://preview.redd.it/45jh9ltavho71.jpg?width=1157&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28c0ffc619e959f76906068314dc368ee61b46d8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[  TMC \u2013 You were supposed to be the chosen one! 160&amp;#37; short interest, massive gamma, low share price.](https://preview.redd.it/ijhuhjtavho71.jpg?width=1190&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ebdc63c195aa7749527ef0728e50a24858c654d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut wait a second, doesn\u2019t gamma move with the stock? Absolutely. And now we learn HOW to gamma.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**II. Buying ATM options is to Gamma Squeezes as Buying and Holding Shares is to Short Squeezes**\n\nSo now you know, the highest gamma is the first strike in the money, and first strike out of the money. What does this mean, and why is this the highest gamma position?\n\nA gamma squeeze is essentially taking advantage of market maker delta hedging. The \u201cidea\u201d here is that there is a rush to own shares in large lots as the price moves. The whole purpose of buying a call option is to lock in a price to own 100 shares. It\u2019s an insurance package. If you are buying at the money options, your breakeven price is pretty close to, but just a bit higher than the share price, depending on volatility (vega gang). \n\nThe *implied* sentiment behind buying at the money options is that you are expecting a continued rise in share price. If you were to go further in the money, you are expecting the share price to remain the same (break even = share price). If you go out of the money, you\u2019re expecting a miracle and want to donate money to the market maker\u2019s party fund. \n\nSo what this means for a gamma squeeze, is that in order for it continue, option buying must reflect an *implied sentiment of continued rise in share price*. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**III.** **If I want to squeeze the gamma, how do I get the juice? READ THIS IT\u2019S YOUR TL;DR**\n\n**SMALL LOTS at a time,**  **BUY FIRST STRIKE IN THE MONEY \u2013 SELL OFF WHEN 5+ strikes ITM and buy more ATM**\n\nBuy the first strike in the money, every time. It doesn\u2019t matter the share price. If you are expecting a gamma squeeze, always buy the first strike in the money, or if you\u2019re really a damn cheapskate, get the first one out of the money.\n\nWhen the share price rises and puts your call a strike or two in the money, buy another small lot at the money again. Continue to do this.   \n Now once the share price puts your calls 5+ strikes in the money, sell dem bitches and get more AT THE MONEY. The gamma on the calls deep in the money has played out. \n\nIn the money calls have a maximum delta of 100. If you can sell an in the money call, and buy two at the money calls with a delta of 60, now you are effecting a combined delta of 120 on the stock. Your power is growing and the market makers must now hedge even more delta. \n\nLet\u2019s look at IRNT for next week. Do you know what you nitwits have done? You\u2019ve opened up massive open interest far out of the money and there\u2019s almost ZERO in the money calls open. You want a gamma squeeze you\u2019re gonna have to get sell off those OTM options and buy at the money. I promise you, the share price will not reach your $70 strike option without significant buy volume. The market makers are bringing the majority of the volume as they delta hedge, and they\u2019re not going to hedge all those calls that are $40 out of the money. There\u2019s zero reason to. In fact, as we approach expiration, their delta gets LOWER and shares are SOLD by market makers. Don\u2019t shoot yourself in the foot!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Okay, you've already shot yourselves in the foot, but maybe it can be fixed?](https://preview.redd.it/pvho43sqvho71.jpg?width=782&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a98487e6213179783b1f1c1cd7e61c5c762792)\n\n  \n\nAlright, so repeat after me, for a GAMMA squeeze, you buy options with the HIGHEST GAMMA. Which ones are they? First strike in the money, first strike out of the money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck!",

Only 55K shares available for Shorting Today! (Fintel 26minutes ago)\n\n# $ASTS is really close to the first Milestone of $12.5 which at market close will exercise 593,100 SHARES in an extremely low float. (GAMMA SQUEEEEZE)\n\n# $12.5 Will Boost it to the next milestone of $15 where 727,200 shares will also be exercised at market close if it stays above it. (GAMMA Turbo Boost!)  \n\nA Gamma/Short squeeze is very possible **today** and it's quite simple:\n\n1- Yesterday $ASTS had a volume of 956,348(very low) and the stock went up 4.94%(and 8.8% after market). This indicates how truly small the float is and how easily it could MOON.\n\n2- As I mentioned above, $ASTS is very close to it's Miles stones. At $15, with the strikes of $2.5, $5, $7.5, $10, $12.5, and $15, at close if we remain above $15, The combined exercisable stocks would be **1,541,200 shares!! almost 1.5 times more than yesterdays volume!!! Add to that the dried up ammo of shorts, A run above $15 could continue to $18 and beyond.**\n\n3- ASTS is a one of a kind Gamma squeeze play, because unlike $IRNT and $OPAD, it's not even 50% of it's all time high of **$25.37**. The potential upside is very big.\n\n4- Another unique feature is that It's an undervalued play which has attracted the investment and partnership of industry leaders such as AT&amp;T, American Tower, Vodafone, and Rakuten. **Barclays and Deutsche Bank recently gave it a PT of $29 and $35**, but noted **the upside of bananas was much higher once the technology is validated in scale.**\n\nWhat I mentioned were my observations for the possibility of a short/gamma squeeze **today.** I am not advocating a pump and dump. I am sharing that **this compelling company which has been shorted AF and the shorts have run out of ammunition.** They cannot artificially keep the stock price down any more via shorting as they only have a handful of shares left to do so.\n\n**Be warned, If ASTS squeezes, it will become very risky during the squeeze, if you choose to partake only do so with money you can afford to lose or don't partake at all because it's a retarded move.**",

        "selftext": "I saw a bunch of these top posts about the market crashing and the market not crashing and I lost more and more brain cells as I read through each one. I will try to explain this very complex issue in a very simple way for you all.\n\nSo here is the circumstances under which the U.S Market could potentially fail, and yes it includes inflationary risk. I am going to preface this issue with the fact that this topic is not black and white it is very complex and includes a lot of factors that would affect a market dump.\n\nFirst off lets look back at the most recent stock market crash, the 2008 housing crisis. I won't delve too deep but the reason this was allowed to happen was because the Government credit rating agencies ignored a very blatant issue and pretended it didn't exist until the tipping point in which people defaulted on their home loans causing the whole market to dump. \n\nNow to the present issue at hand and the main reason the US market could fail. Inflation. For those that don't understand inflation it can be boiled down to, if everyone has a lot more money than they originally had then everyone is going to buy more things and buy them at higher prices. Higher demand means higher prices. One thing many people may not know is how much money the Fed actually printed in the last year and the disgusting scale at which they did it. Since the start of the covid-19 virus, most estimates are showing that the federal reserve printed ***approximately \\~30% of all the US. Dollars that have ever been printed*** were printed in the last 12 months alone. \n\nSo, we now know that more money in circulation + people buying stuff = higher prices for everyday goods and services. But how can we measure this? Luckily for you there is already a metric that keeps track of this regularly and its called CPI (Consumer Price Index). This keeps track of the prices that consumers are paying for goods and services, The most updated numbers release at 08:30AM EST today. So we can just watch to see if the CPI is rising and then we know that inflation is happening right? Not so much, I really wish it was that easy but here is where covid enters the picture.\n\nIf the supply chain of goods and services was unaffected but prices still increased for consumers then this would be due to an increase in demand only. However, thanks to covid this is where the black and white becomes very gray. Covid-19 has affected the supply chains for almost everything sold in the US market, between china lockdowns and shipping issues there is a very obvious supply of goods issue. With this supply chain issue we can expect that prices will rise just due to a lack of supply coupled with the increasing demand, BUT on top of this there is also a **worker shortage** (this one still baffles me but its happening regardless).\n\nThe last factor is the FED. In order to avoid a massive increase in prices across the board due to the hefty increase in USD printed, the FED can implement **Tapering policies.** These are meant to preemptively hamstring the US market before Prices of goods and services get to out of control. If the FED sees inflation being a risk and ignores it like they ignored issues in 2008 then we are screwed and I wish you all the best of luck.\n\nHere's where I wrap things up and the start of the **TLDR;**\n\n  **TLDR;** We have an increase in Demand, a decrease in supply and a decrease in workers, all fueling an increase in prices. The Fed has printed approx \\~30% of all U.S dollars that have ever been printed all in one year. **If the CPI keeps rising after the supply chain issue is fixed, and the Fed doesn't start tapering then we enter an inflationary market for goods where a gallon of milk is $16, causing the market to implode on itself because nobody can afford anything anymore.**",
