        "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/the-wealthiest-10percent-of-americans-own-a-record-89percent-of-all-us-stocks.html\n\nThe wealthiest 10% of Americans now own 89% of all U.S. stocks, a record high that highlights the stock market\u2019s role in increasing wealth inequality. The top 1% gained over $6.5 trillion in corporate equities and mutual fund wealth during the Covid-19 pandemic, while the bottom 90% added $1.2 trillion, according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve. The share of corporate equities and mutual funds owned by the top 10% reached the record high in the second quarter, while the bottom 90% of Americans held about 11% of stocks, down from 12% before the pandemic. The stock market, which has nearly doubled since the March 2020 drop and is up nearly 40% since January 2020, was the main source of wealth creation in America during the pandemic \u2014 as well as the main driver of inequality. The total wealth of the top 1% now tops 32%, a record, according to the Fed data. Nearly 70% of their wealth gains over the past year and a half \u2014 one of the fastest wealth booms in recent history \u2014 came from stocks.\n\n\u201cThe top 1% own a lot of stock, the rest of us own a little,\u201d said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow, Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The growing concentration of wealth comes despite millions of new investors coming into the stock market for the first time during the pandemic, leading to what many have labeled \u201cthe democratization\u201d of stocks. Robinhood added more than 10 million new accounts over the past two years and now has more than 22 million \u2014 many of them held by younger, first-time investors. Yet while the market may be owned more broadly, the gains and wealth it creates are not being more widely distributed. Rosenthal said that while the army of new investors may be numerous, they are also still small, with the average account size at Robinhood at about $4,500. When markets rise, they will have far smaller dollar gains than wealthier investors with hundreds of thousands or even millions in stock holdings.\n\n\u201cMany of the younger investors also bought in at higher prices, compared to bigger investors who have been in the market for years and see larger gains,\u201d Rosenthal said. What\u2019s more, many of the new investors have more of a trading mentality \u2014 buying and selling stocks rapidly, with leverage, in hopes of quick gains. While the strategy can create big winners, others may see lower returns than those of investors who simply buy and hold for the long term. The top 10% saw the value of their stocks gain 43% between January 2020 and June of 2021, according to the Fed. The bottom 90% saw stock wealth rise at a lower rate \u2014 33%. \u201cThey might account for a larger share of trading activity, but that\u2019s different from ownership and wealth,\u201d Rosenthal said.",

        "selftext": "Tesla's valuation is probably one of the most hotly debated topics in the stock market these past few years. Tesla is certainly richly valued, and sentiments like \"Tesla has a higher market cap than all other automakers combined\" or \"Tesla has decades of growth priced in\" are very prevalent, especially on this sub.\n\nThat said, I noticed a trend where - although lots of different people are saying this and people defending Tesla's market cap are often downvoted - the people who make this argument never use any numbers to back up their claims. So I figured it might be nice to have an objective look at Tesla's trends and projections, run the numbers, and see how richly valued Tesla really is.\n\n**For those who don't like reading, I will now explain how I got to my numbers. If you don't like reading, skip straight to \"The Numbers\"**\n\n----------------------------\n\n**The method**\n\nWhile trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap has risen slightly higher, let's use a market cap of $1T to determine if Tesla really deserves to be a trillion dollar company.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**The trends**\n\nIn terms of revenue (LTM), Tesla has grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021. A 66% growth YoY.\n\nIn terms of operating margin, Tesla has grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021.\n\nIn terms of net income (LTM), Tesla has grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,468M after Q3 2021. A 524% growth YoY.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n**The future**\n\nObviously Tesla won't be able to maintain such a high growth rate in terms of margins and net income. The net income figure is heavily distorted by their low profitability in 2020, and their margins may suffer somewhat as they start to ramp up the two new factories that they are building.\n\nThat said, these two new factories are each larger than their two current factories combined and are much more efficiently spaced. Additionally, they will be using new technologies like the front and rear underbody gigacasting which should increase margins by quite a bit. On top of that, the percentage of sales that are Model 3's (their cheapest car) will decline as they scale up Model Y at these new factories and reintroduce the refreshed Model S and X, so ASPs should increase.\n\nIn terms of future sales, Tesla produced 237,823 cars in Q3. Annualized that gives a current run rate of 950,000 cars. Tesla has announced that they will scale up both their existing factories and start to ramp up both new factories by end of this year. Giga Shanghai ramped up with 300,000 units per year, so assuming Giga Texas and Berlin will ramp up with at least an equal amount, they should be doing 600,000 in 2022, 1,200,000 in 2023 and 1,800,000 in 2024.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**The numbers**\n\nPutting all of the information from the previous section together, I have create a worst and a best case scenario for Tesla's numbers through 2024. In the worst case I assume there are significant unforeseen setbacks that cause them to fall short of those numbers, in the best case I expect them to meet or even slightly exceed them. This brings us to the following projection:\n\n**Sales**\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|1,400,000|1,700,000|\n|**2023**|2,000,000|2,700,000|\n|**2024**|2,600,000|3,300,000|\n\n**ASP**\n\nWhile I mentioned ASPs will likely increase, I have chosen to keep them the same as in Q3 2022 at $50,000 because it's too difficult to predict. This should make sure the final numbers remain conservative.\n\n**Revenue**\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$70B|$85B|\n|**2023**|$100B|$135B|\n|**2024**|$130B|$165B|\n\n**Operating Margin**\n\nBecause of the mix of positive and negative effects on margins while ramping up the two factories, I will keep margins the same in 2022 and restart the increasing trend from 2023.\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|14%|14%|\n|**2023**|15%|18%|\n|**2024**|16%|20%|\n\n**Net Income**\n\nMultiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$9,8B|$11,9B|\n|**2023**|$15,0B|$24,3B|\n|**2024**|$20,8B|$33,0B|\n\n**P/E**\n\nDividing our $1T market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|102|84|\n|**2023**|67|41|\n|**2024**|48|30|\n\n---------------------------\n\n**The conclusion**\n\nShould Tesla trade flat at around a $1T market cap and they continue on their current expected trajectory, they will be trading at a trailing P/E of between 30 and 48 by the end of 2024. Depending on which scenario plays out (best or worst case) and what you think is a fair valuation for a company growing revenue and margins as quickly as Tesla is, the stock has between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in.\n\nSo to conclude, the popular sentiment that \"Tesla has decades of growth priced in\" is false.\n\n**Important side note**\n\nFor simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla's automotive bussiness, as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla's future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder), deserve to be taken into account when assigned a valuation to the company. But to avoid \"FSD doesn't exist\" and \"energy is a scam\" kind of comments, I have left these out of the analysis entirely.\n\n**TL;DR: Based on Tesla's current trends, they have between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in when looking purely at their automotive sales.**",

        "selftext": "I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven\u2019t counted it up, but it\u2019s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I\u2019m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I\u2019d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. \n\nThese are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.\n\n**Understand the Trading Environment**\n\nOne mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.\n\n**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can\u2019t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. \n\nIn between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that\u2019s more likely to pull back.  It\u2019s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).\n\nI try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don\u2019t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. \n\n**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**\n\nThe sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it\u2019s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.\n\nLast year\u2019s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don\u2019t bet against this trend, it\u2019s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I\u2019m dirt. \n\nLast year you couldn\u2019t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. \n\nOne of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don\u2019t overpay for the options, it works. I don\u2019t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I\u2019m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.\n\n**Make The VIX Your Friend**\n\nThe VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It\u2019s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. \n\nAnother interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don\u2019t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I\u2019ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. \n\n**Selecting Trades &amp; Investments**\n\n**Have an Allocation Plan**\n\nThe first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:\n\n* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.\n* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It\u2019s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.\n* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.\n* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. \n* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It\u2019s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I\u2019ll let you know in 10 years if it works.\n* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  \n* 1% in other things I can\u2019t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.\n\n**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**\n\nUnless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. \n\nI\u2019ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. \n\nMy favorite tools to use are Zack\u2019s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack\u2019s VGM measures a stock\u2019s value, growth rate, and momentum. It\u2019s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what\u2019s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. \n\nThe list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.\n\nA friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don\u2019t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there\u2019s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it\u2019s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   \nI use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn\u2019t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it\u2019s because there\u2019s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&amp;P but haven\u2019t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they\u2019d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn\u2019t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.\n\nI use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.\n\nFidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.\n\n**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**\n\nIf you\u2019ve invested actively for a while, you\u2019ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. \n\nI\u2019ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What\u2019s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. \u201cGoldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode\u201d), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. \n\nI am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.\n\n**Good Things Come in Pairs**\n\nJust about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I\u2019ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it\u2019s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. \n\nSimilarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it\u2019s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.\n\n**Exercise Financial Discipline**\n\nEven when I\u2019ve been successful picking investments, I\u2019ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We\u2019ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That\u2019s usually the moment I\u2019ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:\n\n1. Take Profits Often.   \nWhen an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  \nIf you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn\u2019t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  \n\n2. Fail Fast.   \nIf the option price sinks to -50% in value, it\u2019s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there\u2019s negative news driving this, I\u2019m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  \n\n3. Profit Both Ways.   \nIf a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \\~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year\u2019s returns for Visa.  \n\n4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   \nI have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should\u2019ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  \nOn the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don\u2019t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don\u2019t chase the perfect trade. It\u2019s a white whale. Just make money.  \n\n5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   \nThis is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn\u2019t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   \nSo if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there\u2019s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",

        "selftext": "I'll get straight to the point. **Everyone,** and I mean **EVERYONE**, is hunting down that next 'GME/AMC' style squeeze.\n\nThey want to be in it 'early'. They want to be on the cusp of the 'next big squeeze', and join the ranks of those who 'HODL'd GME and AMC over the past year.\n\nThis is easy to see. Flocks of people move from stock to stock as soon as it gets mentioned. They want to match the 'ape monicker' and get creative marketing names 'Spartans, Progs, etc.. to match the 'ape community' that was formed.\n\nWhen in reality, these squeezes are far and few between.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I have made money off these constant rotations. That aside, this is my FAVORITE play and the one I have put the most effort into... $SDC.\n\n**Here are my thoughts on why I believe $SDC has what it takes to take on the Meme title and join GME and AMC as a true meme-style rally/squeeze.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1.** **SDC has been well known:**\n\n**$SDC** already has a huge amount of exposure. When it comes to short squeezes, exposure is EVERYTHING. You NEED people to **actually know** about the company. On top of that, you need volume and price action to work in your favor to apply pressure (via increased share price, margin requirements, and cost to borrow) against the opposing short positions. $SDC **has** this exposure. It's highly talked about, and you have tons of eyes on the sidelines. A simple 5+% move like today can suddenly cause a MASSIVE shot in upwards sentiment. It gets everyone to FOMO in and turns what was a 5% day into a 15% day almost immediately.\n\n**2. Management Favors Retail:**\n\nManagement is in RETAILS FAVOR. I will say this OVER and OVER again. BECAUSE GME's management favored retail and because AMC's management favored retail, that is the TRUE reason these stocks had the momentum they did. These companies put RETAIL FIRST. Yes, AMC had to raise capital, but they did that WITH transparency to retail. AND, they did that AFTER MOST RETAIL made a KILLING riding the stock to almost $40. If you haven't been paying attention $SDC is on retails side. Just like Adam Aron, SDC's CFO is making constant retail appearances and inviting retail to ask questions to get them involved. Retail only wins, if, AND ONLY IF, the company works WITH retail; not against.\n\nOn top of that we, DON'T want dilution when we have the momentum of a squeeze. SDC has made it clear they don't plan to dilute on retail. Even when they had to do a dilution round in the past they made sure there was a clause that the stock had to go up 100% from that current price before the dilution could be realized. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED. We need a stock/management team that puts retail first, and I believe SDC has that checked as well.\n\n**3. Fundamentals Matter on Psychology**\n\nFUNDAMENTALS. Now, don't tell me fundamentals don't matter in a squeeze. They do. At the very least, the COMPANY/STOCK behind the squeeze does. There is a psychological play in every squeeze. As the price goes up, more and more people are making profits. On the flip side, as the price goes down, more and more people are losing money. Why did AMC and GME squeeze? **THEY DIDN'T SELL**.\n\nYou can't tell me the fact that there was nostalgia for your childhood GameStop, or the fact that people were excited to get out of these pandemic lockdowns, and go back to the movies, didn't have a HUGE effect on the psychological sentiment behind these stocks? You **knew** the companies you were buying and trying to squeeze, and they gave you/them confidence.\n\nWhen stock is down, your **CONVICTION** is what keeps you from selling. You have to know **WHAT YOU OWN**. If you're playing a squeeze on some penny stock you have never heard of before now, **YOU CAN'T TELL ME** you will have a high conviction when things go south. **NO-ONE** wants to be the one holding a bag of a no-name company if a squeeze doesn't turn out and the stock drops.\n\nThis is another reason I love $SDC. **PEOPLE KNOW WHO THEY ARE.** Unless you are living under a rock or didn't watch any tv AT ALL during the pandemic these past 2 years, you have seen a Smile Direct Club ad. I'm not saying Smile Direct has the nostalgia, GME or AMC have/had. But they for sure have more retail confidence and or more well know (as as company) than any of the most recent 'brand new' squeeze plays of late.\n\nYou cant tell me you had ANY idea what/who some of these random squeeze companies were prior to the squeeze play being called out. And this is VERY important. Have you noticed SDC has had a cult-like following DESPITE dropping 20% over the past few weeks? People are dropping hundreds of thousands if not MILLIONS into this company with the conviction that it's going up because **THEY KNOW** what/who the company actually is.\n\nLong story short, the better a company is known, the more confident the average trader will feel when it dips. The more confident = less selling. less selling on a short squeeze = \ud83c\udf19.\n\n4. **Fundamentals are debatable (fundamentals continued)...**\n\nThe fundamentals are debatable. This is a follow up to number 3.\n\nAMC and GME had 'debatable fundamental value. They didn't have 100% of people thinking AMC and GME were going to turn the boat around and make a profitable company (hence why they were so shorted). It took VISION, vision that they COULD have a future. And that 'potential' allowed people to speculate, and in turn, allowed them to confidently buy the stock.\n\nSDC has that same 'speculative' future. 50% of people see its potential... how it has SO MUCH growth potential for SO MUCH more, especially when compared to ALGN. On the flip side, you have 'every dentist and their dog' bashing the company and saying why it's going to fail. The similarities to that of GME and AMC (when they were trading in the $5's) isn't lost on me. People also said they were going **NOWHERE** and that people on this sub were throwing money in the garbage. Look at them now.\n\n**5. Stats**\n\n**The float, short interest etc...:**\n\nOne thing I have seen said over and over \"the float is too big to move\". That is a **BUNCH OF SH$\\*.**\n\nThe float is around **100M**. AMC's was **NEAR 500M**. You give $SDC 1/5 of the volume and attention that $AMC had and your golden. That aside, you **DONT WANT A LOW FLOAT STOCK**. If a company has a float of say 20M and has 50% short interest. That means there are only 10 million shares on loan/shorted.\n\nIf a stock has having 100M+ in volume a day, shorts could cover in literally an hour if they wanted (not days) and no one would even know from the buying pressure. On top of that, you cant tell me shorts are '**really sweating**' when there are only 10 million shares of stock (lets say its trading at say $2), and the CTB is going up. That's only 20 million dollars to be short 50% of this hypothetical penny stocks float.\n\nThey have less capital at risk, '*less skin in the game*', on these low float stocks. Yes, they can pop fast, but they can be shorted down JUST AS FAST. The risk just isn't there, and the momentum DIES FAST AS WELL.\n\nWhy do you think it has been SO HARD to bring down AMC and GME once they FINALLY started to have MAJOR momentum. **THE BIG FLOAT!** A big float will make it **HARDER** to bring a squeeze down once the squeeze is in motion. On top of that, they have **WAYYYY** more money at risk. In the case of $SDC 45.86 MILLION Shares. At $6 a share, that's **229 million dollars** on the line. **OVER** **1/4 BILLION dollars** they are having to pay over 250% CTB on. Now that, **THAT**, can make shorts think twice. That can actually make a dent in their hedge funds bankroll. **That is what we NEED.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ghndfe38cqr71.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7719dbe2c935c68213bff6d1d0eb1cbfe10040f\n\nAnyway, all in all, these are just a FEW the reasons I think $SDC can join the ranks of $GME and $AMC. I have made other posts going over the companies fundamentals, future outlook as a 'long play' etc.. But this is about its *MEME-ability*. It has all the potential, now it just needs the retail movement. Are you going to be on the right side of this play? Are you going to 'get in early',? just like you wished you did with AMC and GME? If we play our cards right we have the control here. Just BTFD and hold on tight! \ud83d\udc8e \ud83e\udd1a\n\n**tl;dr: $SDC has management that is on the side of retail. The company is well known and has all the components of becoming the next big meme rally next to AMC and GME. So BTFD (but this isn't financial advice) \ud83d\ude09**\n\n.....\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n**IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ JUST, BUY AND HODL TO THE MOON \ud83c\udf19!!! WE DESERVE OUR TENDIES!** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n.... (again not financial advice) \ud83d\ude09!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "selftext": "https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/hertz-orders-100000-tesla-cars-bloomberg-news-2021-10-25/\n\n&gt;Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.\n\n&gt;Tesla shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.\n\n&gt;Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. \"Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,\" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.\n\n&gt;\"Wild $T1mes!\" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.\n\n&gt;Tesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).\n\n&gt;Most automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models. But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz's decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.\n\n&gt;\"Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,\" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.\n\n&gt;Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).\n\n&gt;Consumer demand for electric vehicles is turning a corner in some major markets. The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe last month, consulting firm JATO Dynamics reported Monday. read more\n\n&gt;Tesla also appeared on Monday to be making progress resolving regulatory problems that threatened its business in China. The company said it had opened a new data and research center in Shanghai to comply with government requirements that data collected from vehicles in China stay in the country. read more\n\n&gt;However, Tesla faced new U.S. regulatory pressure on Monday. The National Transportation Safety Board's new chief sent Musk a letter questioning why Tesla was rolling out its \"Full Self Driving\" software even though the company has not officially responded to the NTSB's questions about the automated driving system's safety.\n\n&gt;\"It (the Hertz order) puts an exclamation point under guidance for 50%+ growth in deliveries,\" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. \"Another solid piece of evidence EVs are going mainstream.\"\n\n&gt;Tesla now faces the daunting day-to-day challenge of becoming a high-volume automaker growing at a rate not seen since the early 1900s when demand exploded for Henry Ford's Model T.\n\n&gt;Tesla is coping with an order backlog for its vehicles and extended supply chain disruptions. Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned investors during a call last week that Tesla's near-term production goals will hinge on resolving those disruptions and ramping up two new, huge assembly and battery plants in Austin and Berlin. read more\n\n&gt;\"There is quite an execution journey ahead of us,\" Kirkhorn said.\n\n&gt;Rivals are not sitting still. Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz brand, General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), and startups such as Lucid (LCID.O) and China's Xpeng (9868.HK) are all battling Tesla with new electric cars or trucks.\n\n&gt;Investors and analysts, for now, are looking past the near-term challenges. Morgan Stanley boosted its Tesla price target by 33% to $1,200 as the brokerage expects the electric carmaker to surpass 8 million deliveries in 2030.\n\n&gt;The Hertz deal also underscored the power of the Tesla brand, as the rental car company emerges from bankruptcy and aims to revive its once-dominant brand. Hertz's rescue is led by a group of investors including Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management.\n\n&gt;\"We absolutely believe that this is going to be competitive advantage for us,\" interim Hertz CEO Mark Fields said of the Tesla order, due to be delivered by the end of 2022.\n\n&gt;\"We want to be a leader in mobility. ... Getting customers experience with electrified vehicles is an absolute priority for us.\"\n\n&gt;Tesla's cheapest Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000, making this order worth about $4.4 billion, if the entire order were for its mass-market sedan.\n\n&gt;Fields declined to say how much Hertz was paying for the order. Tesla was not immediately available for comment.\n\n&gt;With the current order, Hertz said EVs will make up more than 20% of its global fleet. Fields cited the rising number of EVs for sale and consumer interest in electrified vehicles.\n\n&gt;Hertz also said it was installing thousands of chargers throughout its network. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the United States and Europe.\n\n&gt;Tesla shares closed up 12.7% at $1,024.86.",

        "selftext": "Hello. Homeless here. I live in my car and I am looking to stocks to solve my problems. Ready to harass me with unkind things?\n\nBefore you do here are some facts:\n\nI make $11 an hour and work 40 hours a week.\n\nI make enough to invest over $1000 a month.\n\nI only spend $400 a month out of my $1500 - $2000 monthly pay.\n\nI plan on getting an apartment in 2022 at some point as well as a better job.\n\nI want to invest for the long term. My ideal minimum goal would be 10 percent profit every year and take out 4 percent per year when I retire.\n\nI have looked at many stocks past 5 year history and many of them are skyrocket. The ones that seem to go up up up and never really go down in the long term would be the ones I think I would invest in.\n\nI have at least a year of savings at $400 a month meaning my savings is at least $5000.\n\nHaving finally looked into stocks and looking up videos for about 100 hours and still having no real true 100 percent plan I know a few things. First: Stock market seems better than a savings account. Second: If I had invested 5 years ago I would have so much more money. Third: It seems some stocks will almost always profit over the long term. Forth: Inflation means stocks are a decent option instead of a bank.\n\nI did put a very small amount of money into stocks and so far have a 2.5 percent return. I put the money in 3 stocks and it increased. That was 24 hours ago.\n\nI have a decent savings account and I was wondering if I should put it all into stocks. The truth is if I put $5000 into stocks and lost it all I would not lose my life and could make it back but it would hurt my heart and make me want to stay in my car a bit longer.\n\nI currently am trying to better myself and I have come a long way. I won't get into that so try not to judge me to harshly. Right now I am at a point where I can invest a bit more at a low paying job, but I do intend on getting a better job when I can and then get an apartment so I can have a home and invest more money as well. But I also have no friends and no family. I am all on my own with the grace of God and perhaps your input here...\n\nBut currently $1000 is completely able to put into the stock market  every month.\n\nWhere do YOU personally put your money and where would YOU personally put your money if you were in my situation?\n\nWith inflation is it okay to start investing or is it too late now?\n\nWould it be best to stick with the stocks that seem to have a history of doing well or would they be overvalued due to the inflation lately?\n\nIn the long term what stocks do you feel will stand the test of time and keep raising even in times of trouble?\n\nPlease provide your thoughts and hope I am not too much of a loser. Thanks.",

        "selftext": "I understand 90% of people are pouring into DWAC right now just to try and get some tendies before they dump their shares onto a bag holder. So maybe there will be a better entry point in a few weeks as the mania subsides. However, I believe that regardless of short and medium term volatility and price manipulation, DWAC is a long term hold. \n\nAt a valuation of 3 billion, that's absolutely nothing for a social media platform. Facebook is worth 907 billion. Snap is worth 88 billion. Now you might ask yourself, \"Yea I get successful social media platforms are valued at crazy levels, but who on Earth is going to make a profile on Truth Social?\" well, for better or for worse depending on your political affiliation and beliefs:\n\n [Poll: Two-thirds of Republicans still think the 2020 election was rigged (yahoo.com)](https://news.yahoo.com/poll-two-thirds-of-republicans-still-think-the-2020-election-was-rigged-165934695.html) \n\nApproximately 240 million people are eligible to vote in this country. Of that 240 million, 40% identify as Republican. That's 96 million. Now of that 96 million, about 63.6 million believe that the election was rigged by Democrats and that Trump is the real President. That's who makes an account at Truth Social. \n\nIn addition to this, a lot of people's favorite thing to do on the internet is get into insufferable political arguments. It will not only be MAGA Qanon people on this thing, people from the left will make accounts there to troll and argue. \n\nFurthermore, there are numerous talk show hosts, and media personalities who will follow suit and make accounts. Jordan Peterson, Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens and the rest of peanut gallery. Tucker Carlson, Thomas Sowell, there are a lot of political figures who will end up on there and bringing a strong follower base. Celebrities who like Trump, are indifferent to him, or who are exhausted by what they view as opaque rule enforcement from youtube and facebook would likely join, such as the Nelk Boys, gun youtubers like Garand Thumb, I would imagine the Paul brothers would make accounts just to kick the hornets nest and get attention. \n\nAt that point, there would be millions of accounts already, which would start to attract non political personalities. People who are hungry for clout and aspiring content creators would see an app with millions of users and not that many creators crowding it and jump in. \n\nI believe there could be 250 million users in Truth Social in over the course of a few years and that's a conservative (pun intended) estimate. Depending then on ad revenue, whether or not the company decides to sell data (That would be a tough thing for them to navigate), I can't imagine this thing not having at least a 20 billion dollar market cap in the near future. And then there's also the streaming service and news broadcast which I haven't even mentioned.  \n\nAnd let's not forget the Catalysts: \n\nDonald Trump running for President.\n\nDonald Trump WINNING the Presidency in 2024. \n\nAnytime a major celebrity or personality joins. \n\nTL:DR:\n\nMay the God-Emperor, Donald Pump, first of his name, bringer of tendies and golden showers, take all holders to Mars on a Falcon X Rocket. \n\nPosition: 10 shares at $98.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I currently work in the shipping industry and would like to give you some insight about what's going on in Long Beach right now, and how Biden's imposed \"emergency fee\" to alleviate congestion is actually making things worse. I hope this provides some of you with useful information. \n\nHere's some background for those of you unfamiliar with ocean imports. When vessels come to Long Beach port, the containers are unloaded and delivered to the terminal. From there, containers are either delivered to CFS (container freight station) for unloading, or the entire container is delivered to the customer that purchased the goods. \n\nRight now, containers are stuck in the terminal unable to be delivered to CFS or to the customer's warehouse. This is due to a lack of truck drivers and chassis (equipment used to transport containers). Not only is this bad because customers can't get their equipment, but there is also something called a \"last free date\" which is the date by which the importer has to get the container out of the terminal. If the importer is unable to get the container out by the last free date, shipping lines will charge importers significant extra charges (called demurrage charges) for each day that the container isn't picked up (usually $200-350 per day, depending on the shipping line). Well, since there is a lack of truck drivers and equipment, there is literally no way to get the containers out of the terminal. Every day that goes by, charges are being added onto shipments, which ultimately ends up on an invoice billed to the customer. Some demurrage charges are able to be contested and refunded, but a refund does not always happen. \n\nThat isn't the worst part. Biden recently began imposing an \"emergency fee\" onto shipping lines to help combat port congestion. But guess what? Shipping lines are recently announced that they are going to start billing importers somewhere around $150 per cubic meter in additional fees. To put this into perspective, a 40 foot container, lets say has 60cbm of goods, will be charged an extra $9000 by shipping lines. Biden's emergency fee literally does nothing to address port congestion, and actually makes things WORSE.\n\nHere's what I'm afraid of. When demurrage charges get so high, customers could simply choose abandon their goods at the terminal. The cost of demurrage and other stupid fees could EASILY surpass the value of the actual goods. Why would a customer want to pay more than the goods of the shipment to have the shipment released to them? This poses a huge risk to shipping lines, importers, and everyone involved in the shipping industry right now. Also, don't get me started on per diem (for those of you interested, just Google it, it's an additional fee resulting in customers being unable to return their containers back to the terminal in time)\n\nThe amount of fees piling on that will ultimately land on consumers, combined with the demand for goods, is honestly kind of scary, and I have no idea how this is going to end if we don't get some kind of divine intervention ASAP.\n\ntldr; bad things are brewing in the shipping industry right now, and it has only been getting worse.",

        "selftext": "Coinbase customers affected recieved this email this morning:\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, between **March and May 20, 2021**, you were a victim of a third-party campaign to gain unauthorized access to the accounts of Coinbase customers and move customer funds off the Coinbase platform. At least 6,000 Coinbase customers had funds removed from their accounts, including you.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In order to access your Coinbase account, these third parties first needed prior knowledge of the email address, password, and phone number associated with your Coinbase account, as well as access to your personal email inbox. While we are not able to determine conclusively how these third parties gained access to this information, this type of campaign typically involves phishing attacks or other social engineering techniques to trick a victim into unknowingly disclosing login credentials to a bad actor. We have not found any evidence that these third parties obtained this information from Coinbase itself.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even with the information described above, additional authentication is required in order to access your Coinbase account. However, in this incident, for customers who use SMS texts for two-factor authentication, the third party took advantage of a flaw in Coinbase\u2019s SMS Account Recovery process in order to receive an SMS two-factor authentication token and gain access to your account.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Once in your account, the third party was able to transfer your funds to crypto wallets unassociated with Coinbase.\n\nFrom a shareholder perspective, I think this is very egregious that this was happening around the time of the IPO, but they didn't disclose this until just now. This news was withheld and kept under wraps for months, and could be related to the heavy selling we've seen from company executives since the IPO back in April.",

        "selftext": "First off, I want to thank the WSB community. I'm not a trader. My time-consuming job makes it challenging to find spare time to research stocks. So my trading philosophy has been simple: keep my cash in ETFs, usually 50% in an S&amp;P 500 ETF and 50% in an investment grade fixed income ETF (depending on the market I will re-weight those allocations), and once I see a clear opportunity to buy, I buy. And WSB has helped me find those opportunities. I've maybe made 6-7 buys over the past 2 years, including:\n\n* Snowflake @ the dip (bought around $200)\n*  Luckin coffee @ about $2\n* Tesla @ $200\n* Shopify @ $350\n\nGranted, I haven't held all of these stocks to their peaks because of my paper thin hands, but have nonetheless made some good profits. And I owe that to the collective information on this forum.\n\nNow, I want to survey the forum here. What stocks do you think will flourish in 2021 and 2022? Where can I turn my $$ into $$$$? Trying to retire and find a trophy wife, but need your help. What stocks I should spend my limited time researching?",

        "selftext": "CRSR probably draws the attention of the Reddit crowd due to its very high short interest of 37% of the float, along with cheap valuations. Partly for these reasons, Wall Street analysts have been calling for significant upside potential in Corsair stock, as we detail below.\n\nThe last year delivered an exceptional 130% gain to the company's bottom line. Although, its longer-term performance hasn't been as strong with three-year EPS growth being relatively non-existent overall. Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.\n\nWith earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Corsair Gaming has been doing relatively well. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favor. Corsair Gaming (CRSR) reported 2nd Quarter June 2021 earnings of $0.33 per share on revenue of $472.9 million. This represents about a 22% increase from last year despite the economy reopening!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n7remyci72s71.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fed04d4cfb054c4b320f94e8dfc92c4c772c785\n\n\\-Estimates expect earnings of $1.82 per share and revenue of $2.08 billion. These totals would mark changes of +13.75% and +22.19%, respectively, from last year.\n\n\\-CRSR recently refinanced their debt, meaning they will pay a lower interest rate increasing their earnings per share.\n\n\\-CRSR has also commited to paying down its debt strengthening its balance sheet.\n\n\\-The company said it continues to expect 2021 revenue of $1.90 billion to $2.10 billion. The current consensus revenue estimate is $2.02 billion for the year ending December 31, 2021.\n\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 12% per annum during the coming three years according to the eight analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 12% each year growth forecast for the broader market.\n\nWith this information, we can see why Corsair Gaming is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. Apparently shareholders are comfortable to simply hold on while the company is keeping a low profile.\n\nI have 6,700 shares at 27.74",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone. I know most of you are idiots who managed to lose money during the greatest bull run in the history, but I have the need to share my thoughts, help the community and at least get you to start thinking about what if scenarios. Let me get straight to the point.\n\n# I think we will experience some headwinds over the next 12 months.\n\nThere. I said it. Now for those of you with higher IQ, let me explain why I think that.\n\n**1. Inflation is at the highest level it has been in the past 13 years (since 2008)**\n\nDespite what some of you may think, we cannot print money forever. Printer cannot go brrrr always. We had fun with the printer since March 2020, but the effects are starting to show. Food, gas, real estate, stocks, digital currencies, wage subsidies, unemployment benefits - the society is flooded with cash. We are literally swimming in it. Sure it's fun when SPY goes up **31.6%** over the past 12 months, but this leads to inflation and inflation is bad. Why? Because high inflation puts pressure on a government to increase the value of the state pension and unemployment benefits and other welfare payments as the cost of living climbs higher. Inflation expectations -&gt; wage demands -&gt; rise labour costs -&gt; lower  profits for businesses. This is why at some point, our saviour J Pow will need to address this. In fact, he already announced it, which leads to my second point.\n\n**2. FED announced tapering will start in November**\n\nTapering means the gradual slowing down of purchases of securities and bonds. Simply put - printer will slow down. Most of you have never seen the stock market without the printer. You think 31.6% a year for SPY is normal. You are not aware that SPY was flat for 13 years (*0% between Mar 2000 and Jan 2013*). Most of you are not reading the news. You did not read the news in Jan 2020. You though corona was a Chinese problem. You did not read the news in Mar 2020. You were buying puts, when J Pow publicly said he's going to turn on the printer. Even if you read that, you had no clue what that meant. You held your puts and watched them melt as printer did its thing. Now, we are in a similar situation. J Pow announced he will slow down the printer, you don't know what that means, you are still holding calls and looking to buy more because \"stocks always go up\".\n\nIn conclusion:  \nprinter brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr -&gt; stocks brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  \nprinter brrr -&gt; stocks brrr\n\n**3. Interest rates will need to go up**\n\nOne way to curb inflation is to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates means it'll be harder to borrow money. Less borrowing, leads to less liquidity to buy houses and stocks. Less buying, prices cool down. I'm not calling for a crash, but a 10-20% cool-down will be enough to wipe out most of you with your clueless strategies, if we can even call them strategies.\n\n**4. China is slowing down**\n\nI know Evergrande paid its bills this month, but they did it by waiting until the last day before announcing bankruptcy. This is not normal. If they had so much trouble this month, who can guarantee they'll be able to pay them next month? On top of that, an average Chinese citizen realized that real estate does not always go up. This change in mindset will cause slight fear, which leads to lower demand for real estate which will eventually show who is over-leveraged. (*hint: It's Evergrande*) You might wonder, how would a slowdown in Chinese real estate affect us in North America? American corporations generate significant profits by selling stuff to Chinese people. If Chinese people are not happy about their houses and apartments going up in value, the last thing on their minds would be to buy new iPhones, purchase Teslas, and buy commodities to build more real estate.  \nWe are more connected that you think. When something happens in China, it affects everyone. Don't believe me? Go back to January 2020.\n\n**What should you do?**\n\nSlow down a bit. Relax. Think. Take it easy with calls. Take the foot of the gas pedal. I'm not calling for a crash. I'm not telling you to short the market. Just don't be caught off guard, when big boys cash their chips and go home. You don't won't be the last ones to leave the casino. That's all.",

        "selftext": "I sold a company I created, and after the press release went out, I was inundated with very gracious offers to take and manage my new found money for fees. At the time, I presumed these wealth managers, after managing hundreds of millions - if not billions - of other people\u2019s money for decades, would have developed advanced strategies and tactics for ensuring success. Surely, they would have teams of analysts scouring the markets for opportunities, technical indicators, news events, macroeconomic data and breakthrough innovations at all times to stay a step ahead of the pack. I was dead wrong.  \n\nWhat I discovered was an antiquated industry that relied heavily on the belief that they knew better and were on top of things. In fact, there was very little effort that went into managing OPM (other people\u2019s money), and that most of the energy went to finding and onboarding new clients. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that their strategies were bad or didn\u2019t work. I am only stating that they were neither complicated nor impressive. In short, anyone here could repeat the same strategies and save 1% of their money a year in perpetuity. Without further ado, here\u2019s what I learned:\n\n**Goldman Sachs**\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that there are various divisions within GS wealth management that handle money differently. I break it down into low net worth, mid-net worth, and high net worth offerings. The low net worth folks are given Marcus, an automated investment system that simply relies on ETFs paired with some basic bond funds. It\u2019s the same as buying Vanguard Target Retirement funds. \n\nThe mid-net worth offering is where I spent the bulk of time understanding. They find 30 stocks to invest in from different sectors with an attempt to represent the sector weighting of the S&amp;P 500. As the SPX is largely tech, they are overweight technology. Basically, they take the SPY and cut it down from 500 companies to 30 companies. \n\nWhy would they offer a less diverse array of stocks? \n\nThey state as the reason that they are better able to manage 30 investments than 500, and since they are not trying to beat the returns of the index - their words - they\u2019d rather find stocks with lower beta (volatility) and thus likely lower returns. \n\nThey locate these stocks by running basic stock screens within the S&amp;P 500 once per quarter to ensure solid performance and find better investments. They target a 6% annual return after accounting for their 1% fee on your money and they offer some financial planning services if you have over a certain amount of money invested with them.  This amounts to $10,000 per year for a $1M portfolio for many years - a lot of money to part with.\n\nDid I mention, you have to liquidate your entire portfolio prior to working with them, unless you happen to already own one of the 30 stocks they pick? So there are tax consequences of getting involved.\n\nFor the HNW folks, the above offering is available and they offer additional products, such as the ability to invest in private equity, REITs and hedge funds. As you might imagine, the more money they manage, the more \u201cfree\u201d accounting services they include.\n\n**Personal Capital**\n\nThis may actually be my favorite, given the simplicity of it. They take the main sector ETFs and eliminate any stocks that are losing money, to recreate their own ETFs by sector. They charge you a fee to use their ETFs. \n\nThey start with an equal amount of capital going to each sector ETF, but allocate more money to the sectors with the worst performance record from the year before. They do this annually. They do nothing all year. \n\nThey charge a fee for managing your money. I recall it being 25 or 35 basis points, but you have to also pay to use their ETFs so it creeps towards the better part of a percentage point very quickly and is much more expensive than simply buying a Vanguard S&amp;P 500  fund or a group of the sector ETFs calling it quits.\n\n**Ritholtz Wealth Management**\n\nIf you\u2019ve watched CNBC regularly, you\u2019d recognize the commentator Josh Brown - a partner of Ritholtz Wealth Management. He\u2019s the one with the thick New York City accent. When I found out I may have the chance to have his insights managing my money, I was excited as he always seemed so knowledgeable. But the wealth management shop was not impressive. \n\nIn fact, their model was exactly the same as that of Goldman Sachs: they pick about 30 stocks, stick your money in them, rotate them every quarter, and keep volatility low on the stocks they pick. They target 5-6% annually, net of fees. Yes, you heard that correctly, 5-6%. \n\nThe next group of wealth management shops all fell into one of three other categories: SPY collars, ETF aggregators, or tactical investors\n\n**SPY Collars**\n\nThis strategy involved putting all of your money into the SPY ETF then selling call options on that investment out of the money a few months out at a time. They take the income from the sale of these options and purchase out of the money puts on the SPY for similar expiration dates. This strategy enables them to control your target return while limiting downside. For those who are not used to options, here\u2019s how it works.\n\nLet\u2019s say the SPY is trading at $400. You own it. You sell someone else the right to buy it from you for $440 for $40 per call. So long as the SPY stays under 480 (440 + the call premium value), the other person will not execute the call and you get to keep the money for the call premium. If the SPY goes above 480, you have to either sell your shares at $440 (plus pocket the 40 per call, making this a sale at 480) or buy the call back at a higher price than what you sold it for. You\u2019d lose money on it, but the SPY shares have gained in value, so you still come out ahead. You are just not as ahead as you would be had you simply bought and held the SPY all the way to $490. This creates a ceiling in terms of the max amount you can obtain on the upside of your investment. \n\nThe option puts work the other way, protecting your investment on the way down. Since you used the premium collected on the sale of the call to buy the puts, you haven\u2019t spent any money but have bought yourself insurance. If the SPY drops, the value of your put option (a short on your own investment) increases. This increase offsets your losses, protecting you, especially in the case of extreme correction. \n\nIf the SPY rises, you lose the value of your put, so you have to account for that in your net income for the investment.\n\nIf you don\u2019t follow this, don\u2019t worry, the net effect is they use options to prevent a major loss but in doing so, they also prevent you from having any major gains. You are trapped or collared within an acceptable range of returns. Over time, you will not beat the S&amp;P 500 index with this strategy and they say this. \n\nSo there is only value to this strategy if you simply are unwilling to trade a really bad year once in a while for a great year once in a while. It\u2019s mostly about your investment time horizon and whether you need regular access to the money. \n\n**ETF and Mutual Fund Aggregators**\n\nAbout 7 firms I interviewed used this strategy. I heard the same thing so often, I thought maybe they were dumbing it down for me. Essentially, they just bought all sector ETFs or a basket of mutual funds for you. A few of the firms would use the collars I spoke of above if the market got a little choppy, but most did not. \n\nThis strategy was most common with smaller wealth management shops - under $250M AUM - which tried to differentiate themselves as financial planners that happen to look after your money. The bulk of them did very very little to watch the market and most flat out stated they only looked at these quarterly. \n\nI could not understand what they did all day until one referred to himself as a market psychologist because his job was to calm clients down when the market shits itself. I have vodka for that, so this strategy was not for me.\n\n**Tactical Firms**\n\nThese firms were harder to find and their DNA was more similar to day traders in terms of their mentality. They invested in a basket of stocks they thought represented a blend of value, growth, and good dividends. They chose them annually but were much more likely to liquidate and go to cash if they thought a correction was coming so they had cash to buy the dip. \n\nOne thing I did learn from them though was tax loss harvesting - a term for specifically taking losses on investments to offset gains on others. \n\nThe best way they did this was by rolling calls on equities that had risen in value. Imagine holding Apple stock and selling a call on it. If Apple goes up, you must then choose to sell the stock or buy the call back at a higher price for a loss. If you do the latter, in year 1 and sell a second option in year 2 at the same price or more than the call you bought back, you can write off the loss in year 1 while avoiding actual losses. \n\nYou can roll calls like this forever, amassing paper losses while you actually gain in the value of the underlying equity. It was a nice trick I\u2019ve used many times now, especially when I want to sell something I\u2019ve held for years with significant gains. \n\nTheir desire to protect the portfolio, I felt, prevented them from participating in the quick rebounds in the market. In 2019, when I spoke to them, they felt a crash was imminent and had gone to 60% cash in their portfolio. I never reached back out to see how they did, but I suspect they were buying the dips in March 2020. \n\nTheir overall returns were around 10% but not as good as simply buying the SPY and holding. But they did seem to be able to minimize the downside of some on major events. \n\n**In the end, I never hired any of them.** I decided instead to use what I learned and what I knew and manage my own money. In case you read this far and are curious, yes, my returns have beaten all these firms\u2019 average returns and I\u2019ve actually learned a lot in the process. Sharing in case anyone could use the strategies.",

        "selftext": "This post is a summary of comments on threads and blog posts comparing traditional IRAs to Roths. In particular, I wanted to comment on and offer some arguments against 5 major points that find their way into many of the comparison threads.\n\n**1st sentiment to dispute: low income earners who expect to make more later should do Roths, high income earners who expect to make less later should do traditional.**\n\nI have seen this point a few times:\n\n&gt;If you\u2019re in a high bracket and expect little or no income in retirement take traditional. Otherwise if you\u2019re in a low bracket now and expect more income in retirement take Roth. Or just do both.\n\nThis is how I used to think and on the surface, it is an accurate statement. I myself am currently in a high earning tax bracket, and have favored traditional IRAs historically assuming that I'll be making less in retirement. And that is true, I will have more available cash at the current time and will be paying a lower effective tax rate at the time of withdrawal.\n\nThere's one major problem: while it is true that for high income earners using a Roth you are paying a higher current tax rate, *you are paying a 0% tax rate on your gains.* This 0% tax on capital gains usually outweighs the taxes saved at time of deposit with a traditional IRA. What's even worse is that this money is taxed as ordinary income instead of as capital gains.\n\n\\-\n\n**2nd point to dispute: the investment accounts work out to be the same over time.**\n\nThis leads me to the next sleight-of-hand that a lot of traditional IRA advocates try to pull. Take a look at [this Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kZ7Qnwh1lsi87to4LpgBbVHDb3iJ7nH1-7pONCzU3yo/edit) that calculates gains for traditional vs Roth.\n\nNow it's tempting to look at these numbers and think \"Oh see, there you go. It doesn't matter, you end up with the same money either way.\" But look at the assumptions this sheet is making: Instead of having you max out your Roth, it assumes that the 5k you were going to put into your traditional IRA is reduced to 3.5k with your Roth. This is not what happens and is such a dramatic error that I think it's intentional -- who doesn't max out their Roth if they can? You're not depositing less, you're depositing the maximum and paying more in taxes (ie. losing available cash). Then, you make the same gains but with a Roth they're not taxed.\n\nUsing the scenario in the linked Excel chart we can more accurately reflect what happens for most people: you have $1250 of extra available cash each year with a traditional. 1250 x 12 = $15k over 12 years that you would have had at the cost of of $18.3k of additional taxes at retirement (with a Roth paying 37% taxes now vs with a traditional IRA paying 22% at retirement).\n\nIf you want to do the numbers again, here is another example taken from a comment comparing IRAs to Roths with the following math:\n\n&gt;assuming 30% tax  \n&gt;  \n&gt;10,000 = 7,000 after tax going into roth = $122,145.82 after 30years @ 10%  \n&gt;  \n&gt;10,000 full going into trad/401k = $174,494 after 30years @ 10% = $122,145.82 after paying 30% tax.\n\nThis is disingenuous. Remember, a Roth is not \"tax free\" but *post-tax*. The numbers evolve differently if you are maxing your IRA out.\n\n* *Roth investment*: 15,900 = 10,000 after tax going into Roth at 37% tax rate = $175k after 30 years at 10% - $5,900 of less available cash at the time of deposit (with a higher tax rate and principal) + $54k gained (\"tax free\" or post-tax gains) at the time of withdrawal = **$49.7k overall gains.**\n* *Traditional investment*: 10,000 pre-tax going into traditional IRA with $5.9k more available cash at time of deposit, in exchange for 22% tax rate at retirement instead of 37% at time of deposit as would have occurred with a Roth = $175k after 30 years; 54k gained but taxed at 22% instead of 37% = **42k overall gains.** In most of the scenarios I calculated, Roths came out ahead in the long run.\n\nSo, taking into account the different expected tax rates, with a traditional IRA you are giving up 7k of long term gains for an additional 5.9k of available cash at the current time. What you do with this money determines its *opportunity cost*.\n\nThis is a stronger [retirement tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VZ4wKbUXdc8VA0mG4ri2wP9VuZCwae7b9MvA4u2HT7w/copy) developed by u/jeff_varszegi from [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/) if any of you are familiar. There are some aspects that caught my attention as needing refinement (discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/hhdvbrq/?context=3)), but my understanding is very basic and I could be missing something.\n\n\\-\n\n**3rd point to dispute: An anti-Roth post at Go Curry Cracker**\n\nThere is a well known anti-Roth post at Go Curry Cracker entitled \"The Great Roth Controversy\" (I can't link the url as it is not allowed in the subreddit). The amount of mental gymnastics that the post undergoes to make its points is staggering:\n\n&gt;Dollars saved in a Traditional 401k / IRA are pre-tax.\u00a0 We pay no income tax on dollars going in, an immediate savings of up to 39.6%, the highest marginal rate.\u00a0 The invested funds are allowed to grow **tax free**, so all interest, dividends, and capital gains are untaxed until withdrawn from the account.\u00a0 Upon withdrawal, all funds are treated as ordinary income, similar to a paycheck.\n\nThis is very inaccurate wording. The invested funds in an IRA don't grow \"tax free\". As said by the author themselves in the first sentence, they grow **pre-tax**. The invested funds in a Roth also don't grow \"tax free\" but **post-tax**. This is the major benefit of a Roth over traditional.\n\nThen the post starts talking about theoretical scenarios where a family would be paying 40% taxes with a Roth but would be reduced to poverty level income in retirement -- the so called \"first and last dollar\" argument. This is incredibly misleading. Instead it should be a \"last and last dollar\" argument. What are you paying as far as a marginal tax rate on the Traditional vs the Roth -- ie. what would an individual have been making otherwise. You have to take into account other income streams to know your base income and effective/marginal tax rates.\n\nAnother point made in this blog is that the greater available cash with a traditional IRA can then be used to invest in an index fund anyways, functionally becoming a Roth at annual capital gains tax rates. First off, why wouldn't you want post-tax gains? The point they leave unspoken is you're paying a premium for more available cash at the current time with a traditional IRA. And that's assuming an individual invests this money -- the average person is actually just redistributing savings.\n\nFor high earners that will earn less at retirement, a Roth requires a higher initial investment, but with the benefit of greater long term cash gains. With a traditional IRA, on the other hand, you are functionally increasing *available cash* because you're paying the lower tax rate that will exist when you retire. This is at the expense of *post-tax gains*.\n\nFor low earners that expect to earn *more* at retirement than they are currently, a Roth will have a lower tax rate fixed at the time of deposit as well as the \"tax-free\" gains. This is a double-win scenario with a Roth. If they had invested in a traditional IRA, it would have been a double loss.\n\n\\-\n\n**4th point to dispute: It's pointless to try to predict the future.**\n\nAnother argument I've heard is that tax rates are difficult to predict in the future. While researching this idea I came across the following charts:\n\nI'm not a tax expert, but from these it appears fairly reasonable to guess that incremental tax brackets won't be changing dramatically in the next few decades. If I am understanding trends shown in the linked charts, if I'm in a higher income tax bracket at retirement, then I will be paying lower taxes than now and if I'm in a lower income tax bracket at retirement (which is more likely if I haven't developed passive income) I will be paying higher taxes than now.\n\nThe more important point, as shown in the math above, is that for the average person, *tax rates* matter less than *post-tax ('tax-free') gains.* That is to say: the amount you gain in a post-tax retirement account will usually be more than the amount you save by a lower effective tax rate in a pre-tax retirement account, even in a top tax bracket.\n\nOf course this is not a guarantee. Your Roths could be invested poorly, there could be a revolution and the entire tax structure we've had for the last century could be changed to a universal standard tax rate, you could win the lottery, etc. but at some point we have to accept that we're dealing with probabilities. If you haven't developed a cumulatively progressive source of passive income *and* you're not in a defined hierarchy (ie. a partnership track in a law firm or medical group, a path to senior management at a large corporation, etc) or you sell a product that can be leveraged to economies of scale (ie. a brand-name app), you will probably be in an eat-what-you-kill situation at retirement and so be making less in retirement than you are in middle age.\n\n\\-\n\n**5th point to dispute: That there are universal solutions. Remember:** ***one size fits all is a size that fits none.***\n\n**A comment I've come across is that having both a traditional IRA and a Roth is good because you're \"diversifying\".** The reasoning behind this is that a traditional IRA will be counted as part of taxable income in retirement and a Roth can be used for additional tax-free withdrawals that would put one out of their desired tax bracket.\n\nThis doesn't make sense as a general rule and must be calculated for your individual circumstances. By my own personal math, for example, it is a bad idea for me to do a traditional IRA because the lower tax rate at retirement would not compensate for the tax-free gains of a Roth. This is an example of where something that sounds like good advice (ie. \"It's always good to diversify.\") actually takes you down a less financially successful path.\n\nAnother point to keep in mind is that your year to year tax situation matters a great deal. Let's say you retire early, get laid off or have a year where you are transitioning jobs so your income is low. This is a great opportunity for a Roth IRA conversion ladder -- ie. moving your pre-tax (IRA/401k) money into to post tax (Roth) accounts. Use this year as an opportunity to pay the lower effective tax rate at deposit *and* get the benefits of post-tax gains. A double-whammy of tax gains.\n\nLooking at your specific life circumstances make it more likely that you will pick the retirement portfolio that applies to your particular path. Barring extreme examples, however, a Roth will be the better choice for most.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI did put a lot of research into the current situation for quite some time and finally build a portfolio I am 100% behind long-term. However, the more I learned, the more sure I am that we will experience a market crash rather soon, than late.\n\nI am not here to debate whether or not you think this is true, but the situation for this thought game is that we might see a crash similar in numbers, not principle like 2008' all over again.In general, during times of high inflation, most businesses will not come out well. The earnings will go up, but they need to put more money into their own business to even stay in the same place. A hedge for this are companies that can easily scale their business without needed money flow. I am looking at you Facebook, who can place 10% more ads, Adobe who can increase their product price without fear of losing customers, Apple, Microsoft...\n\nThe theory behind this discussion would assume that GameStop is a good hedge and to some degree AMC as well, I even heard that from the high ups in a very big, german bank, which is incredibly weird since they were against it months ago and did not even want to talk about it in the first place. This assumes that the crash is happening because of said theory I explained below in short in an edit. It does not mean that a high percentage of the entire portfolio should persist of them, but a chunk just in case might be a very good idea. The market is more complex than many think.\n\nAnother hedge and long term hold can not be mentioned in this sub, but you might guess what it is. Sadly, we cant debate this here. Has to do with weird blocks and tokens, latter of which might change the whole gaming industry and I am thankfully in the position where I can take constant profits from it in percentages that sound absolutely insane.\n\nSo, in case of this **theoretical** scenario, I would like to get everyone's opinion on this. I want to be clear, I value every single opinion and would love the most input possible. In case of no crash, my investments should grow steadily, but in case of a crash due to named circumstance, they would skyrocket. Again, this is purely theoretical, I do not want to discuss whether or not it is happening, but what you would do in case it will happen in the near future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: How would you hedge against a potential market crash ala 2008 due to Evergrande + GameStop and the overall situation?**\n\n*Since I got downvoted to hell on a different subreddit for even mentioning GME and spreading the word, I will add the theory behind GameStop again, even though most of you might know this already.*\n\n*The theory: The most part of the stock is traded in Dark Pools and all the shorting Hedge Funds are telling us that they closed their position, which is mathematically impossible. Do the research yourself. So, what I think is happening, is that all the shorts are actually synthetic and not real shares. There is tons and tons of proof of it, too much to even deny at this point. They exercise and sell deep ITM calls in order to get the FTDs. So basically, they are passing them from one to another, to another.*\n\n*Think of it like this, a good analogy I found: You get a credit card with 10.000$ on it, max it out and have to repay next month. However, you have endless credit cards, so you can get another credit card and \"pay\" the 10.000$ with that. The debt is still there, its just getting passed. You can do that forever. Now you need more money, so you do this all over again and keep digging the grave deeper and deeper. In this theory, multiple times the float and continuing. In order to stop that, you have to lock the float entirely, which is why everyone is currently directly registering their shares. IF this is true, I do not have to explain the potential outcome. There is simply too much proof as that I can deny that at all.*\n\n*Computershare confirmed this:Quote from their Twitter: \"Shares held directly on the books of US companies through a transfer agent are not held at DTCC. As such, shares are not available to be loaned for any means within the security markets. Computershare is a registered transfer agent &amp; therefore does not lend shares in any capacity\"*\n\n*I need to admit I am a bit disappointed by the negative response from a lot of people, but I would like to keep this open and come back one year later, I will simply take all the downvotes from here. I will still read everything and appreciate any opinion on the topic.*\n\n*Cheers, have a nice week everyone!*",

        "selftext": "So gold is getting closer to $1,750 again, and since gold recently experienced a dip I\u2019m looking on investing on some gold stocks since I feel like they\u2019ll do well in the current high inflationary environment.\n\nI am currently holding Barrick Gold whose total preliminary gold production[ rose to 1.09 million ounces](https://www.reuters.com/business/barrick-third-quarter-gold-output-rises-nearly-5-sequentially-2021-10-14/) and Newmont, which is another big company that generates massive production of precious metals. The latter was recently among stocks that can possibly beat inflation.\n\nRight now I\u2019m looking into going for some [First Majestic](https://www.firstmajestic.com/) not just for the gold but also since they have the most expensive silver stock out there. Another one would be Equinox Gold since they are showing a lot of potential too. Their operations are not deterred by the pandemic, so they are constantly producing and is possibly headed for a breakout.\n\nFor explorations, I think [Collective Mining](https://collectivemining.com/) has a lot of room to grow. They already started drilling and have released good results in the recent months. The cash burn is so low and the company is set up for a long timeline. So far that\u2019s the only one I\u2019m going to look into since they\u2019re already showing promise in their drilling results. I also want to be safe so I\u2019m more focused on the bigger ones since they\u2019re more certain and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d lose that much on them.\n\nRight now I have only invested on the bigger producers and is still looking into the others that i have mentioned. I need your thoughts. Is it smart to invest on gold right now since there\u2019s a lot going on with the prices?",

They're new 5mm architecture for their chips is absolutely insane, first seen with how crazy their M1 chips did last year. Now, with apple release the M1 pro and M1 max, both being insanely powerful and battery efficient, I really want to start investing into apple. I believe that they will take over the laptop market in the coming couple of years. \n\nToday, with AAPL being down since their announcement of the chips, is a good idea to invest around $5,000 or $10,000 into AAPL? I am looking to buy as many shares as I can.",

Gavin Newsom on Tuesday night.\nAB 286 requires delivery apps like DoorDash DASH, 1.93%, Uber Eats UBER, 2.98% and Grubhub GRUB, -0.91% to give delivery workers all their tips. The bill also prohibits food-delivery apps from charging customers more than restaurants do. And it addresses hidden fees by requiring the companies to disclose to restaurants and customers a detailed cost breakdown of each transaction.\n\n\u201cGig companies have profited during the pandemic by keeping consumers and restaurants in the dark about the true cost of their services,\u201d said state Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego, who wrote the bill, in a statement. \u201cNow, small restaurants and their customers will know what they\u2019re being charged upfront and get to see exactly how much is actually benefiting the restaurant.\u201d\n\nThe bill, which will take effect Jan. 1, 2022, is the latest of many efforts to regulate the burgeoning app-based food-delivery industry. At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic last year, municipalities adopted emergency delivery-fee caps. This year, San Francisco and New York City enacted permanent fee caps, sparking lawsuits from DoorDash, Uber Eats and Grubhub. And New York City last month passed first-in-the-nation legislation that would establish minimum pay for delivery workers, give them access to restaurant bathrooms and more.\n\nDoorDash, which has faced questions about how much its drivers keep in tips and last year settled a lawsuit by Washington, D.C., accusing it of applying tips to workers\u2019 base pay, says on its website that its delivery workers keep all their tips. Uber Eats and Grubhub also say tips go straight to the drivers.\n\nDoorDash said it had no comment on the signing of AB 286. Grubhub and Uber have not returned requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Newsom vetoed another bill, AB 1444, which would have dictated that agreements between restaurants and food delivery platforms be written and include certain content. It also would have restricted delivery platforms from charging restaurants for forwarded calls unless those calls resulted in an order, and required listing websites to disclose whether ordering through them would result in forwarding a call and a fee paid to a third party other than the restaurant.\n\nIn his veto message, Newsom said \u201cWe have significantly increased oversight of food delivery companies in recent years.\u201d The governor also mentioned that the delivery platforms have said they no longer charge restaurants simply for forwarding calls.",

TSLA ended up being a huge blessing for me and my son over the years!\n \n        I made it through work being closed down for 9 months last year and half of this year, and never sold.     \n       So, this step took alot for me, on a personal level.\n\n      Because of my job being effected half of this year, my income was no where close to what it would have normally been...       I decided that selling half would give me some peace of mind with the economic climate where it is. I also knew that with my income being as low as it was this year, that this was possibly the last opportunity to avoid selling in a higher tax bracket.\n\n        Of course, I had this mental struggle between selling and it then going higher.  But I've decided to just not let myself think on those terms.\n     \n \n       I now feel a security in knowing that if it rises, I still have half my holdings and will enjoy watching my position climb again.  And if it goes down, I will have the option to buy the dip.\n\n       I was surprised at how stubborn my pride was when deciding whether to reduce position or not!

        "selftext": "I know the popular notion on Investment in China, **right now**,  is to \"stay out\" of China.  \n\n\nChina as a country has been an economical miracle in this century. They literally created a prosperous middle class. They have created the world's second largest economy from third world.\n\nAccording to the Hurun Global Rich List 2021, Greater China housed **the most billionaires worldwide in 2021**. By comparison, 696 billionaires resided in the United States.  [source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/299513/billionaires-top-countries/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Hurun%20Global,resided%20in%20the%20United%20States) \n\nChina has emerged as the world's largest manufacturer according to the World Bank. [source](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33534.html#_Toc12530869) \n\nEconomic reforms and trade and investment liberalization have helped transform China into a major trading power. Chinese merchandise exports rose from $14 billion in 1979 to $2.5 trillion in 2018, while merchandise imports grew from $18 billion to $2.1 trillion. China's rapidly growing trade flows have made it **an increasingly important (and often the largest) trading partner** for many countries. According to China, it was **the largest trading partner for 130 countries in 2013**. [source](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33534.html#_Toc12530869) \n\n  \nToday, the country is being rocked heavily. The Evergrande debt crisis is still unravelling (other major Chinese real estate companies are drowning in debt), there is shortage in many of the manufacturing items coming out of China (computer chips, precious metals etc.), they are under international pressures/(warfare?) from the USA and others, and now they are having energy blackouts throughout the country (?!).  \n\n\nThe country societal problems are rearing it's head - The ruling party restricting rights, and then the one child policy is beginning show negative economic ramifications, in that, they have too much of an aging population.  \n\n\nThe ruling party are trying to fix all of their issues right now, wit heavy debt restructuring revamping social programs. But right now it looks like China is being rocked with a lot of issues.  \n\n\nChina is eyeing expansion of power - war with Taiwan and seizure of Hong Kong. What will be the economic ramifications of those events to China, and to the world? Yet to be seen.  \n\n\nNow, here is my question:  \n\n\nDespite the above - **China is still an economic powerhouse on the world stage**. International **Investors need China to remain as such, as China is economically intertwined**  with too many sectors in this world.   \n\n\nI, personally, am  still very bullish on China long term. But since it appears, that China is, honestly, under economic upheaval.   \n\n\nShould someone who admires China's economic performance;  \n\n\nBuy the dip now (while much of the equities are priced low)  \n\n\nor   \n\n\ndoes an intelligent assessment demand waiting until long term (1 year-ish)  \n\n\nor   \nshould one just avoid China as an investment as much as possible for as long as possible (at least until the dust settles with Hong Kong and Taiwan)?",

I remember having money on the sidelines for a further red day when they default, and that red day never came.\n\nNow, you don\u2019t hear anything about Evergrande anymore? I see that they have managed to secure yet another small bailout for an upcoming interest payment, but that just kicks the can down the road and the problem still exists.

        "selftext": "22 (m) working in finance, i currently split rent in a one bedroom with serious girl friend, and i\u2019ve spent some time reflecting recently on how inclined i am to actually buy a house in the intermediate term. I\u2019m less looking for advice on personal finance because i know there are better subreddits on that, but I wanted to raise conversation and see others\u2019 insights on using a single family house as a practical vehicle for growing wealth in house equity. I\u2019m familiar with the pros and cons of renting vs owning a home and i\u2019ve read Rich Dad Poor Dad so no need to remind me that a home for many is actually a liability, i\u2019m more thinking about let\u2019s say the next 5-7 years whether it makes more sense to rent over an extended period of time and plow more money into equities or to build equity in a home by getting a mortgage. I know there\u2019s lots of nuances to this and i consider myself to be a knowledgeable and reasonably sophisticated investor (at least with my own money) so i don\u2019t need tips on how to allocate the difference necessarily, but the crux of my question boils down to over an intermediate 5-7 ish year time frame whether it\u2019s more effective to build wealth generally in a diversified equities portfolio with increased marginal contributions rather than saving up for a downpayment on a house while continuing to rent, or save up for a down payment and use leverage from a mortgage to build real estate equity. Note, not looking for a house to \u2018settle down\u2019 in long term because i recognize the right house for a family has qualitative values not measurable or relevant to an investment analysis. Speaking purely from an investment stand point, i\u2019m wondering whether a leveraged real estate investment (which is how i would think of a house if i bought one now) and all the costs associated as well as the equity in a booming real estate market compares with expected equity returns in medium term. part of my concern here is that neither stocks nor housing seem cheap, especially not in my area right now, but buying a house requires using leverage to enter a record hot asset class while continuing to rent and pouring more into stocks (in roth accounts and then taxable) feels like a more moderate decision. Would love to hear your all\u2019s thoughts",

        "selftext": "TLDR: Pretty much guaranteed that the stock will 10x within 18 months. With the Citizens petition getting denied in Feb and their phase 3 trials getting released in about a year. Phase 2 trials were amazing and the only reason why the stock is currently in the 40s is because of shorts going after it knowing it would be an easy kill. Get in now or get in at 500 in 2023. \n\nNow onto the meat and potatoes. \n\nWhy has sava been floating between $40 and $50 for the past few months? The reason for this is simply short sellers attacked the company in August with a citizen's petition stating that the company basically faked all their data and that everything was bs. Update it's not. The lawyer that filed the petition represents an anonymous company that holds major short positions in the company and just wanted to see them fail. Basically this lawyer Jordan Thomas pushed a 70 page bs Citizens petition filled with technical jargon and complicated medical terms made to scare the average investor and it worked marvelously.\n\nHowever, now that the dust has settled many experts have called the citizen's petition baseless and completely fabricated. I'm sure if you do your own research on the topic you will come to the same conclusion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo why invest in sava:\n\n Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. There is NO effective treatment. \n\nWhich is where Cassava sciences comes in. Im going to explain this in monkey terms because I'm not a medical professional and most likely you're not either. (if you want more details in more professional and medical terms there will be links at the bottom.) In short Cassava sciences has achieved something no other  Alzheimer's treatment has ever done, they're still seeing positive results for their drug. If you don't know most drugs stop working after 6 months. Savas phase 2 results were published with amazing results and they've started phase 3. Obviously, there's a lot more to it than just that but that's the short and simple. \n\nsome upcoming catalysts for sava would be their citizen's petition needs a response from the FDA by February and their phase 3 results should come out within 18 months \n\nSo why 10X well Americans spen about 277 billion a year on Alzheimer's and that's only going up. Since SAVA is the best drug that anyone has ever seen for Alzheimer's to date they'll have basically a monopoly on the industry.I saw some experts predict that, with FDA approval of their drug, Savas stock could reach prices of  $950 - $3000+ obviously that's a huge range but considering the stocks currently at $43 i don't see much of a downside.\n\npersonally I'm all in with 820 shares at a $58 average.\n\nSAVA PHASE 2 FINAL RESULTS:\n\n[https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-announces-final-results-phase-2b-clinical-study](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-announces-final-results-phase-2b-clinical-study)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSAVA PHASE 3 INFO:\n\n[https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-initiates-phase-3-efficacy-trial-simufilam](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-initiates-phase-3-efficacy-trial-simufilam)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSAVA CITIZENS PETITION:\n\n[https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2021-P-0930/document](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2021-P-0930/document)",

I tend to feel that whenever it dips below $10 it starts looking very attractive. \n\nI have mixed feelings on the stock since the company has struggled to actually make money and cement a solid business direction for profitable growth. I was also a little out off by the meme status and wild, seemingly random price spikes. But now I feel like the meme effect has cooled down and it continues to trade fairly consistently in the mid $9-$10 range. From the patent sales and continued partnerships I feel the company is moving in a good direction and while still risky at this points presents some pretty attractive prospects for future growth.

Key drivers that result in folks pursuing a plant-based diet are typically health, animal welfare and the environment [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44488051). In a world where worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975, 39% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in 2016, and most of the world's population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight, [link](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight along with other statistics such as 463 million people live with diabetes and 1.13 billion people live with hypertension (also known as high blood pressure) \u2013 conditions that often occur together and are among the leading global causes of poor health and death [link](https://world-heart-federation.org/news/the-cost-of-inaction-on-diabetes-and-hypertension/), it\u2019s not too surprising that people are turning towards plant-based foods-\u2013 which are a large part of a vegan diet \u2013 particularly fruit, vegetables, nuts, pulses and seeds, as they have been shown to help in the treatment of many chronic diseases and are often associated with lower levels of type 2 diabetes, less hypertension, lower cholesterol levels and reduced cancer rates [link](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/enjoy-food/eating-with-diabetes/veganism-and-diabetes). \n\nFrom an animal welfare perspective \u2013 it turns out that an estimated 99% of US farmed animals are living in factory farms at present. By species, it\u2019s estimated that 70.4% of cows, 98.3% of pigs, 99.8% of turkeys, 98.2% of chickens raised for eggs, and over 99.9% of chickens raised for meat are living in factory farms [link](https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates), less than ideal conditions within these farms where \u2018animals are packed in as tightly as possible to maximize output and profit, even though this causes many to die from disease or infection before being sent to the slaughterhouse\u2019 [link](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/) has also contributed to an increase in the awareness of and consumption of plant-based foods on ethical grounds.\n\nThe third driver\u2019s been getting the most airtime recently since it seems the planet\u2019s actually pretty fucked, with a new report by the UN Environment Programme that came out yesterday finding \u2018new and updated Nationally Determined Contributions only take 7.5% off predicted 2030 emissions, while 55% is needed to meet the 1.5\u00b0C Paris goal\u2019 [link](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/updated-climate-commitments-ahead-cop26-summit-fall-far-short-net) a.k.a a bunch of countries do not want to make the necessary concessions to preserve the planet in its current state. These \u2018Latest climate promises for 2030 put the world on track for a temperature rise this century of at least 2.7\u00b0C\u2019 [link](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/updated-climate-commitments-ahead-cop26-summit-fall-far-short-net), with the planet still on track for catastrophic heating [link](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/10/1104012). Why is any of this important/relevant in this context? It turns out that \u2018the animal agriculture sector is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions,\u2019 [link](https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/climate-change-animal-agriculture-factsheet.pdf) highlights include 9% of annual human-induced CO2 emissions,3\n37% of methane (CH4) emissions, which has more than 20 times the global warming potential of CO2,\nAnd 65% of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, which has almost 300 times CO2\u2019s global warming potential [link](https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/climate-change-animal-agriculture-factsheet.pdf). Not that it\u2019ll happen anytime soon but it turns out that cutting meat and dairy products from diets could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by up to 73 per cent. If everyone stopped eating these foods, researchers at the University of Oxford found that global farmland use could be reduced by 75 per cent, an area equivalent to the size of the US, China, Australia and the EU combined \u2013 leading to a significant drop in greenhouse gas emissions [link](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/veganism-environmental-impact-planet-reduced-plant-based-diet-humans-study-a8378631.html). One survey found that ~23% of people were interested in cutting down meat consumption for the sake of the environment, showing an additional market for producers of plant-based food [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44488051). \n\n**Part 2 - Company Overview and Value Proposition** \n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what Tattooed Chef\u2019s all about and what sets it apart in the marketplace. In the company\u2019s own words - Tattooed Chef is a leading plant-based food company offering a broad portfolio of innovative plant-based food products that taste great and are sustainably sourced. Tattooed Chef\u2019s signature products include ready-to-cook bowls, zucchini spirals, riced cauliflower, acai and smoothie bowls, and cauliflower pizza crusts, which are available in the frozen food sections of leading national retail food stores across the United States. Understanding consumer lifestyle and food trends, and a commitment to innovation, allows Tattooed Chef to continuously introduce new products. Tattooed Chef provides great-tasting, approachable, and innovative products not only to the growing group of consumers who seek to adopt a plant-based lifestyle, but to any of the \u201cPeople Who Give a Crop\u201d [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/).\n\nThe Company\u2019s current market opportunity is worth $42 billion and consists of a number of frozen food categories including frozen appetizers &amp; snacks, frozen breakfast foods, frozen entrees, frozen fruits &amp; vegetables, and frozen plant based meat alternatives [link](https://gyazo.com/c586290597f7fccff2db2ad399e09f41). It\u2019s worth noting that frozen plant-based meat alternatives in which some of its most comparable comps are, is only worth $0.8 billion, in comparison to the other massive segments such as frozen entrees at $23.1 billion and frozen fruits and vegetables at $7.6 billion. The growth in the frozen food category (a key areas where TTCF competes) has been primarily driven by the recent product innovation as a response to the growing demand for great tasting, clean label and convenient options. The overall frozen food category outpaced the general center of store food categories. Millennials and Gen Z are driving growth in the frozen foods section due to convenience, frozen fresh and plant based foods, with the number of consumers who say convenience had a significant impact on their food purchase decision growing from 49% in 2017 to 57% in 2019 [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nThe Company\u2019s product portfolio consists of entrees, breakfast, vegetables, pizza, meat alternatives, and with yesterday\u2019s acquisition news \u2013 they\u2019ll also be entering into nutrition bars. The growth in their portfolio and product range has been pretty explosive, especially in the last year where they went from 38 total products and 17 total new innovations in 2020 to 73 total products and 35 total new innovations in 2021 (thus far) [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb).  \n\nA key strength of Tattooed Chef and its USP is its vertically integrated operations that enable it to create a strategic advantage, through vertical integration they have control of ingredients and prioritization of product, the ability to go from innovation to market in as little as 3 months with experience in manufacturing, distribution, supply chain. As of their past IR deck presentation they highlighted four manufacturing facilities and capacity available to achieve $500+ million in revenue. This will be increasing to five with Belmont\u2019s acquisition and likely higher revenue potential.\n\nIn September 2021, key highlights included 52% year on year growth in revenue from $67.9 million in the first half of 2020 to $103.4 million in the first half of 2021, 82% year on year growth in the established brand from $38.0 million in the first half of 2020 to $69.1 million in the first half of 2021 **with no investment in marketing and brand until 2021**, strong resources with ~$140 million cash balance, 275k square feet of manufacturing capacity to quadruple in 2021 and opportunity for strategic M&amp;A (closed 2 key acquisitions in 2021), and growth in sales and marketing including launching the first national media campaign, tripling of branded store count and creation of 35 new product in 2021 [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). Despite the initial lack of marketing \u2013 testimonials such as President and CEO Salvatore Galletti stating that \u2018Target said it was the most successful frozen food launch in the history of Target\u2019 during the Q1 2021 earnings call show how popular the products are \u2013 even with minimal marketing.\n\nThe expansion in national distribution has been remarkable, with growth from 1,614 stores in 2019 to 4,272 in 2020 i.e., ~165% increase. The goal in 2021 was to reach 10,000 total stores, with 8,355 already achieved in the 1H of 2021 \u2013 by the 3Q 2021 it\u2019s expected that national distribution will have expanded to over 12,000 stores which would be a ~180% increase with the year not even being over. This was facilitated in part by the number of major retail customers that Tattooed Chef was able to onboard \u2013 in 2020 key customers included Walmart, Sam\u2019s Club, Costco, Target, Trader Joe\u2019s, and Aldi. In 2021 this list expanded with 20 additional key customers highlighted, including Kroger, Whole Foods, Albertsons Safeway, Harris Teeter, and Publix. In a study of mass retailers, 3 of the top 10 items including the #1 and #2 since launch in March 2021 of plant based frozen entrees belonged to Tattooed Chef, with dollar velocity over 60% above the nearest top 10 competitor [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb).   \n\nMarketing and branding only really became a component of Tattooed Chef\u2019s outreach in 2021, which makes their success thus far even more impressive in my opinion. The goal is to reach 80% of all Plant Based Intenders (78 million customers) through the national media campaign. I would really recommend taking a look at the IR presentation which has been linked here in several other places to understand more about how Tattooed Chef describes the plant-based intender and the wide cross section of society from which they come \u2013 urban dwellers, parents, under 35 year olds, people who want to eat less meat, aspiring &amp; practicing vegetarians/vegans, pescatarians &amp; flexitarians \u2013 there\u2019s something for everybody in Tattooed Chef\u2019s product portfolio and they\u2019ve segmented their target audience pretty well. The campaign is running through 10,000+ TV spots plus targeted digital video and streaming \u2013 one every 15 minutes, and 24 top tier networks plus Hulu and Programmatic Connected TV/Streaming. As of August 3, 2021, brand awareness grew from 6% to 15% [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nThe Company has stable leadership and has been family run, while also adding experienced folks from the industry to the management team. This includes Sam Galletti \u2013 the CEO and President with 35 years of experience in the food industry having served in both operational and investor roles within seafood, breaded vegetables, salsas and dips, grilled chicken, and organic foods companies. Sarah Galletti \u2013 the Tattooed Chef &amp; Chief Creative Officer who was the creator of the \u201cTattooed Chef,\u201d joined the Company in 2014 and spearheaded shift to plant based and has experience as a former chef in Italy. Stephanie Dieckmann \u2013 Chief Financial Officer &amp; Chief Operating Officer who joined Tattooed Chef in 2017 and has over 12 years of experience in the food industry, also being the former CFO of APPA Fine Foods. Matt Williams \u2013 Chief Growth Officer who joined Tattooed Chef July 2020, has over 25 years\u2019 experience in CPG including roles at Dean Foods, Coca Cola and PepsiCo [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\n**Part 3 \u2013 Recent Updates**\n\nYesterday on 10/27, Tattooed Chef entered into an agreement to acquire Belmont Confections, a private label co-manufacturer of nutrition bars, for approximately $18 million in cash and stock. The transaction has been unanimously approved by Tattooed Chef\u2019s Board of Directors and the acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021. The transaction allows Tattooed Chef to further diversify its product offerings and enter into the $10 billion global plant-based bar category. At full capacity, Tattooed Chef believes the Belmont facility can contribute over $100 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-acquire-belmont-confections-120000434.html), for a reference point \u2013 TTCF currently expects 2021 revenue to be $235 million to $242 million so having just under half of that come from Belmont alone in a couple of years in a new market segment is a pretty big deal.\n\nEarlier this month on 10/4, Tattooed Chef announced six of its entr\u00e9e bowls are available in approximately 1,200 Publix Super Markets (\u201cPublix\u201d) stores as of October 1, 2021. Sam Galletti, President and CEO of Tattooed Chef, added that with the addition of Publix, Tattooed Chef products are now in more than 13,000 stores nationwide including Kroger, multiple divisions of Albertsons, Sprouts Farmers Market, Target, Walmart, Costco, and Sam\u2019s Club [link]( [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-now-available-publix-120000419.html).\n\nOn August 10th, Tattooed Chef announced it has launched four entr\u00e9e bowls including two new flavors at Sprouts Farmers Market in approximately 340 stores [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-launches-innovation-items-120000798.html). \n\nIn July, Tattooed Chef announced that it expects to launch its branded products across multiple categories in approximately 1,800 Kroger stores nationwide later this summer. By September, shoppers can find a variety of Tattooed Chef\u2019s plant-based offerings including pizzas, entr\u00e9e bowls, and vegetables in nearly every Kroger. A total of 12 SKU\u2019s will be rolled out nationally [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-launch-kroger-stores-120000706.html). \n\nOn May 18th, Tattooed Chef completed the acquisition of New Mexico Food Distributors, Inc. and Karsten Tortilla Factory, LLC (collectively referred to as \u201cFoods of New Mexico\u201d) for approximately $37.0 million in cash [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-completes-acquisition-mexico-100000887.html). The acquisition of Foods of New Mexico allows Tattooed Chef to expand further into the $20 billion Hispanic/Southwest Food sector and beyond, including frozen, refrigerated, and ambient products. Utilizing these new capabilities, the Company expects to launch Tattooed Chef branded products in additional categories. Foods of New Mexico\u2019s two facilities total 118,000 square feet and\nprovides Tattooed Chef additional capacity to continue to innovate [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb) and is expected to contribute $200m to annual revenues in the next two to three years [link](https://www.just-food.com/news/plant-based-firm-tattooed-chef-to-acquire-foods-of-new-mexico/). \n\nSo in the span of 5 months, some of the highlights of Tattooed Chef include completing an acquisition that doubled the number of manufacturing spaces it had (from just Italy and California to adding Foods of New Mexico, Albuquerque and Foods of New Mexico, Karsten), agreeing on another acquisition that will enable it to enter a new market segment and have another production facility (both of these acquisitions are expected to contribute a combined $300m to revenues in two-three years \u2013 more than the expected full year revenue of the Company this year), launching into two major nationwide chains and continuing to innovate and launch new products \u2013 whatever knock anyone may have on them you can\u2019t deny that they\u2019re moving pretty quickly to lock in sources of major revenue growth. \n\n**Part 4 \u2013 Financials and Valuation**\n\nRevenue \u2013 Revenue for the first half of 2021 was $103.4 million, an increase of 52.2% from $67.9 million in the first half of 2021. The increase in revenue was primarily due to growth in sales of \u201cTattooed Chef\u201d branded products. [link](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390021042632/f10q0621_tattooed.htm#a_003). For the full 2021-year, Tattooed Chef expects revenue in the range of $235 million to $242 million, an increase of 58% to 63% compared to 2020. This guidance implies 49% year-over-year growth on the base business to $222 million, and a $13 million to $20 million contribution from one of the two facilities included in the Foods of New Mexico acquisition [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results). Tattooed Chef is expecting to reach revenue of $1 billion in 2026, so increasing by 5x over the next five years [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-this-food-company-growth-stock-plans-to-generate-%241-billion-in-revenue-2021-02-07), with the expected contributions from two key acquisitions this year \u2013 they could reach that number even earlier than 2026.  The Company expects Foods of New Mexico to contribute up to $200 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-enters-agreements-acquire-new-mexico-food), and the Belmont Confections facility to contribute over $100 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-acquire-belmont-confections-120000434.html). If we do some pretty rough (by pretty rough literally don\u2019t take this as any kind of in-depth analysis \u2013 just guesstimating) back of the envelope math and assume conservatively that both acquisitions begin contributing these numbers in 2024, and assume $240 million for the Company in revenue for this year with a slightly lower year on year growth rate of 50% just to make it easier for numbers\u2019 sake, that would mean $360 million in 2022 (excluding acquisitions), $540 million in 2023 (excluding acquisitions), and $810 million in 2024 (excluding acquisitions). Add in the expected $300m the that Foods of New Mexico and Belmont would be expected to contribute by then and you blow past the $1 billion number a couple of years early (this is assuming of course that operational capacity can sustain these numbers \u2013 the Company currently is quadrupling capacity in 2021) [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nGross Profit \u2013 Gross Profit was $13.9 million in the first half of 2021, compared to $13.0 million in 2020 \u2013 while this was an increase in absolute terms, the Gross Profit Margin declined from 19.1% in 2020 to 13.4% in 2021 thus far. This was primarily due to expenditure on infrastructure to support current and expected growth in operations and increased raw materials, packaging, freight and container costs due to inflation [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). The Company has forecasted improving gross profit margins for the full year 2021 in the range of 16% to 22% [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results), due to leverage of fixed costs on higher volume, benefit of new equipment to enhance operating efficiencies, and the product and channel mix [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nAdjusted EBITDA \u2013 Adjusted EBITDA was ($9.2) million in the first half of 2021, as compared to $9.0 million in the first half of 2020. This was primarily due to public company accounting costs that were not present during the 2020 period, as well as significant increases in promotional expenses, marketing expenses, professional services, and freight and container costs [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb), this is forecasted to be ($14) to ($17) million for the full year 2021 so still decreasing in subsequent quarters, but at a lower rate, as the Company is committed to an aggressive plan of growing its brand through extensive marketing and promotional spending that has already produced significant revenue growth in both grocery and mass retail [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results). \n\nMarket cap of TTCF [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TTCF) is $1.5 billion, in comparison to \u2018competitors\u2019 such as Beyond Meat who have a market cap of ~$6 billion [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYND/). Quotation\u2019s emphasis because TTCF is competing in a broader range of segments so they\u2019re not exactly direct comps but one of the closer ones we\u2019d be able to look at here. Beyond has cash on hand of $1 billion compared to the $140 million that Tattooed Chef had in the last quarter, and also has ~2.5x the revenue with $257.59 million compared to $103.4m for Tattooed Chef, however the revenue growth was only 22.4% for Beyond so ~2.5x less than the 52.2% for Tattooed Chef, with Beyond incurring significant losses as well so as a growth story I would really think that TTCF is valued at magnitudes less than it should be. \n\nThe analyst consensus for TTCF is a buy with an average price target of $23.50 so a 32.17% upside from current prices [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TTCF/price-target/), compared to BYND which has a consensus hold and an average price target of $112.24 so a 18.93% upside from current prices [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/BYND/price-target/), with a P/S of 10.22 for TTCF [link](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-TTCF/financials-statistics-and-ratios/price-sales/) compared to 13.25 for BYND[link](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-BYND/financials-statistics-and-ratios/price-sales/), it would also seem like the more attractive investment with higher upside.   \n\n**Part 5 \u2013 Bear Case**\n\nWell the most obvious risk would be that the Company\u2019s not profitable - as a growth story, it has a higher focus on revenue growth than profitability and my interpretation is that achieving higher revenue is the primary concern over the next couple of years, meaning that there is going to be cash burn in the short-term and I wouldn\u2019t expect them to become profitable till probably around mid-2023. The one-off valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $47.22 million skewed numbers a bit for this year, but if they were to continue making similar amounts of losses (excluding the one-off) so in effect  ~$15 million in the first half of 2021 and doubling that to ~30 million for the full year, they would probably have enough cash to last 3 years \u2013 this is of course a very, very crude estimation as losses would not stay the same in absolute terms, the Company has estimated it\u2019s gross profit margin would improve and they could become profitable within a couple of years as well and keep themselves in the running for longer.\n\nFrom what I understand, the Company is also authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and currently have 81,938,668 shares issued and outstanding, meaning if it seemed like there was going to be a cash crunch, they already have the authorization for a potential dilution which would be a point of concern for any equity holder. I doubt they would need to call on this at least for a year or two and potentially not at all if they turn profitable soon but you can never be certain so worth keeping in mind [link](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390021042632/f10q0621_tattooed.htm#a_003).   \n\nAnother risk would be the promotional/marketing/professional service expenses which seem to have the biggest percentage increases since 2020, as the company continues to build brand awareness and expand its distribution points and stores, marketing expenses especially would be likely to continue to rise. The Company has said that \u2018We expect overall operating expenses to decrease over time as a percentage of revenue as many relatively fixed operating expenses will be spread over increasing revenue, but expect freight and container costs to remain high (relative to historical) as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future,\u2019 [link](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390021042632/f10q0621_tattooed.htm#a_007). The latter sentence about freight and container costs is concerning to me because in my opinion that\u2019s one of the types of costs that a Company doesn\u2019t have too much choice over e.g. if someone is selling you raw material and it becomes too expensive it\u2019s within your control (hopefully if the product isn\u2019t too niche) to switch to another supplier, but here with shipping costs companies are less likely to have that sort of leverage and would probably end up just having to absorb the cost, especially in this case where Tattooed Chef has a production facility in Italy \u2013 not something that I would expect to remain constantly high in the long-run but with current supply chain constraints it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on.\n\nFinally, this is more of a mixed bag of bull and bear, as we\u2019ve seen earlier \u2013 the current opportunity market for Tattooed Chef\u2019s diverse range of products is massive and while having a wide variety of products is great as a buffer in the event one particular segment faces issues e.g. as we\u2019re seeing now with Beyond [link](https://www.reuters.com/business/beyond-meat-forecasts-disappointing-revenue-pandemic-uncertainty-2021-08-05/), there is a risk that increasing competition in this market \u2013 especially by firms leveraging economies of scale by operating in just one particular segment, could pressurize margins (although since Tattooed Chef is vertically integrated, it should be more resilient in this regard than competitors that aren\u2019t).\n\n**Part 6 \u2013 Short Interest**\n\nHigh short interest pumps are now everywhere \u2013 like cheese in a mousetrap with half-baked numbers that just act as clickbait or a cause for people to fomo in. Nevertheless, being aware of short interest as a concept and having the numbers is a useful data point to have \u2013 though I would urge anyone reading this not to just look at SI numbers when making an \u2018investing\u2019 decision. Broken clocks are right twice a day and there are undoubtedly companies for which there is a good justification for folks to be doubling down on shorting them. [Let\u2019s take a look at TTCF\u2019s short interest numbers using the SMELL test](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/nzd2zi/whats_that_smell/). \n\n* Short Interest \u2013 15.5 million shares out of 82 million total shares outstanding. With insiders holding almost half the shares, that leads to short interest of 37.43% of free float [link](https://gyazo.com/c18de608d5efde59055092e26bd6c7a3), Additionally, with utilization of 98.56%, there\u2019s very little left for shorts to borrow to depress the price further [link](https://gyazo.com/3b067c76c0cc8c9d268e3089c9b6c498).\n\n* Market Cap \u2013 $1.5 Billion so at the lower range of a midcap stock, would require a few hundred million for shorts to cover if they were the only ones trading on a given day so would require a good amount of capital to exit or to add further to their short position if they decide to double down. Insiders hold 45.03% of shares outstanding, while institutions hold 16.87% of shares outstanding (30.7% of the free float) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TTCF/holders?p=TTCF).  \n\n* Extremely Memeable \u2013 Can\u2019t think of too many better causes to get behind than saving the planet by eating your vegetables \u2013 if only you\u2019d listen to ma when you were a kid and ate some broccoli instead of meatloaf we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\n\n* Low Liquidity \u2013 Average volume per yahoo finance is around 1.5m shares, with current volume around 20% lower than that so &lt;5% of the free float. Any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly, which would be exacerbated by the fact that the most recently reported days to cover was 13.49 [link](https://gyazo.com/817e2edb0eb27d294c414d19eed52f58) which means at the current volume shorts would need almost 3 weeks to cover their positions. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on TTCF for cheap, with institutional inflows of $119M and only $6.57M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TTCF/institutional-ownership/) so a net increase of ~95%.\n\n* Low Risk (IV) \u2013 Yep, current IV is 47.1% for 10/29 and 11/5 options so pretty cheap to load up on if you\u2019re so inclined. A good resource to understand the mechanics of a gamma ramp can be found here in my opinion if that\u2019s the sort of thing that interests you [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prcdnr/why_you_suck_ass_at_gamma_squeezing_and_what_you/). \n\n**Part 7 \u2013 TL; DR**\n\nThe total global plant-based retail market size is expected to reach $162 billion in 2030, increasing by more than 500% from $29 billion in 2020. Key drivers that result in folks pursuing a plant-based diet are typically health, animal welfare and the environment. Tattooed Chef\u2019s current market opportunity is worth $42 billion and consists of several frozen food categories including frozen appetizers &amp; snacks, frozen breakfast foods, frozen entrees, frozen fruits &amp; vegetables, and frozen plant-based meat alternatives.\n\nTattooed Chef is a leading plant-based food company offering a broad portfolio of innovative plant-based food products that taste great and are sustainably sourced with signature products include ready-to-cook bowls, zucchini spirals, riced cauliflower, acai and smoothie bowls, and cauliflower pizza crusts, which are available in the frozen food sections of leading national retail food stores across the United States. The Company\u2019s product portfolio consists of entrees, breakfast, vegetables, pizza, meat alternatives, and with yesterday\u2019s acquisition news \u2013 they\u2019ll also be entering into nutrition bars. The growth in their portfolio and product range has been pretty explosive, especially in the last year where they went from 38 total products and 17 total new innovations in 2020 to 73 total products and 35 total new innovations in 2021.\n\nA key strength of Tattooed Chef and its USP is its vertically integrated operations that enable it to create a strategic advantage with control of ingredients and prioritization of product, the ability to go from innovation to market in as little as 3 months and soon to be 5 manufacturing facilities. Key highlights included 52% year on year growth in revenue from H1 2020 to H1 2021, 82% year on year growth in the established brand from H1 2020 to H1 2021**with no investment in marketing and brand until 2021**, strong resources with ~$140 million cash balance, 275k square feet of manufacturing capacity to quadruple in 2021 and opportunity for strategic M&amp;A (closed 2 key acquisitions in 2021), and growth in sales and marketing including launching the first national media campaign, and tripling of branded store count with key customers including Walmart, Sam\u2019s Club, Costco, Target, Trader Joe\u2019s, Aldi, Kroger, Whole Foods, Albertsons Safeway, Harris Teeter, and Publix. In a study of mass retailers, 3 of the top 10 items including the #1 and #2 since launch in March 2021 of plant based frozen entrees belonged to Tattooed Chef, with dollar velocity over 60% above the nearest top 10 competitor.\n\nRevenue for the first half of 2021 was $103.4 million, an increase of 52.2% from $67.9 million in the first half of 2021. For the full 2021-year, Tattooed Chef expects revenue in the range of $235 million to $242 million, an increase of 58% to 63% compared to 2020. Tattooed Chef is expecting to reach revenue of $1 billion in 2026, so increasing by 5x over the next five years, with the expected contributions from two key acquisitions this year \u2013 they could reach that number even earlier than 2026. Gross Profit was $13.9 million in the first half of 2021, compared to $13.0 million in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was ($9.2) million in the first half of 2021, as compared to $9.0 million in the first half of 2020. \n \nMarket cap of TTCF is $1.5 billion, in comparison to \u2018competitors\u2019 such as Beyond Meat who have a market cap of ~$6 billion. The analyst consensus for TTCF is a buy with an average price target of $23.50 so a 32.17% upside from current prices, compared to BYND which has a consensus hold and an average price target of $112.24 so a 18.93% upside from current prices, with a P/S of 10.22 for TTCF compared to 13.25 for BYND, it would also seem like the more attractive investment with higher upside.   \n\nRisks include the Company not being currently profitable due to an immediate focus on the top-line, potential for dilution as the Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and currently have 81,938,668 shares issued and outstanding, likelihood of increasing marketing expenses even though the Company has an expectation of a decrease in OPEX as a percentage of revenue. \n\nTattooed Chef passes the SMELL test for with high SI if the conditions are right, as short interest is 37.43% of free float with utilization of 98.56%, market cap is at the lower range of a midcap stock so capital required to cover is not insignificant in the event of shorts wanting to exit or doubling down on their positions, meme-ability is high, liquidity is low with around 1.5m shares traded on average and 13.49 days to cover, and low risk as IV is sub 50% for the next couple of weeks of options in the run-up to earnings.\n\nAppreciate y\u2019all for reading this if you made it this far. I\u2019m playing the runup to earnings because the stock has barely moved with yesterday\u2019s acquisition news and I believe there\u2019ll be some short covering going on in the meantime over the next couple of weeks in expectation of a growth beat as certain milestones that could impact that have already been surpassed e.g. the target of 12,000 stores by Q3 2021 was already announced as over 13,000 in the 10/4 press release. If it does end up picking up in the short-term, I\u2019ll be looking to roll the gains into leaps post-earnings. Positions \u2013 30 x 18.5c @ 10/29 and 20 x 20c @ 11/5.",

And when this happens, what likely timeframe will we see a systemic crash throughout the Chinese real estate market due to this default? Nearly 30% of China\u2019s GDP is in real estate and if their real estate market crashes, one would expect a crash to their entire economy. How likely is this scenario and if so, what is the likely timeframe of this occurring? Weeks, months?

        "selftext": "I just had an idea. Suppose that you're a rich person, with at least $1 billion dollars on hand to exist. Maybe not all your money, but in an investment account that you control.\n\nFind a stock with an options market, but low trading volume. For example: [Sigma Labs](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SGLB/). Current price $3, average volume 500,000. It has a call option at $5.\n\nBuy up as many of those $5 call options as you can, all expiring on the same day. Buy some of the further out ones too. As many call options as you can get without massively distorting the market. You can buy them gradually over a long period, just as long as they're all the same expiration.\n\nThen, on the day they expire, start buying the stock like crazy. Buy buy buy. Place a massive market order, all at once. You're not trying to get good fills, you're just trying to drive the stock price up as much as possible, right before trading closes. Now all your options are deep in the money- sell them for a profit. You could even go short the calls, to get rid of some of your stock. Sell the stock gradually over the next few months to get rid of it (or keep it if you want I guess). You'll probably lose money on the stock itself, but make a killing on the options trade.\n\nI don't have a solid calculation of the numbers of this though.

Most of y\u2019all assumed it was way out bc of US legalizations taking forever\u2026 Y\u2019all went to pursue vanity in other run ups while I built my my kingdom. I have passionately followed the incessant fall in TLRY price since January of 2019\u2026 Since then I have yet to lose any money because I quite simply do not realize losses. In fact all I have done is increase my ever cheaper stock in increasing amounts \ud83d\ude33. Would you look at that. \n\n(Plz skip this) \nWhat have y\u2019all been doing?  AMC can go burn in hell where it belongs for charging 15.00 for popcorn\u2026movie theatres are fun and all but all the big media giants have learned to profit without theatres\u2026. In fact they profit much more\u2026 there will always be demand for theatres\u2026 but now new releases are available on native streaming platforms. \n\nSo yeah idek why I mentioned that\u2026 tbh I may be what you call \u201chigh af\u201d. \ud83d\ude18 But you don\u2019t have to be high to want TLRY stock.. They are the best positioned of any major weed company to profit in the coming years\u2026go check out the TLRY subreddit for the company news and developments since earlier this year\u2026 it has all the info you need. \n\nBasically it boils down to German, then European Legalization. With German election results showing that the SPD (the opposition to merkel) has won, legalization is nearly certain as the vast majority of that part and its supporters are pro legalization\u2026.as is their Green Party who  is most likely to merge with the SPD. (Awesome) this is big bc Germany only has two liscenced operating distributors and the largest one is TLRY\u2026\n\nUS legalizations are just now around the corner and it\u2019s best to be in it earlier.. the price has most likely bottomed out and after earning October 7th that will most likely show strong results we will be set for 20+\n\nThe time is now \u2026\n\n(This post was created with the help of Tornado Of Souls - Megadeth)",

        "selftext": "There's an old saying in Tennessee -- I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee -- that says: Two in the pink, one in the TWNK.\n\nI realize none of you have any idea what the pink is, but you should all get familiar with the TWNK. This snack of a stock is currently undergoing a slow melt-up caused by fundamentals: a steady quarters-long COVID-fueled turnaround and more recently a Morgan Stanley upgrade (PT: $16 -&gt; $20) on Sept 21. Since then, it has ignored all indexes and steadily climbed from $16 to an all-time high of nearly $19.\n\nIn addition to fundamentals improving, it appears short interest (established mostly in the sub $15 range, at least six months ago) has decided to start the long and arduous task of covering a low-liquidity stock. They probably made a big bet that people were as soy as them and wanted to eat healthier, and somehow COVID would be some sort of reckoning. Well, they ignored the fact the CEO has spent his entire career successfully shilling unhealthy packaged foods... and also ignored the fact this is fucking America: land of the free, home of the snacks. I think bears are now seeing their thesis sucks Ding Dongs and the don't want to wait until Q3 earnings Nov 3-8 to take it up their brownies.\n\nThe problem the bears have is liquidity. The \\~20m shorted shares, or \\~$400m worth, would take 10-15 days to cover at 100% of the current volume. Even a fraction of that would move the price significantly. It appears it already has, as the price has steadily been rising these past few sessions, while estimated SI has been falling. I assume they are trying to get out before earnings. It's not the percent float that is killing them, it's the low liquidity. Oh, yeah, and the company is buying back shares at the same time.\n\nIf that doesn't get your fruit pie all wet, consider this: This stock is low-beta and low-volatility:\n\n1. Anybody who shorted this would not have expected it to move up 30% within six months after opening their position.\n2. Even though the share price has recently been climbing steadily at about 1.00% to 2.00% per day, this thing has a retardly low ATM IV30 of 35%.\n3. Another 10% move in share price would print pretty well. A move to $20+ would be a multibagger for November options. If IV goes up, that's icing.\n4. It's squeezed twice before (Jan 28, Early June), and both times it printed.\n5. The document below has a lot of words and graphs.\n\nLastly, as far as I can tell this thing has zero social traction anywhere. I checked twitter, fintwit, etc... nothing. To me, that means the likelihood of a rug pull is pretty low, and that would also explain why the IV is low as well. The last two times IV approached 35%+ were preceding squeezes, with IV30 spiking up to the 80s. So I'll happily scoop up some options and sit around and wait for this to catch on wherever the hell people talk about twinks.\n\n**It's time to spread your Honey Buns and** ***squeeze*** **one out with your favorite TWNK.**\n\n# 1. The Likely Bear Thesis\n\nI'm imagining it went something like this...\n\nSome over-priveleged 28-year-old PM decides everybody is just like him and has spent COVID perfecting their homemade nut-based keto energy bar recipe and riding their Peleton. \"Everywhere I look, people are talking about healthy snacks!\" he thinks to himself while scrolling finspo instagram bullshit before nodding off to sleep.\n\nHis dreams consist of 30-second recipe videos of trendy bullshit healthy crap, and his days are full of him listening to his girlfriend talk about all the healthy shit she ate and how she now deserves some oat-based ice cream. Together they listen to podcasts about healthy food being amazing and how processed food is so bad for you and is somehow or another probably racist.\n\nAt work, he tells his analysts to take a look at how to capitalize on the health food craze. It's time to do some good in the world and get rid of unhealthy processed foods! They find stats and surveys that say everybody wants to be healthier and that COVID was a reckoning for them to take care of their bodies. They see that sales of $20 oat-based ice cream have skyrocketed. With all the confirmation bias in place, he decides: We must go long healthy shit, and short unhealthy shit.\n\nSo, they picked the company with a portfolio consisting of \"Twinkies\", \"Zingers\", \"Ding Dongs\", and other shit they would never touch.. because processed food is so terrible! Yuckies! Who would put that stuff into their temple -- I mean, their bodies?! Unthinkable! In the futures, convenience stores will see how harmful these are, and simply not sell them! Or people will do what they said they would do on surveys -- eat healthier!\n\nWhat they didn't think about was who actually buys Hostess brands snacks. It's not the 10% of people that have the means and discipline to treat their bodies with respect all the time; it's the 90% of people that indulge themselves or want something fast and cheap and don't give a shit about what is good or bad, they give their body what it wants. People that buy food from wherever is cheap and convenient.\n\nAnd they certainly didn't think about how the genius CEO has decades of experience marketing unhealthy consumer packaged goods. They aren't just snacks to him -- they are little bites of happiness.\n\n**Why would you short happiness?!**\n\n# 2. The Company, and the Turnaround\n\nHostess filed for bankruptcy in 2012. It hit the news because people were dreading saying goodbye to their favorite cream-filled phallic snack, the Twinkie. Private equity purchased the brands and they restarted production in 2013, then completed a SPAC merger in 2016 to go public.\n\n## The Turnaround\n\nA few key things have propelled them forward in the past few years:\n\n1. **New CEO**. In May 2018, they signed on Andrew Callahan as their CEO. This guy's entire life has centered around packaged consumer goods and branding. Prior to Hostess, he was the president of retail packaged brands at Tyson. That includes these brands: Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, Sara Lee, and Ball Park. Prior to that, he worked at Kraft Foods. **This guy knows how to sling fatty foods to the American consumer.** As a result, they've had 14 consecutive quarters of positive revenue growth.\n2. **Pre and Post COVID**. COVID catapulted their business. It turns out that when people are at home all day they tend to eat snacks a lot. Furthermore, as post-COVID traffic recovers, Hostess is seeing their single-serve and convenience store sales (the largest share of sales) pick up at a rapid pace. This trend is expected to continue.\n3. **Innovation**. Believe it or not, there is innovation in the junk food business. With their Voortman Cookies acquisition in Jan 2020, Hostess is creating \"healthier\" product off-shoots under a well respected brand. For their Hostess branded goods, they're expanding into breakfast junk food, adding new flavors to their already-iconic junk food, creating limited-time offerings of the junk food, and expanding the channels by which they sell their junk food (eg: more varieties of single serve snacks).\n4. **Good Marketing, and Human Nature**. It turns out people like sweet and fatty foods. They like convenience. They like single-serve. COVID or not. If they are told they are buying happiness, they'll buy more. (Hostess also sells stuff healthier stuff under a brand they acquired in Jan 2020, Voortman, which is contributing nicely to their bottom line.)\n\n## Q2 Earnings, Guidance, Etc\n\nTheir Q2 earnings were arguably their best yet, showing double digit CAGR rates for both revenue and EBITDA since Q2 2019. They lowered leveraged from 4.3x to 3.4x. They raised FY21 net revenue growth rate to 7.5 - 9.0% from 3.0 - 4.5% I won't bore you with the details: Most things were up and to the right. Find their Q2 investor presentation, Q2 conference call transcript, etc, do your own DD on the company to confirm this shit.\n\nHere are two delicious slides from the Q2 earnings presentation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Signature TWNK color scheme. Fabulous!](https://preview.redd.it/4p274cml4us71.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bafda422e24d0d79b00fcd0d6f066ae8de7079a4)\n\nThere's seemingly still room for share price to appreciate. They trade at around 11x EBITDA, with their mid-cap food peer group averaging 13x. The very same peers that they are poised to out-perform by virtue of a ton of their sales consisting of single-serve and convenience. Back-to-school and post-COVID recovery traffic will start coming down the pipe.\n\nAnalysts are catching on. Morgan Stanley upgraded to \"overweight\" (lol) and a PT of $20. This seemingly kicked off a rally. I don't have access to the their coverage -- if you do, give me a hollar.\n\n&gt;Morgan Stanley analyst Pamela Kaufman upgraded Hostess Brands to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $20, up from $16, as she assumed coverage of large cap packaged food companies at the firm. Hostess, which she sees being positioned to benefit from tailwinds that include a shifting consumer preferences toward more snacking, increasing consumer mobility and potential revenue synergies from its Voortman acquisition, is now her Top Pick\n\nTheir share price has appreciated substantially, especially considering they are consumer packaged goods, which means low beta, low vol. So to move from $12.50 to $19 in under a year is quite a significant move. Any sensible party shorting this is probably thinking twice about their position heading into Q3 earnings.\n\nAgain, do your own DD on this. My take is they've turned shit around, and the price action and analyst upgrades seem to support that. It's possible they've reached fair value already. I  think there's still gas in the tank.\n\n## Buyback\n\nFrom [the latest 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001644406/000164440621000009/twnk-20201231.htm) \\-- go to page 27, bullet #1.\n\n&gt;In November 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a securities repurchase program of up to $100 million of its outstanding securities. The program has no expiration date. The program may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company's discretion and does not commit the Company to repurchase its securities.\n\nAs of Q2 earnings, they've spent around $25m of that $100m. If they continued to buy back at that rate through Q3, that'd put them at roughly $50m spent and $50m left right now.\n\n# 3. Will It Squeeze\n\nWill it squeeze? The short answer: All signs point to \"it currently is squeezing, but slowly\" -- shorts cannot exit quickly due to low liquidity, and they would prefer not to squeeze themselves. I think it will continue to slowly melt-up until they hit a price point that provides enough liquidity to really cover a lot of their position.\n\nI also wouldn't claim that shorts are *forced* to cover. I think that currently it is in their best interest to close out as much as they can below the \"worst-case\" upward price action that earnings might cause. I simply cannot know if the shorts are distressed or not. CTB is low, utilization is low. So if they have the budget, there is plenty of wiggle room to survive a \"squeeze\" attempt.\n\nA few more important things to note:\n\n* It is supposed to be a boring stock. Low volume. Low volatility. Low liquidity.\n* Shorts would typically enter and exit positions very slowly and carefully.\n* Shorts would probably only enter a position based on a bearish outlook of fundamentals, and not much else.\n* **Catalyst 1**: Fundamentally, company is doing well. COVID helped them. Recovery helps them. Q2 earnings crushed and guidance was increased.\n* **Catalyst 2**: Sep 21: MS upgraded to \"overweight\", PT $20.\n* **Catalyst 3**: Nov 3-8: Q3 earnings. Do they want to keep their bet through the print?\n* Short positions are guaranteed underwater, and given the low expected volatility, the current share price movement is well outside of norms.\n* Shorts' mark to market losses are likely edging on \"unexpectedly high\", and with the fundamentals of the company vastly improving, and Q3 earnings coming up, it may not be a bet they want to continue.\n* Util is low, CTB is low -- they are likely not \"forced to cover\" for some time, but vastly prefer to get out while they can.\n\nBelow is some analysis of the short situation.\n\n## SMELL\n\nI periodically screen for SMELLy stocks that could see some interesting squeeze-like behavior. TWNK has been SMELLy for awhile, but it looks as though finally the catalysts for it have arrived: a fundamental turnaround, a PT upgrade, the price starting to move like crazy. It's a nice bonus that shorts seem to voluntarily want to cover.\n\nAnyway, I'll go over SMELL briefly:\n\n* **S**hort Interest: 20m shares, around $400m, all underwater. Established between Feb and March. It's not super high % float, and Util and CTB are low, but it's a large bet on the company failing based on fundamentals... which is turning out to be wrong. They'll want to cover eventually. DTC is around 10-15, at 100% volume. Let's say they go with 20% daily volume and only cover 1/5th. That's still a solid 10-15 days of covering.\n* **M**arket Cap: It's in the goldilocks zone. Small enough for retail to have an impact. Large enough for notional short interest to be meaningful.\n* **E**xtremely Memeable: What are you into? Snoballing? Ding Dongs? The mascot, \"King Ding Dong\"? Do you like Honey Buns... how about Giant Honey Buns? Are you into twinks? Do you like sticking things into fruit pies or brownies? Whatever you want, Hostess brands has you covered.\n* **L**ow Liquidity: This ensures shorts covering will impact stock price. A combination of low volume, high market impact (each $ bought pushes price up a lot), etc. TWNK has a pretty low daily volume, especially considering the short interest.\n* **L**ow IV: Causes upside in the delta-hedging aspect of the options chain: Vanna can vastly increase deltahedging obligation (eg, if volatility goes up, MMs will buy more stonk), and gamma will generally be quite high ATM, providing an early boost. Also, low IV means you long vol for cheap -- if a squeeze does occur you make bank.\n\nSo, yeah, TWNK checks all the boxes. It can fly easily. And it's done so twice before already.\n\n## Ortex\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Lots of colors and lines means stonk go up.](https://preview.redd.it/1kbjz43n4us71.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=645be905222352dbdf71c7ddf155fb710ab103a5)\n\nHere's my breakdown:\n\n1. This was a one-day squeeze on Jan 28, likely distressed books that got fucked over by the other meme tickers at the time. Price spiked massively, and slowly decayed, bottoming out 5.00% higher from where it started.\n2. Based on the current average loan age, this is the accumulation zone for most of the current short interest.\n3. This was during the second squeeze season, early June. Price went from $15.50 to $17.30 on incredible volume. Stabilized at $16.50.\n4. It's difficult to tell what exactly is happening here. First, I have to trust the exchange reported SI and assume short interest is actually decreasing during this period. Second, the Ortex On Loan increasing is Ortex increasing their data sources. They eventually get to more On Loan than SI, which is what is expected. Third, there's a clear trend of shorts covering here. The On Loan age rises slightly slower than time, so that indicates more older shorts are covering than newer shorts.\n5. Q2 Earnings bounce, then MS upgrade. On Loan starts to trend down (for the first time since Jan 28), and estimate SI starts to tank, in line with the share price mooning. It's clear shorts are net covering.\n\nThe main takeaways from this are the following:\n\n1. On Loan Average Age was 150 days on July 6, and 210 days on Oct 7. That means the average loan date has shifted from early February to mid March. Combined with the fact that short interest is decreasing, it would appear that older shorts are starting to cover, but slowly.\n2. Feb - Mar prices were nearing multi-year highs at $15, and prior to that it was a rocket ship up from COVID, where it hit a low of $9.00.  So, the vast majority of the 20m shorted shares are well underwater. **How will they react to this fundamental shift?**\n3. There's a long way to go before shorts are out of this. **Since late August, Estimated SI has only dropped from 23m to 20m, yet share price has shot up. Even if shorts cover only another 4m-5m shares, there will be significant price action.**\n\n## Short Volume\n\nWe can also look at short volume, which has fallen off a cliff since early September, and hitting lows right now. Unsurprisingly, when there is less short volume ratio, the share price tends to move up (circled regions).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Less shorting correlates to stock going up? Wow!](https://preview.redd.it/c2w4rj7o4us71.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=801bd9413af1ba4f3736814c1ffa7cc13bf47061)\n\nI see an overall trend of short volume ratio decreasing. The question is, of course, will it bounce back up? If not, I suspect TWNK continues this melt up.\n\n## Recent Price Action\n\nSince Sep 21, the stock has been on an absolute tear, hitting ATHs. Both in absolute terms, but also relative to SPY.\n\nYou might think based on \"stonk go up now\" there are TWNK fanatics sitting on the sidelines consistently buying in day after day based on what their God, Morgan Stanley, says. **The far more likely conclusion, as supported by all of the above, is that the shift in fundamentals and the stock hitting ATHs is convincing shorts to capitulate and slowly cover before Q3 earnings in November.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I spent 12 hours making the \\\\\"daily alpha\\\\\" thing.](https://preview.redd.it/1urejrep4us71.png?width=1826&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c584783d0fa818bdb0ee11620b4822fbec043df2)\n\nI spent this weekend learning PineScript, which is fucking god awful bullshit, just to make the cute little \"Daily Alpha\" indicator thing below. What this does it it computes the stocks Beta relative to another ticker (SPY, in this case), then plots the daily price action relative to the \"expected\" price action.\n\nFor TWNK its beta is 0.40 (computed using a daily lookback of 200 days). So if SPY is up 1.00%, you'd expect TWNK to be up 0.40%. For each little daily plot, you see a gray line which indicates this \"expected\" price action for TWNK: basically what SPY is for that day, times 0.40. The blue line is the price action for TWNK. The region between those two lines is Alpha, which is filled in either green or red, and the magnitude of Alpha (the distance between those two lines) is plotted as a histogram. The three yellow lines (both above and below) the zero line are the standard deviations of alpha returns (using a lookback of 90 days).\n\nBasically, this shows us by what amount TWNK is outperforming \"the market\". In this case we use SPY. (I'm all ears for a decent consumer packaged goods benchmark to use.)\n\nYou can see TWNK smashed 3-sigma Sep 21, and has been flirting with 1-sigma for days on end. Not exactly rocket science and definitely not worth the time I put into it.\n\n**The takeaway: PineScript sucks. Also, TWNK is going up and doesn't give a fuck what SPY is doing. Also, it's probably from shorts covering. And there are a lot of shorts.**\n\n## Options Chain / Gamma\n\nThe options chain is pretty scarce, but to the extent it exists it is quite bullish:\n\n[ Many more calls than puts.](https://preview.redd.it/ahh1pdfv4us71.png?width=1469&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5af1791c0a2f35947f08fc12db975315857c4a7)\n\nMostly calls, hardly any puts.\n\nIn terms of net delta and gamma, there's not much:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Very neutral. Not much gamma, charm, or vanna.](https://preview.redd.it/e21cj5cw4us71.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6de507da965df8b33f5921002f30bb0cd055adb)\n\nThe percent relative to volume is somewhat interesting, but I don't expect MMs to push this around due to the underlying changing. I do expect some minor effect from them buying/selling shares when they sell calls/puts, but not much at all.\n\n# 4. The Previous Squeezes\n\nAs mentioned before, TWNK has seen two squeezes before:\n\n1. Jan 28, in sympathy with the other meme tickers.\n2. Early June, in sympathy with squeeze season 2.0\n\nHere's how the IV played out in those cases:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Green Line = IV30, Purple Line = 20d Realized Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/hwtf3hpy4us71.png?width=1461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eadb6b098e8e822f54975c5937c7cee72affcacc)\n\nSo, I think IV has a shot at popping up here. That's tendies for anyone who has those options and doesn't FOMO in at the peak of IV.\n\nTo be clear, the arrows are pointing at these two dates:\n\n* Jan 28\n* Jun 3, Jun 8\n\nHere's what happened after those two dates:\n\n**Jan 28**\n\n[ IV spiked Jan 28. This likely printed huge.](https://preview.redd.it/q8viknt05us71.png?width=1809&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bcefcf431296b85a328dbb71706e9b741b3cfc1)\n\n**Jun 3 and 8**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[IV spiked Jun 3 and 8. Looks like this printed huge as well, provided you timed it half-way decently.](https://preview.redd.it/4w67clv45us71.png?width=1816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b86e65bbd01a0ddf013f458e99996aa4272cc057)\n\nIn both cases, price spiked up and levelled off above where it started, and IV settled way higher than where it started. So as long as you bought non-degen options, you probably printed pretty well.\n\nI have higher hopes this time around, as the price action is so far entirely natural and not due to whatever factors tend to raise IV.. cough degens-buying-far-OTM-weeklies cough.\n\n# 5. Be Realistic\n\nShorts may not be \"forced to cover\". If share price rockets up, they might hold out for longer and wait for a better exit, particularly one that Q3 earnings will provide via a lot of volume. Or they may hedge with calls or something else.\n\nRealistically, there are two price points to consider:\n\n1. \"We'd be happy to keep shorting it at this price, even through the earnings\". This is probably slightly above the price they think it'll end up at after the Q3 dust settles. I have no clue what they think that price is. It appears to be \"higher than the current price\".\n2. \"Oh shit, this price blows up our account\". I have no idea what this price is. It's a low-volatility low-beta stock, so it could be fairly low. However, I would not bet on it.\n\nI think shorts will slowly cover until they hit price #1 -- which I think is still a ways up from here. High enough that cheap ass 35% IV options will pay off.\n\nI don't think we'll hit price #2. Although, anything could happen. If IV gets jacked, it's possible they'll have no means to hedge and end up hitting price #2. This is a supposedly low-volatility stock, so a spike upwards might not be well planned for. **All that being said, I'm not banking on that happening.**\n\nI think a slow melt-up into Q3 earnings is very likely. I think cheap options will pay off. I don't think it will maintain high price levels ($22+), or high IV (IV30 80%+) for very long. In these situations, fair value is eventually achieved -- yes, the shorts might pay their exit fee first, but that exit fee is finite.\n\n# 6. Positions, etc\n\n## This is not financial advice.\n\nEarnings is Nov 3-8, so Nov 19s are a safer bet. However, stock has been on a tear lately and I suspect it may continue this week. So I bought some Oct's which I'll ride out a little.\n\n**I'm in with Oct 15 $17.50s, Nov 19 $20s.** I purchased most of these Friday.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ebppuac65us71.png?width=884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f7bcf526f6973a0712eb4979e99817676d91fb9\n\n**Some plays to consider:**\n\n* Oct 15 $17.50: A bet the stock continues its short term upward trend this week.\n* Oct 15 $20.00: Degenerate play and probably a waste of money.\n* Nov 19 $17.50: Kind of a pussy play but I think it'll pay off nicely.\n* Nov 19 $20.00: Honey Bun.\n* Shares: Meh. Might make 20%?\n\nGo further OTM than $20, and you're retarded. Too illiquid, and way less likely to hit. The only people buying/selling will be fellow degens. You could buy more of something less risky and you'll get similar returns.\n\nNotes:\n\n* Historically IV30 tops out at 80%. As IV30 approaches 80%, consider your actions carefully.\n* I get IV30 from IBKR and from market chameleon. Figure out what works for you. Don't buy when IV is high.\n\n# 7. TLDR\n\nBear thesis is that unhealthy bad and healthy good. Hostess fundamentals continue to improve, company making moneys. As a result, analysts upgrade and stock price has hit all-time highs. Long-standing short interest (\\~$400m, largely at $15 or below) seems to have started covering. They might want out before Q3 earnings, Nov 3-8. Stock is low liquidity, so when they cover the price goes up. Stock is low IV so options print. Stock has squeezed twice before, both times printing, but this time it's fundamentals-driven so maybe it'll print even harder. Oct or Nov calls, up to $20. Further OTM at your own peril. Not financial advice.",

        "selftext": "Do you know about AAPL, the original cult stock?\n\nWell, it\u2019s now the largest company in the world.\n\nThe AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. \n\nDIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant.\n\nLet's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to r/pcmasterrace or other similar places, the cult vibe is relentless and unending. Their only position being: INTC and Epic(private company) bad. AMD, NVDA, Valve daddies good.\n\nAnd look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult!\n\nOf course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE.\n\nCult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical.\n\nI am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC.\n\nAMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.\ud83d\ude02\nINTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction.\n\nBut does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals.\n\nIt\u2019s supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think).\n\nAlso, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevator valuation is highly likely.\n\n\nNow, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything?\nIf the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. \n(I am not saying you shouldn\u2019t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult)\n\nAs long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely.\n\nWith all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter.\n\nTL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults.",

        "selftext": "This probably happens often, but I rarely see any posts about it. You rarely hear from the losers. Since those people probably just stop posting on forums when it happens. So I'm swallowing the pride and posting about my losses. \n\nI started invested January 5 this year as a New Year's resolution. I got Rich Dad Poor dad youtube video recommended to me and didnt realize I had been spending my money on liabilities all this time. I went heavy into SPACs, Cathie Wood stocks, biotech, and I got into AMC due to the \"recovery\" stock trade that was all over CNBC. I somehow didnt have a red day with those stocks for 15 straight days and the turning point was WSB looking at short interest and pumping several stocks late January. And Robinhood shutting off the buy option. I had just started investing and didn't realize at the time that turning off buying pressure meant the stocks would tank. And that was my first blow up. My portfolio dropped 35% in a day. That day was January 28th.\n\nI started following WSB since while my account blew up it seemed their stocks were getting massive gains. So I went all in on weed stocks. And I recovered my losses. But I didnt take profits and I had another blow up on February 10th. My account had another 35% drop. As I was in options and the entire weed sector crashed in premarket. So by the time I could sell it was too late.\n\nWith what I now know I should have had trailing stop losses if I was in momentum stocks but I decided after the weed stock crash to go all in on tech stocks to name some of them CRWD, AAPL, MSFT, CRWD, NET, and SE. It worked for 2 months I had somehow recovered my losses for the third time. Then around the week of 4/20 there started to be inflation panic and those stocks tanked. Stock subs and CNBC were calling tech stocks terrible at the time and after three weeks of constant losses and my account blew up for the third time I sold all my stocks around May 10-13. Which in retrospect was a bottom.\n\n\n\nSo I got back into stocks the following week May 17th. And I stopped following WSB stock picks, did my own DD, and have a diversified portfolio and a Roth IRA with index funds. But Im sick to my stomach since im down still down 40% overall 5 months later. When I gave up on WSB stocks that meant I sold AMC in February which if I had I held that would have recovered all my losses from the May panic sell at the bottom. Now once a month there is FUD that the market is overvalued and there is gonna be a crash on stock subs and CNBC. And im like wtf I already dealt with three crashes that just gets swept under the rug with SPACs, weed stocks, and several small cap stocks losing like 70% of their value since Febuary. It just feels like it is a different market from my first two months and I messed up not taking profits on three occasions. My portfolio would have been up 500% instead im down 60%.",

        "selftext": "Hidden in plain sight. Trump is actively using and publicly touting the $AIAD owned campaign tech and service - Nucleus - and its niche market position has crazy asymmetric gain opportunities going into the 2022 election season.\u00a0\n\nDue to a ton of obscure filings, most of the retail public doesn\u2019t know that the trading parent company - $AIAD - is the one who benefits as Trump\u2019s entire web services and data collection currently runs off of Nucleus. This stock soared 1100% higher in January. I\u2019m looking for similar gains now.\n\n**TLDR summary**: $AIAD owns \u201cCampaign Nucleus\u201d - the provider behind Trump\u2019s current web tech and the creator of a scalable automated ecosystem that provides their web services to conservative politicians. The recent \u201cTruth\u201d announcement and increase in data/traffic means more profit for $AIAD. This was hard to track down and is probably why few people have the evidence below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l9wele7samv71.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cec00acbc565537d7a3d16fc157faeef249fe34a\n\n**Nucleus rabbit hole**\n\nLast week, Trump\u2019s \u201cTruth\u201d Announcement came from Campaign Nucleus\u2019 Press List. This was the first confirmation Trump is still using Nucleus\u2019 data/client services after a weird fallout with his former campaign manager (Brad Parscale). Important. Excerpt below.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ym0pe6bvamv71.png?width=980&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad115bf1e7ebed1bf3aaf88d1868ff8b947f57c1\n\nLikewise, Trump's website/blog is publicly advertising using Nucleus for its data services\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rl3rx9dwamv71.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e39f60d0287b68ba7949d9a9c420ec6ddfcb046\n\n**So why haven\u2019t I heard about this**\n\nIt\u2019s complicated. There have been a lot of moving parts and changes.\n\n1. In 2016, Brad Parscale created Nucleus as a part of his Digital Media service.\n2. In 2017, Parscale sold \u201cParscal Digital Media\u201d to CloudCommerice and became the largest shareholder.\u00a0\n3. In Feb 2021, CloudCommerce ($CLWD) rebranded to AIAdvertising ($AIAD), completed in Aug 2021. Parscale is still the largest shareholder\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0w4ib0jxamv71.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=462e0d5fd3a0055e7d294c8ce764f35e6b74c0c5\n\n**Are we sure $AIAD owns Nucleus?**\n\nYes. $AIAD's recent 10Q and CloudCommerce\u2019s former LinkedIn page confirms this. They still own Parscale Digital. Campaign Nucleus is a service offered/owned by Parscale Digital. Ie. $AIAD owns Nucleus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rumod4hzamv71.png?width=1602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79526859aad2976b90da999458eca8b227b95652\n\nHere\u2019s a link to the parscale website. Nucleus is clearly a standout. Included the screenshot below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bucogqqyamv71.png?width=2114&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad18639a9ad963c41dde0d481dcff28baff0c47f\n\n**$AIAD is cheap and has phenomenal growth**\n\nPut it into perspective. $AIAD is doing fantastically with growth. This is before the potential of many conservative politicians (half of the entire electorate) starting to use Nucleus\u2019 Trump-advocated services for the 2022 elections coming up. Currently it\u2019s the only conservative-leaning campaign services being offered. You can bet this will explode and be devoured by conservative politicians if it\u2019s being touted by trump.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t3yepu41bmv71.png?width=1332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d561b3e63e94aa4220922feac413ed8d3049ca8e\n\n**Other stuff**\n\n$AIAD is filing for a reverse split to be listed in the Nasdaq within the next year. SEC filing here. The set split number is still unknown, but this is good news in my opinion.\n\nI\u2019ve heard people spreading FUD about Parscale (largest shareholder) selling 9 million shares. The guy has 215million shares still and held them after the price was up 1100% from current prices in January. Him selling is the least of my concerns.\u00a0\n\nVolume is dramatically increasing in the darkpool. Something is brewing\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mdjq4m42bmv71.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7a38115c74de5de9d9242fcb23fea1a31cc3edb\n\nDisclaimer: This is not political. I do not care about who you voted for. Be aware this is an unbelievable cheap OTC stock with crazy potential for volatility in both directions.",

        "selftext": "I get it, the idea of $ASTS seems too good to be true. When you hear people saying it could be a 10x, or a 100x, yet the shares don\u2019t budge, it\u2019s easy to just file it as \u201cmust be a pump.\u201d Do employees think it\u2019s a pump? Where you see top technical talent betting with their careers, it\u2019s useful to see what type of people are joining a pre-revenue company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3olke9lzus71.png?width=842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d54df62bfdd5ffdec00a3c24fa4d078cc533977\n\nA key aspect when analyzing a pre-revenue venture capital bet like $ASTS is to focus on the Company\u2019s success at building its team and attracting \u201cA\u201d talent. $ASTS is effectively a Series C stage company and if it\u2019s legit, we should see a steady flow of talent joining the company. Think about it from the perspective of a talented engineer \u2013 would you go join a company that was going to flop? If you were a radio frequency PhD or a satellite payload specialists, you\u2019d have an informed view on whether this project would work and whether you\u2019d want to join the company. The best positioned companies with the best prospects should attract talent like a tractor beam. These people aren\u2019t reading Reddit, they are learning about an opportunity from industry and deep technical perspectives\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dcncyzkmzus71.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83c5c6f2f4433919f312baa5116c144e9f60b8d2\n\nLet\u2019s start with some of the more recent hires, who necessarily get less equity and therefore require more certainty of outcome to join. Let\u2019s meet Pat, who joined 5 months ago. Pat is a veteran, starting in the U.S. Airforce before spending 20+ years at Boeing and Raytheon and until recently, was at Blue Origin. Pat kept the F-18 fighter jet in the sky.  I bet he can keep something in orbit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ai1wlrnzus71.png?width=780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0985f8cbd484bfa6425c6cf6de570543f8b29747\n\nBut first\u2026this one\u2019s for all the single ladies\u2026let\u2019s meet Carl! Imagine your delight when you meet this Masters from John Hopkins in Space Systems Engineering and who casually says his day job is, \u201cMission Operations\u201d at a space company. So hot. Another poach from Blue Origin, as you\u2019ll soon see is a trend\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/szdb8rsozus71.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06796e728ed352da89ddce81fbed950c89e634fb\n\nBut since $ASTS is a massively spy satellite in the air, we know it wouldn\u2019t be complete unless it was attracting some hardcore Israelis into the org. Shalom, let\u2019s meet Ron. Ron joined 4 months ago from NextSilicon (which raised $200MM in VC money). Trading one VC rocket ship for another? Interesting question since Ron was making a calculation on personal upside and would have been in an equity position in his old job. Ron will be working on $ASTS\u2019s semiconductors for mass production of the Blue Birds. We unfortunately cannot show Ron\u2019s face. Mossad rules!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7vsvyaypzus71.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52b37cd514bb34c59c16ad137c259a9616fb37e3\n\nLet\u2019s get back to an issue near and dear to my heart: low taxes. Let\u2019s meet Jose, who lives in America\u2019s own tax haven\u2026MIAMI!!! No surprise that Jose is an accountant. This is an interesting hire \u2013 as a former PwC partner, Jose has already made a lot of money. He\u2019d also have a good network to prevent joining some loser company, e.g. Theranos. He\u2019s probably known CEO Abel for a long time and got the inside look on joining $ASTS. This hire also shows that $ASTS is building scale in its organization, not some placeholder finance team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kl0e2wzqzus71.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2de794eadaf1c5cdb9b09319bd54ed99eca6fe63\n\nSo $ASTS is already set to count the money, but how will they get their birds reliably in the air? DE-FENSE. DE-FENSE. Actually, defense. And not the opposite of offence, but actually just hiring a ton of people from the military complex where failure means death, or submission to a new Chinese overlord. In what amounts to a great online dating profile tag, John says about his time at defense contract, L3, \u201cI\u2019m here to ensure that our products function 100% of the time because our war righters rely on this equipment.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mr24h9xszus71.png?width=762&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92809091fcc2c64cbd2d61cfd05ec5154d56b0f9\n\nBut how will $ASTS actually build satellites? Who knows, TLDR. Kidding\u2026Ken knows the answer. Ken has excelled throughout his career with the top operational jobs at large defense companies.

Were you one of those people tied to the webcam watching oil bellow out? If you were, you\u2019d know that subsea oil operations make space look easy. Meet Andrea. Trained at Shell, she went on to make sure Jeff Bezos had a nice trip to \u201cspace.\u201d\\* Another Blue Origin alumnus bailing for the promising pastures of $ASTS\n\n\\*not really space\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gz69y3uvzus71.png?width=696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50e024674f8321068a5487002395b772e9dfba61\n\nNever hurts to have some NASA alumnus, right? Let\u2019s meet Lee! After 20 years at Honeywell as Director of Space Computers, Lee went to Orbital and then NASA. In his bio, he notes, \u201cSpacemobile is up and available.\u201d Is it now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9qac81xzus71.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d99b3db487aefa38385c3b42f5caab81f666377b\n\nIt\u2019s becoming evident that Jeff Bezos needs to include free shipping for his Blue Origin employees because they are leaving to join $ASTS. Meet Lenny. Lenny hails from Blue Origin and its holiness SpaceX and is now part of the Spacemob. For those who don\u2019t know, the Spacemob wears these boots. That\u2019s how we know when we are among friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgjfoi7yzus71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65a07d5bf95d1b69caefb7a02f37a62f5ad6fc9e\n\nNow there\u2019s been a lot of FUD about whether ASTS\u2019s satellites will unfold. As such, it makes sense that ASTS would hire a few mechanical engineers. Let\u2019s Meet Justin, who had been the Director of Engineering at Northrup Grumman after a long career at Orbital. He\u2019s now $ASTS\u2019s Chief Mechanical Engineer. Let $ASTS spread its wings!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4b2iakfzzus71.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1399b6d93fcc27c58a8fa160b2662ab43c8d51bf\n\nOn this topic, when people ask how $ASTS will unfold its satellite, or question whether it\u2019s too big, well\u2026.Hui-Wen is laughing at you. This CTO launched 2.5 ton birds into the sky while you were still buying video games at $GME.

Meet Mark, the VP of Engineering Programs at $ASTS. Mark is impressive. I\u2019ll bet on him. Seem like a guy whose next best job opportunity is at a Wendy\u2019s? I think not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r69d4dl20vs71.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96ec5761dc9f75e9b04e5ca05416f6dfa185b3ca\n\nSome people have a specialty they develop over the course of a career and leverage it for maximum impact. Let\u2019s meet Peter. Peter has a PhD in Satellite MIMO Radio Propagation. Can you imagine if Peter saw my original YOLO post on WSB and tried to make sense of the world? Separately, Peter\u2019s wife was psyched when he got a new job so he\u2019d move all this sh\\~t out of their living room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z7tbe6s40vs71.png?width=582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51965698108bca1a3bf313787eaebcbb5507153d\n\nSo we have a lot of smart engineers. Maybe they just like to build stuff but have no idea how to make money. Glad you asked. Let\u2019s meet Scott. This senior Barclays banker is rumored to have resigned and joined $ASTS by calling his superiors via the Bluewalker experimental satellite phone, \u201cNew phone, dis Scott from Space\u2026I\u2019m out.\u201d Legend. Scott had been $ASTS\u2019s banker so would have seen all the DD. When a banker quits his job to join his client, you should probably take note. He\u2019s got better information than you do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flc5isw50vs71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6f18844e8c46c909c7abafd5159cc31c65a3595\n\nNow it\u2019s time to get serious. Dr. Zhi Zhong, who goes by John, is not a newbie to space. He\u2019s not \u201cfiguring it out\u201d on the job. Remember when ET wanted to phone home? The Dr. was still getting his PhD, but he has since figured out how to make it happen. Glad the doctor is on call! Check out his own words on $ASTS in the blurb below. John brings a nuke to a knife fight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i625uw870vs71.png?width=667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4771b7c1cc7a22087485701c0abef54e529f8821\n\nAnd finally, we end with the big enchilada. When aliens ask to be taken to our leader, they will be taken to Dr. Ray. Ray is an MIT PhD and former professor who is now the Chief Scientist at $ASTS. I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say that we have some elite talent here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u5rr4f590vs71.png?width=689&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cbf9737cccba6642504ca2034eebe1c2aae7c48\n\nAnd there is your overview on what type of talent $ASTS has been able to attract. It helped me understand whether others who have true technical competence saw the same opportunity that I saw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65i59x6a0vs71.png?width=674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f0dde056c6e1a64a4c0edd878b5e36b60aeebbf\n\nWhat\u2019s my angle here? I own a lot of stock, have held it for \\~10 months, and look forward to the story unfolding. Retail investors come and go, but for those who are looking to better understand a potentially great long-term story, I hope the above helps de-mystify a stock that\u2019s pitched with \u201chuge upside\u201d yet can sometimes be lumped in with a lot of other stocks.\n\nI'm not a financial advisor but just wanted to share some of my own work as I research this stock.\n\nProof of position below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tic7kd9b0vs71.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dd574b6e8289b114fced9cab33059c84d12a67a",

        "selftext": " \n\n**Introduction**: There has been a lot of discussion as to the increase in money supply and inflation. Most seem to think that an increase in M2 inevitably leads to inflation in prices of goods and services. This couldn't be further from the truth. There was previously a strong correlation between the two up until 1990. From then on, the correlation has reversed and is negative. There is now a much stronger relationship between increases in the money supply and decreases in the velocity of money, meaning that money is not moving through the economy as it once did. This means that increases in the money supply are not getting spent. And as we all know, money must be spent to cause inflation. This is why economists are not overly concerned about the recent rapid rise in the money supply causing inflation.\n\nSo here are the four easy charts:\n\n1. This [first chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQY4owBA5SP28Ng2glt_fG0jnDXTgwvsp-Q90VTA5_TTqrSZQRjkUTZeE1Zt5BOSxCnkHz-TX6HWu2z/pubchart?oid=809733064&amp;format=image) shows the correlation between the adjusted money supply and inflation. The M2 money supply is adjusted by subtracting real GDP. This amounts to the excess money beyond what is needed to grow real GDP. This has the strongest correlation with inflation. Inflation is measured by the implicit GDP price deflator, which measures the actual items that were spent in the year vs. a previous year's base price. You can use PCE or CPI, but the relationship is very similar. (Also I'm using an 8 year moving average because this gives the strongest correlation between the two variables. The correlation is very weak in concurrent periods, and gets a little stronger using 2 and 4 year moving averages.) You can see from this chart that the correlation was very strong from 1968, the first year of the 8 year moving average, through the end of 1990. R = 0.95 and R\\^2 = 0.90. This indicates that 90% of changes in inflation can be explained by the changes in the adjusted money supply. This strong relationship has lead the general public to believe that the two variables are inherently related: That is, that the expansion of the adjusted money supply inevitably leads to inflation.\n2. The [second chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQY4owBA5SP28Ng2glt_fG0jnDXTgwvsp-Q90VTA5_TTqrSZQRjkUTZeE1Zt5BOSxCnkHz-TX6HWu2z/pubchart?oid=2061624488&amp;format=image) shows the correlation from 1991-2021. You can clearly see that the relationship reversed. R= -0.50 R\\^2 = 0.25. This indicates that the rate of inflation decreases as the adjusted money supply increases. It shows a moderate to weak relationship in which the increase in the adjusted money supply explains about 25% of the decrease in the rate of inflation. This can probably be explained by the fact that the money supply has seen its largest increases in periods when the economy was in recession and prices were falling. Needless to say, you can see that the former relationship between these two variables does NOT exist anymore and hasn't for 30 years!\n3. This [third chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlyD-2fO9g1W3h6VFXV_r-CJo5MdLourVfNF5HMo_uG-8s1Rpu2293GA-_3LkBGbF_WM0CkWI61zXx/pubchart?oid=997615969&amp;format=image) shows the relationship between changes in adjusted money supply and changes in the velocity of money from 1960-1990. The velocity of money is the frequency of monetary transactions in the economy. You can clearly see that the relationship is negative, as the adjusted money supply increases, the number of transactions decreases. R = -0.63 R\\^2 = 0.40. This indicates that 40% of the decrease in the velocity of money can be explained by the increase in the adjusted money supply. This is a moderately strong relationship.\n4. This [last chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlyD-2fO9g1W3h6VFXV_r-CJo5MdLourVfNF5HMo_uG-8s1Rpu2293GA-_3LkBGbF_WM0CkWI61zXx/pubchart?oid=946401508&amp;format=image) shows the correlation of adjusted money supply and the velocity of money from 1991-2021. R= -0.98 R\\^2 = 0.97. This indicates the strengthening of the relationship between increases in adjusted money supply and decreases in the velocity of money. You can clearly see that the more money that is pushed into the economy the less frequent that money gets spent.\n\n**So where is all this money going if it is not going into goods and services?** Economist largely believe that increases in the money supply probably inflate assets, including real estate, stocks, bonds and all other capital and financial assets. PE ratios have been on the rise for 30 years now. The average TTM PE ratio from 1928-1990 was 13.8 times. Since then it is 21x. The 10-year treasury yield from 1928-1990 averaged 5.17%. Since then 4.19%, and 3% in the last 20 years. The are further examples, but I think you can see that the decoupling of the money supply and inflation has probably benefited asset prices.\n\n**TLDR**: Increasing the money supply does NOT lead to inflation in products and services like it once did. It now results in a lower velocity of money, more savings and higher asset prices.",

        "selftext": "Weed stocks like Tilray, Canopy Growth and many more have had a crazy year but clearly have been forgotten since the crazy upswings around february 2021. Since then, many reasons have brought then to the point where they are now: Undervalued. Hear me out. The cannabis industry is an emerging market with all the inherent risks and possibilities that go with it. Cannabis will inevitably be as big as the tabacco industry and the alcohol industry if not bigger longterm. The demand is there, legislature is slowly but surely changing towards legalization of cannabis for private consumption. The medicinal benefits are already being utilised by many different countries and hemp is a plant with many different uses in textiles and more. Imo nearly every cannabis stock is being undervalued right now due to the financially unstable times of corona pandemic and the inherent tendency many players go by to not invest in risk heavy, emerging industries in times of turmoil. If you apes haven't already figured it out because your to busy washing the dishes for your wife's boyfriend while he's busy smoking a joint. You could have at least profited of that joint he's slowly putting out on your forhead when he's done. The cannabis market has huge potential and it will soar as high as your wife's boyfriend is undoubtedly. Fundies will strike at some point as the entry point is still low and opportunities are on the horizon. Don't let them take it all.",

        "selftext": " So far, I have only covered the possibility of short squeeze of $SDC (see link below in previous post)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pymseb/sdc\\_cost\\_to\\_borrow\\_just\\_picked\\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pymseb/sdc_cost_to_borrow_just_picked_up/)\n\nBut there is something more important than that.\n\nThere are many stocks that show the possibility of a short squeeze,\n\nbut among them, there are reasons why we should focus on $SDC and invest a lot.\n\nAs discussed in the previous post, the data on the short squeeze was the most perfect with $PROG, but the most important reason is the value and potential of the company.\n\nMany institutions hold stocks at an average unit price of $10 or more.\n\nI would like to write an opinion and analysis on why SDC became the target of short selling and why the judgment of short selling is wrong.\n\n==================================\n\n**contents**\n\n1. The Future Value of SmileDirectClub\n2. Issues with SmileDirectClub\n3. Danger\n4. Conclusion and Consideration\n\n==================================\n\n**1. The Future Value of SmileDirectClub**\n\n..**1). Trends for orthodontics (increasing demand)**\n\nBased on the growth of orthodontic-related companies, the demand for orthodontics is growing explosively around the world, and $SDC also has explosive growth potential in this trend.\u200b\n\nLet's take a look at some of the very important companies involved.\n\n....**(1). ALGN (Align Technology)**\n\n$ALGN is in the business of developing, manufacturing and selling orthodontic 3D printers.\n\nIt is amazing to see the growth of this company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cgme1ae094t71.png?width=1234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38e1a65da40402d87932df5be28bead49c928bb6\n\nThe stock price has risen 58527 % from its lowest point ($1.26) to the maximum ($737.45), and is currently at $643.56, up 51076 %.\n\nNumber of shares: 79.01 M\n\nMarket cap: 50803 M $\n\n....**(2). XRAY (Dentsplay Sinora)**\n\n$XRAY is also in the business of developing and selling dental equipment in addition to orthodontic 3D printers.\n\nThe growth rate of this company is also surprising.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xob4n5194t71.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d30b10c2d58957d678859f436b83ce5b798d70c\n\nIt reached the high of $69.54, which is 13120 % higher than the low of $0.53, and is now 10949% higher at $58.03.\n\nNumber of shares: 218.55 M\n\nMarket cap: 12682.46 M $\n\nIn addition to this, the main tickers are\n\n\\* Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC)\n\n\\* 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD)\n\netc., but I'll skip these.\n\nEven dental care/treatment around the world is expensive, so unless you are upper-middle class or higher, you have not been able to straighten your teeth well. In particular, there **were** many negative views on corrections for beauty.\n\nHowever, the explosive growth of orthodontic equipment companies,\n\nSeeing that orthodontic for beauty are now increasingly popular with the young generation in many countries,\n\nDemand for orthodontics has exploded in recent years and is expected to increase in the future.\n\n..**2). the importance of price**\n\nOrthodontic at SDC is generally much cheaper than actual visits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sy97rxb294t71.png?width=631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ee9eecc22555d2309e75ca6a39122f3252f29a4\n\nIn addition, due to the pandemic, masks have become commonplace and the frequency of going out has greatly decreased.\n\nAt this time when people are not showing their teeth, more and more people want to have orthodontic treatment, and SDC has a very strong advantage in this regard.\n\nFor this expensive orthodontic treatment to **become common**, it must not be too burdensome for the middle class to afford.\n\nAnd SDC is one of the most affordable solutions,\n\n**I think SmileDirectClub will lead the way among companies that make orthodontics universal for beauty in the future.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxia739394t71.png?width=1301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=199d252b1f65280620b3bf2f37e6eb325ceb4776\n\nGet a smile with just 3$ per day!\n\n..**3). Sales and operating profit**\n\nLet's look at the change in sales of $SDC.\n\nAnnual Sales Trend\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0f7mte3494t71.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ba5e57a124b05cc5714e50f822fe8bef84d6e15\n\nMonthly Sales Trend\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l1q6orp494t71.png?width=1245&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f956a9c60c70052624836f7a434ea3d1bf391d6\n\nSDC's quarterly sales are doing pretty well. I think this has a big impact on showing good results in marketing as well.\n\nSince this orthodontic treatment is highly likely to become a trend from the young generation, reviews and promotions through SNS will spread very quickly during the transition period when orthodontic treatment becomes common. In fact, SDC can easily find promotional materials on SNS, Youtube, and TV.\n\nPoor operating profit is one of the biggest causes of recent short selling attacks, and in fact, ignorant 'self-proclaimed analysts' cite operating profit as the reason for 'the reason you should not buy SDC'.\n\nBut the reason why the operating profit is currently poor is largely due to the cost of plant expansion, new patent development, and business expansion into new countries.\n\n\\--------------------ref----------------------------\n\nItem 2.

Management believes the terms of the leases are consistent with market standards and were arrived at through arm\u2019s-length negotiation.\n\n( Reference : File number 21907839 , 10-Q, page : 52 )\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the 10-Q filing, the number of manufacturing plants and retail shops are increasing.\n\nIt is an accurate approach to the business core elements of the current SDC.\n\n\\---------------------ref------------------------------\n\nKey Business Metrics\n\nWe review the following key business metrics to evaluate our business performance:\n\nUnique aligner order shipments\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we shipped 374,982 and 453,053 unique aligner orders, respectively. Each unique aligner order shipment represents a single contracted member. We believe that our ability to increase the number of aligner orders shipped is an indicator of our market penetration, growth of our business, consumer interest, and our member conversion.\n\nAverage aligner gross sales price\n\nWe define average gross sales price (\u201cASP\u201d) as gross revenue, before implicit price concession and other variable considerations and exclusive of sales tax, from aligner orders shipped divided by the number of unique aligner orders shipped. We believe ASP is an indicator of the value we provide to our members and our ability to maintain our pricing. Our ASP for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1,797 and $1,771, respectively. Our ASP is less than our standard $1,950 price as a result of discounts offered to select members.\n\n( Reference : File number 21907839 , 10-Q, page : 57 )\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe core business element of SDC presented in 10-Q is to secure a large number of orders, and recently sales are good and capacity is increasing, so operating profit is negative.\n\n..**4). Alabama State Dental Association is so territorial but Fair Trade Commission recognized SDC business.**\n\nSDC was planning to expand into Alabama, but the Alabama Dental Association requested SDC to stop remote/visual orthodontic diagnosis and treatment, and SDC abandoned its expansion plan to Alabama.\n\nHowever, the Fair Trade Commission said that this was an unreasonable request and violated the antitrust law and that SmileDirectClub's business was justified as a result of a 5-0 vote.\n\n[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/alabama-board-dental-examiners-agrees-settle-ftc-charges-it](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/alabama-board-dental-examiners-agrees-settle-ftc-charges-it)\n\nAlabama Board of Dental Examiners Agrees to Settle FTC Charges that It Unreasonably Excluded Lower Cost Online and Teledentistry Providers from Competition\n\nTo settle FTC charges that its actions violated the antitrust laws, the Board of Dental Examiners of Alabama has agreed to stop requiring on-site supervision by licensed dentists of alignment scans of prospective patients\u2019 mouths seeking to address misaligned teeth or gaps between teeth.\n\nSDC is fighting these existing dental associations' territory and regulations,\n\nI sent an inquiry email to SDC regarding these.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q01nub1694t71.png?width=1581&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f132df1bdbf9f2a8d94bee213aa8cf7faa81178a\n\nIn this regard, SDC received a reply that it would deal with it in more detail when it released 3Q earnings.\n\n..**5). $SDC is the only Tele-Dentistry company listed on Nasdaq**\n\nThe link below is a list of US Tele-Dentistry companies, and SmileDirectClub is the only listed company.\n\n[https://www.beckersdental.com/teledentistry/36105-10-teledentistry-companies-to-know.html](https://www.beckersdental.com/teledentistry/36105-10-teledentistry-companies-to-know.html)\n\nThis means that there is no competition for $SDC in the Nasdaq market, there is sufficient liquidity to invest in marketing,\n\nIt is the best company that can monopolize a percentage of the Tele-Dentistry market.\n\n**2. Issues with SmileDirectClub**\n\n..**1). Legal issues with NBC ( CNBC ).**\n\nLast year, SDC filed a $2.85 billion lawsuit alleging that NBC deliberately distorted SDC.\n\n[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/smiledirectclub-sues-nbc-285-billion-1295347/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/smiledirectclub-sues-nbc-285-billion-1295347/)\n\nThe lawsuit is still ongoing. If SDC win, it is possible to secure a huge amount of funds with strong recognition.\n\n..**2). Short-Squeuze play on Reddit**\n\nBased on the content of my previous post about the possibility of short squeeze and the general information above, reports that I was trying to play a short squeeze on Reddit.\n\n[https://twitter.com/KristinaParts/status/1437884294249201669?s=19](https://twitter.com/KristinaParts/status/1437884294249201669?s=19)\n\nGME, AMC, and then SDC, MEMEs started to become popular.\n\n..**3). Analyst raises target price**\n\nBelow is Analyst's upward revision of the $SDC target price (starting price of $5.25 -&gt; target price of $11)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pz36eg/credit\\_suisse\\_analyst\\_matt\\_miksic\\_gives/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pz36eg/credit_suisse_analyst_matt_miksic_gives/)\n\n**3. Danger**\n\nThe short-term risks of SDC are hard to find out now. So let's take a look at three long-term risks.\n\n..**1). Risks from audits after exiting emerging growth companies**\n\nSDC, as an emerging growth company, receives exceptions from audits, and if sales exceed 1.08 B, it will be eliminated from the emerging growth company, and there is a high risk of being attacked by short selling according to financial reporting.\n\nIn fact, according to the investment prospectus of SDC, it is possible to speculate that the current sales are intentionally lowered to some extent because the company intends to take full advantage of the advantages of 'emerging growth companies'. It is a story of the distant future. No need to worry right now.\n\n..**2). Possibility of dilution of Class A common stock by pre-IPO investors**\n\nThe number of issued shares is 118.87 M , the current share price is 6.5 dollars, and the current market capitalization is 773 M $ ( 972 billion won).\n\nThe total number of diluted shares including pre-IPO investor volume (common share B) is 387,61 M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0v6zqi8894t71.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12cad7c7cf680cef8d008bb15a5db1ed0d64f51\n\nReference : 10-Q, page 1\n\nThe lock-up release date for common stock B was released on August 16, 19, 180 days after the submission of S-1.\n\nSo far, a total of 1.2M common stock B has been diluted with common stock A.\n\nClass A change: 104,825,858 -&gt; 118,869,656\n\nClass B change: 281,863,766 -&gt; 269,243,501\n\n**Even after the lockup was lifted, the conversion of common stock B to common stock A was only diluted by 4.5%, a small amount for a year and a half. Moreover, considering the diluted unit price (over $10), the current share price is $6.5, so the possibility of a share price decline due to the dilution of common stock B is very low.**\n\n..**3). Redemption of convertible bonds**\n\nThe convertible bonds issued on February 9, 21st had a conversion rate of 55.3710 shares per 1000$ conversion rate, and were converted to the common share A price of $18.06 per share.\n\nAccording to the contents of convertible bonds, the bill is due on February 1, 26, and from August 1, 25, the issuer of the note can request redemption.\n\nIn addition, according to the will of the company, from February 6, 24, if the stock price at that time is higher than the stock price when the bill was issued, early redemption is possible.\n\nTherefore, the possibility that SDC's common stock A will be diluted due to convertible bonds is a very distant future, and it is not something to be concerned about much at present.\n\n\\------------------------ref---------------------------------\n\nItem 1.01.\n\nEntry into a Material Definitive Agreement.\n\nIndenture and Notes\n\nOn February 9, 2021, SmileDirectClub, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) entered into an indenture (the \u201cIndenture\u201d), between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d), pursuant to which the Company issued $650,000,000 principal amount of the Company's 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The Company has also granted the initial purchasers of the Notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the Notes were first issued, up to an additional $97,500,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes (\u201cOption Notes\u201d). On February 9, 2021, the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase $70,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Option Notes.\n\nThe Notes will be the Company\u2019s senior, unsecured obligations and will be (i) equal in right of payment with the Company\u2019s existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company\u2019s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to the Company\u2019s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including our credit facility and trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\n\nThe Notes will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes will not accrete. The Notes will mature on February 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before August 1, 2025, noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after August 1, 2025, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its Class A common stock, at the Company\u2019s election. The initial conversion rate is 55.3710 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $18.06 per share of Class A common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a \u201cMake-Whole Fundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.\n\nThe Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time, and from time to time, on or after February 6, 2024 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company's Class A common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice. In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.\n\nIf certain corporate events that constitute a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then, then noteholders may require the Company to repurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company\u2019s Class A common stock.\n\n(Reference:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001775625/000110465921016943/tm214449d4\\_8k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001775625/000110465921016943/tm214449d4_8k.htm))\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**4. Conclusions and considerations**\n\n**$SDC This is on the movement, not a moment.**\n\nThe demand for orthodontics is explosively popular all over the world, and SDC is a company that has great advantages. It is also the largest company in the Tele-Dentistry industry and is the only listed company on Nasdaq.\n\nIn view of the move to continuously increase marketing and production capacity,\n\nSDC is a company with great potential to continue increasing its market share by leading the future Online &amp; Tele-Dentistry, and believes that its share price will rise by at least several hundred% in the next few years.\n\nWhen 3Q earnings are announced in November, no one knows whether the short selling will be more aggressive or if the results will exceed expectations and result in an earnings surprise.\n\nThere is one more thing to remember. Long position institutions have already formed strong support at $5, and there has never been any class B dilution near this price range. Therefore, we believe that the current share price is more safe than risky.\n\nIn the short term, there is a high possibility that the stock price will rise quickly due to the pressure on short selling.\n\nIf a squeeze occurs in order to maximize profits (to hold as many shares of $SDC as possible in the long term), as explained in Chapter 3. Risk, there is a factor that will decrease in the long run, so some of them will be forced to sell. , I think it would be good to collect stocks steadily over the long term.\n\nps.

        "selftext": "**Observations:**\n\n* **Stay Away From Chinese Stocks:** I\u2019m assessing some serious future market turmoil coming out of Southeast Asia. For this reason I\u2019m staying clear of as many Chinese, &amp; heavily Chinese affiliated, stocks as reasonably possible in the US market.  I argue that China\u2019s historic and repeated violation of Taiwanese airspace is likely to take the worlds attention away from the underlying economic conditions on the mainland, which if true, certainly indicates things are worse than China is making them out to be. In short, China wants to project power, and they cant do this when the news is filled with energy issues and failing sectors of the Chinese economy.  \n* **Why the Uncertainty:** In addition to China being [downgraded](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/28/goldman-sachs-cuts-chinas-gdp-growth-forecasts-amid-energy-crunch.html) by the ratings firms, China [regulating the hell](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/china-issues-draft-rules-banning-unfair-competition-internet-sector-2021-08-17/) out of their publicly traded corporations, [Chinese construction](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-evergrande-debt/china-property-sector-woes-deepen-as-markets-await-evergrande-deal-idUSL4N2R10QL) going [down the tubes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/evergrande-china-real-estate-debt-debacle-empty-buildings-cities-beijing-11633374710) (*Its* [*spreading beyond Evergrande folks*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/china-property-default-risk-for-fantasia-sinic-amid-evergrande-crisis.html)), &amp; China\u2019s [energy crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/30/chinas-factory-activity-in-shock-slowdown-as-energy-crisis-hits-home), China has also been [violating Taiwan\u2019s airspace](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58794094) at a record rate.\n* **Indicators of Mainland Desperation:** The Chinese are likely messing with Taiwan for four reasons I can think of.\n   * 1) To distract the world from their economic crises at home\n   * 2) To test the international reaction both militarily &amp; diplomatically for strategic purposes\n   * 3) To aid in training (war gaming) an eventual takeover of Taiwan (No secret folks, if they could snap their fingers and own Taiwan they would)\n   * 4) To generate some leverage for future US talks and negotiations\n* **The Distraction Game:** The Chinese modus operandi when they have serious turmoil at home is to play the distraction game. The grander the distraction the larger their issues at home. [Taiwan presents a plausible distraction](https://www.businessinsider.com/taiwan-touts-defense-as-china-pressures-island-with-frequent-flights-2021-10), and its a big one!\n* **In Chinese Media:** Reviewing the various Chinese government media outlets (all media out of China is government media), I see a lot of stories about Taiwan, trade with the US, and friction with the US, but very little about their energy crisis and the seemingly [company by company domino like collapse of their construction sector](https://www.reuters.com/business/china-evergrandes-snowballing-debt-crisis-2021-09-14/).\n* **Why Empty Cities:** Remember that China did not build [empty cities no one wanted to live in](https://allthatsinteresting.com/chinese-ghost-cities) because of market demand, but rather to artificially prop up their economy. Else they wouldn\u2019t be empty. Economically speaking China did the equivalent of paying people to dig ditches, and then fill them back in again. Only they added the extra step of promising the digging company that people would pay them to rent the ditch.\n* **What May Happen:** If Chinese construction fails, then the banks are next. And if the banks fail, so too does the Chinese economy. However the Chinese economy is a command economy and enjoys the benefit of not really caring about the welfare of her people (The state supersedes the peoples welfare in China) so they will have more options available to them than we would in the US. Indeed printing and devaluating their currency is among them. But that will still have a horrible outcome for the Chinese people and international trade relations.\n* **I'm Out of Chinese Stocks:** So I\u2019m staying away from Chinese &amp; Chinese affiliated/dependent stocks which means no $DIS no $NKE no $AAPL no $TSLA no $WMT. Certainly no $NIO\n\n**TL;DR:** You better bet your ass financial institutions and hedge funds are paying close attention to the economic state of China, and we had better too lest they pull the rug out from underneath us leaving retail traders, like us, with the bag.\n\nI am not long nor short any Chinese stock, nor short heavily Chinese affiliated US companies. In fact I am not short any stock right now.\n\nMore Reading:\n\n* [Chinese developer](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/china-property-default-risk-for-fantasia-sinic-amid-evergrande-crisis.html) misses bond payment as stress spreads beyond Evergrande crisis (*Domino Effect*)\n* [Empty Buildings](https://www.wsj.com/articles/evergrande-china-real-estate-debt-debacle-empty-buildings-cities-beijing-11633374710) in China\u2019s Provincial Cities Testify to Evergrande Debacle\n* [Economic headwinds](https://www.designbuild-network.com/comment/economic-china-construction-output/) expected to weigh on China\u2019s construction output this year\n* [The End of a \u2018Gilded Age](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/business/china-businesses.html)\u2019: China Is Bringing Business to Heel\n* [Biden says](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/biden-says-he-chinas-xi-have-agreed-abide-by-taiwan-agreement-2021-10-05/) he and China's Xi agree to abide by Taiwan agreement\n* [Empty buildings](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/empty-buildings-in-chinas-provincial-cities-testify-to-evergrande-debacle) in China\u2019s provincial cities testify to Evergrande debacle\n* [Mounting tensions](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/05/tensions-us-china-taiwan-515142) between U.S., China raise new fears of threat to Taiwan",

        "selftext": "There is a global energy crisis unfolding today. Energy prices worldwide have been soaring and its not even winter in the Northern Hemisphere yet.  Globally, we have been chasing renewable pipe dreams as if they will save the day. As Charif Souki said, \u201cwe are now seeing reality clash with our aspirations\u201d.  To compound the problem, Europe has been decommissioning Nuclear plants, the wind hasn\u2019t been blowing, global gas storage is low, and we may have a cold winter. \n\nEnergy Demand is increasing worldwide.  Currently, 80% of the world\u2019s energy is consumed by 15% of the world\u2019s population. The majority of the world lacks basic energy infrastructure, but that is changing. China, India and Africa will increase their energy demand exponentially in the coming years/decades. \n\nNatural Gas is positioned to be the biggest winner as the most affordable and cleanest of practical solutions. Expensive renewables represent a small fraction of energy generation. Doubling/tripling renewables would probably not even cover the new demand from developing countries (even if they could afford them). \n\nAs we try to decarbonize and reduce pollution, we will switch coal plants to nat gas since nat gas is significantly cleaner. Worldwide, we produce 43 billion tons of Co2 annually. Switching all coal to natural gas would reduce that by 6 billion tons. Im not saying that all will switch, but I am saying that Nat gas will cannibalize coal AND that energy demand is growing. Its a great recipe for Natural Gas. \n\nOne final point on electricity\u2026 For some strange reason, many people view \u201celectric\u201d as an energy source. Electric is NOT a primary energy source. Something has to generate the power for electric. In most cases, that power generation is from coal and nat gas. The increase in electrification worldwide (particularly with EV adoption) will drive nat gas demand even further. \n\nCareful getting sucked into the renewable dream. Practicality will win the day through the real market. Natural gas will be a growing and profitable investment for the decades to come.",

        "selftext": "John Deere workers are inching precipitously close to a strike after they overwhelmingly voted to reject a new six-year collective bargaining agreement that had been recommended by the union representing them, the United Auto Workers (UAW).\n\nOn Sunday, 90 percent of UAW voting members shot down the new agreement, which had been reached between the union and the tractor manufacturing company and had offered modest wage increases and enhanced retirement benefits that would have come at the expense of new hires. According to the Des Moines Register, pro-strike sentiment has been strong on the ground in Iowa, where union members have erected signs reading \u201cREJECT THIS PIECE OF TRASH\u201d and \u201cYOU DESERVE BETTER.\u201d According to a dispatch from Labor Notes, several union members also showed up to local meetings sporting \u201cF*** No\u201d t-shirts, and at least one member took up the microphone to say that the only thing the agreement was good for was \u201cwiping my ass.\u201d\n\nNow, unless an agreement is reached by the new strike deadline imposed by the UAW of 11:59pm on Wednesday, October 13, more than 10,000 Deere workers at nine locals in Iowa, Illinois, and Kansas are set to walk off the job in what would amount to the largest private-sector strike since the 40-day walkout staged by UAW workers employed by GM in 2019.\n\nOfficials at John Deere have, thus far, signaled a willingness to keep negotiations going, telling the Register in a statement that the company \u201cremains fully committed to continuing the collective bargaining process in an effort to better understand our employees\u2019 viewpoints,\u201d and saying that operations \u201cwill continue as normal\u201d in the meantime. But according to internal company emails reviewed by Labor Notes, the company also seems to be increasingly looking to hire white-collar workers in an active effort to \u201ccast a broader net to fill critical factory positions in the case of a work stoppage.\u201d\n\nIn addition to setting itself up for one of the biggest labor showdowns in recent memory during a year that has already been rife with worker unrest, labor shortages, and strike efforts, John Deere has also recently emerged as a critical battleground for national right-to-repair laws. Because of its refusal to allow farmworkers to repair their own equipment, the company is frequently seen as being at the heart of the struggle against manufacturing repair monopolies and was referenced as such by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders during his doomed campaign for the presidency in 2019.\n\n\u201cIn rural America today, farmers can\u2019t even repair their own tractors or other equipment because of the greed of companies like John Deere,\u201d Sanders wrote at the time, vowing that if he became president, he would \u201cpass a national right-to-repair law that gives every farmer in America full rights over the machinery they buy.\u201d\n\nUnder the administration of President Joe Biden, right-to-repair has seen several modest victories recently, including a sweeping executive order that directed the Federal Trade Commission to draft regulations that limit the ability of companies like Deere to restrict independent repairs of their products.\n\nhttps://gi zmodo.com/john-deere-workers-sure-look-like-they-re-about-to-go-o-1847847258",

        "selftext": " \n\nI've been making a good amount on this bullish October push with SPY calls, and was thinking of rolling a good 3k into some options judging by Friday's last 30 min bullish push upwards of $3. All this FUD of crashing etc etc is scaring whoever the fuck out of this once in a lifetime bullish market that has been going on for the last year and a half. Is it going to \"crash\" once the FED stops buying assets and begins tapering? Yes. Is that going to happen in the next 3 weeks? Probably not. My bet is December or January. Still waiting to hear our lord and savior JPOW tell me on Wednesday that \"Inflation is transitory, fuck your puts.\" and he's keeping this crazy train running for another month or so.\n\nMy play then, is that I think the SPY will do 1 of 3 things opening into November.\n\n1. Straight bull rush the first week to 470.20. I don't think this is VERY likely, but it could happen. If anything goes well it should do a steady $2 or so a day climb with decent slow swings and quick buybacks, alongside strong EOD volume pushes.\n2. Maybe go up for 1-3 days then do a fake dip out before shooting up. More likely I think.\n3. Fib retracement 30%, probably down to 445-455ish before a huge push into the rest of November. This could also be a very likely scenario that might go with number 2. This would suck if you buy the calls on Monday and it drops 10 bucks. Good news is, I think they will hit no matter what.\n\nIt doesn't really matter what options happens as long as you look at Friday's graph(10/29/2021) and ask yourself, \"Does this look like it won't hit $470 (10 gain ) in roughly a month?I am almost certain it will.\n\nThat said, I have multiple option plays. The 3 that look the best to me are\n\n6 $500 ATM 460c Strike:11/19/2021 (Safest option, and 100%ish gain)\n\n30 $100 OTM 470c Strike:11/19/2021(Decent OTM option, even if it doesn't hit and runs up 5 bucks, you can still take a 150%ish gain)\n\nOr...\n\n300-350 $10 OTM 480c Strike:11/19/2021 (Most yolo option with a fair bit of play. This contract is right at the price where the option is going to start going up to 20, 30 bucks every 2ish bucks as the delta gets higher. These options will skyrocket if this thing gets anything over 460, which it is indeed about to do, in my opinion. The loss potential is right where it will start to go down a bit, but the good thing is the initial contract is only worth 10 bucks a piece. This means you might lose 1-5 bucks each contract if it goes down to retrace, but if this goes past 460 anytime in the next 3 weeks you're looking at roughly a 100-1000% gain. Based on my retarded math skills, I think a price increase to $470 will net each contract to be worth roughly what the 470's are right now, which is $100 per contract and a 1000% gain of 3.5k to 35k. Feel free to cash out at 465 and take 15kish if you don't wanna get greedy. I don't even think I have factored in implied Vol.)\n\nNow you may be saying to yourself this either sounds amazingly retarded, or amazingly retarded, but why? How? When?\n\nWell, that's my question to you. If I seem wrong in my calculations please let me know, if I am missing something, please let me know.\n\nBut do yourself a favor and open the Strike:11/19/2021 calls and look at the open interest for the 460-470's. Don't even need it to hit 480 if it rises quick enough.\n\nDon't need much DD when the FED is buying everything for another month or so, but I have 2 friends that work at brokerages and I asked them both about the taper. They both said they were talked to about something like that happening but \"not yet\" as in a month or 2 out still I think. Maybe beginning 2022.\n\nPretty sure we're going up as the music continues to play. Worst case scenario, I lose 3.5k. Best case scenario, I make 15-30k ++++++++++++++",

        "selftext": " Tesla has hit a new all-time high in Friday trading. The stock\u2019s recent run has been incredible. Now the question is how high can it go. Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock is at $906.50, up about 1.4%, in recent trading. The S&amp;P 500 is up about 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added about 0.3%.\n\nThat\u2019s a record for the electric-vehicle maker. Its old high-water mark was set on Jan. 25 at $900.40 a share, according to Dow Jones Market Data. On Thursday, Tesla closed at a record for the first time since Jan. 26. Shares are up about 39% over the past three months, pushing the market cap to roughly $900 billion. (Tesla has about 1 billion shares outstanding, making the math easy.) \n\nBulls, naturally, see more gains ahead. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Tesla raised his most bullish case for Tesla stock to $1,500 a share from $1,300 after Tesla reported better-than-expected earnings on Wednesday. \u201cTesla is rising because earnings revisions are soaring,\u201d points out Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund Active exchange-traded fund. Analyst estimates for Tesla\u2019s 2022 earnings have risen to about $8 a share from $6 over the past few weeks. \u201cRising estimates drove Tesla to the moon in 2020. They will drive Tesla to $1,000-plus in 2022,\u201d Black says. \n\nIves rates Tesla stock Buy, and Tesla is the largest position in Black\u2019s fund. Yes, there are still Tesla bears out there who believe the stock is overvalued. The bottom third of analyst price targets averages about $425, less than half of where the stock is trading.\n\nBears expect the sky-high valuation to give investors pause eventually. Stocks don\u2019t usually fall just because investors, collectively, wake up one morning and feel differently about valuation. Something has to happen. The overall market could tumble, or the business could trip up. Analysts expect Tesla deliveries to grow from about 890,000 units in 2021 to 1.3 million in 2022. Any hiccup to growth would be a negative catalyst for shares. \n\nWhether the stock rises or falls in the short run is anyone\u2019s guess. Whatever happens, it will be fun to watch.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/tesla-stock-hits-new-high-heres-what-could-come-next-51634913773?mod=mw\\_latestnews](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/tesla-stock-hits-new-high-heres-what-could-come-next-51634913773?mod=mw_latestnews)",

        "selftext": "This is the start of a new series meant to dive into inflation, what it looks like, what it\u2019s effects are, and it\u2019s historical comparisons. Today we will be diving into the story of Paul Volcker, the fed chairman who took inflation head on and raised interest rates 20%.\n\n# Inflation in the 80\u2019s\n\nAs energy prices, wages, and government spending rose in the 80\u2019s, inflation went to new uncharted heights. The Consumer Price Index, otherwise as the CPI (which a separate write up will be made on in the future) clocked in at 13.91% annually in January of 1980. Accelerating a trend that had begun to occur in the latter half of the 1970's.\n\n# In Comes Volcker\n\nPaul Volcker, who was Fed chairman from 1979 to 1987, was determined to put an end to inflation. Contrary to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, Paul Volcker was very concerned about inflation and its effect on the economy, he felt the prime directive of the fed at the time was to rein in inflation. Volcker raised interest rates 2% in 1980, to an average 13.35%. And another 3% in 1981, with an average of 16.39%. The year high in 1981 would be 22%. This would be followed by considerate drops over the next decade, with the decade ending at an average of 9.21%\n\n# The interest rate induced recession\n\nBy raising interest rates, and making it harder to borrow money. The economy entered a recession. By 1982, unemployment hit a peak of nearly 11%. Congress had repeatedly called on Paul Volcker to back down from his position on inflation, but he never did, quoted as saying inflation, if left unchecked, would result in \u201cmore serious economic circumstances over a much longer period of time\u201d\n\n# The fed\u2019s most brilliant move to tame inflation, quit looking at it\n\n1983 marked the year the Fed did their most brilliant policy yet at fighting inflation. They quit measuring it.\n\nIn 1983, the Fed changed the largest component of the CPI, mortgage prices, with something known as \u201cowners equivalent rent\u201d Instead of tracking mortgage prices, they instead decided to ask people who bought homes years ago what they would charge themselves to live in it. Weirdly, most people simply say whatever their mortgage is, which was also locked in years ago. The fed definitely did not anticipate this and just felt it was a handy change to make and has nothing to do with making inflation look better trust us on this one\n\n# Comparisons to modern time\n\nThe 1980\u2019s were a time when the government was much less dependent on low interest rates. Never once falling below 4% in the 70\u2019s. Despite this, interest rates would have to be raised  to highs of 20%, in combination with blatant lying by changing the CPI, to rein in inflation. Compared to now, we are much more dependent on low interest rates. In 2018, when interest rates were raised to only 2%, the SPY ended the year down 6% in what would be the worst year since the 08 financial crises.\n\n# What this tells us\n\nInflation is here to stay. The fed cannot raise interest rates to the levels necessary to rein in inflation. Simply talking about tapering, which isn\u2019t even raising interest rates, causes the market to crash. In order for the fed to successfully rein in inflation, it will cause, at minimum, a recession. And most likely a complete depression. The fed will remain \u201chawkish\u201d on \u201chypothetically\u201d fighting inflation, in order to not scare people into hoarding, but inflation has become a raging wildfire that the fed understands they are largely powerless to fight. At best they will be able to slow down the rate of increase a small amount.",

        "selftext": "Listen here, this post is for fun - I don\u2019t give a fuck if anyone becomes rich of this, I am speaking my mind and when in 2 years people question why they didn\u2019t invest in cannabis you can link them to this post. \n\nFull Disclosure: While my portfolio is diversified, I have around 5 digits of it in U.S. cannabis stocks. This post is not written to pump cannabis market, frankly I don\u2019t give a fuck if you invest or not - this post is written so that I can share the knowledge I learned in the cannabis industry. Invest at your own discretion, and don\u2019t cry if you lose or win.\n\nWe all remember 2018, a meme years when everyone and everything was in cannabis stocks, tilray was pumping just like any other Canadian cannabis stock - too bad this was all retarded and everything crashed harder than a Japanese kamikaze did in 1944. \n\nLet\u2019s fast forward to 2021 -  EV/ EBITDA multiples for cannabis stocks Are at historic lows - cannabis shares are down on average 40% since their peak. In the world of finance, 95% of companies get valued by their EV/EBITDA multiple, ( enterprise value / ebitda - if you want to read more on this investopedia is your best friend) \n\nAnyway, U.S. has THE best cannabis stocks in the world, growing at 100% Y/Y and overall having positive cash flows (ex. GTI, Trulieve) \n\nLet me tell you one thing, as of now Cannabis stocks are trading at very low multiples compared to their growth ~10-15x, if you compare it to Uber or DoorDash or snowflake which are trading with at 100+ multiple and growing way slower. **I don\u2019t believe in a lot of things, but I can bet my left but that cannabis stocks are currently undervalued based on the growth they are having **\n\nIf you don\u2019t trust me - fine. Look at any fast growing company on the NYSE or NASDAQ and compare their multiples to cannabis stock. I can guarantee cannabis stock will be trading at a lower multiple than counterparts when you account for revenue and EBITDA growth rate. \n\nNow that we covered multiple expansion, let me talk about management and growth opportunities. \nTwo things I want to cover:\nManagement teams: go on any large cannabis website be it GTI, Curaleaf, Cresco, trulieve or any other and you will find that at least 50% of management will be made up of finance legends from Goldman or any other respected bank - they know their shit when it comes to growing the business, and the fact that they or on these teams should tell you a lot. If it doesn\u2019t, look st the companies the sold and what **multiples** they sold them at. Also, many of these team member where actively managing portfolios that. Yields insane returns. \nGrowth: Cannabis is bound to be legalized, and even if it isn\u2019t, there is plenty of opportunity for state growth. Every year there are more states legalizing some form of cannabis sale, which opens up a new market for these companies to enter. Sooner or later federal legalization will come - this will lead to more growth ops and revenue expansion. I don\u2019t want to dwell to deep into this topic because M&amp;A markets are very complex and expansion leads to consolidation at attractive multiples - this is a topic for another discussion. \n\nYou are probably thinking by now, \u201cwhy the fuck are these cannabis stocks not trading at high multiples now?\u201d\nHere are me three reason which I truly believe in:\n1. Equity and debt available in the markets: cannabis stock are not legal in the U.S. federally which means they can not be officially listed on stock exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ therefore they do not have access to cheap equity and are not able to grow easily. Same with debt - historically these cannabis companies where getting their debt at ~13% with a lot of restrictive covenants and warrants\n2. Cannabis is not federally legalized yet, which leads to multiples problems but the main being investor confidence. No one wants to pay a high multiple on a business that is currently illegal and that is simple as that. \n3. U.S. cannabis stocks not listed on major exchanges. This is a bigger problem than many people realize - a large demographic that would likely invest in cannabis is millennial investors which just so happen to use Robinhood and WeBull -  these platforms do not allows Over The Counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) trading, which locks out retail investors. How many people are willing to open a fidelity or thinkorswim account just to buy some cannabis? Less than 1% if I had to estimate. \n\nMoral of the story is that when cannabis becomes legal on the federal level or at least a SAFE banking act is enacted, multiples will stay low until they explode. Federal legalization will be the ultimate driver of multiple explanation. While now democrats are busy passing debt legislation what easier route can they take to grow their approvals by a few percent than legalizing cannabis? Reminder: Bidens approvals rating dipped to 42-44% based on most recent polls. \n\nThesis: **cannabis companies now are not able to access debt or equity financing like normal companies can, driving the multiples way below industry averages especially when accounted for growth**\n\nEnd of story - as I said before, I give zero fucks if you invest in this market - but I personally think this is a truly fantastic opportunity that lets me or you buy in for cheap. As somewhat of an insider in the industry I think cannabis has way more room for growth and what anyone sees right now is a tip of the iceberg.\n\nFor the sake of entrainment I am willing to wager a $2000 dollars debt with a highest upvoted comment that predicts GTI + CURALEAF market cap being below my prediction by end of 2023. Note: it has to be lower than my projected EV which I predict to be at least 40 billion dollars .",

        "selftext": "*This following was written by James Stafford of OilPrice.com and appeared in* Investment Watch Blog *on 2/7/21:*\n\nThere is a massive threat to our capital markets, the free market in general, and fair dealings overall. And no, it\u2019s not China. It\u2019s a homegrown threat that everyone has been afraid to talk about. Until now.\n\nHordes of new retail investors are banding together to take on Wall Street.\u00a0 They are not willing to sit back and watch naked short sellers, funded by big banks, manipulate stocks, harm companies, and fleece shareholders.\n\nThe battle that launched this week over GameStop between retail investors and Wall Street-backed naked short sellers is the beginning of a war that could change everything.\n\nIt\u2019s a global problem, but it poses the greatest threat to Canadian capital markets, where naked short selling\u2014the process of selling shares you don\u2019t own, thereby creating counterfeit or \u2018phantom\u2019 shares\u2014survives and remains under the regulatory radar because Broker-Dealers do not have to report failing trades until they exceed 10 days.\n\nThis is an egregious act against capital markets, and it\u2019s caused billions of dollars in damage.\n\nMake no mistake about the enormity of this threat: Both foreign and domestic schemers have attacked Canada in an effort to bring down the stock prices of its publicly listed companies.\n\nIn Canada alone, hundreds of billions of dollars have been vaporized from pension funds and regular, everyday Canadians because of this, according to Texas-based lawyer James W. Christian. Christian and his firm\u00a0are heavy hitters in litigation related to stock manipulation and have prosecuted over 20 cases involving naked short selling and spoofing in the last 20 years.\n\n*\u201cHundreds of billions have been stolen from everyday Canadians and Americans and pension funds alike, and this has jeopardized the integrity of Canada\u2019s capital markets and the integral process of capital creation for entrepreneurs and job creation for the economy,\u201d*\u00a0Christian told Oilprice.com.\n\n**The Dangerous Naked Short-Selling MO**\n\nIn order to \\[legally\\] sell a stock short, traders must first locate and secure a borrow against the shares they intend to sell. A broker who enters such a trade must have assurance that his client will make settlement.\n\nWhile \u201clong\u201d sales mean the seller owns the stock, short sales can be either \"covered\" or \"naked.\" A\u00a0*covered short*\u00a0means that the short seller has already \u201cborrowed\u201d or has located or arranged to borrow the shares when the short sale is made.\u00a0Whereas, a\u00a0*naked short*\u00a0means the short seller is selling shares it doesn\u2019t own and has made no arrangements to buy. The seller cannot cover or \u201csettle\u201d in this instance, which means they are selling \u201cghost\u201d or \u201cphantom\u201d shares that simply do not exist without their action.\n\nWhen you have the ability to sell an unlimited number of non-existent phantom shares in a publicly-traded company, you then have the power to destroy and manipulate the share price at your own will.\n\nAnd big banks and financial institutions are turning a blind eye to some of the accounts that routinely participate in these illegal transactions because of the large fees they collect from them.\u00a0These institutions are actively facilitating the destruction of shareholder value in return for short term windfalls in the form of trading fees. They are a major part of the problem and are complicit in aiding these accounts to create counterfeit shares.\n\nThe funds behind this are hyper sophisticated and know all the rules and tricks needed to exploit the regulators to buy themselves time to cover their short positions. According to multiple accounts from traders, lawyers, and businesses who have become victims of the worst of the worst in this game, short-sellers sometimes manage to stay naked for months on end, in clear violation of even the most relaxed securities laws.\n\nThe short-sellers and funds who participate in this manipulation almost always finance undisclosed \u201cshort reports\u201d which they research &amp; prepare in advance, before paying well-known short-selling groups to publish and market their reports (often without any form of disclosure) to broad audiences in order to further push the stock down artificially. There\u2019s no doubt that these reports are intended to create maximum fear amongst retail investors and to push them to sell their shares as quickly as possible.\n\nThat is market manipulation. Plain and simple.\n\nTheir MO is to short weak, vulnerable companies by putting out negative reports that drive down their share price as much as possible. This ensures that the shorted company in question no longer has the ability to obtain financing, putting them at the mercy of the same funds that were just shorting them. After cratering the shorted company\u2019s share price, the funds then start offering these companies financing usually through convertibles with a warrant attachment as a hedge (or potential future cover) against their short; and the companies take the offers because they have no choice left. Rinse and Repeat.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing madness, brokers are often complicit in these sorts of crimes through their booking of client shares as \u201clong\u201d when they are in fact \u201cshort\u201d. This is where the practice moves from a regulatory gray area to conduct worthy of prison time.\n\nNaked short selling was officially labeled illegal in the U.S. and Europe after the 2008/2009 financial crisis.\n\nMaking it illegal didn\u2019t stop it from happening, however, because some of the more creative traders have discovered convenient gaps between paper and electronic trading systems, and they have taken advantage of those gaps to short stocks.\n\nStill, it gets even more sinister.\n\nAccording to Christian, \u201cglobal working groups\u201d coordinate their attacks on specifically targeted companies in a \u201cMafia-like\u201d strategy.\n\nJournalists are paid off, along with social media influencers and third-party research houses that are funded by what amounts to a conspiracy. Together, they collaborate to spread lies and negative narratives to destroy a stock.\n\nAt its most illegal, there is an insider-trading element that should enrage regulators. The MO is to infiltrate a company through disgruntled insiders or lawyers close to the company. These sources are used to obtain insider information that is then leaked to damage the company.\n\nOften, these illegal transactions involve paying off \u201cinformants\u201d, journalists, influencers, and \u201cresearchers\u201d are difficult to trace because they are made from offshore accounts that are shut down once the deed is done.\n\nLikewise, the \u201cshorts\u201d disguised as longs can be difficult to trace when the perpetrators have direct market access to trading systems. These trades are usually undetected until the trades fail or miss settlement.\u00a0 At that point, the account will move the position to another broker-dealer and start the process all over again.\n\nThe collusion widens when brokers and financial institutions become complicit in purposefully mislabeling \u201cshorts\u201d as \u201clongs\u201d, sweeping the illegal transactions under the rug and off of regulatory radar.\n\n\u201cSpoofing\u201d and \u201clayering\u201d have also become pervasive techniques to avoid regulator attention. Spoofing, as the name suggests, involves short sellers creating fake selling pressure on their targeted stocks to drive prices lower. They accomplish this by submitting fake offerings in \u201clayers\u201d at different prices to create a mirage.\n\nFinally, these bad actors manage to skirt the settlement system, which is supposed to \u201cclear\u201d on what is called a\u00a0T+2 Basis. That means that any failed trades must be bought or dealt with within 3 days. In other words, if you buy on Monday (your \u201cT\u201d or transaction day), it has to be settled by Wednesday.\n\nUnfortunately, Canadian regulators have a hard time keeping up with this system, and failed trades are often left outstanding for much longer periods than T+2. These failing trades are constantly being traded to reset the settlement clock and move the failing trade to the back of the line. The failures of a centralized system\u2026\n\nAccording to Christian, it can be T+12 days before a failed trade is even brought to the attention of the IIROC (the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada)\u2026\n\n**Prime Brokers and Banks are Complicit**\n\nThis is one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest profit center and fines levied against them are merely a minor cost of doing business.\n\nSome banks are getting rich off of these naked short sellers. The profits off this kind of lending are tantalizing, indeed. Brokers are lending stocks they don\u2019t own for massive profit and sizable bonuses.\n\nThis layer of what many have now called a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d is the toughest for regulators to deal with, regardless of the illegal nature of these activities.\n\nPrime brokers lend cash account shares that are absolutely not allowed to be lent. They lend them to short-sellers in order to facilitate them in settling their naked shorts.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the regulators are in the dark on this. They are, in fact, handing out fines, left and right\u2014both for illegal lending and for mismarking \u201cshorts\u201d and \u201clongs\u201d to evade regulatory scrutiny. The problem is that these fines pale in comparison to the profits earned through these activities.\n\nAnd banks in Canada in particular are basically writing the rules themselves, recently making it easier (and legal) to lend out cash account shares.\n\nNor do law firms have clean hands. They help short sellers bankrupt targeted companies through court proceedings, a process that eventually leads to the disappearance of evidence of naked shorts on the bank books.\n\n\u201cHow much has been stolen through this fraudulent system globally is anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d says Christian, \u201cbut the number begins with a \u2018T\u2019 (trillions).\u201d\n\nThe list of fines for enabling and engaging in manipulative activity that destroys companies\u2019 stock prices may seem to carry big numbers from the retail investor\u2019s perspective, but they are not even close to being significant enough to deter such actions:\n\n\u2013 The SEC charged Citigroup\u2019s principal U.S. broker-deal subsidiary in 2011 with misleading investors about a $1 billion collateralized debt obligation (CDO) tied to the U.S. housing market. Citigroup had bet against investors as the housing market showed signs of distress. The CDO defaulted only months later, causing severe losses for investors and a profit of $160 million (just in fees and trading profits). Citigroup paid $285 million\u00a0to settle these SEC charges.\n\n\u2013 In 2016, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. agreed to pay\u00a0$15 million\u00a0to settle SEC charges that its securities lending practices violated federal regulations. To wit: The SEC found that Goldman Sachs was mismarking logs and allowed customers to engage in short selling without determining whether the securities could reasonably be borrowed at settlement.\n\n\u2013 In 2013, a Charles Schwab subsidiary was found liable by the SEC for a naked short-selling scheme and fined $8.2 million.\n\n\u2013 The SEC charged two Merrill Lynch entities in 2015 with using \u201cinaccurate data in the course of executing short sale orders\u201d, fining them $11 million.\n\n\u2013 And most recently, Canadian Cormark Securities Inc and two others came under the SEC\u2019s radar. On December 21, SEC instituted cease and desist orders\u00a0against Cormark. It also settled charges against Cormark and two other Canada-based broker deals for \u201cproviding incorrect order-making information that caused an executing broker\u2019s repeated violations of Regulation SHO\u201d. According to the SEC, Cormark and ITG Canada caused more than 200 sale orders from a single hedge fund, to the tune of more than $660 million between August 2016 and October 2017, to be mismarked as \u201clong\u201d when they were, in fact, \u201cshort\u201d\u2014a clear violation of Regulation SHO. Cormark agreed to pay a penalty of $800,000, while ITG Canada\u2014one of the other broker-dealers charged\u2014agreed to pay a penalty of $200,000. Charging and fining Cormark is only the tip of the iceberg. The real question is on whose behalf was Cormark making the naked short sells?\n\n\u2013 In August 2020, Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) was fined $127 million over civil and criminal allegations in connection with its role in a massive price-manipulation scheme.\n\nAccording to one Toronto-based Canadian trader who spoke to Oilprice.com on condition of anonymity,\u00a0*\u201ctraders are the gatekeeper for the capital markets and they\u2019re not doing a very good job because it\u2019s lucrative to turn a blind eye.\u201d*\u00a0This game is set to end in the near future, and it is only a matter of time.\n\n*\u201cThese traders are breaking a variety of regulations, and they are taking this risk on because of the size of the account,\u201d*\u00a0he said.\u00a0*\u201cThey have a responsibility to turn these trades down. Whoever is doing this is breaking regulations \\[for the short seller\\] and they know he is not going to be able to make a settlement. As a gatekeeper, it is their regulatory responsibility to turn these trades away. Instead, they are breaking the law willfully and with full knowledge of what they are doing.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cIf you control the settlement system, you can do whatever you want,\u201d*\u00a0the source said.\u00a0*\u201cThe compliance officers have no teeth because the banks are making big money. They over-lend the stocks; they lend from cash account shares to cover some of these fails \u2026 for instance, if there are 20 million shares they sold \u2018long\u2019, they can cover by borrowing from cash account shares.\u201d*\n\n**The Naked Truth**\n\nIn what he calls our \u201cominous financial reality\u201d, Tom C.W. Lin, attorney at law, details how \u201cmillions of dollars can vanish in seconds, rogue actors can halt trading of billion-dollar companies, and trillion-dollar financial markets can be distorted with a simple click or a few lines of code\u201d.\n\nEvery investor and every institution is at risk, writes Lin.\n\nThe naked truth is this: Investors stand no chance in the face of naked short sellers. It\u2019s a game rigged in the favor of a sophisticated short cartel and Wall Street giants.\n\nNow, with online trading making it easier to democratize trading, there are calls for regulators to make moves against these bad actors to ensure that North America\u2019s capital markets remain protected, and retail investors are treated fairly.\n\nThe recent GameStop saga is retail fighting back against the shorting powers, and it\u2019s a wonderful thing to see \u2013 but is it a futile punch or the start of something bigger? The positive take away from the events the past week is that the term \u201cshort selling\u201d has been introduced to the public and will surely gather more scrutiny.\n\nWashington is gearing up to get involved. That means that we can expect the full power of Washington, not just the regulators, to be thrown behind protecting the retail investors from insidious short sellers and the bankers and prime brokers who are profiting beyond belief from these manipulative schemes.\n\nThe pressure is mounting in Canada, too, where laxer rules have been a huge boon for manipulators. The US short cartel has preyed upon the Canadian markets for decades as they know the regulators rarely take action. It is truly the wild west.\n\nJust over a year ago, McMillan published\u00a0a lengthy report on the issue from the Canadian perspective, concluding that there are significant weaknesses in the regulatory regime.\n\nWhile covered short-selling itself has undeniable benefits in providing liquidity and facilitating price discovery, and while the Canadian regulators\u2019 hands-off approach has attracted many people to its capital markets, there are significant weaknesses that threaten to bring the whole house of cards down.\n\nMcMillan also noted that \u201cthe number of short campaigns in Canada is utterly disproportionate to the size of our capital markets when compared to the United States, the European Union, and Australia\u201d.\n\nTaking Wall Street\u2019s side in this battle,\u00a0Bloomberg notes that Wall Street has survived \u201cnumerous other attacks\u201d over the centuries, \u201cbut the GameStop uprising could mark the end of an era for the public short\u201d, suggesting that these actors are \u201clong-vilified folks who try to root out corporate wrongdoing\u201d.\n\nBloomberg even attempts to victimize Andrew Left\u2019s Citron Research, which\u2014amid all the chaos\u2014has just announced that it has exited the short-selling game after two decades.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. Short sellers, particularly the naked variety, are not helping police the markets and route out bad companies, as Bloomberg suggests.\u00a0**Naked short sellers are not motivated by moral and ethical reasons, but by profit alone.**\u00a0They attack good, but weak and vulnerable companies.\u00a0**They are not the saviors of capital markets, but the destroyers.**\u00a0Andrew Left may be a \u201ccasualty\u201d, but he is not a victim. Nor likely are the hedge funds with whom he has been working.\n\nIn a petition initiated by Change.org, the petitioners urge the SEC and FINRA to investigate Left and Citron Research, noting: \u201cWhile information Citron Research publishes are carefully selected and\u00a0distributed\u00a0in ways that do not break the law at first sight, the SEC and FINRA have overlooked the fact that Left and Citron gains are a result of distributing catalysts in an anticipation of substantial price changes due to public response in either panic, encouragement, or simply a catalyst action wave ride.\u00a0Their job as a company is to create the most amount of panic shortly after taking a trading position so they and their clients can make the most amount of financial gains at the expense of regular investors.\u201d\n\nOn January 25th, the Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce\u00a0published its final report for Ontario\u2019s Minister of Finance, noting that while naked short selling has been illegal in the United States since 2008, it remains a legal loophole in Canada. The task force is recommending that the Ministry ban this practice that allows for the short-selling of tradable assets without first borrowing the security.\n\nThe National Coalition Against Naked Short Selling \u2013 Failing to Deliver Securities (NCANS), which takes pains to emphasize that is not in any way against short-selling, notes: \u201cNaked short-selling transfers the risk exposure and the hedging expense of the derivatives market makers onto the backs of equity investors, without any corresponding benefit to them. This is fundamentally unfair, and must stop.\u201d ###\n\n**Have You Contacted Your Congressional Representative Regarding Illegal Naked Short-Selling?** [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockLaunchers/comments/ni4tos/have\\_you\\_contacted\\_your\\_congressional/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockLaunchers/comments/ni4tos/have_you_contacted_your_congressional/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

        "selftext": "By now we have all heard the virtues of Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and that you should never try to time the market. Basically, it has been repeated ad nauseam that\n\n&gt;Time in the market beats timing the market\n\nBut what is interesting is that I could not find any research that has been done on the best way to do dollar-cost averaging.\n\n**Theoretically, there must be a better way than to randomly throw your hard-earned money once a month into SPY, right?**\n\nSo in this week\u2019s analysis, we will explore various methods to do DCA and see which one would end up giving you the best returns!\n\n___ \n\n**Analysis**\n\nGiven that dollar-cost averaging is about holding investments long-term, we need data, lots and lots of data! For this, I have pulled the adjusted daily closing price &amp; Shiller P/E ratio of SPY for the last 30 years \\[1\\].\n\nNow we have to devise different methods to do the Dollar-cost averaging that will maximize our long-term return. We will have different personas for reflecting different investment styles (all of them would be investing the same amount - $100 every month but following different strategies)\n\n**Average Joe:** Invests on the first of every month no matter how the market is trending (this would be our benchmark)\n\n**Cautious Charlie:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio \\[2\\] is lesser than the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold Treasury-Bills \\[3\\]\n\n**Balanced Barry:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio is within +20% \\[4\\] of the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold T-Bills\n\n**Analyst Alan:** Invests whenever the market pulls back a certain percentage from the last all-time high, else will hold T-Bills \\[5\\].\n\nGiven that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment, I have considered the starting point to be 1st Jan 1994. So the analysis is based on someone who invested $100 every month since 1994. In all the above strategies, we will only hold treasury bills till the investment requirements are satisfied. I.e, in the case of Cautious Charlie, he will keep on accumulating T-Bills every month if the PE ratio is not within his set limit. Once it\u2019s below the limit, he will convert all the T-bills and invest them into SPY. \n\n___\n\n**Results**\n\nBased on the time period of our analysis, we would have invested a total amount of $33,400 till now.\n\n**Return Comparison - Different DCA Strategies** \n\n|**Investment Strategy**|**Portfolio** |**Investment Strategy**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Average Joe|$169,036|406%|\n|Analyst Alan - 1% drop|$168,129|403%|\n|Analyst Alan - 3% drop|$166,658|399%|\n|Balanced Barry|$162,150|385%|\n|Analyst Alan - 5% drop|$154,441|362%|\n|Analyst Alan - 10% drop|$146,392|388%|\n|Cautious Charlie|$139,696|318%|\n\n \n\nNo matter what strategy we use, the most amount of returns were made by the Average Joe who invested every month no matter how the market was trending. A close second was Analyst Alan who accumulated money in T-Bills and only invested when the market dropped more than 1% from its all-time high.\n\nThe least amount of returns were generated by Cautious Charlie who only invested if the PE ratio was lesser than the last 5-year average (basically by trying to avoid over-valued rallies, he ended up missing on all the gains), followed by the Analyst Alan persona who waited for a 10% drop from ATH before investing.\n\n___\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThere are some limitations to the analysis.\n\na. Tax on the gain on sale of treasury bills and transactions costs are not considered in the analysis. Both of these would adversely affect the overall returns\n\nb. Since I am only using the monthly data for the P/E ratio and my SPY investments (due to data constraints), a much more complicated strategy involving intra-month price changes might have a better chance of beating the market (at the same time making it more difficult to execute).\n\nc. While we have analyzed the trends using the last 30 years\u2019 worth of SPY data, the overall outcome might be different if we change the time period to say 40, 50, or even 100 years.\n\n___ \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI started off the analysis thinking that it would be pretty straightforward to find a winning strategy given that we are using nuanced strategies instead of randomly putting money in every month. I also checked for various time frames \\[5,10, 20 years\\] and various endpoints \\[Just before the covid crash, after the crash, before J-Pow, etc.\\]. In none of the cases did any of the strategies beat average Joe in the total returns.\n\nSince this is an optimization problem, I am [sharing all the data and my analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JK4b-CYgvlSH-FqYvCBEve0RQ3ACmJNsmTwzLV7jqWs/edit?usp=sharing) in the hope that someone can tweak the strategy to finally give us that elusive risk-adjusted market-beating returns.\n\n___ \n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] The data was obtained from Yahoo Finance API and longtermtrends.net. While the P/E ratio was available for the last 130+ years, the daily closing of SPY was limited to 30 years.\n\n\\[2\\] We are using the Shiller PE ratio - this ratio divides the price of the S&amp;P 500 index by the average inflation-adjusted earnings of the previous 10 years. This solves for the brief period in 2009 when the normal PE ratio went through the roof as the earnings of the companies fell drastically due to the financial crisis.\n\n\\[3\\] We are holding treasury bills as it has the shortest maturity dates and does not have a minimum holding period unlike the T-Bonds\n\n\\[4\\] The 20% cut-off is considered as it would be above one standard deviation from the historical trends\n\n\\[5\\] The idea of investing after the market pullbacks is driven by the following report from JP Morgan which stated that 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones",

I was planning on deploying the cash into faangs if we get a significant pull back in those names which I don't feel we have had yet.\n\nI'm mainly wondering if that's a good strategy (buying significant dips in tech mega cap) or if some cash should be deployed into \"reopening\" (although I'm kind of tired of hearing about that! Lol) stocks,\n\nOr deployed into industrials or whatever. \n\nI realize being 50% tech I'm gonna get hit, but I always think of tech rebounding eventually so it doesn't worry me.
