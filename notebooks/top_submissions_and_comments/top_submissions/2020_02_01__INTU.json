        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Coronavirus fears spoiled a solid earnings season and will further dominate markets ahead\u2019  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-fears-ruin-solid-earnings-season-and-cloud-growth-picture.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The coronavirus outbreak ruined for investors what was a solid earnings reporting season and is casting a pall on forecasts for this quarter and the rest of this year. And now with most of the earnings season in the books, look for the latest coronavirus headlines to fill the vacuum and weigh on stocks the rest of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Fourth-quarter profit growth for S&amp;P 500 companies came in at 3.1%, and if the energy sector is excluded, the growth rate was 6.0%, according to Refinitiv. Just about four weeks ago, analysts expected a slight decline.\n*****\n&gt; However, the deluge of solid corporate results was largely overlooked by investors who are focusing on the spillover impact from the coronavirus on U.S. corporations. Stocks post losses this week as a jump in confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths deepened concerns about slowing global economic growth. Major U.S. companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble have sounded alarms on the disease, warning of a dent in profits down the road.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe virus is totally underrated,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said on Friday.\u201cWhat I think is a little too premature is they all presume that it is going to be solved within a foreseeable time frame. At what point do we say that many, many companies are going to be hurt by the virus [and] we\u2019re paying too much for stocks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018More cautious than usual\u2019\n&gt; Wall Street analysts have been quick to slash their earnings expectations for the next quarter in light of the fast-spreading virus. Expectations for earnings growth in the first quarter have been cut in half to just 3.2% from more than 6% at the start of 2020, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Companies themselves are also lowering guidance for earnings growth in the near future. There have been more U.S. companies issuing below-consensus guidance for the next quarter than those with upbeat forecasts, marking the weakest ratio in a February since 2014, according to Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile guidance is typically weak in the first quarter as corporates set a low bar, it has been more cautious than usual this earnings season, likely due to the coronavirus,\u201d Subramanian said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have cited coronavirus during their earnings call this season, according to FactSet. These companies\u2019 average revenue exposure to China is 7.2%, compared to 4.8% exposure for the average S&amp;P 500 company.\n*****\n&gt; As of Friday, China\u2019s National Health Commission reported more than 75,000 confirmed cases and over 2,000 deaths on the mainland. South Korea has also reported more than 200 cases. Meanwhile, World health officials said the outbreak in Iran is \u201cvery worrisome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season,\u201d John Lynch, LPL Financial\u2019s chief investment strategist, said in a note. \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ePo2a9q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ClwuPuJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/jpEvLyH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/flHhHRv.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HyjYjBt.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/XCThMbQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TN0RBSk.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ixAr7Su.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ncauH0T.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/x4XfkyA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yeknvyf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hOU10RV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Earnings Season Observations\n\n&gt; The recent news that technology giant Apple would miss its fourth quarter 2020 revenue targets has understandably increased investor anxiety surrounding the potential economic impact of the coronavirus (now called COVID-19). Lost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season.\n\n&gt; \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cDespite slowing global economic growth, weakness in capital investment and manufacturing, a strong US dollar, and a huge drop in energy sector profits, S&amp;P 500 companies are impressively grinding out 1-2 percentage points of overall earnings growth.\u201d The fourth quarter earnings growth may cement the third quarter of 2019 as the trough, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some highlights of this earnings season:\n\n&gt; * **Solid revenue upside**. A solid 65% of S&amp;P 500 Index companies have beaten revenue estimates, the highest level since second quarter 2018 and well above the long-term average at 57%. S&amp;P 500 companies have produced a larger-than-normal nearly one percentage point positive revenue surprise and are tracking to a 3.5% top-line increase.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/revenue-tracking-nicely-ahead-of-expectations-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Respectable earnings upside despite headwinds**. The earnings beat rate at 71% is slightly above the 10-year average (70%). S&amp;P 500 earnings growth has surprised by a solid 4.4% so far despite economic, currency, and commodity headwinds.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Consider the energy drag**. Though 1-2% overall earnings growth isn\u2019t much, the gain is approximately 4%, excluding the energy sector.\n&gt; * ** Sector standout**. One of the most China-exposed sectors produced one of the biggest upside earnings surprises: Technology. Technology sector earnings growth is tracking to a 5% year-over-year increase, about 9 percentage points above prior estimates.\n&gt; * **Reassuring outlooks**. Estimates for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share in 2020 have only fallen by about 0.9% since December 31, 2019. Though these numbers may come down a bit more in the coming days and the China situation remains fluid, this modest reduction reflects U.S. companies\u2019 resilience overall amid significant supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n# Election Year March: Performance Haunted By Steep 1980 Declines\n\n&gt; Boisterous March markets tend to drive prices up early in the month and batter stocks at month end. Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to \u201cbeware the Ides of March\u201d but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. In March 2001, DJIA plunged 1469 points (-11.8%) from March 9 to the 22.\n\n&gt; Normally a decent performing market month, March is somewhat above average in election years with advances 64.7% of the time with a 1.0% average DJIA gain since 1952. S&amp;P 500 has also advanced 64.7% of the time since 1952, but gains have been slightly better at 1.2%, on average. NASDAQ has not fared well in March in election years since 1972. Due to a 17.1% loss in 1980, March is NASDAQ\u2019s second worst month of the election year. Similarly, March 1980\u2019s steep losses adversely affect Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indices.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9950c2a54b4059c3ffe0481a83cf281a/573a7bf3eae7af17-3d/s400x600/7703526bf6d4a2214d4e4b75883edec7f23d56af.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Performance Throughout The Presidencies\n\n&gt; As markets were closed to observe Presidents Day yesterday and the 2020 Presidential election continues to ramp up, we thought it would be a good time to check up on stock performance during different administrations. In the table below, we show the performance of the Dow during the administrations of every US president since 1900 in addition to the annualized return. In the time since President Trump was sworn into office, the Dow has risen 46.9%. On an annualized basis, the 13.3% return places the current administration in 3rd place for the strongest performance. Only the Clinton administration in the 1990s and Coolidge administration in the 1920s have observed stronger annualized gains. The one caveat of course is that President Trump's term (or terms) has yet to end. Comparing Democratic and Republican administrations since 1900, Democratic presidencies have tended to average stronger returns than their Republican peers, so the stock market's returns under President Trump have deviated somewhat from the norm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-Presidents1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it is impossible to say what a candidate's election will mean for the market, at the moment betting markets favor the incumbent to win the presidency while Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg go back and forth in taking the number 2 spot, hovering around 15%-16%. Come Super Tuesday (March 3rd) when we could finally see more clarity on the Democratic side, the back and forth between Bloomberg and Sanders might become more one-sided.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-EBO.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yet Another Corona Friday\n\n&gt; The major indices decided it was five o'clock somewhere right off the bat today as they experience yet another \"Corona Friday\". More concerns around the coronavirus have sent stocks lower with the S&amp;P 500 down around 1.1% as of this writing and the Nasdaq down nearly 2% today. Declines on a Friday have become par for the course in 2020. Fridays have been the weakest day of the week so far in 2020; the only one to average a decline. On average, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.52% on Fridays while the next worst day has been Monday which has averaged a gain of 0.19%. Fridays have also been the day that the S&amp;P 500 has closed higher the least. Only 28.6% of Fridays this year have seen the S&amp;P 500 finish in the green. That compares to a positive close more than three-quarters of the time on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. While it has averaged a gain of 0.24%, Tuesdays have also experienced a positive close less than half of the time.

All three indexes are well above their respective historical averages for this time of an election year. NASDAQ has in fact already exceeded its average full election year performance going back to 1972. Bullish sentiment and momentum appear to be firmly in place and historical election year patterns suggests strength could easily continue for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 into May. NASDAQ\u2019s surge higher could be vulnerable to a retreat sooner, in March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/baea2768b612eb15dbd047fbc0cff07b/5100d48ef25e7c53-d2/s500x750/10e181f3beef5c191c7ec0ad2bf7e50a0e449324.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Dow Without Boeing (BA)\n\n&gt; For more than a year now, Boeing (BA) has been plagued by the 737 MAX crisis which has weighed on shares of the plane manufacturer with it now currently down nearly 20% from when the initial groundings took place on March 10th of last year. Despite this, while underperforming the broader market due to the 737 issues, the stock is actually still up just over 5% since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; Even though BA has lagged, it is still the highest-priced of the 30 stocks in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average. Currently trading around $338.50, the only stocks in the index holding a candle to BA are Apple (AAPL) and UnitedHealth (UNH), which also trade north of $300 per share. That means these stocks have the highest weighting in the index and therefore have a much larger impact than other stocks on the Dow's performance.\n\n&gt; With BA's issues, a number of people have pondered the what-ifs for the Dow had the company not had the issues with the 737. Would we have already broken out the Dow 30K hats were it not for BA? In the chart below, we show the actual performance of the DJIA and have overlaid the performance of an 'alternate Dow' showing its performance if BA had not been in the index since the start of 2019. We used the start of 2019 instead of the actual date of the groundings as it is a little less arbitrary. By our calculations, while we would be a bit closer, even if BA wasn't in the index since the start of 2019, we wouldn't quite be at Dow 30K yet. As shown, our alternate Dow would be almost 1% or 266 points higher if Boeing was not included in the index since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; While BA has been a drag on the DJIA since last March, it also provided a big boost to the index in early 2018 before the 737 issues hit the stock. In fact, at the start of March 2017, BA was up over 36% YTD and the spread between the Dow's performance with and without BA was around 700 points in the other direction as it is now!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow-wo-BA-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Another example of this dynamic in which high priced stocks have a greater impact on the index was observed on Tuesday when Apple's (AAPL) stock fell after the company warned that Q1 revenues would be shy of prior guidance due to the coronavirus. The warnings sent shares down over 3% at its intraday lows, but the stock only finished down 1.83%. While there were equivalent or larger declines like Dow (DOW) or Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) in Tuesday's session, AAPL's declines by far weighed on the index more than any other stock. Of the Dow's 165.89 point decline, AAPL contributed 40.35 points. Fortunately, UNH helped to mitigate some of those losses as it had a positive impact on the index of +22.79 points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 21st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXVxywH87mg))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.23.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BYND**\n&gt; * **$SQ** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$SPCE** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$CRON** \n&gt; * **$CHK** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$TTD** \n&gt; * **$AMRN** \n&gt; * **$SHAK** \n&gt; * **$KOS** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$ILPT** \n&gt; * **$CLVS** \n&gt; * **$TNDM** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$CRI** \n&gt; * **$SPNS** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$CTB** \n&gt; * **$ETSY** \n&gt; * **$TREE** \n&gt; * **$KEYS** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$GWPH** \n&gt; * **$W** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$WEN** \n&gt; * **$CROX** \n&gt; * **$DIN** \n&gt; * **$DNR** \n&gt; * **$LL** \n&gt; * **$DORM** \n&gt; * **$GH** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$MGI** \n&gt; * **$AMT** \n&gt; * **$JCP** \n&gt; * **$CBRL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/qvtfNhx.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/kpCRctt.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3PTK97f.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eNbMCOD.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/qV7qy6J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eNgrHgV.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FopcLUz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2yyK6HI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dsgBu6B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9VYkHyk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/5mFOqR0.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rd8JhvX.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WrX9hNT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jsCwSCH.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/fzm6EPP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lKtvBHM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Beyond Meat, Inc. $117.45\n&gt; **Beyond Meat, Inc.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Coronavirus fears spoiled a solid earnings season and will further dominate markets ahead\u2019  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-fears-ruin-solid-earnings-season-and-cloud-growth-picture.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The coronavirus outbreak ruined for investors what was a solid earnings reporting season and is casting a pall on forecasts for this quarter and the rest of this year. And now with most of the earnings season in the books, look for the latest coronavirus headlines to fill the vacuum and weigh on stocks the rest of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Fourth-quarter profit growth for S&amp;P 500 companies came in at 3.1%, and if the energy sector is excluded, the growth rate was 6.0%, according to Refinitiv. Just about four weeks ago, analysts expected a slight decline.\n*****\n&gt; However, the deluge of solid corporate results was largely overlooked by investors who are focusing on the spillover impact from the coronavirus on U.S. corporations. Stocks post losses this week as a jump in confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths deepened concerns about slowing global economic growth. Major U.S. companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble have sounded alarms on the disease, warning of a dent in profits down the road.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe virus is totally underrated,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said on Friday.\u201cWhat I think is a little too premature is they all presume that it is going to be solved within a foreseeable time frame. At what point do we say that many, many companies are going to be hurt by the virus [and] we\u2019re paying too much for stocks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018More cautious than usual\u2019\n&gt; Wall Street analysts have been quick to slash their earnings expectations for the next quarter in light of the fast-spreading virus. Expectations for earnings growth in the first quarter have been cut in half to just 3.2% from more than 6% at the start of 2020, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Companies themselves are also lowering guidance for earnings growth in the near future. There have been more U.S. companies issuing below-consensus guidance for the next quarter than those with upbeat forecasts, marking the weakest ratio in a February since 2014, according to Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile guidance is typically weak in the first quarter as corporates set a low bar, it has been more cautious than usual this earnings season, likely due to the coronavirus,\u201d Subramanian said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have cited coronavirus during their earnings call this season, according to FactSet. These companies\u2019 average revenue exposure to China is 7.2%, compared to 4.8% exposure for the average S&amp;P 500 company.\n*****\n&gt; As of Friday, China\u2019s National Health Commission reported more than 75,000 confirmed cases and over 2,000 deaths on the mainland. South Korea has also reported more than 200 cases. Meanwhile, World health officials said the outbreak in Iran is \u201cvery worrisome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season,\u201d John Lynch, LPL Financial\u2019s chief investment strategist, said in a note. \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ePo2a9q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ClwuPuJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/jpEvLyH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/flHhHRv.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HyjYjBt.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/XCThMbQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TN0RBSk.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ixAr7Su.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ncauH0T.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/x4XfkyA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yeknvyf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hOU10RV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Earnings Season Observations\n\n&gt; The recent news that technology giant Apple would miss its fourth quarter 2020 revenue targets has understandably increased investor anxiety surrounding the potential economic impact of the coronavirus (now called COVID-19). Lost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season.\n\n&gt; \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cDespite slowing global economic growth, weakness in capital investment and manufacturing, a strong US dollar, and a huge drop in energy sector profits, S&amp;P 500 companies are impressively grinding out 1-2 percentage points of overall earnings growth.\u201d The fourth quarter earnings growth may cement the third quarter of 2019 as the trough, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some highlights of this earnings season:\n\n&gt; * **Solid revenue upside**. A solid 65% of S&amp;P 500 Index companies have beaten revenue estimates, the highest level since second quarter 2018 and well above the long-term average at 57%. S&amp;P 500 companies have produced a larger-than-normal nearly one percentage point positive revenue surprise and are tracking to a 3.5% top-line increase.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/revenue-tracking-nicely-ahead-of-expectations-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Respectable earnings upside despite headwinds**. The earnings beat rate at 71% is slightly above the 10-year average (70%). S&amp;P 500 earnings growth has surprised by a solid 4.4% so far despite economic, currency, and commodity headwinds.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Consider the energy drag**. Though 1-2% overall earnings growth isn\u2019t much, the gain is approximately 4%, excluding the energy sector.\n&gt; * **Sector standout**. One of the most China-exposed sectors produced one of the biggest upside earnings surprises: Technology. Technology sector earnings growth is tracking to a 5% year-over-year increase, about 9 percentage points above prior estimates.\n&gt; * **Reassuring outlooks**. Estimates for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share in 2020 have only fallen by about 0.9% since December 31, 2019. Though these numbers may come down a bit more in the coming days and the China situation remains fluid, this modest reduction reflects U.S. companies\u2019 resilience overall amid significant supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n# Election Year March: Performance Haunted By Steep 1980 Declines\n\n&gt; Boisterous March markets tend to drive prices up early in the month and batter stocks at month end. Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to \u201cbeware the Ides of March\u201d but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. In March 2001, DJIA plunged 1469 points (-11.8%) from March 9 to the 22.\n\n&gt; Normally a decent performing market month, March is somewhat above average in election years with advances 64.7% of the time with a 1.0% average DJIA gain since 1952. S&amp;P 500 has also advanced 64.7% of the time since 1952, but gains have been slightly better at 1.2%, on average. NASDAQ has not fared well in March in election years since 1972. Due to a 17.1% loss in 1980, March is NASDAQ\u2019s second worst month of the election year. Similarly, March 1980\u2019s steep losses adversely affect Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indices.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9950c2a54b4059c3ffe0481a83cf281a/573a7bf3eae7af17-3d/s400x600/7703526bf6d4a2214d4e4b75883edec7f23d56af.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Performance Throughout The Presidencies\n\n&gt; As markets were closed to observe Presidents Day yesterday and the 2020 Presidential election continues to ramp up, we thought it would be a good time to check up on stock performance during different administrations. In the table below, we show the performance of the Dow during the administrations of every US president since 1900 in addition to the annualized return. In the time since President Trump was sworn into office, the Dow has risen 46.9%. On an annualized basis, the 13.3% return places the current administration in 3rd place for the strongest performance. Only the Clinton administration in the 1990s and Coolidge administration in the 1920s have observed stronger annualized gains. The one caveat of course is that President Trump's term (or terms) has yet to end. Comparing Democratic and Republican administrations since 1900, Democratic presidencies have tended to average stronger returns than their Republican peers, so the stock market's returns under President Trump have deviated somewhat from the norm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-Presidents1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it is impossible to say what a candidate's election will mean for the market, at the moment betting markets favor the incumbent to win the presidency while Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg go back and forth in taking the number 2 spot, hovering around 15%-16%. Come Super Tuesday (March 3rd) when we could finally see more clarity on the Democratic side, the back and forth between Bloomberg and Sanders might become more one-sided.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-EBO.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yet Another Corona Friday\n\n&gt; The major indices decided it was five o'clock somewhere right off the bat today as they experience yet another \"Corona Friday\". More concerns around the coronavirus have sent stocks lower with the S&amp;P 500 down around 1.1% as of this writing and the Nasdaq down nearly 2% today. Declines on a Friday have become par for the course in 2020. Fridays have been the weakest day of the week so far in 2020; the only one to average a decline. On average, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.52% on Fridays while the next worst day has been Monday which has averaged a gain of 0.19%. Fridays have also been the day that the S&amp;P 500 has closed higher the least. Only 28.6% of Fridays this year have seen the S&amp;P 500 finish in the green. That compares to a positive close more than three-quarters of the time on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. While it has averaged a gain of 0.24%, Tuesdays have also experienced a positive close less than half of the time.

All three indexes are well above their respective historical averages for this time of an election year. NASDAQ has in fact already exceeded its average full election year performance going back to 1972. Bullish sentiment and momentum appear to be firmly in place and historical election year patterns suggests strength could easily continue for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 into May. NASDAQ\u2019s surge higher could be vulnerable to a retreat sooner, in March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/baea2768b612eb15dbd047fbc0cff07b/5100d48ef25e7c53-d2/s500x750/10e181f3beef5c191c7ec0ad2bf7e50a0e449324.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Dow Without Boeing (BA)\n\n&gt; For more than a year now, Boeing (BA) has been plagued by the 737 MAX crisis which has weighed on shares of the plane manufacturer with it now currently down nearly 20% from when the initial groundings took place on March 10th of last year. Despite this, while underperforming the broader market due to the 737 issues, the stock is actually still up just over 5% since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; Even though BA has lagged, it is still the highest-priced of the 30 stocks in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average. Currently trading around $338.50, the only stocks in the index holding a candle to BA are Apple (AAPL) and UnitedHealth (UNH), which also trade north of $300 per share. That means these stocks have the highest weighting in the index and therefore have a much larger impact than other stocks on the Dow's performance.\n\n&gt; With BA's issues, a number of people have pondered the what-ifs for the Dow had the company not had the issues with the 737. Would we have already broken out the Dow 30K hats were it not for BA? In the chart below, we show the actual performance of the DJIA and have overlaid the performance of an 'alternate Dow' showing its performance if BA had not been in the index since the start of 2019. We used the start of 2019 instead of the actual date of the groundings as it is a little less arbitrary. By our calculations, while we would be a bit closer, even if BA wasn't in the index since the start of 2019, we wouldn't quite be at Dow 30K yet. As shown, our alternate Dow would be almost 1% or 266 points higher if Boeing was not included in the index since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; While BA has been a drag on the DJIA since last March, it also provided a big boost to the index in early 2018 before the 737 issues hit the stock. In fact, at the start of March 2017, BA was up over 36% YTD and the spread between the Dow's performance with and without BA was around 700 points in the other direction as it is now!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow-wo-BA-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Another example of this dynamic in which high priced stocks have a greater impact on the index was observed on Tuesday when Apple's (AAPL) stock fell after the company warned that Q1 revenues would be shy of prior guidance due to the coronavirus. The warnings sent shares down over 3% at its intraday lows, but the stock only finished down 1.83%. While there were equivalent or larger declines like Dow (DOW) or Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) in Tuesday's session, AAPL's declines by far weighed on the index more than any other stock. Of the Dow's 165.89 point decline, AAPL contributed 40.35 points. Fortunately, UNH helped to mitigate some of those losses as it had a positive impact on the index of +22.79 points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow2.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BYND**\n&gt; * **$SQ** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$SPCE** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$CRON** \n&gt; * **$CHK** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$TTD** \n&gt; * **$AMRN** \n&gt; * **$SHAK** \n&gt; * **$KOS** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$ILPT** \n&gt; * **$CLVS** \n&gt; * **$TNDM** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$CRI** \n&gt; * **$SPNS** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$CTB** \n&gt; * **$ETSY** \n&gt; * **$TREE** \n&gt; * **$KEYS** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$GWPH** \n&gt; * **$W** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$WEN** \n&gt; * **$CROX** \n&gt; * **$DIN** \n&gt; * **$DNR** \n&gt; * **$LL** \n&gt; * **$DORM** \n&gt; * **$GH** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$MGI** \n&gt; * **$AMT** \n&gt; * **$JCP** \n&gt; * **$CBRL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/qvtfNhx.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/kpCRctt.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3PTK97f.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eNbMCOD.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/qV7qy6J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eNgrHgV.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FopcLUz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2yyK6HI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dsgBu6B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9VYkHyk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/5mFOqR0.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rd8JhvX.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WrX9hNT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jsCwSCH.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/fzm6EPP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lKtvBHM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Beyond Meat, Inc. $117.45\n&gt; **Beyond Meat, Inc.
