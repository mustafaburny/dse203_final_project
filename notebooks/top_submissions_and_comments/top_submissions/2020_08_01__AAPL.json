        "selftext": "This is not financial advise. Do your own research. I personally am gonna do exactly what this says, and.... hard.\n\nThis is a win big or lose the entire bet trade. Here\u2019s the backstory:\n\nIf you watch the Commodities Futures Trading ([https://www.cftc.gov/](https://www.cftc.gov/)) weekly report on precious metals report (near the bottom here at \u201cCommodity Exchange Incorporated\u201d \u201cshort format) [https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm))\n\nYou can see that from last weekly, large commercial traders were net short about 46,000 silver contracts. That's 240,000,000 ounces. **They can't get them.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faa0pivd12j51.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b285392df24cf18568983dd46c6ca5ab4f5e01a3\n\nThere\u2019s only about 1,000,000,000 in circulation. Physical silver is going for a $7-$8 premium versus /SI. \n\nThe thinking is that this large discrepancy in physical vs paper will lead to MANY more /SI holders seeking delivery next Thursday when settlement occurs.That leaves the banks with 3 options.\n\n1. Write more paper contracts short and try to hammer the price. That would lead to more exposure I'm not thinking they want.\n\n2. Take their lumps and attempt to fill as many settlements as possible. They risk losses in the billions and fines\n\n3. Most likely. They attempt to buy the contracts back, driving a huge temporary jump in prices. Basically the reverse of oil in april. I expect SLV to go crazy on Wednesday and Thursday this week.\n\nSomeone else does too as the option volume and open interest at $40 strike is the highest on the board so.... what is to prevent a[ $TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click) or[ $AAPL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AAPL&amp;src=cashtag_click) like squeeze in[ $SLV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SLV&amp;src=cashtag_click) next week?!\n\nI would like to say nothing.,,\n\nTHE PLAY\n\nThe play is to pick up options on Tuesday (tomorrow) that expire on Friday, and our out of the money. (I personally went with $28 strike, but I have a few lottos too). If scenario 2 happens, we make money. If 3 happens, we make a lot. If 1 happens, we try again next week and the hole is deeper.\n\n(REPORT)\n\nI have already made an offering to the Tendie Gods, so I hope I'm good. We'll see.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ssn2ssr912j51.jpg?width=1512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=595bc2fb25dccdaa3b612350018f4ee4981ab803",

        "selftext": " New York (CNN Business)Tesla is preparing to\u00a0[split its stock](http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/11/cars/tesla-stock-split/index.html), making it more affordable for average investors. It may need to do another one pretty soon if its shares keep surging.Tesla\u00a0([TSLA](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=TSLA&amp;source=story_quote_link))\u00a0has skyrocketed 50% since announcing the stock split on August 11. It now trades at nearly $2,100 a share.Once\u00a0[the split](http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/18/investing/stock-splits-apple-tesla/index.html)\u00a0goes into effect on August 31, current Tesla investors will get five shares for each one they own. That will\u00a0[cut the price](http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/11/cars/tesla-stock-split/index.html)\u00a0by a fifth, to almost $420 a share. The market value of Tesla, now hovering around $390 billion, will remain the same.But does Tesla deserve to trade at such a high valuation? While the\u00a0[Elon Musk-led company](http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/18/success/elon-musk-tesla-ipo-vault-interview/index.html)\u00a0is generating\u00a0[consistent profits](http://www.cnn.com/2020/07/22/cars/tesla-earnings-q2/index.html), its sales are dwarfed by the major auto giants.Tesla is expected to generate nearly $30 billion in annual revenue this year.

But\u00a0Fiat Chrysler\u00a0([FCAU](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=FCAU&amp;source=story_quote_link))\u00a0is estimated to report $100 billion in sales for 2020.\u00a0GM\u00a0([GM](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=GM&amp;source=story_quote_link))\u00a0and\u00a0Ford\u00a0([F](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=F&amp;source=story_quote_link))\u00a0are each forecast to post annual revenue of more than $110 billion.Still, Tesla\u2019s market value is now more than four times the combined market caps of Detroit\u2019s Big 3.\n\nA majority of Wall Street analysts are betting against Tesla. Of the 33 that officially track the stock, only eight have a buy rating on Tesla while 15 have it rated a hold and 10 are recommending a sell on it.Only three of the Tesla analysts currently have a price target for it above $2,000. The consensus target is just under $1,300 \u2014 almost 40% below its current price.Tesla continues to be a\u00a0[big target of short sellers](http://www.cnn.com/2020/01/30/investing/short-selling-squeeze/index.html), investors who borrow the stock and sell it with the hopes of eventually buying it back at a lower price.Of course, Tesla fans can correctly point out that analysts have been consistently wrong and that Wall Street will eventually have to raise its earnings forecasts and price targets on the stock.Tesla may also get a further boost if it is\u00a0[finally added](http://www.cnn.com/2020/02/06/investing/tesla-sp-500/index.html)\u00a0to the blue-chip\u00a0[S&amp;P 500 index](https://money.cnn.com/data/markets/sandp/)\u00a0\u2014 a move that could soon happen now that the company has posted a consistent run of profitable quarters.\n\nFull Article:  [http://pioret.com/tesla-has-soared-50-since-announcing-its-stock-split-last-week](http://pioret.com/tesla-has-soared-50-since-announcing-its-stock-split-last-week)",

        "selftext": "I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -&gt; Aug. \n\nI beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180-&gt;300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)\n\nI did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. \n\nI did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. \n\n#High level advice:\n=========================================\n\nhttps://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/37-top-10-pieces-of-investment-advice-from-warren-buffett\n\nI picked the 7 I agree with.\n\n1. Invest in what you know\u2026and nothing more.\n2. Never compromise on business quality\n3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever\n4. Diversification can be dangerous\n5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)\n8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)\n10. Only listen to those you know and trust \n\nI firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  \n\n#General mindset:\n================\n- Keep emotions out of the market\n- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.\n- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. \n- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. \n- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)\n- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. \n\n#Application:\n==================================================================\nI was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. \n\nAs a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. \n\nBased on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good \"feel\" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). \n\nI tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. \n\nPost COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.\n\nMy hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. \n\n1. eCommerce + AdTech \n2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)\n3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)\n\nThese are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:\n\n1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?\n2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?\n3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? \n4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?\n5. Who are their customers and target demographic?\n6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.\n\nIn March, I took what I believe to be an \"educated gamble\". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.\n\nI have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.\n\nHere are the non FAANGs I chose.\n\n1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&amp;M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. \n\n2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.\n\n3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. \n\n4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.\n\n5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. \n\n6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.\n\n7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. \"Zoom parties\" and \"Zoom dates\" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.\n\n8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. \n\n10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.\n\n11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. \n\n12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. \n\n13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say \"Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?\" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.\n\n14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.\n\nMutual funds/ETFs\n1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. \n\n2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. \n\n3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... \n\nTitanvest:\nI was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.\n\n#Some things I do that that are against the grain:\n\n- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.\n\n- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.\n\n- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. \n\nOne example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. \n\nLastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. \n\nAlso, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",

        "selftext": "The world\u2019s most valuable car company just hit another milestone.\n\nTesla \ufffc\u2019s (ticker: TSLA) market capitalization on Wednesday topped $400 billion. About two months ago, it was celebrating $200 billion. It first hit $100 billion in January.\n\nTesla passed Johnson &amp; Johnson \ufffc (JNJ) along the way on Wednesday, in terms of market cap. There are only seven companies in the S&amp;P 500 index worth more, including Visa \ufffc (V) at $447 billon and Apple \ufffc (AAPL) at $2.16 trillion.\n\nThere is a lot you could buy for $400 billion. Here are a few notable   comparisons to put that figure in context.\n\nIt\u2019s more than the combined value of every team in the four major U.S. professional sports, according to Forbes estimates. It\u2019s also more than the Forbes estimate for the combined net worth of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla\u2019s own CEO Elon Musk.\n\nIt\u2019s nearly four times International Business Machines \ufffc\u2019 (IBM) market cap.\n\nYou could buy 400 billion things at a dollar store\u2014or just buy Dollar General \ufffc (DG) and Dollar Tree \ufffc (DLTR).\n\nIt\u2019s also more than the individual gross domestic product of Israel, Ireland, and Hong Kong.\n\nWith $400 billion, you could also stockpile about 181 billion regular gallons of gas, based on AAA\u2019s U.S. estimates. You could drive 5.79 trillion miles, if you averaged 32 miles per gallon. That would take you around the Earth 232.5 million times.\n\nIf you are into electric vehicles, $400 billion could get you 10.53 million of Tesla\u2019s basic 2020 Model 3. Of course, such a sale would cause price targets to soar. And Tesla would need a few more factories to turn out that many vehicles. The company only delivered about 90,000 vehicles in the second quarter.\n\nSource: Barron's",

        "selftext": "Hello there\n\nI posted about [6 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hn9ydm/defense_stocks_what_the_heck_is_going_on/) about defense being undervalued and they\u2019ve climbed 15-20% since then (besides HII which completely whiffed earnings) and I am now starting to see value in the oil sector(s). The June high and subsequent re-crash for oil industry coincided directly with the new covid case rate picking up. With covid cases declining and oil stocks generally trading in ranges for over a month now, I present my case for a break in those ranges\n\nThere are a couple of tailwinds that are happening right now for WTI:\n\n* New covid cases in the US have dropped substantially from their peak and are on a downtrend [according to JHU\u2019s data](https://i.imgur.com/EShb2sU.jpg). Globally, it seems to be seesawing in a confined range\n* [China is buying a large amount of US crude by September])https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-oil-exclusive/exclusive-china-ramps-up-u-s-oil-purchases-ahead-of-trade-deal-review-sources-idUSKCN25A2F4), potentially 37 million barrels [according to this](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-Charters-Tankers-For-37-Million-Barrels-Of-US-Oil.html)\n* After flooding the US market with [Saudi oil](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/850026351/saudi-arabias-oil-tanker-flotilla-is-reaching-the-u-s-despite-some-objections#:~:text=Live%20Sessions-,Saudi%20Arabia's%20Oil%20Tanker%20Flotilla%20Is%20Reaching%20The%20U.S.%2C%20Despite,are%20headed%20to%20the%20U.S.), they have now cut exports to a [record low ](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Saudi-Arabias-Crude-Oil-Exports-Dip-To-Record-Low-In-June.html)\n* The dual storms in the Gulf have caused a lot of [shut-ins](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-storms-energy/oil-firms-evacuate-staff-curb-offshore-production-ahead-of-twin-storms-idUSKBN25I0J3)\n* After stalling in July, air traffic is starting to [pick back up](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput) and routes are being added again, although still way way down\nWhich all support WTI prices in the coming weeks. Should be noted that rig counts have continued to lows, however last week was the first week in a long time that a few rigs came back online, which will add to the inventory. How much, I am not sure. You can see from [Baker Hughes\u2019 rig count]( https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-overview) that we added 10 rigs, but are still down a net of 662 rigs from last year. Next we can take a look at the [EIA data](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/) for some more insight into what current inventories are like:\n\n* 512M barrels of crude, 15% above average. Peak was 540M barrels on June 19th\n* 244M barrels of gasoline, 7% above average. Peak was before covid due to build over the winter\n* 178M barrels of distillates, 24% above average. Peak was 180M barrels on July 31st\n* Refinery inputs at 14.5M barrels, low was 12.4M barrels on May 13th \n* Refinery rates at 81%. At the low on April 22nd it was at 67%, normally around 95%.\n* WTI is trading in the $42-43 range, with the low being negative due to the contract rollover situation back in the Spring\n\nThe last several EIA reports have been good in general \u2013 drawing down of products, with two weeks in a row of fantastic gasoline draw down. \n\nWhat\u2019s my point here? The takeaway should be this: the worst is over. Now is the best chance for a while to get beaten up value stocks at a discount, as the industry recovers and conditions for the crash are resolving\n\nRight now cyclicals have been beaten down to Earth\u2019s core as tech goes up and up. Cyclicals and value generally outperform in a market recovery and I expect a rotation at some point, strengthened by a combination of inventory drops making headlines, covid cases going down, and a general resumption of normal. Any stimulus would be big news for these beaten down stocks as well\n\nWorried about a Democratic administration? Unlike the defense stocks I had previously looked at, I think it\u2019s a real issue for this industry. The Democratic platform calls out removing tax breaks for oil and gas companies while adding environmental regulations. It\u2019s weird that big tech has been climbing \u2013 companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook etc. that are known tax avoiders and privacy usurpers seem like prime candidates to have a \u2018tax bill fear\u2019 from the Dem\u2019s closing of tax avoidance legislation and future lawsuits. I haven\u2019t seen any hints of this in the market, so I am going to assume this is not considered a big deal by investors\n\nHowever, I still believe these low valuations are still too low, even with headwinds. Some of the majors have already been adjusting (Shell in particular) and refineries like Valero already have strong renewable fuels segments; Phillips 66 recently announced plans to build the [biggest renewable diesel refinery in the world](https://investor.phillips66.com/financial-information/news-releases/news-release-details/2020/Phillips-66-Plans-to-Transform-San-Francisco-Refinery-into-Worlds-Largest-Renewable-Fuels-Plant/default.aspx)\n\nWhat am I looking at in particular?\n\nRight now, refineries have the best value to me. PSX is **criminally** undervalued with a safe dividend. VLO is another that is set for strong performance. MPC has a strong position after its Speedway asset sale, but I would rank PSX&gt;VLO&gt;MPC at this point for value.\n\n* PSX target price: ~$82, sitting currently at ~$61\n* VLO target price: ~71-72, sitting currently at ~$52.50\n\nFrom a producer standpoint, CVX and COP are both fundamentally solid (I prefer COP at this point). RDS is the closest its been to it\u2019s covid low and is one of the leading majors in transitioning off oil. It\u2019s been beaten down since losing its dividend but I can only assume it will be back. I\u2019m not a fan of XOM going forward, but right now it\u2019s at the low of the range it\u2019s been confined in and wouldn\u2019t be a bad temporary pickup. FANG / EOG / PXD aren\u2019t bad pickups either\n\nPS \u2013 stay away from OXY. It\u2019s very clear they\u2019re going to continue to issue shares until they\u2019re through their debt and the pummeling is well deserved. It was popular for a while, not sure how it\u2019s still viewed, just stay away\n\nTLDR; buy refineries and the producers worth buying that aren't drowning in debt or have terrible assets\n\nDisclosure: I have a large position in PSX calls",

        "selftext": "Just got to thinking about all the money robinhood is skimming off the top, and the audacity of their name in light of this.\n\nOther firms report payment for order flow, at least on shares. TDA or Charles Schwab, for example are getting an average of about 1/10 of a cent per share... Robinhood doesn\u2019t post their data. \n\nThis is why Citadel and other huge trading firms pay more for robinhood orders, as there are no parameters publicly listed anywhere and they \u201cget away\u201d with taking more off the top. For shares, it can be a few cents.\n\n\u201cIf a customer buys 100 shares of Apple for $200 each\u2014a $20,000 purchase\u2014Robinhood could get up to $5.20 for routing that order to electronic-trading giant Citadel Securities LLC, according to calculations based on a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\n\nSchwab would be paid around 9 cents for sending the same order to Citadel, while TD Ameritrade would get 16 cents on average, according to these companies\u2019 SEC filings.\n\nThat\u2019s a nearly 60-to-1 difference between what Robinhood and Schwab are paid. The gap isn\u2019t always so wide, because of differences in the formulas used to determine the size of the payments. Still, Robinhood often makes much more for the same orders, the filings suggest.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/why-free-trading-on-robinhood-isnt-really-free-1541772001\n\nOptions data isn\u2019t available for TDA, Schwab, etc., but given the difference in share payment for order flow from Robinhood to electronic trading giant Citadel, would it surprise anyone they were also paying more for options? \n\nRobinhood likes to set quite a large bid-ask spread as the default for options with an easy button and number for a retail investor to click that is in the middle, further gouging inexperienced traders.\n\nBut besides that little trick, what about the prices that they show on the screen as the bid/ask.\n\nHow do the option prices compare in real time, bid / ask vs. other brokerages.\n\nI want to do more research.",

        "selftext": "I've dedicated a large percentage of my portfolio to renewable energy companies and have obtained some knowledge on the sector and specific companies in doing so. I've noticed a trend of people inquiring about these companies so I hope that this post can provide some information. \n\n---------------------------\n\nI'll provide a brief bullish thesis and some information about my investments in renewables. These are in order of weight in my portfolio. \n\n------------------------------\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nMost of us know what Tesla is about. They are the global leader in electric vehicles and will eventually come out with autonomous driving but I'll focus on their energy business. They sell solar panels with the lowest cost/watt of U.S. manufacturers, but this isn't the exciting part of their energy business. They are a leader in battery storage, which is an integral part of a renewable future. Energy storage systems store energy produced from solar panels and when the sun isn't shining, energy is consumed from the batteries instead. Also their autobidder software, which is out in trial in Massachusetts and Australia I believe, eventually will turn energy into a market place for Tesla customers. Read more about autobidder here: https://www.tesla.com/support/autobidder \n\nMy bull case for Tesla (specifically the energy side of the business) is that they will continue to innovate with their low cost panels, and be a leader in battery storage, plus leverage their autobidder software to bring added value to residential customers.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nVestas Wind Systems (VWDRY) \n\nhttps://www.vestas.com/~/media/vestas/investor/investor%20pdf/financial%20reports/2020/q2/2020%20q2_pres.pdf\n\nVestas is the leading manufacturer and installer of wind turbines. They have a global footprint and are expected to grow in line with the growth of the wind industry as a whole. A major growth engine in their business is going to be their expanding service and maintenance business, which has very high margins. My bull case for Vestas is that they are a unique pure play wind turbine company with years of experience in the growing industry. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR)\n\nFirst Solar is an American based solar module manufacturing and solar project operating company. Most of their business comes from corporate and grid level solar projects. Notably, they have Next Era Energy, Microsoft and Apple as customers. The real bullish case behind First Solar is around their differentiated Cadmium Telluride solar modules. Compared to the standard Crystalline silicon technology, First Solar's modules last longer and produce energy at higher efficiencies in hotter climates. \n\nMy bull case for First Solar is around their differentiated technology, strong balance sheet, and position as an American company, which typically warrants a higher P/E ratio than foreign countries. \n\n----------------------------------\n\nJinko Solar (JKS) \n\nhttps://ir.jinkosolar.com/static-files/5a6d9266-d288-4ece-a0ea-f8e49ff60119\n\nJinko Solar is a leader is a Chinese based solar panel manufacturer. They produce low cost modules and also manage solar projects. Their business model is similar to First Solar's, however they trade at a cheaper valuation, due to being a Chinese company. You can read more about their technology on their investor relations page, but my main bull case for this company is around their position in South East Asia as a leading manufacturer, as this is undoubtably the biggest potential market for solar energy. \n\n--------------------------\n\nCanadian Solar (CSIQ) \n\nhttp://investors.canadiansolar.com/events\n\nCanadian Solar is also a leader in the module manufacturing &amp; project development business. They have a similar business model with Jinko and First Solar. Canadian Solar owns equity stakes in several of their solar projects, which gives them a source of recurring revenue. They also have a large footprint in American grid/commercial systems and are a market leader in North America. \nThey trade at an absurdly low 5 P/E ratio despite significant growth expectations in the coming years. \n\nMy bull case for CSIQ is around their ability to dominate the current market and potential to capitalize off of further market growth and consolidation towards the biggest solar companies. Also their current valuation is very intriguing. \n\n--------------------------\n\nSolarEdge (SEDG) \n\nhttps://investors.solaredge.com/\n\nSolarEdge is the global leader in the Inverter space, with a 60% U.S. market share. For those who don't know, Inverter's turn the D.C. electrical current from the sun into an A.C. current, which is used by households. The inverter business is also much higher margin than the module (panel) business, due to there being fewer players in the industry. They are also expanding into energy storage and electric vehicle manufacturing. \n\nMy bull case around SolarEdge is around their market dominance in the Solar Inverter business, which will grow exponentially in the coming years plus future expansion in storage &amp; EVs. They have a very strong management team as well. \n\n--------------------------\n\nTPI composites (TPIC)\n\nhttps://ir.tpicomposites.com/download/companies/tpicomposites/Supplements/TPI%20Earnings%20Deck%202Q20.pdf\n\nTPI composites manufacturers wind blades and sells them to wind turbine companies. They have long term contracts with the top 5 non Chinese wind turbine companies (Vestas, GE, Siemens, Nordex &amp; Enercon.) 63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with a certain EV company that I can't mention on this subreddit apparently (DM if you want more info) to manufacture vehicle parts for them.\n\n-------------------\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH) \n\nhttps://investor.enphase.com/static-files/81902e59-7d61-4693-aa86-8d54e63975b9\n\nEnphase is the sole producer of Microinverters, which are smaller inverters that go on individual panels and provide a safer, more efficient, but more expensive solution than the standard string inverters. Microinverters are used in smaller solar systems, mostly residential. They also have an energy storage business that is just starting to scale. Enphase and SolarEdge are competitors in both of these spaces, and are expected to be major players in the future. Like SolarEdge, Enphases' inverter business is high margin and expects rapid future growth, as the residential solar market grows. \n\nMy bullish case around Enphase is around their Microinverter technology, potential for expansion into storage and unique Ensamble home energy management system (read about Ensamble on the Investor relations page). \n\n-----------------------\n\nBrookfield Renewables (BEPC)\n\nBrookfield Renewables owns and operates renewable energy systems and projects. They sell energy produced from such systems to utility companies and have a recurring revenue stream. They also pay a 3.73% dividend yield. Their investments are split relatively evenly between Hydroelectric, solar and wind. \n\nMy bullish thesis around BEPC is the consistent cash flow positive revenue stream and relative safety in the business model. Also, they provide be with exposure to hydroelectric energy. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nLet me know if you have any comments, hold, or plan to buy any of these companies!",

        "selftext": "At time of writing, GOOG market cap is $1.06T and other tech giants are much higher (AAPL is $2.01T, AMZN is $1.65T, MSFT is $1.61T). That gap feels large to me. Also, FB is valued at $760B with much lower revenue and decelerating growth, so its gap vs GOOG seems small. \n\nIs GOOG a good buy? Are these other companies just overvalued? Curious what you all think.  \nHere's my thinking:\n\n* GOOG has rock-solid fundamentals - excellent gross margins, has maintained \\~15%+ YoY revenue growth even at their scale, and search is a steady business with many entrypoints across the Google ecosystem\n* GOOG has bets across so many forward-looking industries that I think they will be able to diversify over time and don't have real risk of not continuing to innovate. There's of course the risk of anti-trust and privacy regulations, but that's been true for years now (although things do appear to be ratcheting up).\n* It seems their stock hasn't mooned during covid because a meaningful share of search volume (and subsequently search revenue) comes from brick-and-mortar businesses (as opposed to someone like FB, whose ads biz is more of an ecommerce/direct-to-consumer play), which puts a drag on their revenue. This was the main reason for their relatively weak Q2 earnings a couple weeks back.  \n\nDisclaimer: I own shares of every company mentioned here. Thanks for your input - I really enjoy this subreddit and have learned a lot from reading other posts.",

        "selftext": "Yes I know what you're thinking Autist, as you sit on your gaming chair sipping your choccy milk. \"I've seen all these \ud83d\udc3b posts before and stonks kept going up, printer goes BRRRRRR\"\n\nFundamentals haven't mattered for months, and except for some sharp pullbacks, NQ and SPY have all been on an absolute tear being instabid on every dip.\n\nThat's all about the change.\n\nTldr - bond market/ PM pricing in no deal on stimulus.\n- Bifurcation of NQ and SPY reached major tipping points.\n- DXY likely to bounce back strongly on risk off sentiment and foreign central bank action.\n- macro long term positioning for Inflation playing out across asset class correlations ( RUSSELL and value stocks starting to gain traction )\n\n1.\nPriced In has become a retarded meme at this point but what does it actually mean? It means basically that the market, chiefly big \ud83d\udcb0 / institutions are expecting a future outcome ( or probability of one) and have allocated money appropriately. Historically Fixed Income due to its relative size has been a fairly reliable indicator. Previous crashes this year such as Feb/March crash and the mini NQ/SPY crash in June and July were both foreshadowed by major/ high Vol shifts downwards in 10 year bond prices .\n\nCurrently 10 year are plumbing new lows at the bottom end of 0.50 percent ( discounting the March flash crash ). This coupled with the meteoric rise in GLD and SLV last night IS NOT A GOOD SIGN. The sharp changes occured directly after stimulus news. \n\nWhat this means is that Institutions are signalling a chance the package will not be passed on time or in its entirety . \n\nBUT BUT VIX IS DOWN AND EQUITIES ARE UPPIES!\nyes little autismo, they are but that doesn't mean what you think it does. it's a poorly kept secret that this market is being kept afloat by hedge funds , institutional buying and retail fomo. I don't have the crayons or time to explain it to you but just look at news releases, support level buying and virus/ trade talks pumps. institutional players left the market in February , now it's just algos and retail. Vix being low doesn't necessarily mean what you think it does either. To oversimplify VIX goes up when more people buy puts. This is typically done hedge against market drops. \nBig players don't need to hedge if they SOLD all/ most of their equity holdings and moved it into Bonds/ Gold / Foreign equity. Hedge funds are also notorious for shorting VIX as part of the 'Fed Put \" trade . The fact that FI/PM are up while VIX is down makes me more certain of a drop not less as it means Big boys are trying to pass as many bags as they can to retail without spooking them.\n\n2. There's been a lot of articles on this already so I'll keep it short, you all know how to use Google. SPY since March lows has been split in two like a sociopathic Solomon. There is the big 5 tech and everything else. Currently Big 5 is sitting at 25 percent of all market cap with huge returns over the last few months. This coupled with the performance differential of the other 495 has surpassed levels not seen since the dot com boom. THIS IS NOT SIGN OF A HEALTHY BULL MARKET. Major Bifurcation is the second best signifier of a \ud83d\udc3b after the technical 20 percent drop level ( which doesn't really mean much) . \ud83c\udf4f Has now become the largest company in the world surpassing Saudi Aramco. THIS TECH BOOM IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. Most of the apple gains have been from a one of WFH structural shift and Fiscal stimulus ( that now accounts for 25 percent of all disposable income ). If the stimulus bill doesn't pass, Apple is fucked. Just look at the AAPL gains from the last week, do you think this is sustainable?\n\nThe common retort on this sub is, \" we all know it's a bubble but it will pop in few months, I'm getting my TENDIES while they're hot! \"\n\nThis sentiment has been thrown around for months all through April to July. Well what if months later is now? What better catalyst for a bubble pop than a Stimulus not going through as planned? \n\n3. There's been a lot of posts about DXY dying and a lot of it is half true. Currencies are a hard thing to predict but I do want to point out two very key factors that are bullish for DXY. \n3a- The entire world, especially emerging markets rely on Dollar inflows from exports to fund imports for key goods, especially commodities (oil etc). Global trade fell off a cliff in March and has barely recovered so where are countries getting dollars? By buying bonds . This was the reason behind the DXY spike to over 100 in March and the reason why the FX central bank swap program was instituted by JPOW. So unless you see global trade rebounding strongly in the very near term ( pigs will fly ) bonds will continue to be bid extremely strongly at auction, supporting DXY. \n\n3b) DXY as has been pointed out is primarily dropping due to Euro strength ( which makes up about 65 percent of the Index). When DXY is compared to the Bloomberg trade weighted dollar index you'll see it hasn't dropped far at all and this makes sense (see 3a above). The Euro bullish trend, along with AUD/USD,GBP/USD and JPY/USD is unlikely to continue much further. Foreign central banks and governments for that matter will not allow the dollar to crater. We've already seen rumblings from the EU and JPY on this front as exports are already in a tenuous position. The last thing foreign companies need is a strong currency to hamper export sales. So I wouldn't bet against the FED, but I sure as shit wouldn't be getting against the ECB.\n\nSummary: I don't see this stimulus playing out on time or in full. Big money is pricing in either a delay or being scaled back substantially to meet Republican demands. I won't go into the specifics of the political theatre because quite frankly it doesn't matter. PM/ BONDS are are all the signalling device you need.\n\nHow I see this playing out: The stimulus bill will pass on few weeks after a substantial Rug pull, similar to the 2008 TARP fiasco. I would strongly recommend either holding cash or going long DXY while this plays out. Either buy the dip on GLD/SLV with leaps or go long TLT at like 180c.\n\nPositions : short MNQ 3 units at 10530 and 1 ES at 3220. Yeah got in a little early, wasn't expecting the tech earnings blowout but have the margin to hold. \n\nLooking at GLD leaps for 06/21 300c when we get a pullback ( due to margin calls ).",

        "selftext": "Feeling really dumb and depressed this morning as I was margin called for 380k. Hoping for some advice. Here\u2019s the story:\n\n1) Sold 10x AAPL 375c 21Aug20 \n2) Bought 10x AAPL 380c 21Aug20\nThe credit spread was about $3,000 at the time (mid-July), and max loss therefore should have been $2,000. \n\nI believe the short position was ITM, and long was ATM at the time, although this is irrelevant. \n\nThis morning I received an email saying my short position was exercised (fuck me, I didn\u2019t realize ex-div for AAPL was today). I\u2019m assuming they exercised it yesterday to qualify for the upcoming dividend. My broker (Questrade in Canada) did nothing with my long position, so I\u2019ve gone from a max loss of $2,000 to a much steeper one. I don\u2019t know what to do.. \n\nQuestrade rep convinced me to exercise my long position and sell the shares upon receipt. However, the share price has dropped $10 already today, so my loss has likely gone from $2,000 to $12,000 and could get worse if this drop continues. I submitted the request to exercise the calls and I\u2019m waiting for the shares. \n\nI entered this trade assuming my max loss would be $2,000. I thought questrade would require direction for the long position, cause I don\u2019t have 380k to cover in my account. \n\nTLDR; entered what I thought was a covered credit position, to later be naked and forced into to a $380,000 long position.",

        "selftext": "You\u2019ve probably seen a rising trend of bullish posts about Nvidia recently, whether it\u2019s about recent acquisitions being included in revenue, its management, or the semiconductor industry in general.\n\nYesterday, Evening Standard reported that $NVDA has locked in a takeover of Arm Ltd. from SoftBank for a reported 40 billion.\n\nThe reason this is important is that Arm owns instructions-set architectures (ISAs) for the chips within nearly every smartphone, along with a handful of other products. Usually, this isn\u2019t an issue, since SoftBank would sell the rights to produce these chips to Apple, Qualcomm, and others for a fee. \n\n$NVDA, unlike SoftBank, is an actual semiconductor company. They could potentially limit access to their ISAs so that $NVDA can become the sole producer of those chips. Or, due to SoftBank being in the sinosphere and $NVDA being American, potential tensions could arise from the recent economic sanctions.\n\nEither way, considering that the deal is essentially locked in, $NVDA is flying straight to tendie town. Arm is a powerful player in the semiconductor industry, and its acquisition by $NVDA demonstrates that the company is making big moves to become more prevalent. $NVDA could theoretically lockdown a subsector of the semiconductor market by restricting access to chips under Arm\u2019s ISA. And if the Don requests $NVDA restrict Chinese access to the ISAs, you can bet that it will get a fucking BOATLOAD of government subsidies.\n\nTL;DR $NVDA 520c 9/18",

        "selftext": "\\#Introduction\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi all, it's your friendly neighborhood Tatar Sauce here with the first episode of my Options series. My hope is to help some of you autistic fucks to not blow up your accounts and learn to manage risk better. Each week I will be touching on a new topic that will hopefully help some of you understand the intricacies of options trading, with each lesson building upon previous lessons. Some topics will include different options strategies, risk/reward balance, and the psychology of trading. If you want me to touch on a particular topic, leave a comment below. If you want to call me a retard, leave a comment below.\n\nI do not sell a program or anything like that, I'm just a dude that loves trading and managing an account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo lets get into it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine you just read some retarded DD on WSB. You're convinced that OP has shown you the way to Tendie Town, and all thats left for you to do is hop on your PRPL mattress, punch in a few coordinates, go to bed and wake up swimming in a sea of hunny mussy. Like most retards on this sub, you probably have a loose understanding of the Greeks and don't know the difference between a horizontal spread and that gesture your wife does when you invite your buddy C-Note over for poker. So what are your options? Naked calls baby!\n\nWell, I'm here to tell you that while naked calls do have a time and a place, it shouldn't be your go to. If you were one of the autistic fucks posting loss porn because you bought a bunch of naked calls on PRPL, you need this more than anyone. So buckle up, grab a whisky, and let ME lead you to Tendie Town (no mattress required).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#**So what do I do now?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVertical spreads baby. Next week we will dive deep into why vertical spreads offer a better risk/reward profile, but first we need to understand the Greeks and what they mean for your option contract. So lets dig in.  \n\n\n\\#**Delta**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Contrary to popular belief, delta does NOT mean the percent chance your option will expire ITM.** Delta is simply the amount of money your contract will move in accordance to every dollar the underling moves. In other words, if you bought your call for $2.00 with a .3 delta. and the price moves up $1, it is now worth $2.30. Conversely, if it moves down $1, it is worth $1.70. This is a simplistic way of looking at it, as other things can affect delta such as fundamentals and volatility, but that is what it means.  \n\n\nDelta is affected most by how close the strike price is to the current price of the underling. Farther OTM options have less delta, farther ITM options have more, and ATM is typically around .5. Delta is not heavily affected by DTE. Knowing delta is important in measuring risk/reward because it will tell you how much the value the option will move for or against you as the underling moves.  \n\n\n**#Gamma**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If delta is the speed in which the price moves, gamma is the acceleration.** What gamma measures is how much delta changes after each subsequent dollar change. Here is an example to illustrate:  \n\n\n\\&gt; Buy option XYZ 50c with .3 delta and .01 gamma for $2.00\n\n\\&gt; Price moves up $1\n\n\\&gt; Call is worth $2.30, new delta value is now .31\n\n(Now lets say gamma was .15)\n\n\\&gt; Buy option XYZ 50c with .3 delta and .15 gamma for $2.00\n\n\\&gt; Price moves up another $1\n\n\\&gt; Call is worth $2.30, new delta is .45\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy example is again a simplistic way of looking at it, but don't miss the point- gamma will accelerate the price change in your option as the underling changes and is a important factor in determining risk/reward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnlike delta, gamma is heavily affected by DTE, and gamma increases by a lot as you get closer to expiry, and is much smaller the farther out you buy. It is not affected heavily by how ITM or OTM the option is (although there is a slight increase the closer you get to ATM).  \n\n\nThink of FD's as purchasing gamma, where a large move in your favor will yield exponential returns.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**#Theta**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Think of theta as the amount of money you have to spend per day to hold the contract, or the amount you get paid per day to sell one.** I like to think of theta as \"how much money I will lose per day if the underling trades sideways.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheta is increased as you get closer to your expiry date. At about 30 DTE, theta begins to accelerate  faster. ATM strikes tend to have the most theta, where ITM strikes have enough intrinsic value that they arent affected as much and OTM strikes go for less premium so there is less value to eat.  \n\n\nI don't think you autistic fucks are dumb enough to need an example for this one. Most of you hold your contracts too long and know what theta burn is. NEXT!  \n\n\n**#Vega**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Vega is the amount the underling moves in response to a 1% change in IV.** This is the reason behind the term \"IV crush.\" Vega is greater the farther out you purchase your option, and greater the closer it is to being ATM (while OTM options have a slightly higher vega than ITM, it's not by much).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cannot stress this enough, **look at the vega and IV rank of the options you are buying if you want to play earnings!**  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIV rank takes the past 52 weeks of IV for the ticker and tells you what percentile its current IV is at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHigh IV rank and vega is inherently more risky REGARDLESS of what the underling does! I'm tired of seeing you retards weeble wobble your way through posts asking why the fuck your option went down when the price moved in your favor. It's because you're retarded and don't know what you're doing.  \n\n\nHowever, vega can play in your favor if volatility increases. This can be a shrewd play if you catch a ticker a couple weeks before earning.  \n\n\n**#What about Rho?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRho stands for red-headed orphan. Nobody cares about rho.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**#The different type of plays you can make using the Greeks**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Believe it or not, there are more ways to play with options then \"hurr durr stonks go up.\"** Here are a few things you can do to leverage yourself and use each Greek to your advantage:  \n\n\nDelta: Purchasing delta is similar exposure to purchasing 100 shares of the underling, but for far less money and risk. It can be a great way to leverage yourself if you are looking to purchase the shares anyway and are okay paying the extra premium for the increased gains. IMO, this is a boomer play that someone makes if they don't want to tie up the capital short term but want the option to exercise long term. For example, AAPL 400c 1/15/21 goes for \\~$111. That is about 1/5 less money then purchasing 100 shares today and AAPL only has to go up like 13 bucks to break even. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGamma: Purchasing gamma is the thought behind an FD. Low risk, high reward, low chance of profit. The WSB special. I will try to get a day trade in every now and then if I see an opportunity, where I put a tight stop loss on and let it ride. **If you do this, look at the theta and set your stop loss at least that distance away from your purchase price so you don't get stopped out due to theta burn.**  \n\n\nTheta: You don't buy theta. You sell theta. Join r/thetagang for more info.  \n\n\nVega:  If you want to play the volatility of a stock, consider buying or selling vega. Some people use straddles a few weeks before earnings and capitalize on the increased volatility to increase their odds of success when they might not be sure how the market will respond to the earnings. Keep in mind that you will have to put up more premium for farther out DTE options, but if volatility goes up you would be surprised how much it will make your options move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo thats that. Learning the Greeks and learning what you're buying will help keep you from making a lot of rookie mistakes. Next week, I'm going to talk about spreads and why they offer a better risk/reward profile then naked options.  \n\n\n**TLDR:** Stop gambling and start trading.  \n\n\n**Positions:** DKNG 33/34/38/39 Iron Condor 8/28 - PENN 54p 8/28 - VXX 25/26c 8/28 Debit - AAPL 500/520c 9/4 Debit - RKT 27c 9/18 - RKT 26/30c 9/18 Debit - XRX 22c 9/18 - MU 42.5/47.5c 9/18 Debit - AAPL 560/580c 9/18 Debit - SPY 330/320p 9/25 Debit",

        "selftext": "Is Microsoft the best stock of all-time? Back in the 90s, it used to be  known as the millionaire stock with how many Microsoft investors and  employees saw their wealth rise on the back of the company\u2019s fortunes. The shares have split 9 times. And the company is currently the second most valuable in the world. If you invested $1,000 in the Microsoft IPO  in 1986, today it\u2019d be worth $2,130,200 \u2013 that\u2019s a total return of  212,920%, or 25% annualized returns *every year for the past 34 years*. By comparison, $1,000 invested in the Apple IPO would be worth $1,262,380 today.\u00a0\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s  dominance in PC software was so absolute by the late 1990s that the US  Government opened antitrust proceedings in 2001 and tried to break up  the company. Yet only a decade later, Microsoft had largely been  surpassed by Apple and Google. No longer did tech executives and  business schools point to IBM as the poster child for corporate  stagnation and loss of commanding market share. It was now Microsoft.\u00a0\n\n7  years ago, Microsoft was such an afterthought that the now-famous FAANG  moniker conspicuously excludes the Redmond giant despite Microsoft  outperforming both Google and Facebook in the time since (and until  Apple\u2019s near-30% rise the past month, Apple as well). So how did we get  here?\u00a0\n\nThe [journey](https://blackjacketco.com/f/featured-flashback-how-microsoft-rose-and-fell-then-rose-again) \u2013 summarized below \u2013 revisits the mania surrounding the launch of Windows 95, an  investment that saved Apple from bankruptcy, a series of failed  acquisitions and product launches, and the rebirth of Microsoft under  current CEO Satya Nadella.\u00a0\n\n **BASIC beginnings to PC Powerhouse (1980s to 2001)** \n\n* In 1980, IBM \u2013 the world\u2019s largest computer manufacturer at the time \u2013  approached Microsoft with an offer to license an operating system for  their soon-to-be-released IBM PC. When Microsoft received the contract,  they hadn\u2019t yet built the operating system. They actually had to  purchase a Seattle-based company called QDOS to help build the original  MS-DOS system that Microsoft eventually licensed to IBM.\n* As part of the deal, Microsoft insisted that MS-DOS be non-exclusive to  IBM. IBM thought the future of the PC was hardware. Not anticipating  companies like Compaq would be able to legally reverse-engineer their  PC, Big Blue agreed to the terms. And it was the ability of Microsoft to  bundle MS-DOS with the various competing PCs that transformed the  company into the go-to operating system provider for nearly every PC on  the market. By the close of the decade, Microsoft\u2019s stock had already  risen over 500% since its IPO.\u00a0\n* MS-DOS was only a text-based system though, and Microsoft soon began to  work on a fully graphical interface, including desktop navigation and  icons, as part of a new operating system that would come to be known as  Windows. Windows completely changed the game for the PC, making it much  more user friendly and accessible for everyday consumers. By 1995,  Windows was so synonymous with the PC that customers lined up around the  block at midnight to try and get their hands on the Windows 95 release.  The Empire State Building was even lit up in Microsoft colors to mark  the occasion.\u00a0\n* In 1997,  Windows 95 and the Microsoft family of operating systems held a  commanding 86.3% PC market share. In contrast to Microsoft, Apple was on  the verge of bankruptcy that year. Following an emergency investment of  $150mn from Microsoft, Bill Gates appeared live-on screen at an Apple  event with Steven Jobs to announce the agreement. He was promptly  booed.\u00a0\n\n**Complacency, Stagnation, and Decline (2001-2014)**\n\n* While it\u2019s hard to point to a single factor that caused Microsoft to  lose its way, the company became obsessed with propping up Windows as it  was the company\u2019s major cash cow. New products were only deemed viable  if they augmented Windows or were backward-compatible. Ultimately, this  narrow focus on Windows left Microsoft over-exposed to the PC market at a  time when new trends were starting to emerge in computing and digital  services.\u00a0\n* On December 29,  1999, Microsoft hit a split-adjusted all-time high of nearly $120 per  share. A little over two weeks later, Bill Gates stepped down as CEO and  Steven Ballmer ascended to lead the company. Under Ballmer, Microsoft  employees repeatedly identified promising technologies, like e-readers  and mobile software, only to see those projects pushed aside because  they didn't revolve around Windows. Microsoft had an e-reader prototype  as early as 1998, developed a mobile operating system called Windows CE,  and worked on a smartphone-type device all the way back in 2000.  Despite a multi-year head start in these areas, Microsoft never found  success.\u00a0\n* Apple released the  first iPod in 2001, but it took until 2006 for Microsoft to release the  rival Zune. And in a sign of how far ahead Apple now was at that point,  only two months later Steve Jobs revealed an integrated music player and  internet-capable phone called the iPhone. The Zune was a complete  disaster, and in 2009, Apple had a 71% share of the MP3 player market.\u00a0\n* Microsoft also completely missed the mark on search. In 2004, an  upstart Google had been poaching talented developers \u2013 as well as some  senior executives \u2013 from Microsoft for a couple years. In response,  Ballmer ordered the company to start prioritizing search. Although  Microsoft had several previous iterations of a search platform, the  company didn\u2019t launch Bing until May 2009. Over the next 3 years Bing  lost $6bn, and a failed acquisition of advertising company aQuantive in  an attempt to jump-start search led to a $6.2bn write-down and the  company\u2019s first-ever quarterly loss in 2012.\u00a0\n* After the introduction of the iPhone, Ballmer famously said: \u201cNo chance  that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.\u201d Yet as  PC sales plateaued then declined and the mobile market was quickly  becoming the future, Microsoft\u2019s inability to develop a mobile strategy  or a competing product became the embodiment of the company\u2019s failure to  perceive market trends and remain relevant beyond the PC. Although  Ballmer tried to get Microsoft into the game by purchasing Nokia\u2019s  mobile phone division in 2013, the company never got above 3.6% market  share. And in 2015, Microsoft wrote off the whole acquisition for  $7.5bn. \u00a0\n\n**Nadella and the Rise of Azure (2014-Present)**\n\n* One of Nadella\u2019s first and most important moves after taking the helm  was to finally recognize that Windows could no longer drive the future  of Microsoft. Instead, he made it a corporate priority to go all-in on  the cloud at the exact time when enterprise IT spend was starting to  show a real demand for cloud computing capabilities.\u00a0\n* He also greatly changed the culture. Under Gates and Ballmer, Microsoft  was the epitome of anti-competitive. Rather than work with other  companies in the PC and software businesses, they used Microsoft\u2019s  dominant position in both operating system and web browsing to squeeze  rivals or eliminate them altogether. Nadella forced Microsoft to open,  to seek out partnerships, and to even prioritize its iOS or Android  mobile software offerings to the detriment of the now defunct Windows  phone.\u00a0\n* Today, Linux is about  as widely used on Azure as Windows is. And this corporate strategy has  led companies to seek out Microsoft\u2019s cloud offerings as Amazon  increasingly expands into more and more industries to disrupt. Microsoft  also repackaged its enterprise and productivity tools into  subscription-based products rather than costly one-time downloads or  annual license fees.\u00a0\n* The new  Microsoft strategy has empowered developers and engineers to pursue  innovation in the exact opposite way that occurred under Ballmer. And  the company has developed a more customer-centric approach to developing  software that has resulted in a suite of bundled enterprise resource  products, such as Dynamics 365, that have made the entire Office 365  SaaS offering that much more compelling for large corporations.\u00a0\n* The most crucial driver in the Microsoft turnaround has been the  hyper-growth of the company\u2019s Iaas and PaaS platform Azure. As much  credit as Azure receives now, back in 2015 and 2016, Amazon AWS was  largely considered the undisputed king of the cloud. Articles would  frequently cite how AWS was bigger than Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and  Google combined. Following years of 75-100% growth rates, however, Azure  is now firmly in peer status alongside AWS. This is no better evidenced  than by Microsoft\u2019s $10bn contract win over Amazon for the DoD JEDI  contract last year.\u00a0\n* Although  Azure growth is slowing, as of July 2020 AWS has 31% market share versus  20% for Azure \u2013 an amazing turnaround. And despite the disproportionate  attention given to the AWS/Azure as the \u201ccloud\u201d, Microsoft\u2019s place as  the leader of enterprise SaaS means that the company actually generates  more quarterly revenues ($14.3bn) from the cloud relative to Amazon  ($10.8bn).\u00a0\n\nWhen Nadella first took over, Microsoft\u2019s market cap sat around $300bn. Today, it\u2019s $1.6tn.\u00a0\n\n*You can find me on Twitter* [@BlackjacketCo](https://twitter.com/BlackjacketCo) *where I write about emerging technologies and long-term market trends.

        "selftext": "It only takes ten 100% investments to get from $1000 to $1,000,000\n\nI see a lot of people posting calls on here. Calls are the types of posts that do well on this site. WSB is all about %1000 trades, and a %100 trade likely isn't gonna get much attention. Consistent 100% trades will however, get you rich. A poll from a while back showed that a lot of the users on here having been trading for less than 6 months, and likely don't know much about spreads. I'm also pretty new to this. \n\n\nA 2000c 9/11 costs $14,000. Can't afford a Tesla call? A 2000/2100 9/11 spread costs $4000 and can make you $6000. \n\n\nTake AAPL, what are the odds that apple goes up $5 on any given month? I mean it's not guaranteed of course, but it's pretty fucking likely.\n\nIt currently trades for 469. A 470/475 spread for September 4th costs $205 right now. Plug this spread into optionsprofitcalculator.com, and you'll see that if AAPL is 475 or higher at the end of the day on September 4th, you'll make a 144% profit.\n\n$205 is accessible to just about anyone, and you can always buy more spreads if you can afford to. I get that there is a stock split, and apple will likely go up by more than just $5 by September 4th, but you can do this $5 spread over and over for a ~likely~ 144% gain everytime.\n\nA $475 call for Sept 4 by itself costs about $1200. You could buy 6 spreads with the same amount. %144 of 1200 is $1728. In order to make that same amount of money with a call, AAPL would have to go up by at least $15. The beauty of the spread is that you're only betting AAPL will go up by $5. \n\nAs long as you pick a stock with relatively consistent small growth you can make a killing with lots of trades betting on small swings.\n\n\nTLDR: debit call spreads make more money than you think. Buy AAPL 470c 9/4, sell AAPL 480c 9/4. 144% return (almost) guaranteed. Rinse and repeat just $5 otm. Can double your money every 3 weeks.",

        "selftext": "Ok, so you know how Apple has been mooning on news of the iPhone 12, and ARM MacBooks, which has totally screwed over INTC and made TSM and other suppliers to AAPL moon?\n\n(Here's the background info in case you missed the news [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS52JigV1CY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS52JigV1CY))\n\nApple was actually approached by Softbank to buy ARM but they couldn't due to ARM licensing stuff out to competitors as well, and Apple obviously has a very private philosophy too so that wouldn't work. But, they will continue to use chipsets based on ARM's architecture for the future macbooks/iphones as well ([https://wccftech.com/apple-shows-disinterest-in-buying-arm-from-softbank/](https://wccftech.com/apple-shows-disinterest-in-buying-arm-from-softbank/)). But if you just follow the money, and try to find out who actually will OWN ARM, the offer has come from none other than Nvidia, and the deal to buy ARM is all but confirmed. (seeck ingalpha.com/article/4370499-chippening-part-2-nvidia-reaches-for-outstretched-arm). And I'm sure that most of you are aware of how AAPL is trying to expand its reach into countries like India for the first time offering first-party stores and an online store, etc. This will only increase their sales numbers, and Apple will only get more bullet proof from hereon. The real story here, is in NVDA.\n\nWhen they do end up buying ARM, the merger will either be seen as A.) a value destroying buy that wasn't worth it or B.) A merger of epic proportions that inserts Nvidia into the mobile and CPU market \"Apple recently indicated it would change their use of Intel chips in Mac computers to custom made ARM-based chips. This is likely due to the desire to include a touch screen and also due to the general efficiency of the design as well as ARM's licensing of its IP to Apple. This could be the start of a major transition for chip usage among desktop computers. Moreover, this technology appears to be competitive for use in data-centers markets.\n\nNVIDIA is not currently a major competitor in the smartphone and tablet business, so acquiring ARM would expand it into new realms where ARM happens to dominate. NVIDIA did previously attempt to compete in this business, but its Tegra chips never got much market share.\"\n\nMost of you already know how durable Nvidia is, but for those of you that don't I'll leave you with these too: Nvidia's R&amp;D expense/gross profit is surprisingly low due to multiple income streams, and although it is increasing (as expected) we can expect gross profits to massively increase too with the world's largest company as its customer. Their Cash per share has grown insanely :\n\nCash Per Share ratio\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3wz4otn79j51.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=501e51a371f0d4ab402a8500a03e14b6e31f86d3\n\nAnd they have low long term debt that has barely increased, but their assets have remarkably increased, which means a low lt debt/asset ratio, just showing you how much of a powerhouse NVDA is.\n\nLT debt/total assets\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0hg0zqmo79j51.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2862927faff7933cf9600ae20f76455de0a47ee\n\nNot only that, but along with decreasing/flatlining long term debt, they have a negative cash conversion cycle, which greatly reduces opex. Financially, this is only the beginning of their buildup. Aside from just solid financials for such a revolutionary company, they have revolutionary products. Their cloud services and acquisition of Mellanox will only expand their bases. Nvidia has a vision, and it may be very far-out and hard to accomplish or it may be the most genius thing I've ever seen. I'm not sure how long this'll take to work itself out, but I wouldn't fear buying March 2021 740 calls.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been making YouTube tech reviews and videos on Apple products for the past 4 years. Currently making videos for the Max Tech YouTube channel. \n\nThis is going to be the most important positive change for Apple ever since I started. You literally have no idea. \n\n\u2014 The iPhone 12 is getting released with the A14 chip that will be so much more powerful than the Qualcomm chip in android phones that they won\u2019t be able to catch up for years. (The new 865 plus is hardly faster than last year\u2019s overpriced 865) \n\n\u2014 this will be achieved by using TSMC\u2019s brand new 5nm technology which is gonna be more powerful and more power efficient than people are expecting. \n\n\u2014 TSMC is already working on their 3nm tech that will be going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\n\u2014 they are gonna implement 5G across their iPhone lineup without raising the prices crazy high like other brands like Samsung are forced to do right now. \n\n\u2014 leaks have shown that the iPhone 12 pro will come with the widely requested 120Hz display and insane camera recording features (4K at 240fps) \n\n\u2014 their Apple silicon chip Macs are gonna be so good and so powerful using TSMC\u2019s 5nm tech that people\u2019s minds will be blown. The new features and battery life are gonna be game changers. \n\n\u2014 the transition period to ARM-based chips will be much smoother than people are expecting. \n\n\u2014 these Macs will likely also have models with support for 5G cellular. \n\n\u2014 their new iPads are gonna start getting redesigned with a modern design for the first time in years. While the android tablets aren\u2019t getting much better. Huge demand upswing. \n\n\u2014 the Apple Watch is gonna support more sensors and features than ever before, and they\u2019re gonna release a brand new budget model for the first time. \n\n\u2014 Apple is gonna release their brand new services bundles which are gonna be very popular, and we all know that services are where the money is at. \n\n\u2014 Apple is gonna release a new Apple TV which will begin to get marketed as a gaming console. They\u2019ll release a new gaming controller at the same time that will work across all of their Apple devices including the iPhone. \n\n\u2014 Apple will release a HomePod mini to better compete with the Amazon echo and push their Apple Music sales. \n\n\u2014 Apple is gonna begin to switch most of their devices to Mini-LED displays on their devices which will be almost as good as OLED without all of the drawbacks. \n\n\u2014 The stock split is gonna allow a bunch of new investors to get in after they realize all of this is happening. \n\nThose are just a few of the reasons why Apple has even more room to grow within the next year. -Vadim from the Max Tech channel on YouTube. \n\nPositions: wait for correction and dip after stock split. Go long on AAPL if you can afford January calls. \nAlso: $TSM 100c 1/15/21",

        "selftext": "Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google. These companies have one thing in common - their market cap is above $1 Trillion. They're all fairly diversified, some more some less but they certainly don't rely on one single product to exist. It's actually basically impossible to open a business nowadays without having to do with at least one of these companies. I realize that just 15 years ago the top 4 companies by market cap were very different ones and historically things have always changed, especially in tech. This time feels different though. Regulators are sleeping and politicians don't understand these companies. On top of that China is getting more and more powerful so it's questionable if there's even political interest in holding back the tech giants. Whenever competition emerges they can just kill it with money either by simply buying the competition or making the own product superior. On top of that their products have long lasting lock in effects. For the business side it's very expensive to move away from them and your average user hates having to get used to something new. As long as something \"just works\" people don't change for minor benefit and it feels like these companies have gotten strong enough to ensure that nobody else is ever offering something vastly superior.\n\nAs much as the past has shown otherwise, I don't see a world in which Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google are not at all at least top 10 in market cap 20 years from now.\n\nAt this point why even bother with anything else and not go all in on them?",

        "selftext": "I am in my twenties and like many \"new\" investors became very interested in the market as a result of the economic downturn brought on by COVID-19. I saw a lot of my peers on Twitter and FaceBook making decent gains and it really piqued my interest because I have been saving roughly 4k per month in a high interest savings account and not really doing much else with it. I always thought the market to be too risky for my taste but after becoming comfortable with my base savings, I was ready to start my own journey into investing. I am not really the kind of person to go off of word of mouth so I set out to learn as much as I could on my own through reading and online courses. I took a course on the basics of the stock market on Udemy which mainly covered fundamental analysis but touched on the technical side of things as well. In addition to this I took a more in depth course on just technical analysis which covered trend lines, candlestick patterns etc ... I didn't find it too helpful for long term investments but it still seemed interesting. Lastly I read the Intelligent Investor as well as One Up on WallStreet and a book on basic accounting to help me understand how to decipher what I was seeing on these annual reports and what all of the numbers meant when I was attempting to valuate a potential purchase .... as well as various YouTube courses and tutorials\n\nAll of this has occurred over the course of the past 3 months, so while I have become a little more knowledgeable than most of my friends just blindly throwing money into the market, I still don't feel very confident in my newly developed skills because .... well, they are new and I haven't had enough experience. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME AND MY JOURNEY INTO THE STOCK MARKET, SKIP TO HERE:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that being said, I have been seeing a lot of talk about this 4:1 Apple split that is coming up and while I understand that this doesn't change the company fundamentally at all, I really can't seem to see why Apple is trading for what it is ... or more importantly, why so many analysts are rating it as a \"buy\". I know that Graham specifically warns against needing validation from \"professionals\" for your decision making but since I am still really a newbie, I wanted to know if there is something I am missing in forming my opinion that the stock is severely overvalued. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is how I arrived at this conclusion: \n\n**Point 1:** \n\nIn my opinion, Apple is nothing more than a 1 dimensional hardware company. When you look at the annual report for FY 19' the revenue stemmed from the following: \n\n* iPhone Sales: 54.7%\n* Services: 17.8%\n* Mac: 9.9%\n* Wearables, Home, &amp; Accessories: 9.4%\n* iPad: 8.2%\n\nOut of all of these things, the only one that is not hardware is services which means that 82.2% of the sales come from hardware alone ... mainly iPhone. \n\nFurthermore, if you look at what exactly makes up this \"services\" category you will see that it is Apple Music, Apple Care, iCloud, App Store Subscriptions, and also baked in there is the free version of iCloud, Maps, and Siri. \n\nNow, while I respect apple for growing this particular vertical (services) of its company which has experienced some good growth over the last few years\n\n2017: $32,700M in sales\n\n2018: $39,748M in sales (increase of 21.55%)\n\n2019: $46,291M in sales (increase of 16.46%)\n\nI can't help but also realize how closely coupled the services vertical is to the hardware vertical. Mostly all of the services Apple provides depend on the successful sale of its hardware. I can speak personally that I cancelled Apple Music in 2017 for Spotify because I switched jobs (software engineer) to a position that required me to work in a secure environment where I couldn't bring in my phone and since Apple Music had no web app, I couldn't listen to music and code while at work. This makes me weary of their services business as a whole because if for some reason the hardware becomes less popular then the services will suffer severely it seems ... you don't really need Apple Music without an iPhone .... and you aren't really paying for app store subscriptions if you don't have an iPhone or Mac ... and you also don't need Apple Care without an Apple Device, see where I am heading? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niPhone sales are plateauing which can be seen by the data leading up to 2018 as well as the official announcement from Apple that they would stop providing exact numbers on the numbers of units sold at the end of 2018.  Data: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/276306/global-apple-iphone-sales-since-fiscal-year-2007/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276306/global-apple-iphone-sales-since-fiscal-year-2007/)\n\nIn addition to iPhone sales slowing up ... PC sales have been declining across the board for a while due to the fact that handhelds have become increasingly more powerful, this has also resulted in the plateauing of Mac sales as well. Data: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/276308/global-apple-mac-sales-since-fiscal-year-2002/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276308/global-apple-mac-sales-since-fiscal-year-2002/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI say all of this to point out that for a company that is getting 82% of its sales from hardware, the hardware growth seems to be slowing down tremendously and the services market that it seems to be  shifting into seems largely dependent on the hardware, which seems concerning to say the least. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Point 2:** \n\nApple does not appear to either be a growth stock or a value stock in the current climate. Don't get me wrong, I think Apple is pretty good company as a whole and they appear to clearly be financially stable  even despite the declining hardware sales ... but at this price they are far from a \"value\" stock and from a financial perspective, they don't seem to be a \"growth\" stock either. \n\nWhen you look at net income for the past 5 years you will notice that it hasn't really changed too much, when comparing the most recent annual report with the one from 5 years ago the net income has only increased by 3.5% which doesn't even take into account inflation which in actuality would make it seem like the net income for FY 19' was actually less than what was earned in FY 15'\n\n2015: $53.39B\n\n2016: $45.69B\n\n2017: $48.35B\n\n2018: $59.53B\n\n2019:  $55.26B\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, what seems funky to me is that the EPS actually seems to be increasing over time ... but it is not due to the net income rising, it is due to the fact that Apple has been buying back stock each year thus decreasing the total number of shares outstanding from 5.75B in 2015 to 4.62B in 2019, a decrease of 19.65% over the past 5 years ... this makes the EPS seem higher and the P/E seem lower, making the stock seem more valuable than it actually is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SHARES OUTSTANDING:** \n\n2015: 5.75B\n\n2016: 5.47B (-4.87%)\n\n2017: 5.22B (-4.57%)\n\n2018: 4.96B (-4.98%)\n\n2019: 4.62B (-6.85%)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2015 - 2019 Change: - 19.65%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EPS (as is in annual report):**\n\n2015: $9.28\n\n2016: $8.35 (-10.02%)\n\n2017: $9.27 (+11.02%)\n\n2018: $12.01 (+29.56%)\n\n2019:  $11.97 (-0.37%)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2015 - 2019 Change: +28.99%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EPS (based on consistent shares outstanding of 5.75B across all years)**\n\n2015: $9.28\n\n2016: $7.94 (-14.44%)\n\n2017: $8.40 (+5.79%)\n\n2018: $10.35 (+23.21%)\n\n2019:  $9.61 (-7.15%)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2015 - 2019 Change: +3.56%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen if we use each 2019 EPS to calculate the P/E based on todays closing price of $452.04\n\n**P/E TTM as is:** $37.76\n\n**P/E TTM adjusted based on consistent shares outstanding:** $47.04\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot really sure if I am even allowed to make an adjusted calculation based on what if they never brought back the shares but nonetheless here it is .... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Point 3:**\n\nThis is purely speculation which is against the rules, I know .... but I can't help but think consumer psychology has to play a role in the market.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that consumers don't really know what they want until it is presented to them, iPhone has dominated the market for what seems like forever but in actuality, it has really only been about a decade. iPhone 4 was the real game changer since it allowed people to get their hands on an iPhone for other carriers. There seems to be a general consensus among many consumers now though that all Apple does is slap a new camera on each new model, repackage it, and put it on the shelf .... being in tech myself, I understand that the technical upgrades such as chipsets and other components that don't bring forth clear, tangible improvements do play a vital role in allowing the device to move forward and become more capable but I don't think the average consumer understands that. \n\nApple vs Android is a tired and pretty much done battle, they have been battling for the market for a while and many consumers have chosen their side and will likely stick with it at this point when comparing the 2 ... however, I have a feeling that if a new product were to emerge onto the market that were neither android or apple but introduced something reliable, new, and fresh then consumers would be more than ready for a change. Apple's double edged sword is that it is a complete ecosystem, all of the devices rely on some type of proprietary operating system which when paired together create a pretty good user experience between the devices. However, make no mistake, iPhone sits at the top of that ecosystem and for many consumers, iPhone is the segway into the Apple ecosystem. You get an iPhone and you like it .... so now when you get a computer you want a Mac etc. I say this to point out how financially dependent Apple is on the iPhone, if ever it should fail ... then the performance of the company will suffer miserably. How long can iPhone continue to dominate? Touch screen phones of this type have been running the scene for the past decade, I honestly think a major change is on the horizon for smart phones, but I don't necessarily believe Apple will be the company to usher it in .... and because of that belief I just don't think it would be a good idea to overpay for a stock now with the stupid belief that the what goes up must continue to go up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:** \n\nFrom everything I see it seems like Apple is severely overvalued right now, the company  has shown a long history of growth and one would like to think that would continue but based on the financials it doesn't seem like the growth factor is really there right now. I don't think the company is doomed or is a bad pick, I just don't think it's a good pick at its current price. However, with that being said ... I don't have nearly as much experience as many of you I'm sure and definitely not those analysts. on Wall Street, so I was trying to figure out why people are so excited as the price sits now and why the buy rating seems to be so high.",

        "selftext": "## What\u2019s A Stock Split And How It Could Affect Your Current Holdings\n\nApple and Tesla, arguably two of the hottest companies on [Wall Street](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing), both announced stock splits in recent weeks. The question is, can it positively affect your current holdings? First, let\u2019s understand what a stock split is. Essentially, a stock split is exactly what it sounds like. One share is splitting up into a few individual shares. This often comes after a particular share price has been inflated to a level that may be \u2018too high\u2019. For example, in Tesla 5-for-1 stock split example, one share worth $1500 now will be broken into 5 shares worth $300 each. This way, it will lower the entry barrier for investors who wish to buy a stake in the company.\n\nA stock split can typically result in a share price increase following a decrease immediately after the split. Since many retail investors find the stock now more affordable, they end up boosting demand and driving up prices. A stock split also reminds investors that the share price had been increasing in the past. It is not surprising that many investors extrapolate the historical growth into the future and bid up the share price again. One thing to also note is that even though the number of outstanding shares increases and stock price decreases, the market capitalization doesn\u2019t change.\n\n# Who Tend To Benefit From Stock Splits?\n\nGenerally speaking, stock splits are neutral events for current shareholders. In the case of the Apple 4-for-1 stock split, you used to own 1 stock, but moving forward you will own 4, but the total value remains the same. Essentially, a stock split wouldn\u2019t change the company value, all else being equal. But the truth is, all else is rarely equal when we apply it in the market.\n\nBoth TSLA stock and AAPL stock jumped after the announcement. This may be the fifth time for Apple to do a stock split, but it is Tesla\u2019s first. The price change will be more dramatic for Tesla, whose stock split will bring individual share to the $300 range. Compared to Apple\u2019s post-split of $100 range, Tesla\u2019s post-split stock might find it harder to attract smaller investors.\n\nCertain online brokerages offer investors to buy fractional stocks. Conceptually, it offers the same thing in the absence of stock splits. Then again, not all brokerages will offer such services and it\u2019s not that easy to move shares between brokerages. Therefore, it will not create a much stronger demand than actual stock splits. Now, like it or not, news of stock splits tend to cause share prices to jump. And that is not really rational. But who cares? As long as the prices go up, existing shareholders would not be complaining.\n\n## Tesla &amp; Apple\u2019s Stock Splits Could Restart The Trend Again.\n\nIs stock splits a thing in the past? Tracing back the history, in 1997, 102 companies in the [S&amp;P 500](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=SPY) split their stocks, and in 2016, only 7 companies did so, a decline of more than 90%. That is about to change when two of the hottest tech companies announced they will be splitting their shares at the end of this month. The zero brokerage fees environment gives companies a greater incentive to split shares today. In addition, it creates a more affordable and accessible stock for Robinhood traders to start trading. After all, many retail investors are nonetheless still prone to judging how \u201cexpensive\u201d a stock is based on its dollar value. That said, it is not surprising to see other tech companies like Amazon, Shopify, or Alphabet make such moves in their own timeline.",

        "selftext": "Alright now that I\u2019ve hooked you autists with my retarded title I will now bore you with boring information here we go:\n\n\n**History Lesson**\nJPM + other bullion banks have been suppressing silver prices for over half a century the second half of [this old ass article from 2010 that basically predicted the silver spike of 2011](https://www.thestreet.com/opinion/silvers-history-of-suppression-10787499) explains it pretty well. Basically the bullion banks were \u201cprinting silver\u201d which caused a supply fake out keeping silver at low level so the banks can roll in their money piles from silver shorts.\n\nHistorically silver normally moved at about 20:1 of gold which is it\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d price and as you can see [in this fun graph](https://www.macrotrends.net/2517/gold-prices-vs-silver-prices-historical-chart) as of 2011-2012 silver has decided to fuck off and do it\u2019s own thing. We are currently at 76:1 gold to silver.\n\n**JPM Bad and Fed fault**\nIn 2008 after the collapse of Bear Stearns JPM inherited all their silver shorts. Because Beat Stearns was \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d the whole JPM take over was handled by the fed. JPM ofc started to manipulate silver by spoofing supply (It was estimated in 2008 its estimated that 2/3rds of the silver supply was literally just paper) and gold and taking massive gains meanwhile the CFTC decides to investigate JPM for manipulation but some how manages to continue manipulation and hoard a literal fuck ton of actual silver. Since then JPM has never lost on a silver short (as of 2018). \n\nNow because JPM took over the failing Beat Stearns bank it\u2019s *speculated* that the fed told the CFTC to ignore JPM and let them do what ever the fuck they wanted with gold and silver and [apparently gave JPM a 10 year deal to make unlimited tendies](https://www.silverdoctors.com/silver/silver-news/theres-a-govtjp-morgan-10-year-deal-to-rig-silver-prices-thats-coming-to-an-end-in-march-2018/) which was supposed to end in early 2018.\n\n**Current Events**\nRecently JPM has been under [investigation for rigging metals \n](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-05/jpmorgan-s-role-in-metals-spoofing-is-under-u-s-criminal-probe) again after some [employee guilty pleas](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/13/jp-morgan-faces-lawsuits-after-guilty-pleas-by-a-former-metals-trader.html) in late 2018.\n\nBecause of human malware virus JPM [went net long](https://gsiexchange.com/with-jpmorgan-back-in-the-mix-the-hammer-is-now-about-to-fall/) on silver in April and there is a precious metals supply problem while there is a run on precious metals going on. Also everyone wants their silver deliveries now which caught JPM with their pants down holding paper instead of silver so the real supply is being revealed to be low. Which is thanks to daddy JPOW and his brrrrr machine pushing inflation.\n\nAll the other bullion banks who are still short who were making tendies off of JPM\u2019s shenanigans will eventually have to cover their shorts by buying silver, pushing up the price more. \n\n**TLDR:** Buy SLV calls. Silver supply way down demand is up bigly and silver will go up huuuugely. I\u2019m expecting $35 by end of September.\n\nPositions: \nSLV Call $31 10/2\nBag holding Purple Mattress shares \nGonna but some AAPL and AMZN stonk.\n\n**Side note**\nPlease don\u2019t use RH those shitty spreads aren\u2019t worth it. Just get a real broker and pay the 0.65 per contact and save more money on the spreads.",

        "selftext": "Alright guys so I'm one of the hosts on a YouTube channel named \"Max Tech\".  \nI previously did YouTube work for the channel \"Appleinsider\" since 2016, making videos on Apple products which include Mac computers with Intel chips. \n\nI also grew up playing video games and building custom PCs right when AMD started to release six-core and 8-core processors that were cheaper than Intel CPUs and targeted towards gamers.  \n\nEven though the Intel chips were better for gaming, I still bought AMD because they were cheaper. Intel maintained the lead for many years since games really only used 4 cores, and Intel chips gave more consistent frame rates for gaming.\n\nAt one point, it was clear to me and to everyone else that Intel was intentionally holding off from innovating and improving their performance because they already owned a bulk of the market share. They realized that they could make more profit by making small improvements every year, while AMD was busting their ass trying to figure out how they can compete. (it was ultimately the gaming and custom PC market) \n\nMeanwhile.. Apple was using Intel chips quite successfully in their Mac computers the like MacBooks and iMacs. And Apple was also using their XEON chips for their higher-end machines. And of course, Intel was killing it in the server market.\n\nNow in 2013, Intel announced that they were working on their new 10nm chip process and that it should be ready to launch in 2015, and they said their 7nm chips should launch in 2017. \n\nBack to Intel, over the new few years, Intel delayed 10nm to 2016... and then to 2017.. and then to late 2019... We are now in 2020 and Intel is still shipping 14+++++ nm chips for high-end machines like the 2020 5K Apple iMac that was just released yesterday. Only laptops are getting the actual 10nm chips right now. \n\nIn 2017, AMD shocked the world by announcing their new Ryzen chips, and then also their Threadripper chips, and ever since then, they've been quickly catching up to Intel in terms of both performance and price. \n\nBecause of this, Intel instantly started lowering the price of their chips, and in 2018, they finally made 6-core chips for the MacBook Pro. 8-core chips in 2019, and now 10-core chips in 2020. This is an obvious and desperate move to try and compete with AMD. \n\nBecause Intel's 10nm chips were not ready in 2015 or 2016, Apple's redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro which was thinner than ever before, had overheating issues. The overheating was severe in 2018 with the 6-core chips that Intel made in fear of AMD. \n\nThere were even leaked emails from Intel executives worried about AMD's price to performance beating out Intel. \n\nAnd right now, it is well known that AMD is making BETTER price-to-performance x86 chips. \n\nThe MOST important part of this discussion is that the tech community as a whole, including or YouTube and Reddit, are now convinced that AMD is the way to go. I've seen countless comments on my videos that are dissing on Intel chips and wishing that Apple would switch to using Intel. \n\nIf we make a build guide video using an Intel processor, we get shamed and called dumb for not using an AMD chip. Our Mac Pro videos got a ton of negative feedback because Apple is stupid for using Intel chips. Our 2020 MacBook Pro videos were getting comments dissing on Intel's 10th-gen chips. The entire community is starting to hate Intel and preferring AMD.  \n\nAMD stock has increased over 11x since they announced the first Ryzen chips in August of 2016.  \nIntel stock has only increased 38% since that same date. \n\nAnd looking towards the future.. Intel has recently delayed their 7nm chips until late 2022 or 2023. This caused their stock price to tank at they last earnings call. \n\nThere's even now a class-action lawsuit against Intel because of this delay. \n\nThis also caused their chief of chip engineering to resign, and they reorganized their entire chip team. \n\nThey've even discussed outsourcing their future 6nm, 5nm and 3nm chip production to their rival foundry TSMC because they've lost confidence in their own foundry. \n\nSo it's clear that Intel is getting killed by AMD with each passing year, and the tech community knows it. (Which is VERY important)   \n\n\nThis brings us into the Apple and TSMC portion of this DD.   \n\n\nBack in 2013, Apple announced their A7 chip for their iPhone 5s, the first 64 bit smartphone chip, and ever since then, there was a massive performance war between Apple and Qualcomm, fighting to create the fastest smartphone chips, in which Apple ultimately won. \n\n(The A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro is still much faster than the Snapdragon 865+ which was just recently released this year) \n\nStuck in the middle of this battle was TSMC, which has been the EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Apple Silicon chips for their iPhones and iPads since the A10 chip in 2016. \n\nAnd in 2018, Apple released their 11\" iPad Pro with the A12X chip manufactured by TSMC's 7nm process. This iPad from 2 years ago is so powerful that it still outperforms the new 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with Intel's 10th gen chip in both processor AND graphics performance. \n\nNow, Apple is about to announce their iPhone 12 in about a month that's gonna pack the A14 chip which is being built on TSMC's brand new 5nm process. \n\nAnd of course, the next iPad Pro will get a much improved A14X 5nm chip, and it's the same story for the Apple Silicon Mac chips that will start being released later this year in October/November. \n\nI'm of course, talking about Apple finally ditching Intel and moving forward with their own chips. This makes sense for Apple for various different reasons.\n\n1: They can run iPhone &amp; iPad apps on their Macs.\n\n2: They control both the software and hardware for incredibly amounts of performance optimization.\n\n3: They can make sure every new Mac update gets a new chip with performance improvements instead of relying on Intel to release improved chips. \n\n4: This is of course, much cheaper for Apple since they don't have to pay Intel the high price of their chips. \n\n5: They don't have to deal with overheating issues since most Intel chips are still on 14nm technology, therefore running very hot and using a lot of power.   \n\n\nAnd there's a good chance that the very first Apple Silicon Mac chips are gonna outperform the current Intel chips, stay much cooler and give you much better battery life. \n\nJust to give you some perspective in terms of how Intel's 10nm compares to TSMC's 5nm..\n\nIntel 10nm transistor density: around 100 million transistors per square millimeter.\n\nTSMC 5nm transistor density: around 171 million transistors per square millimeter. \n\n  \nTSMC has already confirmed that they're working on risk production of their new 3nm process in 2021,  with those chips going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\nSo here's what the future looks like:\n\n  \nIntel 7nm in late 2022/2023 : 240 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nTSMC 3nm shipping in 2022 Apple products: 290 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nAnd apparently, TSMC is already working on plans for their 2nm process for 2024.   \n\n\nAnd due to Intel's past, there's a very good chance that Intel could delay 7nm even further, especially since they had to restructure their entire chip team, while TSMC has been on point.   \n\n\nSo the future isn't looking very bright for Intel's chip technology compared to TSMC. No wonder why they wanted to outsource their chips from them.   \n\n\nAnd one last bit on Apple's switch to their own chips built by TSMC. \n\nApple has already given developers their transition kit which is a Mac Mini with an A12Z chip from their iPad Pro. \n\nOne developer tweeted this: \"At this point, I think that the first gen Apple Silicon machines will be faster at running x86 code than an actual x86...\"  \n\n\nWhat he means is that Apple's new Rosetta 2 emulation software is so good that he thinks it'll outperform Intel chips even though it's not running natively for ARM. \n\nSo basically, Apple made the right choice by ditching Intel.   \n\n\nAnd if Apple proves everyone wrong by coming out with incredibly great Macs thanks to their switch to their own Apple Silicon ARM-based chips, then there's a VERY good chance that the rest of the market will follow them and start developing ARM-based chips for laptops.\n\nThis will force Windows to start heavily investing in their ARM-based Windows software. \n\nAnd if you didn't already know.. Intel is FAR behind in the ARM-based chip world.   \n\n\nNow, the most common argument I hear is this: Apple is only a tiny part of Intel's business, and while that may be true.. the MOST important thing is the public's view of Intel.  \n\n\nThe tech community is already starting to despise Intel as a brand name because of their overpriced processors and the fact that AMD is beginning to CRUSH them. \n\nJust wait until Apple Silicon Macs start getting released and people realize that ARM-chips have a ton of potential, and they'll start hating Intel even more. \n\nThis will cause Intel's brand recognition and reputation to get absolutely destroyed in favor of AMD and Apple Silicon. This alone will lead to less market share. And what will happen if Nvidia or Apple buy out ARM? \n\nAnd by the way, there are now more and more ARM-based servers popping up, so there's a good chance that Intel will start to lose market share on the server side if ARM-based servers prove themselves. (They use less power so this makes sense for server farms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is that Intel just got ditched by Apple.. and they're getting killed by AMD and TSMC. ARM is coming VERY quickly and Intel is NOT ready. They have been plagued with delay after delay, and all of this drama will ruin the confidence of their staff, leading to lowered productivity. It's not looking good for Intel for the long-term.  \n\n\nAs of right now, Intel stock is very cheap, and you might make a few bucks if you trade short term.. but I wouldn't hold Intel stock long term.   \n\n\nIf you want more in-depth info with visuals and extra details, you can check out two videos I made on the Max Tech Youtube channel: \n\n\"How Intel Lost the CPU Race..\"\n\n\"Apple Silicon ARM Chips vs Intel x86 Processors for Mac?\"\n\nHopefully you enjoyed this DD.",

        "selftext": "I am seeing a shit load of new treads discussing the following-\n\n1. Fastly vs NET\n2. Hold Fastly or let go?\n3. What does Fastly do? \n\nSo I will clear up a few myths just in case. \n\nFastly is a CDN provider, which allows their clients to host their website on Fastly's servers. Fastly's business model is catered towards large enterprises that are looking at fastest (thus the name!) cold start time, i.e. time it takes to load a webpage on mobile/PC. Here are a few of their clients-\n\n1. **Clients doing very well during Covid**\n\n* Reddit\n* Shopify\n* Wayfair\n* Pinterest\n* Twitter\n* Stripe\n* Overstock\n* Shazam\n* Wealthfront\n* Etsy\n* Tiktok\n\n2. **Clients doing not so well during Covid**\n\n* Airbnb\n* Jetblue\n* Trip Advisor\n* Alaska Air\n* Kayak\n* Yelp\n* Kayak,\n* and many more....\n\nNotice first that their clients that are booming right now are very likely to continue booming for the next year or so. Once we are done with Covid (that is if), revenues will switch to clients in hospitality business, which typically have a strong business during normal times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFastly's USP is fastest cold start time, i.e., it is the best CDN in the market which allows the visitors on their client's website to load the webpage/apps faster than anyone else in the market right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why is this USP so important**\\--well there are a few reasons why Fastly will continue to have higher growth rate.  I have noted a few down below-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Apple rolls out 5g iPhone later this year. They will require webpages to load faster. Fastly is the best CDN there is to handle that request. This does not mean that Akamai or NET are sitting out catching honeybee, but really means that Fastly is positioned to serve that switch to 5g better than NET or Akamai IMO.\n2. Fastly's business model is unique. It charges their customers based on the bytes loaded, which translates to the amount of time people spend on their customers' website. Thus, while I am spending 5-10 mins to write this essay, Reddit is getting charged by Fastly (pun intended!). Notice that this is a different business model than NET. NET offers a free subscription to begin with and has lower CDN hosting rate for those willing to host on their servers. Therefore, organizations which do not feel that speed is of concern to them as much, prefer to use NET. On the flip side, Fastly has a niche set of customers who value speed, because user experience on their website is of utmost importance to them. Imagine if I had to spend several 100 microseconds for a webpage to open, I would be pissed and may not go on that website, purely because of that reason.\n3. YoY growth based on investor's copy was 62%, which is great if you ask me. As long as it is staying above 50, my money is parked there.\n4. Bergman and Josh raised guidance for this year, during a time when a lot of CFOs are holing on giving guidance. Also of importance is that these folks in the C suite like to give a conservative guidance and beat it. In other words, promise less and deliver more. This leaves no question that next earnings should be a beat but do not take my word on it because who knows what happens tomorrow.\n\n**Influence of Tiktok on Fastly's revenue**\n\nCertainly one of the most important question that needs to be addressed because Tiktok constitutes 12% of the revenues. With the stock dropping like a rock after ER and then earnier today after Donny decided to ban it after 45 days, looks like a lot of the uncertainty is already baked into the price at this moment. Those who were uncertain unboarded the train today. That point is the exhaustion point where bulls come in and drive the stock higher (e.g., Chegg today).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally feel that Tiktok MSFT should be a done deal and they are waiting to announce this sometime this month. I am neither an insider nor do I happen to know the actually outcome. However, I do follow hedge fund option sentiment and I have noticed bullish calls inflow for MSFT this past couple days. While I am a peasant who is not connected to anyone involved with the deal, I am sure some of these whales are aware of the decision, which is part of the reason for that bullish call inflow for MSFT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Should you dump FSLY or not?**\n\nEntirely up to you but I see a lot of growth in this company. Fundamentally, nothing has changed in how they operate. The company gave an upward guidance and that drives the stock in forward direction. Some sellers left the ship because a lot of RH investors have not seen losses in their life or some are not even aware of the potential of this company, except it became a meme stock lately and FOMO drove a lot of noobs in FSLY train.\n\nIt is always better to curtail losses. If you trust that they will continue to bring in revenues, I would dollar cost average on every dip. This ensures your average cost of the share is reduced significantly with any dip. Most fund managers actually add stocks to their funds when the stock is sitting at 30 day MA. Fastly had such a quick run up that the 30 day MA kept moving. All of that being said, I think it may rest for some time before beginning the next leg up. That could be a week, 2 weeks, or a month but you will have to be patient if you do not want to loose money. However, never panik sell on a red day because that is literally the day people like me buy from people who are selling. \n\nWould Monday bring a ray of light and we open green-\n\nNo one knows what happens but I would continue to DCA on every 5% drop. I remember when Square dropped a couple years ago, I kept DCAing and here I am sitting on gains. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helped convince some of you.",

        "selftext": " \n\nWhere to start. I've had some success channel-surfing SPY weeklies. Taking small routine gains each week: a thousand here, a few thousand there. The objective is a 1% gain to the portfolio each session. It's been fun, profitable, and reliable.\n\nThursday rolls around with the unemployment numbers and I'm getting a bear vibe. I know, I know, you don't need to say it. My gut was screaming don't do it.\n\nThat morning, I'd already bagged $3000 from the first spike and drop at the open. Was ready to call it day. At this point, I throw back a couple of beers (it's 10:00 pm in Asia) and start thinking there's gotta be room for some tasty bearish puts today. Just a quick strike, take one ride down the red candle slide, bag some tendies, and get out. Let's roll.\n\nI usually buy 30-50 ATM contracts. Enough of an \"investment\" (wager, if you will) to make some money but not lose my damn shirt if I bet wrong and have to bail.\n\nThis time I decide to yolo in and bought 100 8/21 SPY 337P for just over 10K. I don't quite know why; maybe the booze was making me cocky and greedy. The TA )and my lying gut) suggested the price should pop down quickly, print, and let me out.\n\nInstead, it pops up fast. ffs. I usually don't get caught out like that. Suddenly, I'm down more than I'm comfortable and, against my better judgment, I decided to double down with another 130 contracts for a total of 230 337P 1DTE priced at just over $24,000. \n\nSudden alarming alarm washes over me and I realize I might be in way deeper than I'd like or had planned to be when I sat down to trade. That's simply too much money for one rubbish trade and way outside of my rules for engagement and trading strategy. This was the first time dropping such a large sum; of course, it's not going to work out. Deep down, I already know I'm fucked.\n\nPrice is melting up and digging me a deeper pit of hell from which to escape. At $8000 down and the clock ticking towards 4:00 pm (4:00 am, my time), I get to that point where bailing is going to hurt too much; I decide to ride it out overnight to see if I can get a meltdown on Friday to cash in my 230 0 DTE hail marys. Fuck it, let's diamond hand this shit and see if we can pull and pray that price down a buck to $337.\n\nAs I'm trading from Asia, I have to wait out a super stressful Friday on two hours of sleep from Thursday's shit show. I'm sweating, can't focus, and know I'm in the shit. I sit down around 4:00 pm local to watch the pre-market. \n\nHey, there's movement in the PM! At 7 am, the price has rolled down to a little over 335. Fucking perfect. If I could just sell now, I'd be bagging around 20K according to the options calculator. But we all know where this goes... it's waaaay to early and that price is guaranteed to roll right back up.\n\nFriday morning it melts right up to 338 by the bell. Funny how that works. Unfortunately, no quick dump op at the open. I hang on. \n\nMy unrealized losses are now in the $12,000 range. This is gonna hurt. At about 30 minutes into the session, I had a super short window to sell back to an $8000 loss; instead, I stood my damn ground and decided to wait it out like a fucking clown. \n\nNo pop down, no nothing--just green dojis meandering up the fucking hill for hours...\n\nBy now I'm fucking raging at the WSB bulls yelling \"Tesla this\" and \"Apple that\" at me from my Samsung (not AAPL) tablet... ffs, shut up, I've got my own problems at the moment.\n\nThe day (night for me) wears on. I'm losing hope as the price action of the underlying stonk literally only goes up. Look SPY, I need you to *swoon*, not *moon*!\n\nThis was unreal and completely divorced from the reality of life, Mainstreet, whatever. Wall Street simply does not care about fundamentals, TA, the world burning down, presidential hellfire, anything. Literally it's now all pump with little dump. And to make it worse with each refresh of Reddit, WSB was driving me up the wall going on and on about FAANGS, bears, bulls, 500/2000, Rheeeeee, tendies, tenders, chicken, etc..\n\nAt this point, I'm going down with the ship. I'm squeezing my diamond hands for all they're worth, waiting for a reversal of power-hour, something. Of course, nothing... nothing happens AT ALL, other than the slow creep of SPY taking my tendies $0.01 at a time. I'm now looking at the full loss. This blows.\n\nI mean it really fucking blows. Life-changing, \"I fucked up,\" kinda sucks. By 3:00 pm, I'm fucked. I pray one last time for power-hour to dump hard, knowing, of course, that it won't. I finally bail at 3:40 pm, selling off my 230 contracts at 0.03. Not good times. I had to tell Jesus himself in a variety of ways that I was not impressed.\n\nI lost the $24,000 and had to call my wife today to explain it to her... it's embarrassing, depressing, humiliating, etc. Well, I had to explain it to her boyfriend who explained it her as she was \"busy at the moment.\" To make it worse, Chad said he was \"disappointed in me.\"\n\nI'll fight another day, but this one fucking bites. It's all on me, this is my bad. I'll take it like a man (or bear) but got damn if I ever bet against the WSB bois and bulls in this market. Bears really are fuk--well, maybe not next week... but I'm not taking that bet.\n\ntl;dr: it was a bad idea to yolo into 230 contracts of 08/21 SPY 337P; lost mucho tendies",

        "selftext": "From 2010 to 2019, not a single stock in the S&amp;P 500 performed better than Netflix did. Today, the company counts nearly 200 million subscribers across its global streaming platform. At any one time, Netflix accounts for 12-15% of all global internet traffic. And its market cap of $231bn makes Netflix more valuable than Bank of America, AT&amp;T, or Comcast. If you invested $1,000 in the Netflix IPO in 2002, those shares would now be worth $437,888 for a total return of 43,688% \u2013 or annualized returns of 39.51% over the past 18 years. \n\nBut if it weren\u2019t for a bad pitch to Blockbuster, Netflix may have never started the streaming revolution. Did you know that Netflix was originally called Kibble? That Walmart was once the biggest threat to its business? Or that the company nearly launched a \u201cNetflix Box\u201d to download shows instead of offering a fully on-demand streaming service? In the latest featured flashback, we profile how Netflix went from just another dot-com to category inventor, with quite a few ups and downs in between. \n\n**The Amazon.com of \u201cSomething\u201d**\n\n* Early legend had it that Netflix CEO and co-founder Reed Hastings got the idea for Netflix after Blockbuster charged him a $40 late fee for Apollo 13. He has since conceded that he told that story to encapsulate the Netflix ethos and business model. The more widely accepted version is that both Hastings and co-founder Marc Randolph both greatly admired Amazon and wanted to replicate their success by becoming the next Amazon.com of \u201csomething\u201d. \n* In 1997, DVD players were still uncommon and could cost upwards of $700, making them an expensive upgrade over the mainstay VCR. Originally, the duo considered a VHS mail-in service but ultimately decided that shipping video cassettes would be too costly. When they test-mailed a CD to their homes and it arrived in the same condition, they thought they were onto something. \n* After securing funding (including $25,000 from Randolph\u2019s mother), Netflix opened its first distribution center in San Jose in 1998. Back then, the business model was to charge $4 per rental plus $2 for postage. They only had a skeleton staff and fewer than 1000 titles among their collection. But that didn\u2019t prevent Jeff Bezos from making an offer for Netflix to spur Amazon\u2019s entry into the movie rental business. \n* The company rejected the offer but continued to struggle financially before moving to a subscription model in late 1999. Netflix figured that overnight delivery was possible from San Jose throughout the Bay Area, and local consumers were quick to sign up for a flat rate fee in exchange for unlimited movie rentals. That year, Netflix also signed revenue-sharing agreements with several major studios. \n\n**Dot Com Bubble Burst and Near Collapse**\n\n* Although by 2000 Netflix now counted about 300,000 subscribers, the company was burning through an unsustainable rate of cash - $50 million that year alone. To draw in new subscribers, they offered generous deals and free trials. And the combination of only $20 monthly subscriptions for unlimited DVD rentals with a reliance on the US Postal Service meant that the company didn\u2019t have much promise of improving its cash flow. \n* Plans to go public were scrapped when the dot com bubble burst. On top of that, the tech collapse caused venture capital money to dry up throughout the Valley. Unlike during the two or three previous years, investors were no longer willing to back dot com companies that had yet to turn a profit. According to an account from Randolph, Netflix thought the best option to stay in operation was to try and sell part of the company to Blockbuster \u2013 the dominant player in the rental market that had 7,700 retail locations at the time. \n* In early 2000, Hastings and Randolph flew to Dallas to meet with Blockbuster. Netflix wanted to maintain its independence by offering a 49% stake but agreed to take on the name Blockbuster.com. The idea was that Netflix would become the online division of Blockbuster. When Blockbuster asked how much it would cost for the whole company, Hastings replied \u201c$50mn\u201d. Not only did Blockbuster decline the arrangement, Randolph noted that Blockbuster CEO John Antioco [struggled not to laugh](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/09/netflixs-crazy-doomed-meeting-with-blockbuster) when Hastings named his price. Instead, Blockbuster signed a 20-year video-on-demand agreement with Enron Broadband Services. \n* Soon after this, though, DVD sales began to gain major traction and the cost of mass-producing DVDs fell to $1 per unit. On the back of the rise in DVD players, Netflix more than doubled its customer base to 750,000 towards the end of 2002. Even still, many had doubts about the future of the company and its shares hovered around pre-split levels of $6 ($0.42 on a split-adjusted basis at today\u2019s float). Wall Street even likened Netflix to infamous dot-com failures such as Kozmo or Webvan. \n\n**Enter Walmart, then Blockbuster**\n\n* Despite Wall Street\u2019s skepticism, Walmart became intrigued by the success of Netflix and launched an identical service in early 2003. Not only did Walmart undercut Netflix\u2019s $19.95/month subscription with a rate of $18.86, they rivaled Netflix on selection. Hastings reacted to Walmart\u2019s entry by saying he was \u201cglad\u201d and that it \u201cwill benefit Netflix.\u201d Numerous attempts to keep undercutting Netflix on price didn\u2019t work, and Hasting\u2019s suggestion that Walmart\u2019s presence in the rental market would help Netflix actually proved to be true. \n* With DVDs now becoming a popular mode of watching entertainment, the major obstacle preventing subscriber growth was convincing people to rent DVDs online. The entrances of Walmart in 2003 and Blockbuster in 2004 into the market greatly enhanced public understanding of the subscription-based DVD rental model. In fact, marketing by Walmart and Blockbuster had a knock-on effect for Netflix. \n* With lower competitor prices and similar libraries, one of the key advantages for Netflix was its algorithm-driven recommendation feature. Prior to Netflix, box-office hits received the vast majority of rental revenues as it was difficult for consumers to learn about less well-known movies. At the time, 80% of Netflix rentals came from 2,000 titles \u2013 completely inverting the previous model of brick-and-mortar rental. \n* The success of Netflix in promoting a wider range of films made the platform extremely popular with studios as a marketing vehicle and alternative mode of movie advertising versus traditional media. Blockbuster had also been sitting on a mountain of rental data, but unlike Netflix, they never utilized it to build out their online service. Eventually Walmart abandoned online DVD rentals in 2005 and even struck a deal to convert its subscribers to Netflix in exchange for Netflix promoting Walmart\u2019s in-store DVDs for purchase.\n\n**The Start of Streaming** \n\n* In 2002, it cost $30 in bandwidth to download a DVD-quality movie online. But by the mid-2000s, internet speeds were now fast enough that it became feasible to think about sending content digitally. In 2005, the company thought the best way forward was to sell a \u201cNetflix Box\u201d that customers could download movies to then be able to watch them the next day. The product was about ready to launch when some began having second thoughts. Around this time YouTube was experiencing incredible success and growth. Rather than restrict Netflix streaming to a specific hardware device, the company decided to make its new web-based on-demand service hardware-agnostic. \n* Netflix began streaming its movies and TV shows directly to subscribers\u2019 devices in 2007 \u2013 more or less ending the rental wars that began at the start of the decade. At the end of that year, Netflix had 7.5 million subscribers, marking 24x growth in its user base in just over seven years. While Amazon also launched a streaming service that year, Netflix enjoyed a dominant market share at 91%. A few years later in 2010, Blockbuster had filed for bankruptcy protection and Netflix shares were hitting all-time highs. \n* Even after the exit of Blockbuster and its near monopoly on streaming for a time, Netflix experienced a couple of growing pains that caused analysts to question its future on more than one occasion. The most notable of these occurred in 2011 when the company decided to split its DVD rental and streaming plans while it was still mailing 14 million DVDs to customers. The result was that customers who wanted streaming and DVD rental had to pay 60% more per month than before. When the company announced it had lost 800,000 subscribers in its Q3 FY11 earnings report due to the move, shares plunged 35%. Shares had reached a pre-adjusted split high of nearly $300 that summer before falling to $78 in October.\n\n**Original Content, International Expansion, and Media Giant** \n\n* Over the next few years, though, Netflix began significantly investing in original content and moving its platform into new markets. From 2011 to 2015, Netflix expanded into Canada and Europe, across Latin America, and began to gain a foothold in Asia. However, perhaps just as important to the new leg of growth was the start of original content in 2013 with the launch of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d. While the move into original content required major capital investments by Netflix, it also reduced licensing fees and furthered the value proposition for the platform as some of its shows gained critical acclaim. \n* The dual strategy led to Netflix growing subscribers from 70.8 million in 2015 to 167.1 million in 2019 (63.5% of whom were international-based). In 2017, US-based Netflix subscribers equaled the combined number of cable subscribers for the first time. And in 2019, 6 of the top 10 streamed television shows in the US were Netflix original content. With Disney, Comcast, AT&amp;T, Apple, and others pushing heavily into streaming with a combination of high-value content and deep pockets, it remains to be seen who will ultimately win the streaming wars. But there is no doubting the immense success Netflix has achieved in reinventing how we consume entertainment, and their shareholders have been rewarded greatly. \n\n*You can also find me on Twitter* [*@BlackjacketCo*](https://twitter.com/BlackjacketCo) *where I write about emerging technologies and long-term market trends.

        "selftext": "Listen up fuckers.\n\n\nI\u2019m not ludicrously experienced with options, but I can recognize some bullshit when I see it. This arcticle [(Intel \u2018Stunning Failure\u2019 Heralds End of an Era for U.S. Chip Sector)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stunning-failure-heralds-end-030711424.html) and a bunch of other \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b news caused $INTC to drop off the face of the earth last week. \n\n\nI kinda fail to see the drama. Intel has always outsourced it's chips. Maybe it's doing it more now, but even 8 years ago when my brother and I built our first PC's. His chip was from Mexico, mine was from Taiwan. \n\n\nFurthermore, TSMC, the company this article says Intel should sell factories to, has been the heavyweight chip maker for a decade or more.\n\n\nNvidia and AMD for example, they are the two graphics card manufacturers. BOTH of them have their chips made by TSMC. These companies do all their designing, but in the end everything is made by TSMC anyway. At least, a lions share of it.\n\n\nNow, Intel definitely has struggled in the recent market, but that's because they've demolished AMD in the performance chip market for nearly two decades. There was no reason to keep pushing their envelope, spending billions on R&amp;D for a better product. All they had to do was refine their Lake series processors and they'd continue to rake in a ton of profit. This profit was used to expand their market to the mobile industry. Particularly laptops. For a long time it was hard to get an apple product with any kind of processor that wasn't Intel.\n\n\nThey're not going away. They're not crashing.\n\n\nThey're just finally seeing AMD pass them in one market. This has caused other markets to start to shift due to uncertainty about who the \"best\" chip manufacturer is, but trust me - we will see Intel back with a fiery vengeance.\n\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Intel pops out some high core count chips that are pushing 5.0-5.5 all core clock count speeds. Once they scale down their transistor size... Oof. It's going to be a Rottweiler back in the pit. \n\n\n\nTL;DR INTC $55c 09/18, but load up on whatever the hell you want, these contracts are CHEAP",

        "selftext": "#**Introduction**\n\nHey all, it's ya boy Tatar back with the 2nd episode of my option series. If you missed last week, got check out last weeks as this weeks topic builds on it. You can find it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iewqhw/options_101_episode_1_an_introduction_to_the/)\n\nLets dive right in.\n\n#**What is a vertical spread?**\n\nA vertical spread is the simultaneous purchase and selling of an options contract of the same type, same expiration date, but different strike prices. If you are familiar with what a spread is, continue to the next section. I'm going to keep it basic for all the kiddos in the back.\n\nThere are four different types of vertical spreads: 1) Call Credit Spreads 2) Call Debit Spreads 3) Put Credit Spreads and 4) Put Debit Spreads\n\nLets look at an example of each with a ticker, XYZ that is trending at $50.\n\nA call credit spread would be selling a call contract that is closer to being ITM, and purchasing one farther OTM. Example: selling the $52 contract and purchasing the $55. You will receive a premium for this trade that will decay with time, lets call it $100. With this play, you want the price of XYZ to stay under $52 so you collect the full premium. Your max loss is the distance in the spread minus premium earned ($300 - $100) and max gain is the premium earned ($100). You will need to put up the collateral to cover your max loss.\n\nA call debit spread would be the opposite of above: purchasing the $52 call and selling the $55. You will pay a premium for this play, so you will not need to put up any collateral for this play. Lets keep consistent with the above example and say you paid $100 for this play. Your max loss is $100, max gain would be the distance of the spread minus premium payed ($300 - $100).\n\nA put credit spread would be selling a put contract that is closer to being ITM, and purchasing one farther OTM. Example: selling the $48 contract and purchasing the $45. You will receive a premium for this trade that will decay with time, lets call it $100. With this play, you want the price of XYZ to stay above $48 so you collect the full premium. Your max loss is the distance in the spread minus premium earned ($300 - $100) and max gain is the premium earned ($100). You will need to put up the collateral to cover your max loss.\n\nA put debit spread would be the opposite of above: purchasing the $48 put and selling the $45. You will pay a premium for this play, so you will not need to put up any collateral for this play. Lets keep consistent with the above example and say you paid $100 for this play. Your max loss is $100, max gain would be the distance of the spread minus premium payed ($300 - $100).\n\nIf you need a further explanation, checkout the Investopedia page [here.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalspread.asp)\n\n#**Vertical Spreads vs Naked Options: Greeks Analysis**\n\n**TLDR: Compared to naked calls, spreads experience less time decay, less movement when the underlying moves, and are much more affordable for longer time frames**\n\nThe basic premise behind understanding how that works is to understand the greeks. Basically, what you do is take the long option greeks and subtract the short option greeks and that will give you the greeks values for the play.\n\nI screencapped a couple options this past week for SPY and will use them to illustrate what I mean. For this example, lets look at a call debit spread.\n\nPurchase: SPY 350c and sell SPY 353c\n\n          350c          353c          Total\nPrice     3.16          -1.82         1.34\nDelta      .47          -.33           .14\nGamma      .04          -.04           ~0\nTheta     -.21           .19          -.02\nVega       .2           -.18           .02\n\nAs we can see, the spread gives us an entirely different greeks profile than if we bought the 350c naked.\n\nSo, lets get into the pros and cons of these type of spreads when comparing them to their naked conuterpart.\n\n#**Pros:**\n\n1) **Each play is cheaper.** This will allow you to either buy more contracts of the same play, or buy more expensive contracts.\n\n2) **The price moves against you slower.** Since gamma and delta are neutralized, the underlying moving against you will have less impact on the play. \n\n3) **Time decay is lessened.** There will still be time decay as long as both legs are OTM, but it is drastically reduced. In the example above, the spread time decay is 10% what the naked 350c is.\n\n4) **Theta works FOR you when both legs are ITM.** Keep in mind that this will be a slow burn, and most will close out their spread when it gets here, but some times it might be worth holding the spread and letting time decay work in your favor.\n\n5) **You can purchase contracts with longer expiration dates.** Since these contracts can be very expensive, this can open up some plays to a smaller account that they might not have been able to afford before.\n\n6) **Easier to cut your losses.** Since the spread takes longer to move against you due to decreased delta and theta, you have more time to wait and think about closing it out for a smaller loss.\n \n#**Cons:**\n\n1) **You won't be able to earn the full profit until expiration day.** This is due to the fact that each contract will have extrinsic value that gets lessened as the contracts get close to expiry.\n\n2) **You limit your upside.** This can't be ignored, since you are selling an option, any price movement beyond that option doesn't offer any more intrinsic value to the spread. However, since we can often buy more spreads, this can actually benefit us. I'll get into that below.\n\n3) **Getting fills is harder.** If you are trying to make a play on an illiquid option, or want to get a bargain on your limit price, it might take a while to get filled, if at all. This can be counteracted by legging into a spread, which I will get into later.\n\n#**Calculating max profit compared to just buying a naked option**\n\nI expect a lot of you retards to scoff at the idea of limiting your gains, but pump the breaks before going full retard.\n\nWhen I purchase a spread, my goal is to purchase 3 spreads for the price of 1 naked option. Sometimes it's 2:1, but with each additional spread you purchase you have the opportunity for increased gains.\n\nUsing the example of SPY above, 1 naked option of 350c would cost $316. A 350c/353c spread costs $134, so you could purchase 2 spreads for $268. \n\nIf SPY goes to 353, the spreads will yield $300 more profit than the naked option.\n\nYour breakeven would be $356, with both plays being worth the same at that point.\n\nYou are limiting your upside only if the underlying goes above $356.\n\nSo while it is a fair criticism to talk about limiting upside risk, most of the time our plays would benefit from purchasing spreads instead. Especially the closer to expiry we purchase.\n\n#**Tips:**\n\nSo I am still tweaking my personal strategy, but here are a few things I've learned so far that might be helpful:\n\n1) Purchasing spreads &lt; 45 DTE. I found that purchasing options beyond that yields much slower gains, and I find myself closing them out for smaller profit to free up the capital. If you want to buy a leap, just buy the leap naked.\n\n2) Legging into a spread. What I like to do sometimes is purchase a call with the intention of selling the other leg of the spread at a later time. This can be tricky to pull off sometimes, but having this tool in your toolbox gives you more options.\n\n3) CUT YOUR DAMN LOSSES. Since spreads take longer to move against you, cutting your losses yields less overall loss than naked options. \n\n4) Buy multiple spreads of the same play. This adds a multiplier effect to your gains, and IMO is the best way to take advantage of spreads compared to naked options.\n\nPositions: AAPL 560/580 debit spread, rest cash",

        "selftext": "\nI've posted bits and pieces of this in some comments since some form of the question has come up on this subreddit. I want to list out a list of reasons why today is like the dot com times and ALSO what is different about today. I am not a financial professional, but I have been working in the tech industry for over 20 years. It is mostly tech stock focused.\n\nI'm going to also add (fact) or (anecdotal) or (opinion) to my bullet points, so take those bullet points with the appropriate grain of salt.\n\nReasons we are NOT like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance):\n\n* (fact) Interest rates are much lower now and long term expectations on yield is also low. In 1999, the 10 year treasury was at around 5% and rose to over 6.5% in 2000. The P/E of the S&amp;P 500 in 2000 was around 30. Which means that the 10 year treasury yielded MORE than the S&amp;P 500 earnings. This is absolutely not true today with the 10 year treasury yield being around 0.6% and P/Es being around 25-30. This single point is extremely important to understand.\n* (fact) Late stage VCs are more of a thing now than they were in dot com. Thus you have fewer IPOs and the companies that do are more mature and less speculative (of course there are outliers, see below).\n* (fact) The NASDAQ P/E in 2000 was really quite ridiculous (I can't find a chart for some reason, i think it was around 80). S&amp;P 500 was more comparable between 2000 and now.\n* (anecdotes) You can no longer get a job at a startup / real tech firm just because you know HTML or can write \"hello world\" in Perl. A lot of firms back in the late 90's were trying to fatten up the employee count and race to IPO to cash out. This doesn't happen today.\n* (fact) There was no pandemic in 2000 and it makes comparisons hard.\n\nReasons we are like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance)\n\n* (anecdotes) Sentiment on the ground is very similar to what you hear during the dot com boom. We make fun of the people who invest in stupid shit like NKLA, HTZ, etc. But a lot of people are creaming their pants still on the big tech (FAMANG) saying they are forever-holds / they can't go down, etc. You also now are starting to see intelligent, rational people putting money in things **precisely** because other people will and assume they can get out before it all falls apart.\n* (fact) In the late 90s, internet brokers were a new thing and made trading easier for people who didn't know anything -- and we see that today with COVID stay-at-homers and an influx of users into robinhood (I wish I could get hard numbers on the comparison). (opinion) Because of this, I'm fairly certain pricing is out of whack for a large number of companies.\n* (fact) The P/E ratios of the big techs today are higher than a lot of the big techs during 2000. Nasdaq P/E in 2000 was off the chart, but if you just look at the big profitable companies like INTC, ORCL, AAPL, HPQ, IBM, which were the equivalent of FAMANG today, they had P/Es mostly under 30s. FAMANG are around 35 except for Netflix and Amazon which are much higher (see huge caveat on interest rates above). CSCO and MSFT in 2000 were the outliers having P/Es of well over 60.\n* (anecdotes) In tech companies, a common business plan for new firms in the last ~8 years is to get market share at any cost and figure out profitability later. This is really no different from dot com when firms were valued by number of \"eyeballs\".\n* (opinion) \"this time is different\". At least in terms of technology, it's not. The internet itself was a bigger \"paradigm shift\" than what we are seeing today. I used \"paradigm shift\", because was a common buzzword that turned into a joke back in the late 90s and used to justify crazy valuations. Machine Learning is amazing, but not on par with connecting everyone on the globe. And the cloud is just a fancy name for running something on someone else's computer (even though its quite nice how easy and seamless it is today vs. 20 years ago).\n* (anecdotes) While it is harder to IPO today without profitability or clear path to profitability, it clearly still happens (UBER, LYFT, SNAP). And others are using backdoor IPOs (NKLA, SPCE).\n* (fact) In 2000, the IT sector along with Media stocks and the Telecommunications Services sector approached 40% of the S&amp;P market cap. The categories have changed but if you combine IT and Communication Services sectors, you get a 38% of S&amp;P market cap today. If you add Amazon which is not included in IT/Communication, you get over 40%. Does this mean anything, especially since we are in a pandemic and more stuff runs on IT? Not sure.\n\nYou can definitely pick apart some of the individual points, I just wanted to lay them all out and see what people thought and if anyone has other valid comparisons. I personally think we ARE in some kind of tech bubble, but I'm not going to make a fool of myself in predictions on when and how it will burst. And fuck it, while I do have more in cash than typical, I'm still in VTI/VXUS and a bunch of individual tech names since I have the background to do some analysis on the business.\n\nI'll end with a few random thoughts:\n\n* In August 1999, a lot of people were looking at the craziness of the dot com boom and how people were throwing money at stupid shit. I don't care what people say, it was pretty obvious something was wrong. If you shorted the NASDAQ then, you will watch the NASDAQ more than double in 7 months time and have your face ripped off.\n* Taking what I've posted as a whole, the one thing to be terrified about is if long term interest rates rise and the fed is either powerless or does not step in for whatever reason. This will completely destroy the stock and bond market. I don't see the catalyst for it, but I'm no economic genius. You might be able to make an argument that gold is a hedge for this unlikely scenario. There is also the worry of a slump in earnings due to general economic malaise, but that is a garden variety concern that everyone is watching for and usually pretty temporary. Rise in interest rates would be real bad.",

        "selftext": "Hello and welcome. If you read my forecast over the weekend, you would have accurately timed the rotation from Tesla and Apple into Facebook and Amazon. \n\nNow we are going to discuss rotating back into Tesla and Apple although I expect some more momentum into Facebook as well. \n\nAmazon's momentum is fucking slow until Bezos split's that shit so I don't really use spend much energy trying to forecast that.\n\nMy forecast for Apple is about $127.85-$130 opening on the split day and rocketing that week to mid 30s even flirting with 140 intraday but coming down to mid 130s. After which it will grind sideways for a bit and fight for $150 over October and November.\n\nAs for Tesla, I do not see Tesla going much over $2100 this week. I will literally liquidate everything and buy puts on you retards in order for Tesla to open at $420 on Monday. After the split, I expect it to rocket to \\~$500 followed by a sell off after battery day but I don't know how much.\n\nFeel free to look into your crystal ball and share what it's saying to you in this thread.",

        "selftext": "Let's get this straight: the price of a stock is not random\\*. The price is (theoretically) all future earnings of a company discounted at some rate (depending on the risk of the stock) to the present day. What this means is that in order for you to rationally price a stock, you first want to see what money it will deliver to you in the future, and how likely it is to deliver that money. The more earnings and/or the more likely it is to achieve those earnings, the higher the price. So, to price a stock, you form your expectations about all future earnings and discount them depending on the risk of the stock to today's money, and now you can rationally decide if a stock is a buy or sell or even short. This whole thing is called the Discounted Cash Flow Model.\n\nNow, this is the essence of this post: a change in expectations about future earnings, or a change in the discount rate are the only things that change investor sentiment about a stock. It is not how it has historically performed nor about its current situation. It is always how do investors feel about the future of the company.\n\nA lot of people on this sub like that point out the history of a stock to jusifity going long, or the fact that the company is projected to make a lot of money or that it currently does. The reality is that all of that is reflected in the price of the stock. You can use historical earnings to project future earnings, but that is all, and those future earnings are already reflected in the stock's price. Only a change in expectations or the risk of a company meeting expectations influence the price of the stock. This ultimately means only future events can change the price of the stock, and unless you can predict the future, for all intents and purposes, the price of a stock today is right.\n\nHere's a consequence of this line of thinking:\n\nYou want to know why Apple is $2.1T in market cap? It is a mix of high earnings in the future and a very low risk of missing.\n\nHave low risk necessarily means having lower future returns. Almost all (&gt;97%) returns are explained by taking on more risk (using the Fama-French 5 factor model). This is the fundamental idea behind investing, and is basically a law at this point. High risk = high reward.\n\nApple being priced high means that it's expectations are high (meaning for anyone who invests in Apple right now, they are expecting Apple to earn lots of money) and those expectations are not terribly risky. This ultimately means that for Apple investors to make returns at or above the market, Apple has to consistently beat expectations and become even a safer investment in order for current investors to make returns.\n\nWhat this ultimately means is that in the long-term, large cap growth stocks are not the best investments you should have. Companies like Apple are basically guaranteeing you low returns in the long run. If you have a long time horizon, you should be investing in systematically risky assets because in the long run, you make more returns. Things like value, and small cap stocks are higher risk and higher reward.\n\n\\*Price movements are a random walk, but that is because the future is effectively random.",

        "selftext": "I have a post that I explained how in etoro you don\u2019t own the stock what so ever but u just own a cfd contract even if you don\u2019t use margin \n\nIn this post I\u2019ll explain a little bit about how etoro pays dividends on your stocks even tho you don\u2019t own them and the dangers of trading on this kind of brokers \n\n\u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\n\n\nAs I said in one of my replay , the underlying asset is a cfd contract (cfd contracts are decaying assets ) , a cfd contract doesn\u2019t grant you any ownership over the real stock. Let me explain again .\n\nIn one of the legit brokers I use , they have this program that if you subscribe in , you give the broker the permission to lend the stocks in your portfolio to other traders who want to short sell the stock , like I have 5 apple stocks in my portfolio, if I\u2019m signed up to the lending programme in this legit broker , then they can take my 5 apple stocks and lend them to someone who wants to short sell them .\n\n1 - by law I\u2019m not paid dividends on those stocks that they borrowed from me , but the borrower is paid the dividend cause he is the owner now as long as he is borrowing my stocks .\n\n2- said broker will pay me 50% of the interest that he charges the short seller\n\n3- the broker will still give me my dividends equivalent but in a form of capital gain ( etoro does pay u dividends equivalent from the commission that he charges on his platform , but not real dividends, )\n\nThis might sound complicated but again this is way a broker like etoro can tell their clients that they are buying the asset which in-fact they are not , it is legal but it is a form of word play , the real danger is if etoro goes bankrupt or for any reason doesn\u2019t wna does his part of cfd contract deal then they tottaly can , they don\u2019t do it upfront , but they can halt trading on a certain stock , just an example , a real legit broker will never halt trading on a stock unless the exchange itself halt trading and no one in the world can buy the stock , in etoro you will find that you can\u2019t sell a certain position or open one , while at the same time other traders on other platforms are happily buying the same stock and selling it , this is one form of etoro saying \u201c I don\u2019t want to keep up to my words that and exercise the cfd contract \u201c\n\nSomethings I said are a bit complicated but etoro banks on the low experience and innocency of their clients .\n\nHope this helps",

        "selftext": "Listen up fellas. \n\nTelehealth has tremendous potential moving forwards, we all know that. Additionally, the world is becoming increasingly cognizant of mental health and the importance of maintaining it. \n\nOTRK combines telehealth with mental health. I would describe what they do but the Motley Fool probably does it better than me:\n\n \"The artificial intelligence (AI)-driven platform targets and engages with those coping with chronic conditions whose lives can improve with behavioral change. The company then delivers its insights to patients either in-person or via telehealth connection with a healthcare professional.\n\nLike Livongo, Ontrak partners with employers and healthcare plans to find, treat, and support those with behavioral health conditions, eventually delivering medical expense savings upwards of 50%.\"\n\nA lot of people have been comparing OTRK to LVGO over the last few weeks. For those who don't know, LVGO is a &gt;12B market cap stock who deals with telehealth for diabetes. They grew heavily in 2019 and 2020, with revenue going from $40M to $91 M in Q2 2020. They are now positive cash flow, whereas they were bigly in the red a year ago. From this growth their stock has seen over a 400% increase in value.  \n\nGuess which company has similar financial to the old LVGO. OTRK made 17 M in revenue (+124% YoY) in Q2 2020, but is debt ridden and has negative cash flow. They shot up almost 100% on the earnings beat to $60 and now have a market cap of $1B. This seems like a fair valuation, as they're following the footsteps of LVGO but still need a few more years to get there, right? WRONG\n\nIn the OTRK earnings call, their CEO Terren Peizer gave guidance for 90 MILLION total revenue in 2020. They're at less 30 Million after two quarters. That's some rapid fucking growth. The CEO seems a little sketchy. He did some work in 1983 as a highly yield bond salesman and he ratted on one of his buddies to the SEC in exchange for immunity. I don't trust the guy and you shouldn't either. \n\nBut, their CEO is pumping the shit out of this company, and who the hell is going to tell him he's wrong until their next earnings report when we actually get to see what they've been up to. Their $1B market cap should probably be $3B by the next earnings call if people buy into his projections. That's a stock price of $60-$180.\n\nThis company is possibly a scam, so be wary, but this shit could pump to the moon. \n\nDISCLAIMER: These options have relatively low volume and large bid/asks. Don't try and make hella trades with this shit. Get into a position you like and hold it for a few weeks. \n\nTLDR: Buy OTM options on OTRK dated no later than November.",

For the United States specifically, every state and territory ordered or recommended school closures\u2014affecting upwards of 55 million students across the country. Wary of the achievement gap that could spur from prolonged closures, the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) has recently released [guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools-faq.html) for reopening schools. Moreover, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York [recently announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/nyregion/cuomo-schools-reopening.html) that schools can decide to open so long as they are in a region where the average rate of positive coronavirus tests is below 5 percent over a two-week period.\u00a0\n\n**Efficacy of School Reopening: Lessons from Other Nations**\n\nExtended school closures impact students in a variety of ways: it fosters learning loss, weakens social and emotional skills, entrenches abuse in unstable homes, and can lead to a decline in nutritional health. Cognizant of the importance of in-person instruction, multiple countries have already set guidelines to reopen their schools:\n\n*Denmark*\n\n* In Denmark, students were to stay 2 meters apart wherever possible, were grouped into \u201cbubbles\u201d of 12, and were required to wash their hands every two hours but not to wear masks.\u00a0\n\n*Germany*\n\n* In Germany, their government cut class sizes in half, had one-way hallways, staggered breaks, masks for teachers and free twice-weekly Covid-19 tests for students and teachers.\n\n*Taiwan*\n\n* In Taiwan, students returned to school and were required to go through temperature checks at school entries and to wear face masks. Additionally, Taiwan left school reopening to a more localized decision to account for differing infection rates in the country.\n\nIn each of these nations, case and mortality counts continued to decline after reopening schools\u2014a positive indication that school reopenings have been effectively implemented with a variety of guidelines.\n\n**Concerns With School Reopening**\n\nAlthough some governments were able to successfully reopen schools, other governments were not as successful. In Jerusalem, over 100 students and 15 staff members were infected after an outbreak occurred at a high school. To alleviate the spread of COVID-19 in schools, the CDC recommends more research on mitigation strategies (i.e. face masks, the use of cohorting, social distancing).\n\nThe Council of Chief State School Officers estimated that schools would need between $158.1 billion and $244.6 billion in additional funding to open safely.\u00a0\n\nOn top of the estimated [158.1 billion to 244.6 billion dollars](https://ccsso.org/blog/ccsso-submits-cost-estimate-safely-reopening-public-schools-after-covid) school are estimated to need to open safely, considering that the United States has recently surpassed five million virus cases, school reopenings could pose a harm to children\u2014especially considering that the response to COVID-19 has not been as effective as other nations that have reopened schools.\n\n**Financial Impacts**\n\n*Stocks*\n\nOnline educational institutions and virtual schools have seen increases in enrollment as a result of extended school closures. Publicly traded company K12\u2014which currently owns 40% of the market\u2014saw [stocks rise 21%.](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-03-05-public-markets-watch-for-coronavirus-impact-on-edtech-stocks) Chegg, a popular service for study materials and tutors, has seen stocks rise [87% in the last year.](https://investorplace.com/2020/07/5-online-education-stocks-that-can-expand-your-horizons/)\n\n*Costs to School Districts*\n\nThe pandemic will cost states [$555 billion over fiscal years 2020 to 2022.](https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/states-continue-to-face-large-shortfalls-due-to-covid-19-effects) Seeing as school districts rely on state funding and local tax revenue that is likely to be cut because of rampant unemployment, it is likely that districts will have to resort to laying off employees or lessening the quality of education. This occurred during the Great Recession when the Clark County School District in Nevada [laid off upwards of 500 employees in a single year.](https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2011/01/13/16landscape.h30.html)\n\nLet us know what you think!",

        "selftext": " \n\n **Tinley Beverage Company ($TNYBF $TNY)** makes award winning cannabis beverages in California. The flavors are designed to replicate alcoholic drinks like Fireball, Margarita, Moscow Mule, Malibu Coconut Rum, Amaretto, Kahlua. They also offer non-alcoholic ready to drink cocktails under the Beckett's brand names, available at Bevmo, and soon to begin trials at warehouse stores like Sam's or Costco.\n\nThey built a new plant with a high-tech bottling line, which recently received its license, and will soon be commissioned into use. In addition to making their own drinks, they are expected to announce copacking deals to make cannabis drinks for their clients. Former NBA player Baron Davis is on board as an advisor, he helped grow and sell Vitaminwater. Here are some of their key upcoming events anticipated by long-term shareholders. Particularly of interest are the copacking deals to manufacture beverages for other cannabis companies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q2 Financials (Ending June 30th) will be out in just a few short weeks.** To give you an idea what this might look like: As of June 24th, \"the Company has fully exhausted its inventory of Tinley\u2122 \u201927 multi-serve products, which were produced at the Company\u2019s recently-decommissioned Phase 2 facility. The Company\u2019s inventory of carbonated, ready-to-drink products is nearly depleted\". \"The Company expects to generate initial co-packing revenue in Q2 from pre-production packaging services\". These numbers will be interesting nonetheless. As a comparison, at March 31st, the Company had $174,000 in revenues for the first 3 months of the year, and $277,807 in finished goods. The releases subsequent have laid it out black and white, this product has been SOLD. When it hits the financials is another question, but it is coming. There will obviously be a period of time throughout Q3 that some product would not be widely available until the most recent production at Long Beach.\n\n**The Company's Long Beach Facility is fully licensed (and producing)!** As of July 2, \"the initial run of Tinley\u2019s\u2122 \u201927 products will include the Company\u2019s new Tinley\u2019s\u2122 \u201927 Arabica Cask.\" There had been some speculation as to whether this would happen \"mid-July\". As stated, \"the Company expects the first bottling run to take place in the facility by mid-July.\" Since this time, pictures with multi-serve beverages, mainly the Cinnamon Cask, have come to light. Remember that the Coconut Cask is the Company's number 1 seller. Reading between the lines, one can infer that even though the Cinnamon pictures came out a few days ago, the Coconut Cask was most surely produced before then. Production would have been occurring over the past few weeks as a result. As of July 29 interview with Jeff Maser and Money Works Magazine, production was in the works at that very moment in time, and had been for some time already.  Single serves will be completed after the multi. The team is working to get California stocked.\n\n**A massive consumer trend in non-alcoholic beverages has emerged while many of us have been shareholders, right under our noses.** Further to the Money Works Magazine interview, one development that has taken hold over the last year or two is that a massive, massive, consumer trend has emerged in non-alcoholic beverages. This has occurred during the time many of you have been shareholders. The massive demand for this emerging trend is prudent to capture; it had an estimated market share of $18 Billion last year alone, growing in the triple digits in certain markets around the world. The company has diversified its risk by focusing attention to it, and used their know-how and resources to capitalize on this astronomical growth. Remember, the Company's principals are the best of the best in the beverage space (their bio's are at the bottom of this post). They're making strategic decisions on behalf of shareholders, allocating time and efforts where money is to be made. Bear in mind that although infused beverages are the Company's bread and butter (Tinley's), regulations have made its rollout much slower than that of Beckett's (non-infused line). Beckett's can be rolled out very easily (using the same great taste and formulations already developed), while regulators take their time to make many facets of the business easier (or more difficult?). Revenue recognition is also much, much faster with Beckett's. Banking regulations unfortunately make revenue recognition much slower with Tinley's. Some have pointed out that Jeff has only mentioned Beckett's lately. In Canada, there is an extremely fine line when talking about the two business lines. The regulations do not allow for a cross marketing of the two. You either talk about Tinley's, or you talk about Beckett's, not both. Be cognizant of this.\n\n**The Company has at least 4 commitments from supermarkets/chains for Beckett's.** The June monthly CSE report (form 7) stated, the company is \"working to obtain additional grocery, liquor store and other retail placements for its beverages\". The July report had a slight change of wording: the Company is \"working to begin trials at the previously-disclosed grocery and warehouse chains, as well as obtain additional grocery, liquor store ecommerce and other retail placements for its non-infused beverages\". This indicates they are one step closer to a rollout. Jeff indicated in the most recent interview with Money Works Magazine that they \"ramped up production;\" producing more Beckett's last week for these demos.\n\n**Closing of the current Private Placement will happen today.** Since its announcement several weeks ago, the share price has held steady, but the most important development here - nearly 5 million shares have been purchased, in the open market, over this time. (Most likely bought off of those selling to buy in on the private placement). That is one incredibly large position that was taken over the past month. The placement took a bit of time due to some last minute due diligence by one of the houses taking interest, which is not unusual in the industry.\n\n**Celebrity endorsements are coming.** There have been some questions coming up as to why this has not happened yet. It has always been important to ensure the Company had ample inventory, and distribution in place prior to announcing these. It is **absolutely imperative** to have this in place before letting celebrities endorse and tell their followers. There have been many examples of celebrities doing such with other products, only to have inventory and website issues unable to handle the newfound demand. With beverages, you only get 1 shot to win over the consumer. Get it right, the first time. With Long Beach up and running, it is safe to say the Company is one step closer to releasing this news. The Company is \"working to finalize initiatives with prominent figures **(with an S)** in sports and entertainment for marketing of Tinley products and co-packing clients\u2019 products.\"\n\n**Copacking. There has been \"a ton of interest\".** The May 27th release is most important here: Mr. \\[Baron\\] Davis is currently working on marketing initiatives and development of new products for the Company\u2019s own products and its expected co-packing clients\u2019 products. We also know that the copackers are \"well known\". There is some major money to be had here...\"Well Known\" being the key words \ud83d\udcf7;) With the July 2nd licensing news, \"the Company is now in a position to consummate agreements in its pipeline of prospective co-packing clients, and it will update the market as such agreements come to fruition.\"\n\n**Canada will be announced \"shortly\"** regarding Beckett's, and Tinley's. When this happens, remember that Canada is a very, very large piece of real estate. The product will hit, but it's rollout and availability won't happen in a single day. It will take some time. You may see it in Toronto right away for example, but may take some time to reach its way to Vancouver. The logistics are quite immense.\n\nAs shareholders, to truly be a part of the company's success, it is absolutely imperative to share the story with friends, family, business owners, neighbours. Let's hit the ground running.\n\nTo summarize, In no particular order, be sure to watch out for the following:\n\n\\- Q2 financials\n\n\\- fully commissioned production facility announcement\n\n\\- copacking arrangements\n\n\\- Beckett's chains announcements\n\n\\- territorial expansion (Canada etc)\n\n\\- marketing and celebrity endorsements\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the Company and its main principals, feel free to read below (I absolutely encourage those who do know to have a re-read),  it will give you an idea of just how connected the Company is in the beverage space, or if you have any doubt. I hope this has been a great help for those who may have been in the dark on a few of the Company's developments.\n\nCheers!\n\n**Richard Gillis, President, Western USA**\n\n\u2022 Previously President, Youngs Market Company \u2013 US$3 billion in annual sales; 2nd largest beverage alcohol distributor in Western USA\n\n\u2022 EVP/General Manager of Coca-Cola Enterprises, Southwest USA\n\n\u2022 30 years in various senior positions in the beverage and CPG industries\n\n**Jeffrey Maser, Founder, CEO of Becketts (non-infused) Canada**\n\n\u2022 Previously in beverage branding and product strategy at the Watt Design Group, a subsidiary of Cott Corporation during period when Cott was the largest beverage company in the world after Coca Cola and Pepsi\n\n\u2022 10 years in venture capital, merchant and investment banking with a focus on emerging industries\n\n**Ted Zittell, Director &amp; Brand Manager**\n\n\u2022 Previously President of Cott\u2019s Retail Brands International, where he led the creation and launch of premium retailer brand and marketing programs worldwide\n\n\u2022 Senior partner at The Watt Design Group for 17 years (including during period of ownership by Cott Corp.)\n\n\u2022 Senior consultant for McMillan Doolittle LLP, a leading Chicago-based retail and consumer experience agency\n\n\u2022 Advisor for US private equity and investment funds in the food and beverage sectors\n\n\u2022 Recent executive-level engagements include work for Walmart, Kroger, CVS Pharmacy, P&amp;G, Nestl\u00e9, Loblaws, Sainsbury's and Tesco\n\n**Mark Benadiba, Advisory Board**\n\n\u2022 Previously CEO, Cott Canada and EVP Operations, USA\n\n\u2022 Board of Directors, Cott Corporation (2008-2017)\n\n**Andrew Stodart, Advisory Board &amp; Tinley Canada Lead**\n\n\u2022 Launched Crystal Head Vodka and brought from concept to nationwide North American distribution in 18 months\n\n\u2022 Oversaw the launch of Dan Aykroyd Wines at Diamond Estates Wines and Spirits\n\n\u2022 International brand manager for Black Velvet Whisky (Constellation Brands); built from a declining brand into the 3rd-largest selling brand in its category\n\n\u2022 Various roles at Patron Tequila and Everfresh Juice\n\n**Baron Davis, Advisory Board**\n\n\u2022 Two-time NBA All Star; played for the Charlotte Hornets, Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers, Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks\n\n\u2022 Early Vitaminwater\u00ae investor\n\n\u2022 Entrepreneur and Investor in Film and Music Production, Publications, Merchandise and Retail, Beverage, Finance, Real Estate, and Technology\n\n**Curt Marvis, Director**\n\n\u2022 MTV Lifetime Achievement Award recipient\n\n\u2022 Previously President, Digital Media, Lionsgate Entertainment (NYSE:LGF.A)\n\n\u2022 Founder and CEO, QYOU Television (TSXV:QYOU), an LA &amp; Toronto based, millennial-focused television &amp; media company distributed in 35 countries\n\n**Douglas Fulton, Director**\n\n\u2022 LA-Based, European Emmy Award-winning television executive\n\n\u2022 Co-Founder of LA Christine, a line of premium skincare products\n\n**Ben Knight, Advisory Board**\n\n\u2022 Founder of CMX Distribution and 420 Central Brand Stores in California\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **Corporate Presentation:** [https://drinktinley.com/wp-content/uploads/Tinley-Corporate-Presentation-Q2-2020-1.pdf](https://drinktinley.com/wp-content/uploads/Tinley-Corporate-Presentation-Q2-2020-1.pdf)",
