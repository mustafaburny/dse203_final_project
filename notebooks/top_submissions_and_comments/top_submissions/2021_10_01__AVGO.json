        "selftext": "Global datastream is exploding (clouds, sensors, internet,...) and these systems/devices can't hold this anymore. The world is looking for solutions. Because of the **numerous advantages of \"photons\" (light) in comparison with \"electrons\"**, photonic circuits (to \"use\" this photons) will be implemented in almost every electronic device (**datacom, 5G, LiDAR , medical devices, sensors, quantum computing, neurotrophic computing,...**) and thereby replacing the old, expensive and limiting electronic structures, in the near future (couple years from today).\n\n**Just like the internet, hydrogen, electric vehicles, green stocks,...the photonic circuit market is forecasted to take off.** Timing: we are now at the inflection point. The global market for Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) is projected to reach US$3.7 billion by the year 2027, trailing a post COVID-19 **CAGR of 22.7%** over the analysis 2020 through 2027.\n\nAfter years of development by a topclass highly experienced team, **POET Technologies (POETF)** now has the technology (the \"POET interposer platform\") to use photons in devices with outstanding performance, well covered by &gt;70 patents. POETs solution eliminates costly discrete component testing and packaging processes because it is produced with all the customer's custom componentry at wafer scale (nothing needs to be soldered, connected, positioned and so forth later on, after the chips have been sliced and diced out of their wafer). Each interposer is tested and verified while it is still within the wafer with its hundreds of siblings. Imagine the time a cost savings of being able to do that. Potential customers: facebook, broadcom, arista, nokia, alibaba, accelink, jabil, delta, hisense, huawei,... They also have **4 committed customers** (POET said they will announce more info soon), lots of requested **samples**, two **design wins** and a joint venture with **SANAN IC** for mass production soon. **Nasdaq** (in q4/q1) ticker \"POET\" is reserved. Their first market of interest is **datacom**. Price target: **9,56usd**, 12-18 months (Investment bank IBK Capital Corp). **DD/POET: reddit page.**\n\n**Other companies diving into photonics: Lightwave Logic, Intel, NeoPhotonics -**\\&gt; check them out as well. They have very good/brilliant tech, but, they all still have fundamental flaws that POET's optical interposer platform improves upon. Photonic devices depend on a high coupling of light. POET's waveguides are low (light) loss. Intel and Cisco's solutions are high loss in comparison. POET's solution can work with a wide variety of light, from visible to near infrared. Intel and Cisco's solutions can't. Intel and Cisco's solution have no micro-optics integration capability where as POET's platform does. Perhaps most importantly, Intel and Cisco's solution can't scale, where as POET's can. A **partnership** with for example LWLG (skyrocketed in june) is absolutely possible.\n\nA product (the POET interposer platform) that completely outperforms (e.g. most versatile, lowest noice, lowest costs, highest speed) the current industry standard in a huge new market in front of us, I personally think that's **very interesting, so I want to share this with everyone here** (I read here: \"don't hesitate to tell us about a ticker we should know about\"). Also, most people still don't know this is happening. I hope everyone can at least think about it. I hope we can have a **nice conversation** about this and share our thoughts. Questions can be asked. For people downvoting or nonbelievers, I want to hear **your opinion**. Thanks to everyone in advance. Not financial advice.",

        "selftext": "There is a lot of debate in the investing world about the relevance of valuation metrics like the PS ratio, especially in the current climate where valuations across the board have become inflated relative to history. Some people go as far as to say that PS is irrelevant as long as the company is growing strongly. But I've started paying much closer attention to the PS ratio for the following reasons.\n\n1) I came across this article: [http://www.sionna.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dont-be-Fooled-by-the-PS-Insight-Piece.pdf](http://www.sionna.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dont-be-Fooled-by-the-PS-Insight-Piece.pdf). It's just over 2 pages including charts so I'm not going to bother with the tl/dr. It's worth a read.\n\n2) I conducted my own little analysis of stock performance during the 2010-2020 decade, which covers a large chunk of the longest bull market in history. I made a list of all the best performing stocks over that period, added a few notable IPOs from earlier in the decade, and then looked up their highest PS ratios. Here's the list in descending order of highest PS ratio:\n\nDXCM: 123.25 (which it hit on its IPO and then dropped sharply immediately after)  \nOLED: 58.35 (which it hit early, then dropped)  \nWDAY: 32.8 (hit early, then dropped)  \nMKTX: 31.45 (hit recently)  \nABMD: 29.98 (temporary spike, then dropped sharply)  \nTWLO: 27.82 (hit recently)  \nSPLK: 26.65 (hit early, then dropped)  \nNVDA: 25.65 (hit recently)  \nNOW: 25.53 (hit recently)  \nMA: 23.37 (hit recently)  \nREGN: 20.99 (hit on IPO, then dropped sharply)  \nFB: 18.40 (hit early and has been on a long decline since)  \nFTNT: 17.77 (hit recently)  \nEXR: 17.27 (hit recently)  \nZEN: 15.97 (hit recently)  \nNFLX: 12.67  \nFICO: 11.66  \nGOOG: 9.37  \nTTWO: 8.81  \nAVGO: 8.01  \nTDG: 7.89  \nAAPL: 7.80  \nTRU: 7.59  \nSTZ: 6.28  \nCTAS: 6.15  \nZNGA: 5.75  \nAMZN: 4.51  \nDPZ: 4.35  \n\n\n**Observations**\n\n1) From the entire list only 4 stocks hit a PS ratio over 30 at the highest. And almost all the stocks on this list are the best performing stocks of the past decade.\n\n2) In every single case of a PS ratio over 20, that level was only reached temporarily - either early in the decade, a brief spike somewhere along the line, or very recently. THERE ISN'T A SINGLE CASE IN THE SAMPLE OF A STOCK TRADING AT A PS RATIO OVER 20 FOR ANY SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME.\n\n3) The biggest and most successful tech stocks of the last 10 years (the FAANGs) don't even appear anywhere near the top. Facebook's had the highest PS ratio of 18.40, which it hit very early. AMZN's PS ratio has never even hit 5!  \n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe numbers don't lie. The simple truth is that stocks can't trade at high PS ratios for very long because their growth rates can't justify a high PS ratio over the long term. Eventually the stock will a correct, either through price (by selling off) or through time (by trading flat for a long period of time). What this means is that the upside potential for high PS stocks is very limited. The holy grail is to find companies trading at a low PS ratio while also exhibiting strong revenue growth and solid margins. If I find a stock I really like but is trading at a very high PS ratio, I will put it on my watch list and wait for the valuation to come down. The best opportunity is when the stock sells off on a disappointing earnings report. This does mean I might miss the occasional exception to the rule, but history shows those exceptions virtually don't exist.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 29, 2021**\n\nThe remarkable rally in equities continued, with stocks jumping despite two of the largest companies, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), posting disappointing earnings results in an otherwise solid earnings season. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) both closed the week at record closing levels.\n\nComing into Q3 earnings season, market participants were worried the persistent supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances would hamper corporate profits, so it is very encouraging to see companies holding up better than expected. Recent economic data has also contributed to the bounce in equities. \n\nAfter suffering its first -5% dip in September, the SPY has come back with a vengeance, advancing more than 7% from the October 4 bottom. In this same time period, the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped a staggering 10% and the Dow Jones (DIA) gained 5%. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I publicly remained bullish during September volatility and consistently encouraged dip-buying via this recap. Happy to say the strategy, as it has all year, worked great and personally resulted in my most profitable month all year. Hope some of y'all took advantage. Never try to fight market trends, much easier to ride them until you can\u2019t anymore. As I have said for like six months at this point, I think the trend will change once the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes. When that happens, I\u2019ll reassess my position. Until then I see any and all dips as buying opportunities. \n\nAmazon (AMZN) shares dropped after the e-commerce juggernaut missed third-quarter expectations and forecasted a jump in expenses in the fourth quarter due to supply chain disruptions and rising costs for labor, materials and freight. These factors are expected to generate \"several billion dollars of additional costs\" to Amazon in the current quarter, the company said in its earnings statement. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Earnings:** $6.12 vs $8.92 per share expected\n* **Revenue:** $110.81 billion vs $111.6 billion expected\n* Q4 Guidance: Amazon forecast sales between $130 billion and $140 billion\n* **Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime Subs:** $55.9 billion\n* **Net product sales:** $54.9 billion\n\nApple (AAPL) also disappointed Wall Street in its fiscal first-quarter results, with key iPhone sales missing expectations, with the launch of the iPhone 13 hampered by the global shortage in semiconductors that forced Apple to massively cut down on production, new rules that allow third-party payment systems in the App store, and supply chain issues, which Tim Cook says cost the company more than $6 billion. Key Apple suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM) fell on the miss. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **EPS:** $1.24 vs. $1.24 estimated \n* **Revenue:** $83.36 billion  vs. $84.85 billion estimated, up 29% year-over-year \n* **iPhone revenue:** $38.87 billion vs. $41.51 billion estimated, up 47% year-over-year \n* **Services revenue:** $18.28 billion vs. $17.64 billion estimated, up 25.6% year-over-year \n* **Other Products revenue:** $8.79 billion vs. $9.33 billion estimated, up 11.5% year-over-year \n* **Mac revenue:** $9.18 billion vs. $9.23 billion estimated, up 1.6% year-over-year \n* **iPad revenue:** $8.25 billion vs. $7.23 billion estimated, up 21.4% year-over-year \n\nEarlier in the week, a report showed US GDP decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) announced it will be rebranding under new name \u201cMeta\u201d and the ticker will change to MVRS starting December 1. This is to reflect the company\u2019s emphasis into investing in the metaverse, a 3D shared virtual space accessible via VR.\n* Following the post-earning surge, Microsoft (MSFT) unseated Apple (AAPL) as the world\u2019s most valuable company by market cap. \n* Tesla (TSLA) shares continued their monster run, closing above $1100 for a new all-time high. Congrats bulls, we getting paid!\n* Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) disclosed plans to expand drilling in the top US shale basin in West Texas after posting biggest quarterly profits in years amid elevated energy prices.\n* Squid Game Director Hwang Dong-hyuk confirmed there will be a season 2 but said he is \u201cnot a priority\u201d right now. Netflix (NFLX) stock was up 2.5% today to reach a new ATH. After lagging other tech companies in the last year or so, Netflix stocks has been on absolute fire following the release of Squid Game, the most popular show ever on the platform. It is reported Netflix made roughly $900 billion from the show. \n* Shares of Starbucks (SBUX) plummeted 6% after reporting earnings miss amid slowing sales in China.\n* The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation into NVIDIA (NVDA) plpanned $54 billion bid for semiconductor designer ARM. Very basically, the problem is that tons of companies, including Apple\u2019s new M1 chip are designed using ARM architecture, other chip companies are worried that NVDA\u2019s takeover could damage competition. In response NVDA has insisted it would maintain ARM as a \u201ctech neutral\u201d supplier.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Oppenheimer from $165 to $170 at Outperform.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 29, 2021**\n\nThe remarkable rally in equities continued, with stocks jumping despite two of the largest companies, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), posting disappointing earnings results in an otherwise solid earnings season. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) both closed the week at record closing levels.\n\nComing into Q3 earnings season, market participants were worried the persistent supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances would hamper corporate profits, so it is very encouraging to see companies holding up better than expected. Recent economic data has also contributed to the bounce in equities. \n\nAfter suffering its first -5% dip in September, the SPY has come back with a vengeance, advancing more than 7% from the October 4 bottom. In this same time period, the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped a staggering 10% and the Dow Jones (DIA) gained 5%. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I publicly remained bullish during September volatility and consistently encouraged dip-buying via this recap. Happy to say the strategy, as it has all year, worked great and personally resulted in my most profitable month all year. Hope some of y'all took advantage. Never try to fight market trends, much easier to ride them until you can\u2019t anymore. As I have said for like six months at this point, I think the trend will change once the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes. When that happens, I\u2019ll reassess my position. Until then I see any and all dips as buying opportunities. \n\nAmazon (AMZN) shares dropped after the e-commerce juggernaut missed third-quarter expectations and forecasted a jump in expenses in the fourth quarter due to supply chain disruptions and rising costs for labor, materials and freight. These factors are expected to generate \"several billion dollars of additional costs\" to Amazon in the current quarter, the company said in its earnings statement. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Earnings:** $6.12 vs $8.92 per share expected\n* **Revenue:** $110.81 billion vs $111.6 billion expected\n* Q4 Guidance: Amazon forecast sales between $130 billion and $140 billion\n* **Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime Subs:** $55.9 billion\n* **Net product sales:** $54.9 billion\n\nApple (AAPL) also disappointed Wall Street in its fiscal first-quarter results, with key iPhone sales missing expectations, with the launch of the iPhone 13 hampered by the global shortage in semiconductors that forced Apple to massively cut down on production, new rules that allow third-party payment systems in the App store, and supply chain issues, which Tim Cook says cost the company more than $6 billion. Key Apple suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM) fell on the miss. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **EPS:** $1.24 vs. $1.24 estimated \n* **Revenue:** $83.36 billion  vs. $84.85 billion estimated, up 29% year-over-year \n* **iPhone revenue:** $38.87 billion vs. $41.51 billion estimated, up 47% year-over-year \n* **Services revenue:** $18.28 billion vs. $17.64 billion estimated, up 25.6% year-over-year \n* **Other Products revenue:** $8.79 billion vs. $9.33 billion estimated, up 11.5% year-over-year \n* **Mac revenue:** $9.18 billion vs. $9.23 billion estimated, up 1.6% year-over-year \n* **iPad revenue:** $8.25 billion vs. $7.23 billion estimated, up 21.4% year-over-year \n\nEarlier in the week, a report showed US GDP decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) announced it will be rebranding under new name \u201cMeta\u201d and the ticker will change to MVRS starting December 1. This is to reflect the company\u2019s emphasis into investing in the metaverse, a 3D shared virtual space accessible via VR.\n* Following the post-earning surge, Microsoft (MSFT) unseated Apple (AAPL) as the world\u2019s most valuable company by market cap. \n* Tesla (TSLA) shares continued their monster run, closing above $1100 for a new all-time high. Congrats bulls, we getting paid!\n* Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) disclosed plans to expand drilling in the top US shale basin in West Texas after posting biggest quarterly profits in years amid elevated energy prices.\n* Squid Game Director Hwang Dong-hyuk confirmed there will be a season 2 but said he is \u201cnot a priority\u201d right now. Netflix (NFLX) stock was up 2.5% today to reach a new ATH. After lagging other tech companies in the last year or so, Netflix stocks has been on absolute fire following the release of Squid Game, the most popular show ever on the platform. It is reported Netflix made roughly $900 billion from the show. \n* Shares of Starbucks (SBUX) plummeted 6% after reporting earnings miss amid slowing sales in China.\n* The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation into NVIDIA (NVDA) plpanned $54 billion bid for semiconductor designer ARM. Very basically, the problem is that tons of companies, including Apple\u2019s new M1 chip are designed using ARM architecture, other chip companies are worried that NVDA\u2019s takeover could damage competition. In response NVDA has insisted it would maintain ARM as a \u201ctech neutral\u201d supplier.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Oppenheimer from $165 to $170 at Outperform. Stock currently around $150\n* Amazon (AMZN) with two target raises. Stock currently around $3375.\n   * Truist Securities from $3800 to $4000 at Buy  \n   * JP Morgan from $4100 to $4350 at Overweight\n* Floor and Decor (FND) target raised by Wells Fargo from $140 to $150 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "I would like to make my stock portfolio a little more interesting. It is currently very boring, because for 7 years I only bought Vanguard World and iShares MSCI World and since this year also BRK.B &amp; S&amp;P 500.\n\n- DG \u20ac - iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF USD (Acc)\n- UK\u00a3 - Vanguard FTSEDvpWldExUKEqIdx A\u00a3 - FPC9.LN\n- IB$ - BRK.B - 71 - $19,968.75\n- IB$ - CSPX - 30 - $13,308.82 - iShares Core S&amp;P 500\n\nI'm very happy with the earnings but I would like to learn a bit more about the stock market and don't fully understand things yet. My friend suggested QQQ and I work in the tech industry myself, so would love to go a little more tech heavy.\n\nWhat is the difference between?\n- NASDAQ 100 EUR ACC\n- NASDAQ 100 USD ACC\n\nI understand that hedged funds ensure that you can't make a loss on the exchange rate difference between the EUR-USD, but I already have many holdings in US$, \u20ac and \u00a3 and I travel a lot and spend a lot of time in South-East Asia, Latin America and only sometimes in Europe, so I don't worry about currency exchange rates too much. If I see that the hedged has 2% less profit (27%) versus the unhedged (29%) over the year, that seems quite expensive to me, considering the average growth rate for most ETFs is around 7%.\n\nFurthermore, I see that certain NASDAQs refer to themselves as QQQ and others describe themselves as NASDAQ, but their holdings are not defined by the index. They invest massively in Netflix, Broadcom and Johnson &amp; Johnson, that doesn't seem like an improvement over the market. Their NASDAQ-100 title seems a bit misinforming to me. For example: https://www.lyxoretf.nl/nl/retail/products/equity-etf/lyxor-nasdaq100-ucits-etf-acc/lu1829221024/eur\n\n- Top 10 Index Constituents\n- Top 10 Replacement Basket\n\nPrimary Example: https://i.imgur.com/KdTJjwjh.png\n\nExample2: https://i.imgur.com/rMG0sX0.png\nExample3: https://i.imgur.com/qVBJMkz.png\n\nThe holdings are not exactly correct either. I guess there might be some delay, due to price fluctuations in stock or transactions that have not yet been included, meaning it's a little out of date I guess.\n\nFurthermore, does it matter much on which exchange you buy a QQQ (= NASDAQ)? The volume doesn't matter that much, does it? Just that the price difference between BID and ASK gets smaller with a larger volume? Even with iShares NASDAQ 100 UCITS ETF EUR Hedged (Acc) - NQSE on Trading 212, the difference between BID and ASK price seems to be quite low. So that Interactive Brokers has a volume of 1 million and other brokers only 1000, shouldn't matter much?\n\nVolume here at night is very low: https://i.imgur.com/MRe8ipBh.png",
