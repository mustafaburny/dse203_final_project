        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, March 3rd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-3-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow futures jump after Tuesday\u2019s early gain fizzles and reverses\n\n&gt; * The Dow is set to rise 200 points Wednesday after late-day selling reversed strong gains earlier in Tuesday\u2019s session. Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.\n\n&gt; * The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street\u2019s open. U.S. companies are expected to have added 225,000 new jobs in February compared to January of gains 174,000 positions. The ADP lately has not been the best predictor of the government\u2019s monthly jobs report, which comes out Friday.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Senate to begin debate soon on $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill\n\n&gt; * The Senate is expected to start debate as soon as Wednesday on its version of the House-passed, $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for \u2018every adult\u2019 by end of May\n\n&gt; * The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate \u201cevery adult in America\u201d by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. The announcement came as the administration works to increase production of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s newly cleared single-shot vaccine, and rival Merck agrees to pitch in.\n\n&gt; * The Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi both announced Tuesday that they\u2019re lifting mask mandates in their states and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity even as the decline in new daily Covid-19 cases slows. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Monday warned states against lifting public health restrictions too quickly.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. America\u2019s biggest firms push for path to citizenship for \u2018Dreamers\u2019\n\n&gt; * America\u2019s biggest companies are urging Congress to establish a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. In a letter Wednesday, a coalition of more than 100 companies and trade associations \u2014 including Facebook, General Motors, Marriott, Target, Visa and Uber \u2014 asked Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to pass the bipartisan Dream Act of 2021. The move comes as Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill look to immigration as a major legislative priority.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Stocks to watch: Rocket Companies, Las Vegas Sands, Oscar Health\n\n&gt; * Rocket Companies fell 6% in Wednesday\u2019s premarket trading after more than doubling over the past three sessions. On Tuesday, the Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage parent surged over 71% on no apparent news. The heavily shorted stock appears to have garnered bullish interest from day traders on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum.\n\n&gt; * Casino operator Las Vegas Sands said Wednesday it would sell its Vegas real estate and operations to private equity giant Apollo Global Management for about $6.25 billion. The properties include the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Shares of Las Vegas Sands were up almost 3% in the premarket. Apollo fell nearly 1%.\n\n&gt; * Oscar Health is set to debut Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The health insurance startup backed by Google-parent Alphabet priced its initial public offering Tuesday evening at $39 per share, above the already-raised expected range of $36 to $38. The IPO gives Oscar Health a market value of $7.7 billion ahead of trading.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mFJEZLD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DZktsvp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/Yq2hHN9S/econcal1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FFV78Chq/econcal2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/zRvHdP7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/PbURZ3R.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oqzviWR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HGdMXO8.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/978P5c5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/2Ltoqja.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/d0wfH06g/upgradesdowngrades1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/52wGSzBw/upgradesdowngrades2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/nh8gm2DF/upgradesdowngrades3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/85n5bWw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3PemF5S.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/0YIFXZl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lyft-las-vegas-sands-wendys-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lyft (LYFT)** \u2013 The ride-hailing company said that last week saw the highest level of ride volume since the pandemic took hold last March.

        "selftext": " \n\nI imported SIMM (Single Inline Memory Modules), between 1994 and 2006, for my branded computers.\n\nIn that time period, I watched the \"chip\" market more than I did the precious metals market - they moved daily and prices for each type of module was set by noon, each day.\n\nMy companies imported tens of thousands of SIMMs from Singapore, Taiwan, China, Spain, and a few other countries. The paperwork required at customs, in Anchorage, was due to an \"Anti Dumping Tax\". This was to prevent North Korean manufactured chips to be imported (as it should be). At the time, Goldstar became a producer of IC (Integrated Circuitry), chips as it could not keep up with the television innovations. BUT... Goldstar was a SOUTH Korean company, with no embargo, yet monitored closely. Thy produced a great product, however, they were also counterfeited easier and therefore, \"a radioactive\" product.\n\n&gt;***Side Note:***\n\nLG Semicon LLC, was a producer, specializing in IC chips. One company bought the other and both Goldstar and LG Semicon became what we now know as LG.\n\nBack in those days tracking the manufacturing of chips was crucial (no pun intended), because of the daily swing of the prices. The determining factors (which I looked at), were :\n\n* Production capacity of each factory.\n* Daily production numbers of computers.\n* Intel ($INTC), AMD, ($AMD), Microsoft ($MSFT), Compaq, HP ($HP - Hewlett Packard, at one time, \"absorbed\" Packard Bell Computers), and other mass consumers/assemblers of IC chips for PCBs (Printed Circuit Board), including details of motherboard designs and IC requirements.\n* Mother Nature and her wrath \"overseas\".\n\nThe computer makers, DELL ($DELL), Gateway, and Compaq always had first choice of available chips, due to their deep pockets and demand.\n\nA few companies in Asian countries figured out that by closing a factory, for a day or a week, they could, effectively, increase their profits quickly. This effected the entire \"Technology Sector\", although it did not exist yet.\n\n&gt;**Points:**\n\n* Always ask \"Why\".\n* \"Due Diligence\" is not just 2 levels deep. Sometimes you have to find out who is selling the sand/silica, first.\n* In this market, \"What goes down, usually comes up\". Write that down.\n* VIVA LA #REDDIT AND FREE TRADE !!",

(that's my own understanding.) for  example,\n\n&gt;Hydrogen  opportunities were investigated during the quarter and continue with a  growing interest in the space from industry and government. The  synergies between wave energy and hydrogen production strengthen  productionstrengthen the case and Carnegie has been particularly focused  on opportunities that encompass existing target markets such as  islands,  remote areas, and marine energy consumers including fish  farming. In parallel, enabling technologies are being developed by a  variety of companies that are complementary to Carnegie\u2019s activities.   For example, electrolyzers,  the  devices  that  produce  hydrogen  from   water and  electricity,  are being developed can now use seawater as  their hydrogen source rather than freshwater  \nHydrogen   is most likely to play a  role as long/medium-term storage or as a   fuel source for vessels and generators. Carnegie\u2019s role in the Blue  Economy CRCis providing good insight into the topic of hydrogen in the  marine space and opportunities will continue to be identified.\n\nthis  is basically a long-term play and they will specify it in there as  well. Imo I see the demand for renewable energy. I feel like there will  be heavy reform on how Companies and consumers use energy in the  following 50 years. they specify that in the report.\n\n&gt;Carnegie  continues to seegrowing vision and support for offshore renewables  around the world as demonstrated by actions such as the European  Commission publishing a dedicated EU strategy on offshore renewable  energyin November 2020(An EU Strategy to harness thepotential  of   offshore  renewable  energy  for  a  climate  neutral  future). The EU\u2019s  strategysupports an objective of achievingat least1 GW of ocean energy  by 2030 and 60 GW of oceanenergy  by  2050.

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 1.24% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 1.07%. At session lows, both the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 erased 2021\u2019s gains. \n\nThe moves lower came even after a new report on weekly unemployment claims came in better than expected, pointing to improving employment trends. \n\n* **Initial jobless claims:** 745,000 vs. 750,000 expected and a revised 736,000 during the prior week. \n* **Continuing claims:** 4.295 million vs. 4.300 million expected and 4.419 million during the prior week\n\nDuring a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be \u201cpatient\u201d in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, \u201cIf we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.\u201d\n\nAs Treasury yields continue to rise, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-growth names that led the markets in 2020. Technology stocks came under exceptional selling pressure as traders turned their focus to stocks poised to benefit more directly from an impending economic reopening. At the same time, the recent, rapid rise in Treasury yields has also deterred investors from growth stocks, with interest rates closely tied to borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to around 1.544% at the time of writing. \n\nIn other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently.

        "selftext": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/kj2uu8/some_noob_dd_for_some_interesting_canadian/\n\n(Link is deleted now, but I posted this when PyroGenisis was around $3/share and HPQ was around 85c.)\n**Here's the deleted post**\n&gt;Some noob DD from me. I think these stocks are a great long term hold. Don't use this as advice, do your own DD. Informative purposes only\n\n&gt;I've been looking at PyroGenesis (PYR.TO) ever since they announced they were looking to uplist on NASDAQ. PyroGenesis Canada Inc. designs, develops, manufactures, and commercializes advanced plasma processes and systems in Canada and internationally. They are involved in Metals, Waste management, Innovation &amp; Custom Process development (HPQ-Silicon), Plasma Torches (see previous DD by /u/Greasyfork\n\n&gt;Two of their main products piqued my interest- \n\n&gt;1)- Plasma torches\n\n&gt;These plasma torches are an environmentally friendly alternative to using fossil fuels in the Iron Pelletization industry. Currently PyroGenesis is the only company that has a patent for such a process in the industry. \n\n&gt;Just recently, they announced they had a contract with a major iron ore supplier equaling $3.6M\n\n&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-signs-initial-plasma-torch-213000493.html &gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-signs-additional-1-1mm-133500724.html\n\n&gt;It also mentions there that \"The Client, which has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions, has over ten (10) plants, each possibly requiring up to 50 plasma torches.\" - That's approx $500-600M future revenue that the client has committed to purchase exclusively from PyroGenesis. PyroGenesis will also be providing after sale services to this client for additional revenue\n\n&gt;That is just ONE contract with one company. Expect many more contracts over the years as more companies decide to ditch fossil fuels and go with a more green solution\n\n&gt;2- Innovation &amp; Custom Process development (HPQ-Silicon)\n\n&gt;That brings to the second company on my radar, HPQ Silicon Resources (HPQ.V, OTC:URAGF) They are involved in the exploration, mining, and production of silicon metals, solar grade silicon metals, and porous silicon wafers.\n\n&gt;A few months ago, PyroGenesis &amp; HPQ Silicon signed an agreement to develop The PUREVAPTM NSiR process. Once up and runing, HPQ NANO can deliver to advanced materials companies and battery manufacturers a cost competitive, tailor-made product, that can replace graphite in batteries and thereby allow the deployment of truly powerful next generation Li-ion batteries\n\n&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hpq-silicon-pyrogenesis-sign-nano-170500452.html\n\n&gt;PyroGenesis then sold the IP rights of the PUREVAP\u2122 NSiR process which included a 10% royalty for any sales which PyroGenesis can convert into a 50% ownership of HPQ\n\n&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-signs-3m-contract-hpq-174600535.html\n\n&gt;Before they even started any production, they already have an order for the material from a major Car manufacturer \n\n&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hpq-nano-receives-first-order-190300952.html\n\n&gt;And earlier today, they announced that their first reactor has been commissioned and is ready to start production. \n\n&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hpq-nano-reaches-major-milestones-141000141.html\n\nSince that post- there have been a number of developments- PyroGenesis stock price is now at $7.7ish (peak of $12) (which IMO is a great buy-in point) &amp; HPQ price is around $1.1 (peak of ~$1.6)\n\nJanuary 12- they announced implementation of a NCIB- When the company thinks their share price is undervalued, they can opt to buy back some shares thus reducing supply &amp; increasing value for shareholders\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-announces-implementation-ncib-133500312.html\n\nJan 21- HPQ announced that their Gen1 Nano Silicon Reactor Exceeds Expectations\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-announces-implementation-ncib-133500312.html\n\nFeb 02- PyroGenesis filed form 40-f with the SEC\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-files-form-40-f-204300768.html\n\nFeb 18- Nasdaq application all but approved\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-provides-listing-application-nasdaq-192500547.html\n\nLast time the market had a bit of a correction (Feb 23) and the stock price went from around $11 to $7ish, the company put put a press release specifically stating that everything was on track, no financing planned, company has cash, etc\n\nYesterday, they announced a new appointment to the board of directors-Mr. Ben Naccarato who has over 30 years of experience in the sector. BUT what I found interesting was tucked away at the end of the press release- \n\n\"Separately, the Company is pleased to announce today that it has entered into a lease agreement for an additional 31, 632 sq. ft. which will almost double its existing manufacturing footprint in Montreal, QC, Canada.\"\n\nSo they are planning on doubling their manufacturing capability\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-pleased-announce-appointment-mr-212000379.html\n\nAll in all, I think this is a very good long term investment- they are the only leaders in the Plasma industry and they have 2 (other) products that I havent mentioned, they are the only non-US based company to have their equipment on US navy aircraft carriers and have a lot of other things going for them\n\nAs always, I am not a financial advisor, I just like the stock. do you own DD",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, March 3rd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-3-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow futures jump after Tuesday\u2019s early gain fizzles and reverses\n\n&gt; * The Dow is set to rise 200 points Wednesday after late-day selling reversed strong gains earlier in Tuesday\u2019s session. Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.\n\n&gt; * The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street\u2019s open. U.S. companies are expected to have added 225,000 new jobs in February compared to January of gains 174,000 positions. The ADP lately has not been the best predictor of the government\u2019s monthly jobs report, which comes out Friday.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Senate to begin debate soon on $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill\n\n&gt; * The Senate is expected to start debate as soon as Wednesday on its version of the House-passed, $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for \u2018every adult\u2019 by end of May\n\n&gt; * The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate \u201cevery adult in America\u201d by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. The announcement came as the administration works to increase production of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s newly cleared single-shot vaccine, and rival Merck agrees to pitch in.\n\n&gt; * The Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi both announced Tuesday that they\u2019re lifting mask mandates in their states and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity even as the decline in new daily Covid-19 cases slows. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Monday warned states against lifting public health restrictions too quickly.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. America\u2019s biggest firms push for path to citizenship for \u2018Dreamers\u2019\n\n&gt; * America\u2019s biggest companies are urging Congress to establish a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. In a letter Wednesday, a coalition of more than 100 companies and trade associations \u2014 including Facebook, General Motors, Marriott, Target, Visa and Uber \u2014 asked Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to pass the bipartisan Dream Act of 2021. The move comes as Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill look to immigration as a major legislative priority.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Stocks to watch: Rocket Companies, Las Vegas Sands, Oscar Health\n\n&gt; * Rocket Companies fell 6% in Wednesday\u2019s premarket trading after more than doubling over the past three sessions. On Tuesday, the Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage parent surged over 71% on no apparent news. The heavily shorted stock appears to have garnered bullish interest from day traders on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum.\n\n&gt; * Casino operator Las Vegas Sands said Wednesday it would sell its Vegas real estate and operations to private equity giant Apollo Global Management for about $6.25 billion. The properties include the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Shares of Las Vegas Sands were up almost 3% in the premarket.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, March 3rd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-3-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow futures jump after Tuesday\u2019s early gain fizzles and reverses\n\n&gt; * The Dow is set to rise 200 points Wednesday after late-day selling reversed strong gains earlier in Tuesday\u2019s session. Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.\n\n&gt; * The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street\u2019s open. U.S. companies are expected to have added 225,000 new jobs in February compared to January of gains 174,000 positions. The ADP lately has not been the best predictor of the government\u2019s monthly jobs report, which comes out Friday.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Senate to begin debate soon on $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill\n\n&gt; * The Senate is expected to start debate as soon as Wednesday on its version of the House-passed, $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for \u2018every adult\u2019 by end of May\n\n&gt; * The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate \u201cevery adult in America\u201d by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. The announcement came as the administration works to increase production of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s newly cleared single-shot vaccine, and rival Merck agrees to pitch in.\n\n&gt; * The Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi both announced Tuesday that they\u2019re lifting mask mandates in their states and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity even as the decline in new daily Covid-19 cases slows. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Monday warned states against lifting public health restrictions too quickly.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. America\u2019s biggest firms push for path to citizenship for \u2018Dreamers\u2019\n\n&gt; * America\u2019s biggest companies are urging Congress to establish a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. In a letter Wednesday, a coalition of more than 100 companies and trade associations \u2014 including Facebook, General Motors, Marriott, Target, Visa and Uber \u2014 asked Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to pass the bipartisan Dream Act of 2021. The move comes as Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill look to immigration as a major legislative priority.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Stocks to watch: Rocket Companies, Las Vegas Sands, Oscar Health\n\n&gt; * Rocket Companies fell 6% in Wednesday\u2019s premarket trading after more than doubling over the past three sessions. On Tuesday, the Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage parent surged over 71% on no apparent news. The heavily shorted stock appears to have garnered bullish interest from day traders on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum.\n\n&gt; * Casino operator Las Vegas Sands said Wednesday it would sell its Vegas real estate and operations to private equity giant Apollo Global Management for about $6.25 billion. The properties include the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Shares of Las Vegas Sands were up almost 3% in the premarket. Apollo fell nearly 1%.\n\n&gt; * Oscar Health is set to debut Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The health insurance startup backed by Google-parent Alphabet priced its initial public offering Tuesday evening at $39 per share, above the already-raised expected range of $36 to $38. The IPO gives Oscar Health a market value of $7.7 billion ahead of trading.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mFJEZLD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DZktsvp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/Yq2hHN9S/econcal1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FFV78Chq/econcal2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/zRvHdP7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/PbURZ3R.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oqzviWR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HGdMXO8.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/978P5c5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/2Ltoqja.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/d0wfH06g/upgradesdowngrades1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/52wGSzBw/upgradesdowngrades2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/nh8gm2DF/upgradesdowngrades3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/85n5bWw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3PemF5S.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/0YIFXZl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* OCGN\n* KMPH\n* RKT\n* TRXC\n* UWMC\n* OVID\n* FUBO\n* DIA\n* HZON\n* GENE\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lyft-las-vegas-sands-wendys-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lyft (LYFT)** \u2013 The ride-hailing company said that last week saw the highest level of ride volume since the pandemic took hold last March.
