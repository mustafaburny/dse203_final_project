        "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3\n\nGME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \\[Redacted\\] as a payment option.\n\nNewcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\u00a0We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.\n\n**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \\[redacted\\], a new \\[redacted\\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.\n\n**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker\u2019s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it\u2019s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.\n\n**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford\u2019s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.\n\nSOME FAQ\u2019s:\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*",

        "selftext": "I have done so much DD on this play and I really want to share it with you guys since WSB is the reason I started investing over a year ago.\n\nIn this post I'm going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed. Hint: it crashed big time yesterday. You know the one.\n\nThere is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.\n\n#Topics of discussion:\n\n* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks\n\n* WDC Fundamentals\n\n* Bear case\n\n#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early\n\nWDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&amp;A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. \n\n#Fundamentals\n\nWDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&amp;P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.\n\nWDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&amp;P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.\n\n#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it\n\nAn industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.\n\nThe new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. \n\nLet's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.\n\nThe network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.\n\nBut wait - there's more.\n\nWDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.\n\nA company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.\n\n#Bear case\n\nNobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.\n\nThe second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.\n\nThe third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. \n\n#Summary TL;DR\n\nHDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Positions\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n[157 shares (Canadians unite!)](https://i.imgur.com/6y4p3ax.jpg)\n\n[1 leap Jan '23 70c](https://i.imgur.com/SAqvMhA.jpg)\n\nI believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency. STONKS ONLY GO UP",

        "selftext": "As the cloud &amp; big data continues to grow, as well as social media &amp; 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.\n\nLarge social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups(usually to tape). Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.\n\nThe need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.\n\nThere is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace\n\nFor reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021\n\nChia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.\n\nI have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.\n\nThis may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.\n\nIf we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.\n\nWhat's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.\n\nSeagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.\n\nMy positions: ~$21k Western Digital, ~$6k Seagate",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 24, 2021**\n\nAfter weeks of volatility, stocks rallied today as fears over rising inflation forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy tempered. As I have said for weeks, there are several reasons I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, which saw the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) lose 4% in three trading days, was overdone and I am glad to have taken advantage of the dip particularly in technology stocks. The SPY closed 1.01% and is only 3 points away from its all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.68% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed .56% higher. \n\nAs the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures \u201ctransitory\u201d.\n\nMoreover, while the market was shaken by the April Consumer Index, as has been reiterated in the recap before, the Federal Reserve has consistently said they are looking towards significant progress in the labor market before any significant adjustments to monetary policy are considered. In the Federal Reserve\u2019s April meeting minutes, \u201cparticipants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee\u2019s maximum-employment and price-stability goals\u201d.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.\n\nOn a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also said a number of participants suggested\u201d that as the economy continues to quickly, \u201cit might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase\u201d, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, it\u2019s important to note the meeting toke place before the release of the April Jobs report, which greatly bolsters Powell and other monetary officials' argument that the labor market remains below the Fed\u2019s targets and roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic times. onth. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)\n\nMichael Jones, CEO of Caravel Concepts said, \u201cI do think it's been a pretty healthy sideways chop. It's taken out some of the speculative excess. The biggest pullbacks have been in some of the most pricey names. That all feels very healthy to me.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.\n* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.\n* Investors have rejected a record number of executive compensation plans in non-binding votes of U.S.-listed companies this year, objecting to pay rises and the easing of performance targets in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an analysis by consulting firm ISS Corporate Solutions. I hope this trend continues moving forward and urge shareholders to continue voting no on potential compensation plans. A record 14 S&amp;P 500 companies had more than 50% of investors reject executive pay packages so far this year. \n* Ford Motor Co said on Monday its new electric F-150 Lightning Pro for commercial customers would be available at a starting price of $39,974.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price\\*\\***\n* Argenx (ARGX) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $321 to $324 at Overweight.

Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.\n\nThis may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.\n\nWhat's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins.\n\nSeagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021**\n\nStocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain in the Nasdaq (QQQ). After the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered.\n\nNew economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April, compared to March, even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US. The Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. \n\nYesterday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and that the Fed was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be \u201coverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.\u201d \n\nRichard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said \u201cthere will come a time in upcoming meetings\u201d when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that \u201cit is going to depend on the flow of data\u201d. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.\n\nThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn\u2019t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Great vaccination numbers coming out in the US. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States has administered 289,212,304 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 359,849,035 doses. 165,074,907 people had received at least one dose, while 131,850,089 people are fully vaccinated as of Wednesday morning. For context, the entire US population is roughly 328.2 million.\n* Amazon (AMZN) announced that former CEO of Amazon Web Services Andy Jassy will formally take over as CEO of the e-commerce giant on July 5. A few months ago, Jeff Bezos, current CEO and founder, announced he was stepping down and transitioning to a role as the Executive Chairman.\n* Shares of Ford (F) jumped more than 8% after the company said it was raising it\u2019s investment on electric vehicles from $22 to $30 billion. The company recently announced the all-electric F-150.\n* Amazon announced it was purchasing Hollywood movie studio MGM Holdings for $8.45 billion, bolstering Amazon\u2019s streaming service. Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios said, \u201cThe real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM\u2019s talented team. It\u2019s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling \"\n* Mortgage applications slid by the most since early April last week, with a decline in refinances dragging down overall loan volumes even as purchases ticked up for another week. The Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) weekly market composite index for mortgage applications fell 4.2% during the week ended May 21. This followed a 1.2% rise during the prior week.\n* Volkswagen sold more than 206,000 electric vehicles over the past 12 months in Western Europe, more than double the 102,500 made by Tesla over the same time period, according to Schmidt Automotive Research. \n* **\\*\\* Please note that the current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price.\\*\\***\n* Agilent Technologies (A) with a host of target raises.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 18, 2021**\n\nStocks held steady today, with the three major indexes trading within a 0.5% range of the even line. It\u2019s encouraging to see the market holding steady after the volatility experienced in the last few weeks. As I have said before, I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, where technology stocks sank and the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 4%, was overblown for a few reasons that will be explained below. \n\nLast week, the market tumbled in the largest loss since February after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April Consumer and Producer Price indexes, which showed a larger increase than expected.  The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. \n\nThe PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year.\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint exact causes, there seem to be several factors contributing to the rise in inflation, none of which I think pose a significant threat to the sustainability of the current bull market.  First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. \n\nSecond are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. As basic economics shows us, when demand begins to outstrip production capabilities (aka supply), prices inevitably go up. One prominent example of this you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. \n\nThird are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt\u2014incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs\u2014recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, \u201cGiven the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying \u201cEven with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve\u2019s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.\n\nNow that we understand why inflation may be rising, these are the reasons I think fears are overblown. With the US economy reopening, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures \u201ctransitory\u201d. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, \u201cAmid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\u201d \n\nMoreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be \u201ctransitory\u201d as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, \u201cWe want to see a string of months like that \\[like in March\\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there\u2019s a very large group of people who are not.\u201d Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell\u2019s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fourth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. \n* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan \"proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States\u201d and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories \"to build advanced vehicles and parts.\"\n* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie \u201cThe Big Short\u201d, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry\u2019s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available. \n* Square (SQ), one of the leading fintech companies, launched services in Ireland, it\u2019s first foray into the Eurozone as the company looks to expand beyond the US.\n* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday volatility\\*\\***\n* Amazon (AMZN) target raised by Citigroup from $3750 to $4175 at Buy.

Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered in recent weeks, with the SPY roughly 3 points away from its record level. \n\nThis week, the indexes have largely consolidated, an encouraging sign following the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May. Market participants continue to look towards incoming economic data to further judge whether inflation will lead to a sustained jump in prices, causing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, or be a transitory side-effect as the US economy roars back following the coronavirus-induced recession. Personally, I am in the latter camp and am not concerned about sustained inflation. \n\nTodd Jablonski, chief investment officer at Principal Global Asset Allocation said, \u201cInflation has gone from being on no one\u2019s radar screen maybe five years as a lead concern, to now being at the absolute forefront as you see the economy rebound off of COVID lows.

The bottom indicator is called Ultimate RSI which is basically RSI but with Bollinger bands. IDK what the red and green dots are, they seem to give pretty shit signals so just ignore them. The blue line on the ultimate RSI indicator is the actual RSI reading. The rest of the lines are moving averages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD:** Looks like a big ass head and shoulders pattern with the lines I have drawn as support resistance. I expect a lot of chop here. If AMD follows through with the head and shoulders, I think $63 is possible. Break through the bottom yellow line (73) would indicate head and shoulders in play. However, it is in an uptrend channel so as long as it follows the channel trendlines, it's still bullish.\n\n[AMD on daily](https://preview.redd.it/cfp2j6g2mex61.png?width=1571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f76b6cbcce4a10b944b03fa6de817690fde1995)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WDC:** As of [Burry's last 13F filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921003819/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml), he held WDC and it looks like it's been consolidating for a big move. There seems to be bearish RSI divergence (yellow line on the RSI indicator) which is a bearish sign.\n\n[WDC on daily](https://preview.redd.it/r38vk2zylex61.png?width=1569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=423b0e722f24001fb77f7f19d46752a1b52d8deb)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CAT:** This just broke out today from either a triangle or a bull flag. The earnings call was good but puked it but ever since people have been bidding it back up which is definitely bullish IMO.

Looks like some form of a head and shoulders although I can't say for certain where the neckline is. IMO, if IWM breaks and starts to bleed, it will have a lot of major effects in the market. Reason is that a lot of retail is holding stock in the overvalued companies that are in the Russel 2K. Same for QQQ and tech. If retail starts to feel fear and they start selling en masse, it could get ugly. But for now, IWM seems to be in an uptrend for the past month. \n\n[IWM 2H chart](https://preview.redd.it/usq4ir8soex61.png?width=1573&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92fca7e31d87d9596f7b11f0832d2aa3900be492)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DIA:** Like the other indices, the Dow is also in a period of consolidation but it appears to have broken above today and retested the previous resistance. IMO, this could be a result of sector rotation into \"safer\" stocks. \n\n[The Dow on 2H](https://preview.redd.it/uhoi9anxpex61.png?width=1569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67e179ea1cf3062f57b38cda8b7dcc8ac08c03f0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SPY:**  Most heavily traded ETF and most popular derivative of the S&amp;P 500, SPY is also in a zone of consolidation. Break below would get ugly, break above would be the Fed continuing to go BRRRR. That being said, there does appear to be some bearish RSI divergence on SPY. \n\n[SPY 2H](https://preview.redd.it/lksypnxnqex61.png?width=1574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07f5537167f83fe17bb91855b953b8d3e627b618)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GDX:** GDX is gold miners. GDX failed to follow through with the head and shoulders and instead broke out of a bull flag. Gold will follow the miners so this is bullish for gold.\n\n[GDX 2H](https://preview.redd.it/6ubcrwy3rex61.png?width=1582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88336d52c31ac409eadef7788c8c8d8b70abf412)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GLD:** Last but not least, gold. Gold appears to be in the midst of a cup and handle that's been 7 years in the making. If GDX goes higher and GLD follows, this is gonna be a nasty play. That being said, since the time frame for the pattern to form has taken 7 years and the candles are weekly, it wouldn't be a massive gain in a short period of time. It would be a much longer long. GLD is currently retesting the handle resistance which is now support. \n\n[GLD 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/c5djlqjlrex61.png?width=1573&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8d42be0095a2317ee7b8a9c89cb62d9d80b1905)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Read the entire thing. \n\nIf you have questions, lmk. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a financial expert.",

        "selftext": "Recently a crypt0-currency called Chia came out as off April 30th, and the unique thing about this coin it, with a bunch of other things, mines on storage. Like hard drives and SSDs. Long story short it was a success, so far, and even before the coin went public articles like this [one](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chia-500-percent-increase-adata-high-capacity-ssd-sales) were talking about shortages of storage devices due to miners buying them in advance. \n\nYou can see the chart below shows the total storage on the network, and it has become parabolic.\n\n[Storage on network](https://preview.redd.it/63yobwxnybx61.png?width=1495&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c68e8d1f4a60a71369c5c12d28c96e378b2deb9)\n\nAs long as the price maintains its current state of 600+ a Chia, then this should only grow. This is based on some mining calculators that basically say it is still a very profitable endeavor.\n\nWDC is one of the most pure play storage options. They have a significant presence in Asia too, which is important. They make bulk size hard drives, which is what lots of miners want. If Chia coin maintains its explosion and the price stays high, then it WDC will do well. On top of the explosion in PC gaming, which also requires storage, it can lead to a shortage, but typically, companies like Western Digital will do well in those situations.\n\nThe game plan?\n\n2Q earnings are going to be awesome, so I will load up on some calls before then, but that isn't till awhile. I think the best thing would be to potentially buy stock, and most importantly, keep  an eye on the stock. Fundamentally they are also great given the good financial position they are in and are set to have a killer year. The current earnings rolled over into the next few months show them in better position then in 2018, where they reached a high of $106.\n\nPosition: 10 shares of WDC. Potentially adding options if they ever seem attractive and probably before earnings, unless the thesis changes.\n\n***This is not financial advice. Please trade and invest at your own risk. I own various option positions in WDC.***",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 27, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly as market participants looked toward the new weekly jobless report. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered in recent weeks, with the SPY roughly 3 points away from its record level. \n\nThis week, the indexes have largely consolidated, an encouraging sign following the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May. Market participants continue to look towards incoming economic data to further judge whether inflation will lead to a sustained jump in prices, causing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, or be a transitory side-effect as the US economy roars back following the coronavirus-induced recession. Personally, I am in the latter camp and am not concerned about sustained inflation. \n\nTodd Jablonski, chief investment officer at Principal Global Asset Allocation said, \u201cInflation has gone from being on no one\u2019s radar screen maybe five years as a lead concern, to now being at the absolute forefront as you see the economy rebound off of COVID lows. There has been a tremendous acceleration in earnings, coupled with massive monetary and fiscal stimulus.\u201d\n\nmembers of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and that the Fed was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be \u201coverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.\u201d \n\nRichard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said \u201cthere will come a time in upcoming meetings\u201d when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that \u201cit is going to depend on the flow of data\u201d. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.\n\nThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn\u2019t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Labor\u2019s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March. \n\n* **Initial jobless claims, week ended May 22:** 406,000 vs. 425,000 expected and 444,000 the week prior\n* **Continuing claims, week ended May 15:** 3.642 million vs. 3.680 million expected and a revised 3.738 the week prior\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Boeing (BA) agreed to pay at least $17 million to settle enforcement cases with the Federal Aviation Administration over production issues with its 737 jets. Stock reacted positively to the news. \n* Durable goods orders, or orders for manufactured goods intended to last at least three years, unexpectedly declined in April, ending an 11-month streak of increases, the Commerce Department said Thursday, an encouraging sign. \n* \u201cMeme stocks\u201d are on the move again, with AMC gapping up 40% on the day. Gamestop (GME) and AMC have both been on monster runs this week.\n* Paytm, India\u2019s largest digital payment platform, is reportedly aiming to go public later this year with a valuation of $25-$30 billion.\n* Shares of Ford (F) have been on fire since the company announced it was making a big investment to manufacture EVs and recently unveiled the all-electric Ford F-150 pickup, one of the company\u2019s most popular models. \\\\\n* Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are all involved in a bidding process to provide cloud services to Boeing, according to multiple reports. \n* Disney\u2019s (DIS) California-based parks will welcome non-California natives starting June 15.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written in the morning and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) with three target raises. Stock currently around $137\n   * JP Morgan from $146 to $160\n   * Susquehanna from $155 to $170 \n   * Mizuho from $155 to $158 \n* Burlington Stores (BURL) target raised by Telsey Advisory Group from $320 to $370 at Outperform.

        "selftext": "I have done so much DD on this play and I really want to share it with you guys since WSB is the reason I started investing over a year ago.\n\nIn this post I'm going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed. Hint: it crashed big time yesterday. You know the one.\n\nThere is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.\n\n#Topics of discussion:\n\n*Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks\n\n*WDC Fundamentals\n\n*Bear case\n\n**If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early**\n\nWDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. They did saw a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&amp;A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. \n\n#Fundamentals\n\nWDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&amp;P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.\n\nWDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&amp;P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.\n\n#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it\n\nAn industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.\n\nThe new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. \n\nLet's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.\n\nThe network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.\n\nBut wait - there's more.\n\nWDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.\n\nA company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.\n\n#Bear case\n\nNobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.\n\nThe second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.\n\n#Summary TL;DR\n\nHDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Positions\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n[157 shares (Canadians unite!)](https://i.imgur.com/6y4p3ax.jpg)\n\n[1 leap Jan '23 70c](https://i.imgur.com/SAqvMhA.jpg)\n\nI believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency. STONKS ONLY GO UP",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 18, 2021**\n\nStocks held steady today, with the three major indexes trading within a 0.5% range of the even line. It\u2019s encouraging to see the market holding steady after the volatility experienced in the last few weeks. As I have said before, I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, where technology stocks sank and the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 4%, was overblown for a few reasons that will be explained below. \n\nLast week, the market tumbled in the largest loss since February after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April Consumer and Producer Price indexes, which showed a larger increase than expected.  The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. \n\nThe PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year.\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint exact causes, there seem to be several factors contributing to the rise in inflation, none of which I think pose a significant threat to the sustainability of the current bull market.  First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. \n\nSecond are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. As basic economics shows us, when demand begins to outstrip production capabilities (aka supply), prices inevitably go up. One prominent example of this you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. \n\nThird are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt\u2014incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs\u2014recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, \u201cGiven the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying \u201cEven with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve\u2019s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.\n\nNow that we understand why inflation may be rising, these are the reasons I think fears are overblown. With the US economy reopening, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures \u201ctransitory\u201d. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, \u201cAmid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\u201d \n\nMoreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be \u201ctransitory\u201d as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, \u201cWe want to see a string of months like that \\[like in March\\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there\u2019s a very large group of people who are not.\u201d Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell\u2019s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fourth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. \n* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan \"proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States\u201d and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories \"to build advanced vehicles and parts.\"\n* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie \u201cThe Big Short\u201d, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry\u2019s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available. \n* Square (SQ), one of the leading fintech companies, launched services in Ireland, it\u2019s first foray into the Eurozone as the company looks to expand beyond the US.\n* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday volatility\\*\\***\n* Amazon (AMZN) target raised by Citigroup from $3750 to $4175 at Buy. Stcok currently around $3270\n* BioNTech (BNTX) target raised by Canaccord Genuity from $230 to $252. Stock currently around $195\n* CVS Health (CVS) target raised by Mizuho from $82 to $98 at Buy.

        "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\n*Processing img 1kx54njxev071...*\n\nGME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \\[Redacted\\] as a payment option.\n\n  \nNewcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)\n\n **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7j2124y9fv071.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91b1207d45ad40ebacddc14e4b82a7d8e71325ca\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\u00a0We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.  \n\n**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \\[redacted\\], a new \\[redacted\\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.\n\n**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker\u2019s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it\u2019s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.\n\n**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford\u2019s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits. \n\nSOME FAQ\u2019s:\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. You can find a sample [here](https://imgur.com/wj1ynfG).  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021**\n\nStocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain in the Nasdaq (QQQ). After the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered.\n\nNew economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April, compared to March, even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US. The Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. \n\nYesterday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and that the Fed was \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be \u201coverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.\u201d \n\nRichard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said \u201cthere will come a time in upcoming meetings\u201d when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that \u201cit is going to depend on the flow of data\u201d. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.\n\nThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn\u2019t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, \u201cWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.\u201d\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Great  vaccination numbers coming out in the US. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States has administered 289,212,304 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 359,849,035 doses. 165,074,907 people had received at least one dose, while 131,850,089 people are fully vaccinated as of Wednesday morning. For context, the entire US population is roughly 328.2 million.\n* Amazon (AMZN) announced that former CEO of Amazon Web Services Andy Jassy will formally take over as CEO of the e-commerce giant on July 5. A few months ago, Jeff Bezos, current CEO and founder, announced he was stepping down and transitioning to a role as the Executive Chairman.\n* Shares of Ford (F) jumped more than 8% after the company said it was raising it\u2019s investment on electric vehicles from $22 to $30 billion. The company recently announced the all-electric F-150.\n* Amazon announced it was purchasing Hollywood movie studio MGM Holdings for $8.45 billion, bolstering Amazon\u2019s streaming service. Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios said, \u201cThe real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM\u2019s talented team. It\u2019s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling \"\n* Mortgage applications slid by the most since early April last week, with a decline in refinances dragging down overall loan volumes even as purchases ticked up for another week. The Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) weekly market composite index for mortgage applications fell 4.2% during the week ended May 21. This followed a 1.2% rise during the prior week.\n* Volkswagen sold more than 206,000 electric vehicles over the past 12 months in Western Europe, more than double the 102,500 made by Tesla over the same time period, according to Schmidt Automotive Research. \n* **\\*\\* Please note that the current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price.\\*\\***\n* Agilent Technologies (A) with a host of target raises.

        "selftext": "I'm going to keep it short (and hope to avoid auto-moderation yanking this off despite it being a valid stock idea and discussion).\n\nYou can read about proof of space [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_space).\n\nBasically, from an interesting [article](tinyurl.com/3bumpnau\n) published yesterday:\n\n&gt;According to the South China Morning Post, hard-drive prices in China have begun to soar as chia miners stockpile storage. The price of 12-terabyte drives has increased by 59% since chia was announced in February this year, and most professional-quality hard drives with more than 8 terabytes of capacity are sold out.\n\n&gt;Vietnam is also seeing hard-drive shortages as a result of China\u2019s chia craze.\n\nAnd the very interesting part is this:\n\n&gt;Even before its official launch, chia has used more than an exabyte of data storage. \n\nIIRC, Seagate sales are about 400 exabytes per year and Western Digital is about the same or slightly more. If proof of space systems get traction and are accepted more widely, you could extrapolate storage usage growing by a factor of 100x or more at which point you're talking anywhere 5-25% of total annual capacity produced with those drives replaced at a rate of 20-30% / year.\n\nRight now, STX is trading at 14 x EV/EBITDA and WDC is trading at 13x EV/EBITDA. Multiples look even better based on '22 consensus EPS.\n\nI am not promoting the viability of proof of space (it doesn't even concern me that much), just the \"picks and shovels\" angle of possibly increased demand for mass storage which could even lead to improved margins.\n\nPlease do your own DD and have a good weekend.",
