Are fucking serious right now Bob Swan? AND you  \nwont bring a 10nm desktop CPU to market until Q2 2021 while it was already 4 years late?  \nYour last earnings call was a fucking joke bobby boy. You tried to play it off like it was  \nall under control. So you went begging to TSMC to let you eat the cum from their sloppy anal  \nseconds. They made fun of you bobby. They even admitted that you're not shit and they are \"rescuing\" you and they  \n\"will not place extra effort to handle the CPU giant's orders\" \\[4\\]. You're fucking nothing.  \nFrom \"CPU giant\" to this?  \nTSM personally has each engineers cock massaged by a Taiwanese fuck-toy every morning before work.  \nTSM has the backing of the american government \\[7\\]. Yeah, a TAIWANESE chip fab is being backed and NOT  \nYOU. What the fuck do you offer bobby? A place so toxic to work that you can;'t even  \nfind a space nice enough keep Jim Keller safe\\[5\\]?

Buy another 8,000 shares at $50. Your terrible excuse for an earnings call sent the stock  \nall the way down to the $40s immediately loosing you money. And guess what? I bought put options  \nat 11:46 AM today. Right before the dip. I have already broke even. I'm going to make  \nmoney of you losing money because a complete idiot and I know more about this business than you. Its so  \nfucking obvious how fucked you are swanny. You might as well stop fabbing silicone wafers and  \nfab a silicone butt for you to fuck during the next earnings call as that would be infinitely more valuable  \nthan whatever you could possible have prepared. What are you going to do, delay AGAIN?

        "selftext": "Dear Retards,\n\nLucky thou are for stumbling upon my post. I have found something value and growth players can get behind. I have found one for my fellow gamers, one for the work-from-homers, one for the anti-socials and for the cocaine and hookers indulgers. **I have found CORSAIR CRSR. This is my top pick for the next six months. Stock options released yesterday. It will only take $10k to make over $100k easily.**\n\nHere's the S-1 for the real mofuckas..mofucka mofuckaaahhh: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312520227100/d507744ds1.htm#toc507744\\_4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312520227100/d507744ds1.htm#toc507744_4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCorsair is a consumer hardware company. They make money from PC components, Xbox and PS controllers and streaming components so your daughter could show off her mosquito bitten chest for the Chad's on twitch. They basically have monopolized the power supply market for the DIY gamers and is how they've built their brand.  Their memory cards are also respectable in the field because memory doesn't compete the way AMD and INTC do for CPU performance. They also make fans, cases, headsets and mice for computers, all of which are starting to become very popular. They acquired SCUF Gaming so they  have a foot in the console space, which is going to see the growth that will be off the charts in Q4 and FY2021 as the printer brrrrs and everyone stays home.\n\nMy DD will include two of the most important things you should seek: **Catalysts and Undervalued Fundamentals**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd because no one seems to give a fuck about fundys these days, we'll start with\n\n**Catalysts:**\n\n**Generally Speaking:**\n\n* **Gaming is making your fatass, cant-run-a-lap-without-stopping, son cool in school. Look at all the stocks of gaming companies. Hard to find a loser.**\n* **Twitch has made it cool to build your own PC**\n* **25 day Quiet period expiration expires Monday**\n* **Economies of scale and catch-up effect (for my econ majors)**\n\n**Q2 2020:**\n\n* **Two high demanding FPS's** in Call of Duty and Valorant release\n* **WFH stipend** employees have been receiving for their WFH conversion; people bought herman millers and your wife's bf built her a new PC with corsair case, fans, PSU and memory cards\n\n**Q3 2020:**\n\n* **Nvidia's 3000 series released in September and sold out immediately.** The GPU is twice as efficient as the next best and for the same price. THIS literally makes people more willing to go big and build a new rig.\n* **Valorant** was released in June, so CRSR really starts benefitting in Q3\n* **Summer,** which means dad has to buy son the PC he built because that idiot got straight C's in school. I heard they hand out medals for every idiot who participates these days.\n* **WFH Stipend** again, as the unemployment rate falls, the amount of money new employees receive increases, incentivizing gamers to build a new PC to watch porn at 240hz ofc.\n* **Market realizes the growth in DIY computer builders because of Twitch and WoM marketing. DIY computer builders -- it has been a long time coming.** I built my first computer when I was 15, over 10 years ago. It's easy as lego's and you get more value out of each dollar spent. It is 100% the trend as well.\n\n**Q4 2020:**\n\n* **AMD** releases and **NVDA supply chain** improvement this quarter will make and have made a lot of people orgasm, more so than previous years. The rise of RH trading this year (increases exposure to the brand), all of which means more DIY nerds building PC's to finish the year\n* **XBOX release** this year 11/10 will be huge for SCUF gaming (WHOLLY OWNED subsidiary), which makes controllers for the new console. The company's ELITE controllers are sold out online. [https://scufgaming.com/xbox](https://scufgaming.com/xbox)\n   * SCUF PlayStation (11/12) controller has not been released yet for the new console\n* **Stimulus is finally coming** to all the broke boys, in a lump sum fashion ($5,200-7,800 federally), which means people will SPEND.\n\n**Q1 2021:**\n\n* Will be an **easy quarter** to compete against because the company has been experiencing income growth starting Q2 2020, not Q1.\n* **Stimulus payment effect**\n* If there's still **no vaccine** by now, holding CRSR will be a great hedge against the market bc as previously mentioned, WFH stipends, PC building and console gaming\n\n**Fundamentals, for my Buffet &amp; Munger enthusiasts:**\n\n**Literally cannot find a cheaper growth stock in the market.**\n\n* 72MM in free cash flow for the first 6 months 2020, with the latter half of the year historically being even stronger. The 6 months was carried by the strong Q2 2020\n* 58% YOY growth in sales in Q2 with 22.6MM in income\n* Q3 2020 will generate 50%+ sales growth, 35MM+ in income and 50MM+ in FCF (Conservative)\n* Q4 2020 will generate 50%+ sales growth, 75MM+ in income and 100MM IN FCF (Conservative)\n* 150MM in net income and 220MM+ in FCF Trailing Twelve Month by Q1 2021\n   * **I was the Math King in Kindergarten, so don't question my quantabilities.**\n* **1.7 Billion market cap**, implying 11x forward p/e and 8x future free cash flow on 50%+ s.g.\n   * Logitech is trading at a forward P/E of 20-25 and is worth 13.6 Billion\n   * Razer is worth 2.5 Billion and doesn't put up the kinds of numbers Corsair does.\n      * **PT estimate: $36-48, but could go to $60 with favorable peer and market conditions**\n\n**TLDR: ALL-IN on corsair. Ride the wave.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positions:**\n\n**Me &amp; WSB autists:** $20-25 Bull Call spread for 12/18, 2/19 and 5/21. A ten-bagger play. If markets crash to end the year, sell 5/21 and load up on 2/19. I have been buying these, but haven't been given the volume I want from the market makers. I have been able to get in 12/18 for .45c, 2/19 at 1.15 and luckily one contract of 5/21 for .60c\n\n**Pussy Boomers AND MM's:** 1 million shares, sell 10,000k $22.5 call contracts and use the premium to buy FD call options. If $25's don't print, roll them over.\n\n**Optional position:** Puts on Logitech **or better yet,** ***Puts on the guy who negatively comments my post because that guy is the biggest idiot in the room. So, click on the negative commenter's profile and inverse the fuck out of that guy's positions.***\n\nIf you actually read my DD, thank you. I'll end by saying only three other times I have ever felt this confident in a play in the last few years. CMG when they were killing people for eating their food, Spotify's DL and FDX when they were trading at $105-130 in April/May this year. If you inverse me here and now, I will crush you.",

        "selftext": "Because Reddit seems to be good at picking out winners not only in the short term, but in 4-5 year time spans as well\u2026 I\u2019ve seen a lot of topics from 2016-2017 where people were bullish on companies like AMD (40x), MSFT (4x), NVDA (20x), TSLA (9x). Some were bullish on failures like GE, and Intel but even if you picked those as well, you still would\u2019ve been up tremendously over the market.\n\nThe stocks that Reddit were hyping 4-5 months ago and are still hyping up today, NET (1.8x), DKNG (2.5x), SQ (3x), ARKK (2x) have also done very well\u2026 And it\u2019s not like these are short term stocks either. They all have huge growth opportunities 5-10 years down the line.\n\nIn contrast on average it takes 7 years for an S&amp;P 500 ETF to 2x. Statistically, it would take 7+ years for my investment in VTI to reach the same % gains as the investment I made in DKNG 5 months ago. Furthermore you\u2019d have to wait 20+ years just for VOO and VTI to reach 8x valuations. Most of us would be in our late 40s, or early 50s by then.\n\nAs a young person I\u2019d rather take a medium risk, high reward opportunity, than a very-low risk low-reward opportunity.\n\nAnd yet over and over again, we\u2019re told that very few people are able to beat the market, and you\u2019re better off just dumping everything into an S&amp;P 500 index fund and holding. But the more I lurk on this subreddit and various other investing communities, the more I question that statement.\n\nI\u2019m thinking many people underperform the market because they make emotional decisions. They try to time the market, sell innovative companies for a measly 1.5x gain only to buy back again at a higher price due to fomo, liquidate everything on the slightest hint of bad news and so forth. Just like the statistic that got posted, where the Magellan Fund averaged 20% / year over 10 years, but the people who bought into the fund actually had a net negative. And overall there are far more investors like that in general rather than people who know to just buy and hold onto a stock with long term prospects.",

        "selftext": "Well, it\u2019s hard to fully explain what I\u2019m feeling right now. At 6:00am (30 minutes before open for me) this morning I sent my girlfriend to her friends place for a couple nights. Cause I knew I was fucked. \n\nI laugh everyday at the crazies that are actually buying weeklies and holding more then two hours, but this time I chose to do so. See I\u2019m a typical conservative day trader, and normally I don\u2019t make completely dumbass decisions, but this time I did. My number one rule is no holding overnight, but this time I disregarded that rule. \n\nI typically daytrade AMD, and overall I\u2019m extremely bullish in regards to the stock itself. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t play both sides based off recent activity of the stock. \n\nNow, speaking strictly with September and AMD it follows the market, and futures fairly respectively. Not this week though. I could get into the insane amount of DD that I\u2019ve put into this fucking stock, but let me honest nobody gives a fuck.  \n\nLong story short bought puts Tuesday at the opening high, didn\u2019t sell on the first dip, and ever since then I\u2019ve done nothing but watch this stock defy everything it\u2019s ever done. I was seriously looking for just one downward decent dip over the past few days that I could sell these puts and switch bullish for more then what they opened as. But that hasn\u2019t happened. \n\nAfter today I\u2019m officially done. My money is completely gone, there is a 0.001 % chance that I\u2019ll recover more then basic change on a hundred dollar bill, because I\u2019ve never once got lucky in the market over the past seven years I\u2019ve been trading, that\u2019s why I only use data, and I don\u2019t normally hold overnight. This time I did though, and now I\u2019m officially done. I\u2019ve worked my fucking ass off on a daily basis making money, even through September making money. I went against my rules and went with instinct one single time and now my entire life is over. Held over night Tuesday, stock defied the overall market every single day since then. I\u2019m down over 100k, lost my day trading rights, and now I\u2019m officially done, I\u2019ll be going all in on $.380 five minutes after close today. \n\nTo those of you holding AMD calls this week congrats, and I wish you all the best, hope that you make millions in the future, and hope that you make better decisions then me in regards to accepting losses, because if you don\u2019t you\u2019ll lose everything. \n\nThe reality of the situation is that my girlfriend will 100% be gone once she finds out I\u2019ve lost all my savings, I support my mother and now I can\u2019t, the one thing I thought I was good at ruined my life, and soon I\u2019ll have nothing left to even somewhat enjoy life with. \n\nThe only reason I got into day trading was to support those I cared about. When I was younger I thought if I ever made the money I would go to college and get a degree so I could get steady income. But I chose to just keep trading. Now I\u2019m just staring at the wall realizing I\u2019m just me at 19 only this time I\u2019m 26. No progress in life, just another lowlife fucking idiot who thought he was more then what he was.

        "selftext": "Scroll down to check out my current/future positions for AMD next week.\n\nRecap: AMD broke out of its cup and handle bullish pattern and there was a \"sell-the-news\" dump. I bought a 94c 10/30 near close. Check out the green 86.88 marker from the update yesterday (last picture on the link below or just click [here](https://preview.redd.it/otrs788xevr51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=040e5637a4599a930e3a78cafbbf8bf2a92a0e8d) (for direct link). We close today at 86.51. Difference of -0.37. \n\nCheck out the [past TA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j601cc/amd_84c_1030_bullish_forecast_for_earnings_run/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nNow. I'm going to get very ambitious here by predicting the highs and lows up until the 16th. THIS IS A THEORY and NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. This will probably bite me in the butt - BUT i can't ignore \"a\" pattern. First, here is the high and low forecast for AMD:\n\n[high and low forecast](https://preview.redd.it/a4setyvqp1s51.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2621f0c424e9b2c02ea0c30157bdc8e4d072871)\n\nHere it is visually on the chart. I cleaned up all the lines and tried to make it as neat as possible. It may look like nothing lines but I don't think they are... \n\nFor this theory to be considered, the 20 EMA needs to climb up the middle and the 55 EMA needs to hug the bottom of the bullish channel - but not over extend past the triangles. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxrqa606t1s51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a11a6899cf4f61b3f0f78685ef397bfbef8795a\n\n[High and lows on the 3m chart](https://preview.redd.it/62clmm8dr1s51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f856182afcd1b40ef75d9aff1c4439c02f4f432)\n\n[High and lows 1D chart](https://preview.redd.it/4eiwws1ns1s51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79f77e8ced3c1e740206cdbeed326f11e8a34018)\n\n\\*\\*CURRENT PLAYS\\*\\*\n\n[current plays](https://preview.redd.it/tovu13a9u1s51.png?width=2158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1b07b250418b2ba5cfa9d06c1425bd492c75ea8)\n\nAt open, I plan on buying 96c with 10/16 expiration and am going to diamond hands until next week. I will also look into buying put with 11-27 since I believe AMD may crash (*maybe even the entire stock market*) I will trade in the AM during market open and not look at it until this weekend since if been up for about 24 hrs straight. \n\nGood luck boys and girls.

        "selftext": "I played COSTCO call options since May and made about $200k. COSTCO is a stock with low intrinsic value options and rewards you well if you are patient. This is not a swing trade or a 10 bagger but in my opinion, it was always a sure thing, hence I was able to buy 100 or 200 call options. I've played other tech options, NVDA, AMD, AMZN, TSLA but it always felt like pure gambling. I made about 40k on NVDA but got burned for 20k on TSLA and AMZN. I don't recommend playing options on tech stocks unless you're YOLOing stimulus money or a paycheck.\n\nOption trading on WSB has become exactly that but there are still handful savvy people that are playing smart. Sure, in the beginning when you have less than $10k, you can take higher risk for higher reward. But when you accumulate over 50k or 100k, you can invest on plays like this that gives you 10-15% return consistently without having to risk losing 80%.\n\nMy advice is once you hit 50k, don't chase option plays like ZOOM or obscure meme plays like PRPL.   \nPlay monthly options on lower intrinsic value call options like WMT or TGT. Don't hold for earnings unless you have options that are over 1 month till expiration.\n\nIf you manage to get past 100k, then put 75k in APPL or AMZN or NVDA and you can do whatever you want with the 25k. This has worked for me and hopefully this inspires this community to play smarter and make money.\n\nNow I will go to local Costco and get some rotisserie chicken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fevp23hboiq51.png?width=1053&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcc0b91dfe2ccfcd8c5ee0ea0eefd0ab2d28a254\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbst9qwgoiq51.png?width=972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0891a965f84b59a91b7341b519bf5588fbe61c7d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpj57o7loiq51.png?width=941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c49437265d557ea40dc8cbc7446a68df76a36c3e\n\nIt wasn't all glory and there were days when my unrealized loss was 30k or 40k but you have to set a price target or an exit date and be discipline. I took this screenshot to remind myself to always be humble and disciplined. I'm still holding some of these and they are now 20k unrealized gain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3o38stz9piq51.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6b3da0b4825d1543c15e1c91996bd1e00480107",

        "selftext": "I have been a long-term investor in AMD and there was a lot of news to unpack in the last weeks as well as an election coming up in a few days. I wanted to give my opinion on the current state of AMD and why at current levels this company is an incredible opportunity for the medium- to long-term investor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo three 3 major events happened in the last few weeks that I want to address:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[**Q3 Earnings Report**](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4a33e72ea85fe760bd81d3f9e8b71721/amd/news/2020-10-27_AMD_Reports_Third_Quarter_2020_Financial_976.pdf)\n\nFirst of all their Q3 results were above expectation again (same as in Q2). EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. **Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$)**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[**35B Xilinx Takeover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMfNlCZPsBQ)\n\nThen there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint:\n\n[AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2020/10/28/amds-35-billion-acquisition-of-xilinx-is-another-stroke-of-strategic-brilliance/?sh=f76ffe71c9f8)\n\n[AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel](https://analyticsindiamag.com/amd-buys-xilinx-chip-intel-impact/)\n\nSince this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in **TAM: Total Available Market**. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets&gt;more chips to sell&gt; &gt;more profits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[**New GPU Reveal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHpgu-cTjyM)\n\nThen there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA\u2019s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: **their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market.**\n\nThis has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and **AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment**. As Jim Cramer said: [He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5ackqH7a40)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RISK**\n\nOf course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won\u2019t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI\u2019ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn\u2019t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update. I shifted my portfolio more towards AMD, and I am suggesting you do the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions:\n\nAMD: 3,000 shares, 6,500 LT Warrants.",

        "selftext": "\\#**WHY #AMD #IS #GOING #TO #THE  #MOON**  \n\n\n\\#1\n\n**Heavily Rumoured New CPUs (including 16 core gaming CPU).**\n\nThis would be revolutionary and will put investors into a complete frenzy. The slide was leaked and confirmed by [videocardz.com](https://videocardz.com) which is a very authentic source for tech news. A 16 core CPU that pulls 105w at a reasonable price will be GAME-CHANGING, and everyone will want to get their hands on it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4y8kvv3blq51.png?width=1569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0e772c7f4963cb569eb0024dcee84fb63b4697e\n\nAlong with this game-changing chip, 3 additional CPUs are rumored to be released.   \n\n\n\\#2\n\n**Big Navi having possibly better performance**  \nThere have been leaks off Newegg of Big Navi being better than the 3080. Even if the cards are neck in neck AMD will be able to paint the 6000 series cards as better due to minor discrepancies.\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\t5,120\t1,500\t16GB GDDR6\t512\t256-bit\t300  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\t3,840\t1,500\t12GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t200  \n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6700 XT\t2,560\t1,500\t6GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t150  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0zjsju2clq51.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14551f974837dfc21662c24da268d5284287d169\n\n  \n\\#3\n\n**NVIDIA 3rd Party Card Catastrophe**\n\n*(this section is from my previous post)*\n\nSo most GPUs are made by a 3rd party. AMD and NVIDIA make the actual \"brain\" of the GPU but 3rd party partners add onto it for better performance (very basic explanation). Don't ask me why this is, it is just mainly because of logistical reasons.\n\nBut that is not the point, the point is that the great majority of GPUs are third-party cards meaning that they get to change around the design of the PCB. The issue here is that some of these third-party partners cheaped out on little capacitors.\n\nBy cheapening out it is leading to bad power delivery. The only way to fix this rn is to downclock the card which the normal person doesn't know how to do and doesn't expect is necessary when they are buying a 500$+ piece of hardware.\n\nI feel like if there is a mass callback that will be bad PR. NVIDIA could always release drivers that make the cards run below their listed spec but i'm not sure if people will really want that even if the performance loss is marginal.\n\nEVGA already confirmed the suspicions that these cards were crashing because of capacitor issues. It may be different for other companies but at least for EVGA this is what they are saying currently.\n\n**But why does this matter??**\n\nPeople who were looking to pick up a next-gen GPU right away are now hesitant and will wait for AMDS offerings. The people who did return their GPUs will also possibly wait. Faulty cards will most likely get a down clock which will make Big Navi look better. It supposedly already is better and this 3-5% difference could really change people's minds.  \n\n\n\\#4 \n\nLisa Su is an absolute unit. She will for sure talk about their timeline and plans for 5nm/3nm. I am guessing that this will rally investors to invest because they will see shinny 5nm/3nm while Intel is just getting to 10nm.  \n\n\n**POSITIONS:**  \n\\+95 call  (exp 12/18)  \n\\- 100 call (exp 12/18)\n\n(*call me a pussy for using a debit spread but I think its the best for my case)*  \n\n\nif you have something else you want to share comments below and I will add it!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu)\n\n[https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications)\n\n*This is not financial advice just me presenting the facts and the possibility of a callback.*  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2ciqo9vdlq51.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d0fa79a87e74390c112a07e8d93a82c5a8476e",

        "selftext": "I owe about 28k in student loans. I currently pay $400 / month towards them. Then after bills I have about +$1500 to work with. I\u2019ve been tossing around the idea of putting an extra $1000 or so a month into boring stocks with the occasional option. \n\nWould this be a better return on money relatively? \n\nI was going through personal finance subreddit and they all seem to say to pay all the debt first?\n\nMy specific situation: \n28k student loans - like 3 or 4 % interest\n10k personal loan - 23 more payments until done.

        "selftext": "**ABSTRACT**\nAll, I will focus here on technical and fundamental analysis derived from AMD\u2019s 10K\u2019s and 10Q\u2019s. The most recent 10K is not yet available since the year is not over. I will link my previous post about AMD which covers a good amount of the background here. Overall, I tried to make this as easy to read as possible without going into too much detail about things so you do not get bored.  \n\n \n\n\n\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j2q2wp/if_you_arent_in_for_amd_youre_missing_out_on_free/  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\t-One of the main critiques in that post is how AMD is limited by TSMC supply. It is true TSCM production is booked and they are competing with Intel. This is due to unprecedented demand for the new series they expect. So, if they kept production at old levels then I do not think this would have been such a critique. Since they already sent out record levels of inventory last quarter, I think this bodes well actually. \n\t-AMD\u2019s GPU\u2019s are not a big money maker for them so I should not have focused on it. They are not a huge money maker yet. If rumors are true, this will be a breakout product rivaling NVIDIA. \n\t-NVIDIA selling out and saying how they are going to have limited supply of new GPU\u2019s is a good thing because it shows demand is high. I cannot state how bad of a take that is. I have yet to see articles confirming retailers (AIB\u2019s) saying they received adequate amounts of GPU\u2019s. This is because their supply chain is destroyed right now. When your only competitor is coming out with GPU\u2019s that will potentially rival yours with no significant supply chain shortages, you\u2019re in danger. \n\t-Why would I buy calls on a stock that\u2019s already run up with a P/E of 160? Because it will run up more.  \n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n  \n\n\n\n**10K/10Q ANALYSIS**\nAlright let\u2019s go over the company and how it is performing compared to previous years. I\u2019ll give you a hint. It\u2019s really good.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nAll data came from SEC EDGAR\nFor all of the following information, if you have critiques or different ways you view this information please comment or PM me so I can hear what you have to say.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/CQSoojt  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo give context, this graph contextualizes the returns of common stock comparing two indices compared to AMD. To summarize, in a 5-year period, AMD has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index by a factor of 10 and the Semiconductors Index by a factor of 7.3.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/fDcnrgI  \n\n  \n\n\nAMD had its first profitable year in a series of years in 2018. The previous years were categorized by Lisa Su heavily investing in new products, trimming fat, and expanding previous profitable divisions.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2015, AMD had net loss of 660 million dollars. In 2016, 498 million loss. In 2017, 33 million loss. In 2018, 337 million income and 341 million income in 2019. At the same times, the net revenue increased for AMD from years 2015-2019 by a factor of 1.98x.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2015, earnings per share was $-.84. It stayed negative for two years after. Actually, this is not a bad thing in the short term. Companies that need clean up like AMD did in 2012 generally have negative earnings due to such heavy investment to revitalize the company. \n-\tIn 2018 and 2019, earnings increased to .34 and .31 respectively.  \n\n \n\n\n\nIt is important to note that in 2015, AMD implemented its restructuring plan that would cause much of the data below and above this  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**Why 2019 was such an important year**\n1: This year signified the launch of the 7nm products, 3rd gen Ryzen\u2019s, Zen 2\u2019s, new Threadripper\u2019s, and new notebooks. \n2: Introduction of the 2nd Gen AMD EPYC family of processors that reduced cost of ownership by 50%.\n3: Net revenue increased from 6.5 billion to 6.7 billion a 4% increase while gross margin increased by 5%. Operating income increased by 180 million and Cash/cash and marketable securities increased to 1.5 billion. \n4: Debt decreased by just under 1 billion dollars compared to 2018 due to large cash on hand and refinancing previous debts.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**COMPONENTS OF REVENUE**  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/8sm7ver  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\nComputing and Graphics= desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPU\u2019s), data center and professional GPU\u2019s and development services.  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nEnterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom= primarily server and embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip products, development services and technology for game consoles.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Computing and Graphics (Hereby known as C&amp;G) increased by over 14% due to increases in average selling price and 4% increase in shipments due to demand. These factors were driven by strong demand of Ryzen processors. A key takeaway here, a 14% increase due to product reception is absolutely massive. IN 2020, ENTIRE NEW SERIES OF CPU\u2019S AND GPU\u2019S ARE COMING WITH PROMISING LEAKS.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nCURRENT 2020= For the 6 months ending June 27, 2020, net revenue was at 3.7 billion. Before release of the major products being announced this month. MAYBE you can start to see why I am writing this.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**FINANCIAL CONDITION**\nHaving debt is actually a good thing. It allows businesses to finance cheaper than equity, debt can be deducted for taxes, and it prevents takeovers. Having too much to the point where you cannot pay back obligations is a bad thing.\n\t- AMD decreased 2019 debt by a billion dollars. You read that correct  \n\n  \n\n\n\nOperating cash flow increased by 460 million.\nInvesting cash flow slightly decreased by 21 million\nFinancing activities increased by 15 million to 43 million.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nJust something that I like that AMD does\u2026\n-\tAMD hedges its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering foreign currency forward contracts. Nothing huge here other than they have yearly losses for this to hedge their exposure.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing their cash flows from previous years, it looks like a completely different company. Their Financial Condition is a company that can pay current debts with a high cash reserve, good amount of debt, foreign market security, and attainable obligations. I chose not to go over notes in Term Debt because I don\u2019t think most people know how they work.  \n\t-But essentially, AMD has senior and convertible notes maturing in 2022 and 2026 totaling 1.3 billion.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFor gross profit, it has increased from 1.78 billion in 2017 to 2.44 billion in 2018 and 2.87 billion in 2019. Their investment into Research and Development has stayed a large part of their cash flows at 1.5 billion in 2019.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n**LETS TALK 2020 AND WHY ITS GOING TO BE INSANE HERE ON OUT**\nAll of what is detailed below is from the most recent 10-Q for data available up until June 27, 2020.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/51lCBl1  \n\n  \n\n\nWe see a revenue increase for the Six Months Ended of almost a billion dollars. In turn, we see a proportional cost of sales increase of 400 million. Profit increased by 500 million as well when compared to the previous year. In a non-spectacular year for AMD compared to 2019 so far, the company is destroying its previous self.  \n\n  \n\n\n\t\n-AMD announcements for new GPU\u2019s and CPU\u2019s are coming this month and I expect them to be released shortly after. I highly recommend you look through my previous post for a lot of technical terms about AMD how its systems work in the comments.\n\t-EPS for 2020 and 2019 Six Months Ended is .27 and .05 respectively. A .$22 change so far.\n\t-Net income is up from 51 million to 319 million.\n\t-Cash and Cash equivalents is upon from 1,466 billion to 1,775 billion when compared to December 2019.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n**SO LETS SUMMARIZE BEFORE WE CONTINUE**  \n\n  \n\n\n\n-AMD is a company that has wildly outperformed all indexes and most companies. I understand how one company should not be compared to indexes with lots of businesses, but for ease of understanding it is here.\n- In 2019 EPS, Revenue, and profit all went up and not in a slight way.\n-Highly anticipated products launches coming out later this year. \n-Massive decrease of debt obligations.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\nSo far, I hope this has been relatively straight forward.  \n\n  \n\n\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n  \n\n\n**NOW LETS TALK ABOUT TRENDS AND NOVEMBER CONCERNS**  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PlUSi2K  \n\n  \n\n\n\nOn November 7th, 2016 right before the big day, AMD was trading at $6.69. A week after jumped to $8.71. At the end of December it was at $11.58. So the first major moment we are looking at really did not have a negative impact. Him winning helped AMD rise.  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n|\n|\n|\nhttps://imgur.com/a/2YrGBxF  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nMarch 17th was when Former VP J0E won 3 states (Florida, Arizona, and Illinois in his primary battle). During this time, COVID was starting to take effect as well. We 3/16 to 3/18 we see a few percent drop after his win is confirmed. I do not think in any way was Former VP J0E\u2019s win related to that. I think it was entirely COVID related and even when comparing AMD to other tech stocks, the drop is minimal at best for the same timeframe.  \n\n  \n\n\n|\n|\n|\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/gYOvj2H  \n\n  \n\n\nAugust 17th is when Former VP J0E was confirmed the nominee in the race. AMD has virtually zero reaction to this.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n|\n|\n|\n\n\n\nSo we have quickly looked at 3 major events relating to p01itics and seen how AMD has reacted. The only noticeable change was in March 2020 during COVID. It is clear to see how AMD is not influenced by major p01itical events, so I think its safe to say that the outcome of the race will not have a huge impact on the price. Unless the major indices have a massive jump or dip, AMD will not care. I looked at other major events like the first stimulus passing and it was more of a player there. On 3/27 when the Stimulus was signed when compared to a week after, AMD was down $2 when it was trading in the $40\u2019s. However, AMD quickly recovered a short time later.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**BUT AMD JUMPED RECENTLY BUYING IS NOT SMART**  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/uNbwEwi  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n From 7/15 to EOD today, AMD went from $54.96 to $86.15. Quite the jump in just a few months. The all-time high was $94.28 a short while ago. Many people are looking at this and saying its too high and the jump was too soon. Actually, I would agree with them under normal circumstances. But right now tech carries the market and AMD has new product releases soon with massive hype, their deep learning and data centers will continue to take more market share, and their current financials are incredible compared to previous years. In no way do I think the price is too high or priced in yet.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCould we see pullbacks in the coming months? Absolutely and you should expect them. \nWhat are the chances the new products are a disaster? No clue, but if that\u2019s your concern then play the hype surrounding the products and get out at the first sign of bad news. \nWhat do I believe the price target to be? Before 2020 is over, I would say anything around $95 is safe. Long term? $120 in 2021",

        "selftext": "In case you missed it (and you didn't, you astute watcher of markets), INTC got knocked down again after earnings, just like last quarter.  So, just like in September when  I suggested [bullish option trades](https://optionsalary.com/cheap-chips) in Intel (Ticker: INTC) I'm doing it again.  Obligatory chart:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[6 month chart of INTC](https://preview.redd.it/gtz5tt26cav51.png?width=757&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce2c90a075d6b92d0d95e4553dfde4ce5b179066)\n\nAfter last earnings cycle's drop, Intel basically stabilized and then climbed back, recovering a portion of the post-earnings loss.  We've again seen Intel meet or beat on its top line revenue as well as earnings per share.  The Data Center Group did come up a bit short on expected revenue and some point to that as the reason for the significant decline.  See all of the earnings details directly on Intel's [site](https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1424/intel-reports-third-quarter-2020-financial-results). \n\n#### Trade Ideas\n\nWith the stock now back at levels similar to last earnings release, here are a few bullish Intel option trades for playing a recovery in the name:\n\n* 11/13/2020 expiration, sell the 45 put for 0.48 **or**\n* 11/13/2020 expiration, sell the 45/40 put spread for 0.40 **or**\n* Hold tight until after the election and re-evaluate\n* Prices are at the midpoint as of 10/23/2020\n* All trades are for educational purposes and do not constitute financial advice.\n\nSelling the puts outright would result in owning shares at an equivalent of $44.52 if INTC ends below 45 on the 13th.  The immediate return if the put expires worthless is 1.1% or almost 19.5% annualized as this is a 3 week trade.\n\nThe put spreads cap our downside risk in exchange for just 0.08 and also limits margin.  If the spread expires worthless, it will be a return of 8.7% on the $460 risked per trade ($40/$460).  \n\nThe 45 strike is outside of the expected move between now and November 13th.\n\nPersonally, I've put on a \"half\" position and will look to put on more after the election.  I also added a few shares.\n\n#### What's the downside?\n\nEarnings Just occurred and there may be some lingering volatility in the name.  Combined with the election, another approach is to simply wait a week and a half and then re-evaluate.  Another approach is to put on half the size now and wait until after the election to put on the other half.  \n\nMargins are down at INTC vs. one year ago and AMD is a 'flashier' name.  For put sales, I prefer the larger (INTC sells about 10x as much as AMD), slower moving INTC and its dividend in the near term, particularly now that it has gone \"on sale\".  I have and will continue to trade in and out of AMD.\n\nIntel's valuation is well below its 5 year averages and it continues to grow revenue and profits.  Now is (still) a reasonable time to try and pick up shares or at least profit from its currently depressed price.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m sure everyone read enough of how management is going to turn this around but no one spoke about how the gaming console itself is going to benefit Gamestop since they deal with a lot of physical/disc sales/resale.\n\nI just want to talk about the second coming of Tesla that is Gamestop. I talk mostly about how Gamestop will boom with rise in physical game vs digital. What I talking about? I\u2019m talking about the coming of 4k gaming. While you bitches are trying to just play the short squeeze for a price target of 50$ you are completely missing the bigger picture. We are going to easily go above the company\u2019s all time record high made back in 2008 62.11$ without the squeeze when all said is done. (Don't forget our buddy Michael Burry managed to kill 1/3 of the outstanding shares through last years buyback) \n\nBack in 2012, anyone who was a gamer can tell you how big of a POS the console launches were because of one reason. The hardware were absolute trash, it was using AMD\u2019s CPU/GPU and everyone complained because you\u2019re paying a premium for low tier outdated PC parts. Intel cpu was what people wanted fitted with Nvidia graphic cards. You have 12 year olds rocking PCMR (PC MasterRace) logo everywhere making fun of peasants potato PCs. Look at AMD in 2012, it was trading at 2$. Company probably had Donald Trump at the helm making the calls running the company into the ground like his Casinos. \n\nAnyways, this time is fucken different and even better than it was back in 2008. In 2008, cpu/gpu improvements were still doing fucken leaps and bounds year after year. The game consoles were outdated within a year or 2. In 2020, CPU/GPU improvements slowed to an absolute crawl and parts cost a fucken arm and a leg. Moores law hit a wall and getting 2x performance over last year was no longer possible and the cost for parts kept going up. You want the latest and greatest? That\u2019ll cost you 2000$+ for PC gaming, hell no one is going to have that kind of money especially with this recession. \n\nNow here comes PS5 and Xbox Series X, giving you the latest top of the fucken line gaming hardware for 600$. M$ and Sony is losing money on this like back in 2008, you will hear every fucken reviewer praise this and tell you go out and buy it. Everyone and their mom\u2019s going to go buy new gaming console for their kids so they can fuck off while they have sex with her boyfriend in the other room.\n\nHow does any of this benefit Gamestop? Well with now the latest and greatest gaming console and top of the line hardware we will see an actual push for 4k gaming.\n\n4k gaming to say the least is very hardware intensive and also takes up a fuck ton of storage space. What takes up a lot of storage space? 4k fucken texture packs for 4k gaming alone takes up +20gb of space. Yes that fucken storage space is going to be huge. The last generation we never had any real push for 4k gaming, fucken hell they mostly ran below 1080p to even be remotely playable at 30 FPS. You think people are going download entire games when it takes days or weeks to download with their dial up connections. No they will buy physical discs 9/10 times. \n\nMoreover anyone who plays games on console will tell you 99% that they prefer disc over digital downloads because it cost the same as digital and \n\nLastly, we all know that with the new console release there is actually a lack of new games but that matters not. All games are backwards compatible, so where does Gamestop benefit from this? Well they are only the biggest used game reseller around the block. When people go to buy the new console they are going to go to Gamestop over Amazon or Bestbuy and buy used game to play when everyone goes back into lockdown. Everyone who was planning on spending 3000 on trips oversea will be buying games instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone who says they are going to go like Blockbuster and point to the last 2 quarters is trying to shill you. Everyone knew that a new super gaming console cycle was coming, they were holding off on their purchases and been saving their pennies for this. The next quarter for Gamestop is going to be its biggest.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBig push for 4k gaming will result in large files downloads incentivizing people to choose physical discs over digital.\n\nPositions. Shares and even more shares for now. After election IV Armageddon 01/15/21 30C or further out.\n\nTL;DR x2 Also for everyone saying that Gamestop will go out of business. Here\u2019s just a quick discussion on just simply why it makes sense for Microsoft/Sony to exist. https://youtu.be/8gEfHD\\_y7Pc?t=938\n\n Gamestop will be their showroom, so it makes sense for Gamestop to thrive and not run them out of business. Amazon/Bestbuy/Walmart sure as hell aren\u2019t going to advertise games for them since they aren\u2019t a gaming retail store primarily.\n\nPS. Bunch of hedge funds trolling GME to scare you out of positions so they can cover their shorts.",

Most of them are technology but not software companies (NOKIA, ERICCSON) or just semiconductor manufacturers but not AMD, Nvidia or Intel. ASML, the only EUV lithography machine makers in the world, and Adyen are the only 'new economy' stocks that are growing. They also have Prosus which is an investment holding company like Softbank but more conservative.\n\n**My Conclusion**\n\nOnly Netherlands is worth investing in for European exposure. The rest of the companies are old economy companies and large healthcare/pharma are not growing as quickly and are more similar to J&amp;J in terms of growth except your dividends will get taxed too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Extra opinion**\n\nJapan and (Asia) Pacific are not worth investing in too, only Taiwan (TSMC, FOXCONN), South Korea (Samsung), China (BABA, TENCENT, MEITUAN, PINGAN, etc) are worth it. Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand are full of boomer economy companies too. Emerging markets are a different story but in the age of economical colonization, large companies from other countries will probably swallow them up before they can get big so you can't really participate in their growth if you invest in them.",

        "selftext": "I have around $50k in Fidelity index funds in my Roth IRA, and have gained about 20% across the board from my initial investments 3+ years ago. I have always been a cautious investor, and learned that going the index fund route for all investments is a safe bet, plus with low fees and expense ratios, it seemed like the most bang for buck. That said, the kangaroo stock market has me interested in throwing a bit of money at stocks to see what happens. I put in some money to AMD stock and already have a 25% return since initially investing a few months back. At 28 years old, I feel like I could be a bit more risky.   \nMy understanding is that with the ROTH IRA, any money I make in that account, I will not have to pay taxes or capital gains when withdrawing. Would there be any advantage to dumping funds now that the market is quite high, and waiting to see how rocky this election is? Then buying funds again when there is a dip? With the current political climate, I really can't see the election going smoothly, leading to people selling across the board, regardless of who actually wins. Plus if we get into a constitutional crisis, even more reason to be out of the markets.\n\nAny thoughts on this? Is this a super rookie move, and should I just stick with the bogleheads methods of long term strategy? Can we even have long term strategies in the current day and age?",

I don't want anything to do with crypz anymore tho, too stressful. Here's how I'm thinking about investing the money now:\n\n2k on NCLH: I think airlines will tank for a looong time, but I feel like that'll happen because of fewer business flights. There's no such thing as business cruises, so I can see this stock easily going back to $50 by 2022.\n\n2k on MTCH: Good trend, Facebook Dating was a failure, and dating in general and prostitution took a big hit with COVID, people will be even more promiscuous than before after the vaccine.\n\n2k on XOM: I know about renewable energy and electric cars, but the predictions estimate that only 30% of cars by 2030 will be electric, so we still have a loooong way to go until then, and my investment is until 2022~2023. I think it's a safe bet.\n\n2k on AMD: I'm just a personal fan of the brand and I feel like it'll overthrow Intel pretty soon.\n\n2k on Twitter: I was thinking that maybe it would tank a little bit if Trump didn't get reelected, but even then, a Democrat would, and Twitter is THE Liberal social media. Just a safe bet, might switch to FB.\n\nThoughts? Btw I'm not from the US, my final goal is only 100k, it'll be enough for me to not worry about money in my 3rd world country.",

        "selftext": "When I was reading the investors presentation I saw the numbers, but was to lazy to do the math. \n\nWe all know that companies stocks often explode once they reach EBITDA profitability. And ChargePoint is really close to achieving that and the EV market is just starting to blossom. \n\nThe midpoint enterprise valuation for ChargePoint, shown on page 35, is between $4.12 billion and $9.26 billion, or $6.6865 billion. Now, remember this includes a deduction for the net cash of $648 million. Therefore the implied equity value at the midpoint of ChargePoint\u2019s valuation is $7.3345 billion (i.e. $6.6865 billion plus $648 million).\nIn addition, since there will be 304.9 million shares outstanding on a diluted basis, ChargePoint\u2019s target price is $24.06 per share. This is derived by dividing $7.3345 billion by 304.9 million shares outstanding, or $24.06 per share.\nThe bottom line is that since SBE stock is trading for $15.39, it is worth 56.3% more than today (i.e. $24.06 divided by $15.39). That is a great expected return.\n\nHere is an article: https://investorplace.com/2020/10/sbe-stock-massively-undervalued/\n\nCheck in previous SBE post where they posted the investors presentation and do your own math if you do not belive this. SHLL and FMCI amd DPHC have really promising futures according to their forecast and we all saw what happend to their stock.",

        "selftext": "I put half of my account into NIO trades yesterday. Still bullish on Tesla in a big way. But there has to be more price movement and more certainty in NIO moving higher in the short term after their $40 and $50 price targets from certain large corporations. I viewed charts by day. Going back to when Tesla kicked off their IPO. I noticed both stocks moving similarly within a similar price range from when NIO went public last year. I couldn't help but think about Tesla's history with China and their horrific model 3 gaff... Anyway, Nio have a foothold in the fastest growing economy in the world. The Chinese are waaaaay less into fossil fuels than the US for obvious reasons. Meaning that a transition towards EV will almost certainly happen with more speed and volume than the US and any other economy for that matter. This is why I believe that NIO will continue to move in a similar way to Tesla. potentially hitting that 40 or 50 dollar price target by the end of the year. And long term, if they can get their production down and battery tech comparable to Tesla then there is every likelihood that Nio could be up near Tesla in the coming years. I don't think it will catch it mind you, as I am bullish long term on Tesla, I believe it will be hitting 1k this time next year if they can roll out their promised battery tech and reduce the price point of their model 3's. Nio won't be at this level for a while. Maybe not ever if they focus solely on production cars and forget about the production chain and battery tech. Having said that, there is a lot of promise. How many of you wished you got into Tesla at 25?? Now's your chance! Nio will be hitting $40 soon. Where it will go from there only time will tell. Short term I think it will continue to rise. I'm bullish on gold and silver RN also. As well as some other names I have seen being thrown around here: Etsy, SQ, Uber, CRSR, PLTR, Zoom, SPCE. Bearish on airlines. Pulled out of NVD, AMD, PG.

It's all but confirmed that AMD's tease was not their highest end GPU, and what they did show was on par with the 3080. Most leaks say that AMD will be competitive with 3090 as well.\n\nCombo that with the fact that zen 3 is looking to be a price to performance champion, and Intel is so unconfident in their next generation that they announced it in a fucking blog post, I think it's safe to say AMD is going up, but I wonder how much they're pre-inflated for the earnings call on Tuesday.\n\nSo calls for sure, but calls for 30th or calls for sometime in November when both gpus and cpus are officially announced?\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk, my velvety smooth brain is unfamiliar with how markets trend before earnings reports; also broke bitch 20yo so buying both is probably a no.

        "selftext": "New to options, been following AMD for a couple years now and it's safe to bet their processors have pulled ahead of intel by a mile.\n\nThe last couple weeks $AMD has been going down and intel has been climbing, but AMD earnings report forecasts double than what is was same quarter last year($0.14 - $0.31).\n\nBasically I have no idea what the fuck to guess because im assuming AMD is gonna go back up soon but not sure if the earnings report is gonna pull it or tank it further, advice?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pwuzf8a9vhu51.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f15e49b68fb38dbe7e1acc6b821b2efa38c07b5c",

        "selftext": "hello friends,\n\nI need cash, now. And the only way to get cash as a male is to steal it or flip it. I\u2019m not a girl, I can\u2019t just send pics of my feet and get like $300 from a guy named fred. \n\nI have already listed my honda civic (aka the \u201cbeater\u201d) on craigslist and facebook marketplace and had a few autists message me saying they were interested. I\u2019m asking for 15k but they will negotiate it. Whatever happens, happens, i will be yoloing it all into apple calls. Apple $130 eom guaranteed. I\u2019m either gonna be rich enough where from now on I can use the beater to beat her (my gf) (my penis) and beat her in autopilot in my brand new tesla, or i\u2019m going to be taking the L, figuratively and literally to work to make my money back and yolo it all again into maybe tesla calls or amd calls. But first, we will play apple. Ya hear that cooks? I\u2019m coming for ya \n\n\nIf I fuck this up, if cooks fails me, if apple tanks, I will have nothing. My life is already shit, maybe this can turn it around. Gambling runs in my blood, and I need a fix. I think this would be absolutely life changing for me because I only have 20k in my rh account, so another 15k to play with would be huge to make a life changing play. I haven\u2019t told anyone I know about this yet and I don\u2019t plan too, but hopefully I\u2019m not back here a month from now dreading my life. I will keep y\u2019all updated on this post. \n\nlove, autist #828",
