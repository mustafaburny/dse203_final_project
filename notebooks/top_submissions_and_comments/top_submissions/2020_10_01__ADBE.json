        "selftext": "I sold my NET stock few days ago with good profit (at around 57$, 87% up), and I have about 10K worth of WCLD. I was looking into all the holdings of WCLD, and I was surprised there is no akamai (check [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/thematic/wcld](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/thematic/wcld)).\n\nI started digging and I came across this very good comparison of the major cloud companies:\n\n[https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/maxcdn-vs-cloudflare-vs-cloudfront-vs-akamai-edge-vs-fastly/](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/maxcdn-vs-cloudflare-vs-cloudfront-vs-akamai-edge-vs-fastly/)\n\nas you can see, it seems akamai has like 55% of market share, while NET and FASTLY are around 1%. The blog was from July, but I don't think things have changed dramatically since then. \n\nFrom reading the blog, it seems to me for big companies, akam seems to be the first choice for the biggest websites (facebook, adobe, ibm, to mention few).\n\nThen I started looking into the valuations, and I found this article from today comparing Akamai and Fastly\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/15/forget-fastly-this-edge-computing-rival-is-the-bet/?source=iedfolrf0000001](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/15/forget-fastly-this-edge-computing-rival-is-the-bet/?source=iedfolrf0000001)\n\nIt was very eye opening, specially, the following table below  (Revenue and operating income are Guidances for 2020)\n\n    Company | Revenue | Operating Income  | Mkt Cap | P/S  | P/E   |  P/E (forward)\n    ---------|----------|-----------------|---------| ---- | ------|-----------------\n    FSLY  | $295 M |$7 million| $14.5 B | 54.0 | N/A  | 1,110\n    AKAM  | $3,150 M |$961 million| $18.8 B | 6.1 | 35  | 20.3\n\nThere is another table shown the revenue growth, where FSLY obviously have better figure (62% Q2 revenue growth for FSLY vs 13% for Akam), but Akam is still doing better when you look into margins \n\nI know the cloud market is growing, and Akam will not be able to keep the 55% market share. But still, how come it is almost not discussed here?\n\nSo after this quick research, I am thinking of buying a good 4-6K worth of Akamai. Any reasons why I shouldn't do that?  \n\nPS: Fsly, even after the big drops today and yesterday, is still up around 350% YTD, on the other hand, AKAM is only 26% up (NET is around 250% up YTD)",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there\u2019s a will to get something done.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n&gt; But he said even if there\u2019s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cI actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,\u201d said Keon.\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&amp;P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cQ2 reporting season saw S&amp;P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n&gt; The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&amp;P 500  down about 10%. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,\u201d they noted.\n*****\n&gt; The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there\u2019s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think from the market\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are many moving parts here, and they\u2019re all moving in different directions,\u201d said Block. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. \u201cI think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that\u2019s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n&gt; In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n&gt; Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n&gt; Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&amp;P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n&gt; As shown, the average stock in the broad S&amp;P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n&gt; The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n&gt; If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&amp;P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are 46 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n&gt; General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # News High for Net New Highs\n\n&gt; Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&amp;P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n&gt; As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&amp;P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Breadth Booming\n\n&gt; One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&amp;P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n&gt; While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n&gt; With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&amp;P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n&gt; October\u2019s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n&gt; With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9deab1b6431375946cf0104830334e3a/1b58acd0d015098f-cf/s500x750/1a07b8cea97519bcce57adae974614a0e426effb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 9th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.11.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/rotewK3.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2lSi1kT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Wj80iaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZY9TwgO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5LizPLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oIstn4O.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKfmmCC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q3isONG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Swqo1ow.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. $101.20\n**JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

Obviously that's because their long-term growth rate will be lower now because they're so large.\n\nBut the framework is interesting, because if you had a TAM in mind 10 years ago for Adobe and believed they'd achieve scale, you can then basically model out your long-term expected returns sensitizing to varying TAM sizes.  \n\n\nThoughts?\n\nLink to article here for anyone interested (data cited in article can be downloaded to Excel, which is nice):   \n https://www.unhedged.com/exchange/5f6975de2904520a049098a1/?l=5f7f382650e4ce0010980eaf",

There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there\u2019s a will to get something done.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n&gt; But he said even if there\u2019s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cI actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,\u201d said Keon.\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&amp;P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cQ2 reporting season saw S&amp;P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n&gt; The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&amp;P 500  down about 10%. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,\u201d they noted.\n*****\n&gt; The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there\u2019s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think from the market\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are many moving parts here, and they\u2019re all moving in different directions,\u201d said Block. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. \u201cI think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that\u2019s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n&gt; In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n&gt; Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n&gt; Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&amp;P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n&gt; As shown, the average stock in the broad S&amp;P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n&gt; The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n&gt; If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&amp;P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are 46 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n&gt; General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # News High for Net New Highs\n\n&gt; Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&amp;P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n&gt; As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&amp;P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Breadth Booming\n\n&gt; One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&amp;P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n&gt; While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n&gt; With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&amp;P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n&gt; October\u2019s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n&gt; With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9deab1b6431375946cf0104830334e3a/1b58acd0d015098f-cf/s500x750/1a07b8cea97519bcce57adae974614a0e426effb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 9th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw7sXu8pcPw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IIowf1B.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2lSi1kT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Wj80iaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZY9TwgO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5LizPLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oIstn4O.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKfmmCC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q3isONG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Swqo1ow.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",
