        "selftext": "Yes, the title says it all. I firmly believe this market is incorrect on a lot of things. No, I am not saying I am shorting it. No, I am not saying if you\u2019re investing you\u2019re about to go through a massive correction. I will say this though\u2026\n\nYesterday, Visa reported earnings that were a hit. They did great, EPS was way up, revenue was way up. Not only thing though, they are raising their dividend for their investors. They\u2019ll be paying you even more for owning their shares because they have such great cash flow. The market opens today, they\u2019re down over 5%. MA, which reports tomorrow morning, is down 6% with it. One could assume they\u2019ll have pretty similar earnings and revenue. Maybe even up their dividend too (don\u2019t hold your breath for that one, but who knows). But Tesla, a company who has sold patents, licensing, and Bitcoin to pad their balance sheet for specific quarters, so that their earnings look better to the common shareholder, went up 12% because a company that was on the brink of  bankruptcy pulled a publicity stunt saying they\u2019d buy 100K cars. \n\nThese are just examples of what is happening as a whole in our market. I\u2019m buying these companies who are being screwed and I can tell you this, I am right and the market is wrong. I warn any investor who is partaking in this, because greed and speculation has run rampid while fundamentals and discipline has been thrown out the window. \n\nWatch.",

        "selftext": "I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven\u2019t counted it up, but it\u2019s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I\u2019m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I\u2019d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. \n\nThese are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.\n\n**Understand the Trading Environment**\n\nOne mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.\n\n**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can\u2019t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. \n\nIn between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that\u2019s more likely to pull back.  It\u2019s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).\n\nI try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don\u2019t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. \n\n**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**\n\nThe sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it\u2019s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.\n\nLast year\u2019s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don\u2019t bet against this trend, it\u2019s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I\u2019m dirt. \n\nLast year you couldn\u2019t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. \n\nOne of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don\u2019t overpay for the options, it works. I don\u2019t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I\u2019m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.\n\n**Make The VIX Your Friend**\n\nThe VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It\u2019s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. \n\nAnother interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don\u2019t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I\u2019ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. \n\n**Selecting Trades &amp; Investments**\n\n**Have an Allocation Plan**\n\nThe first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:\n\n* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.\n* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It\u2019s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.\n* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.\n* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. \n* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It\u2019s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I\u2019ll let you know in 10 years if it works.\n* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  \n* 1% in other things I can\u2019t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.\n\n**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**\n\nUnless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. \n\nI\u2019ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. \n\nMy favorite tools to use are Zack\u2019s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack\u2019s VGM measures a stock\u2019s value, growth rate, and momentum. It\u2019s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what\u2019s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. \n\nThe list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.\n\nA friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don\u2019t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there\u2019s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it\u2019s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   \nI use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn\u2019t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it\u2019s because there\u2019s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&amp;P but haven\u2019t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they\u2019d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn\u2019t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.\n\nI use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.\n\nFidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.\n\n**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**\n\nIf you\u2019ve invested actively for a while, you\u2019ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. \n\nI\u2019ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What\u2019s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. \u201cGoldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode\u201d), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. \n\nI am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.\n\n**Good Things Come in Pairs**\n\nJust about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I\u2019ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it\u2019s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. \n\nSimilarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it\u2019s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.\n\n**Exercise Financial Discipline**\n\nEven when I\u2019ve been successful picking investments, I\u2019ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We\u2019ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That\u2019s usually the moment I\u2019ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:\n\n1. Take Profits Often.   \nWhen an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  \nIf you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn\u2019t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  \n\n2. Fail Fast.   \nIf the option price sinks to -50% in value, it\u2019s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there\u2019s negative news driving this, I\u2019m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  \n\n3. Profit Both Ways.   \nIf a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \\~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year\u2019s returns for Visa.  \n\n4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   \nI have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should\u2019ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  \nOn the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don\u2019t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don\u2019t chase the perfect trade. It\u2019s a white whale. Just make money.  \n\n5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   \nThis is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn\u2019t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   \nSo if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there\u2019s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",

Key drivers that result in folks pursuing a plant-based diet are typically health, animal welfare and the environment [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44488051). In a world where worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975, 39% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in 2016, and most of the world's population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight, [link](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight along with other statistics such as 463 million people live with diabetes and 1.13 billion people live with hypertension (also known as high blood pressure) \u2013 conditions that often occur together and are among the leading global causes of poor health and death [link](https://world-heart-federation.org/news/the-cost-of-inaction-on-diabetes-and-hypertension/), it\u2019s not too surprising that people are turning towards plant-based foods-\u2013 which are a large part of a vegan diet \u2013 particularly fruit, vegetables, nuts, pulses and seeds, as they have been shown to help in the treatment of many chronic diseases and are often associated with lower levels of type 2 diabetes, less hypertension, lower cholesterol levels and reduced cancer rates [link](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/enjoy-food/eating-with-diabetes/veganism-and-diabetes). \n\nFrom an animal welfare perspective \u2013 it turns out that an estimated 99% of US farmed animals are living in factory farms at present. By species, it\u2019s estimated that 70.4% of cows, 98.3% of pigs, 99.8% of turkeys, 98.2% of chickens raised for eggs, and over 99.9% of chickens raised for meat are living in factory farms [link](https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates), less than ideal conditions within these farms where \u2018animals are packed in as tightly as possible to maximize output and profit, even though this causes many to die from disease or infection before being sent to the slaughterhouse\u2019 [link](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/) has also contributed to an increase in the awareness of and consumption of plant-based foods on ethical grounds.\n\nThe third driver\u2019s been getting the most airtime recently since it seems the planet\u2019s actually pretty fucked, with a new report by the UN Environment Programme that came out yesterday finding \u2018new and updated Nationally Determined Contributions only take 7.5% off predicted 2030 emissions, while 55% is needed to meet the 1.5\u00b0C Paris goal\u2019 [link](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/updated-climate-commitments-ahead-cop26-summit-fall-far-short-net) a.k.a a bunch of countries do not want to make the necessary concessions to preserve the planet in its current state. These \u2018Latest climate promises for 2030 put the world on track for a temperature rise this century of at least 2.7\u00b0C\u2019 [link](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/updated-climate-commitments-ahead-cop26-summit-fall-far-short-net), with the planet still on track for catastrophic heating [link](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/10/1104012). Why is any of this important/relevant in this context? It turns out that \u2018the animal agriculture sector is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions,\u2019 [link](https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/climate-change-animal-agriculture-factsheet.pdf) highlights include 9% of annual human-induced CO2 emissions,3\n37% of methane (CH4) emissions, which has more than 20 times the global warming potential of CO2,\nAnd 65% of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, which has almost 300 times CO2\u2019s global warming potential [link](https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/climate-change-animal-agriculture-factsheet.pdf). Not that it\u2019ll happen anytime soon but it turns out that cutting meat and dairy products from diets could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by up to 73 per cent. If everyone stopped eating these foods, researchers at the University of Oxford found that global farmland use could be reduced by 75 per cent, an area equivalent to the size of the US, China, Australia and the EU combined \u2013 leading to a significant drop in greenhouse gas emissions [link](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/veganism-environmental-impact-planet-reduced-plant-based-diet-humans-study-a8378631.html). One survey found that ~23% of people were interested in cutting down meat consumption for the sake of the environment, showing an additional market for producers of plant-based food [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44488051). \n\n**Part 2 - Company Overview and Value Proposition** \n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what Tattooed Chef\u2019s all about and what sets it apart in the marketplace. In the company\u2019s own words - Tattooed Chef is a leading plant-based food company offering a broad portfolio of innovative plant-based food products that taste great and are sustainably sourced. Tattooed Chef\u2019s signature products include ready-to-cook bowls, zucchini spirals, riced cauliflower, acai and smoothie bowls, and cauliflower pizza crusts, which are available in the frozen food sections of leading national retail food stores across the United States. Understanding consumer lifestyle and food trends, and a commitment to innovation, allows Tattooed Chef to continuously introduce new products. Tattooed Chef provides great-tasting, approachable, and innovative products not only to the growing group of consumers who seek to adopt a plant-based lifestyle, but to any of the \u201cPeople Who Give a Crop\u201d [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/).\n\nThe Company\u2019s current market opportunity is worth $42 billion and consists of a number of frozen food categories including frozen appetizers &amp; snacks, frozen breakfast foods, frozen entrees, frozen fruits &amp; vegetables, and frozen plant based meat alternatives [link](https://gyazo.com/c586290597f7fccff2db2ad399e09f41). It\u2019s worth noting that frozen plant-based meat alternatives in which some of its most comparable comps are, is only worth $0.8 billion, in comparison to the other massive segments such as frozen entrees at $23.1 billion and frozen fruits and vegetables at $7.6 billion. The growth in the frozen food category (a key areas where TTCF competes) has been primarily driven by the recent product innovation as a response to the growing demand for great tasting, clean label and convenient options. The overall frozen food category outpaced the general center of store food categories. Millennials and Gen Z are driving growth in the frozen foods section due to convenience, frozen fresh and plant based foods, with the number of consumers who say convenience had a significant impact on their food purchase decision growing from 49% in 2017 to 57% in 2019 [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nThe Company\u2019s product portfolio consists of entrees, breakfast, vegetables, pizza, meat alternatives, and with yesterday\u2019s acquisition news \u2013 they\u2019ll also be entering into nutrition bars. The growth in their portfolio and product range has been pretty explosive, especially in the last year where they went from 38 total products and 17 total new innovations in 2020 to 73 total products and 35 total new innovations in 2021 (thus far) [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb).  \n\nA key strength of Tattooed Chef and its USP is its vertically integrated operations that enable it to create a strategic advantage, through vertical integration they have control of ingredients and prioritization of product, the ability to go from innovation to market in as little as 3 months with experience in manufacturing, distribution, supply chain. As of their past IR deck presentation they highlighted four manufacturing facilities and capacity available to achieve $500+ million in revenue. This will be increasing to five with Belmont\u2019s acquisition and likely higher revenue potential.\n\nIn September 2021, key highlights included 52% year on year growth in revenue from $67.9 million in the first half of 2020 to $103.4 million in the first half of 2021, 82% year on year growth in the established brand from $38.0 million in the first half of 2020 to $69.1 million in the first half of 2021 **with no investment in marketing and brand until 2021**, strong resources with ~$140 million cash balance, 275k square feet of manufacturing capacity to quadruple in 2021 and opportunity for strategic M&amp;A (closed 2 key acquisitions in 2021), and growth in sales and marketing including launching the first national media campaign, tripling of branded store count and creation of 35 new product in 2021 [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). Despite the initial lack of marketing \u2013 testimonials such as President and CEO Salvatore Galletti stating that \u2018Target said it was the most successful frozen food launch in the history of Target\u2019 during the Q1 2021 earnings call show how popular the products are \u2013 even with minimal marketing.\n\nThe expansion in national distribution has been remarkable, with growth from 1,614 stores in 2019 to 4,272 in 2020 i.e., ~165% increase. The goal in 2021 was to reach 10,000 total stores, with 8,355 already achieved in the 1H of 2021 \u2013 by the 3Q 2021 it\u2019s expected that national distribution will have expanded to over 12,000 stores which would be a ~180% increase with the year not even being over. This was facilitated in part by the number of major retail customers that Tattooed Chef was able to onboard \u2013 in 2020 key customers included Walmart, Sam\u2019s Club, Costco, Target, Trader Joe\u2019s, and Aldi. In 2021 this list expanded with 20 additional key customers highlighted, including Kroger, Whole Foods, Albertsons Safeway, Harris Teeter, and Publix. In a study of mass retailers, 3 of the top 10 items including the #1 and #2 since launch in March 2021 of plant based frozen entrees belonged to Tattooed Chef, with dollar velocity over 60% above the nearest top 10 competitor [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb).   \n\nMarketing and branding only really became a component of Tattooed Chef\u2019s outreach in 2021, which makes their success thus far even more impressive in my opinion. The goal is to reach 80% of all Plant Based Intenders (78 million customers) through the national media campaign. I would really recommend taking a look at the IR presentation which has been linked here in several other places to understand more about how Tattooed Chef describes the plant-based intender and the wide cross section of society from which they come \u2013 urban dwellers, parents, under 35 year olds, people who want to eat less meat, aspiring &amp; practicing vegetarians/vegans, pescatarians &amp; flexitarians \u2013 there\u2019s something for everybody in Tattooed Chef\u2019s product portfolio and they\u2019ve segmented their target audience pretty well. The campaign is running through 10,000+ TV spots plus targeted digital video and streaming \u2013 one every 15 minutes, and 24 top tier networks plus Hulu and Programmatic Connected TV/Streaming. As of August 3, 2021, brand awareness grew from 6% to 15% [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nThe Company has stable leadership and has been family run, while also adding experienced folks from the industry to the management team. This includes Sam Galletti \u2013 the CEO and President with 35 years of experience in the food industry having served in both operational and investor roles within seafood, breaded vegetables, salsas and dips, grilled chicken, and organic foods companies. Sarah Galletti \u2013 the Tattooed Chef &amp; Chief Creative Officer who was the creator of the \u201cTattooed Chef,\u201d joined the Company in 2014 and spearheaded shift to plant based and has experience as a former chef in Italy. Stephanie Dieckmann \u2013 Chief Financial Officer &amp; Chief Operating Officer who joined Tattooed Chef in 2017 and has over 12 years of experience in the food industry, also being the former CFO of APPA Fine Foods. Matt Williams \u2013 Chief Growth Officer who joined Tattooed Chef July 2020, has over 25 years\u2019 experience in CPG including roles at Dean Foods, Coca Cola and PepsiCo [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\n**Part 3 \u2013 Recent Updates**\n\nYesterday on 10/27, Tattooed Chef entered into an agreement to acquire Belmont Confections, a private label co-manufacturer of nutrition bars, for approximately $18 million in cash and stock. The transaction has been unanimously approved by Tattooed Chef\u2019s Board of Directors and the acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021. The transaction allows Tattooed Chef to further diversify its product offerings and enter into the $10 billion global plant-based bar category. At full capacity, Tattooed Chef believes the Belmont facility can contribute over $100 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-acquire-belmont-confections-120000434.html), for a reference point \u2013 TTCF currently expects 2021 revenue to be $235 million to $242 million so having just under half of that come from Belmont alone in a couple of years in a new market segment is a pretty big deal.\n\nEarlier this month on 10/4, Tattooed Chef announced six of its entr\u00e9e bowls are available in approximately 1,200 Publix Super Markets (\u201cPublix\u201d) stores as of October 1, 2021. Sam Galletti, President and CEO of Tattooed Chef, added that with the addition of Publix, Tattooed Chef products are now in more than 13,000 stores nationwide including Kroger, multiple divisions of Albertsons, Sprouts Farmers Market, Target, Walmart, Costco, and Sam\u2019s Club [link]( [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-now-available-publix-120000419.html).\n\nOn August 10th, Tattooed Chef announced it has launched four entr\u00e9e bowls including two new flavors at Sprouts Farmers Market in approximately 340 stores [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-launches-innovation-items-120000798.html). \n\nIn July, Tattooed Chef announced that it expects to launch its branded products across multiple categories in approximately 1,800 Kroger stores nationwide later this summer. By September, shoppers can find a variety of Tattooed Chef\u2019s plant-based offerings including pizzas, entr\u00e9e bowls, and vegetables in nearly every Kroger. A total of 12 SKU\u2019s will be rolled out nationally [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-launch-kroger-stores-120000706.html). \n\nOn May 18th, Tattooed Chef completed the acquisition of New Mexico Food Distributors, Inc. and Karsten Tortilla Factory, LLC (collectively referred to as \u201cFoods of New Mexico\u201d) for approximately $37.0 million in cash [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-completes-acquisition-mexico-100000887.html). The acquisition of Foods of New Mexico allows Tattooed Chef to expand further into the $20 billion Hispanic/Southwest Food sector and beyond, including frozen, refrigerated, and ambient products. Utilizing these new capabilities, the Company expects to launch Tattooed Chef branded products in additional categories. Foods of New Mexico\u2019s two facilities total 118,000 square feet and\nprovides Tattooed Chef additional capacity to continue to innovate [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb) and is expected to contribute $200m to annual revenues in the next two to three years [link](https://www.just-food.com/news/plant-based-firm-tattooed-chef-to-acquire-foods-of-new-mexico/). \n\nSo in the span of 5 months, some of the highlights of Tattooed Chef include completing an acquisition that doubled the number of manufacturing spaces it had (from just Italy and California to adding Foods of New Mexico, Albuquerque and Foods of New Mexico, Karsten), agreeing on another acquisition that will enable it to enter a new market segment and have another production facility (both of these acquisitions are expected to contribute a combined $300m to revenues in two-three years \u2013 more than the expected full year revenue of the Company this year), launching into two major nationwide chains and continuing to innovate and launch new products \u2013 whatever knock anyone may have on them you can\u2019t deny that they\u2019re moving pretty quickly to lock in sources of major revenue growth. \n\n**Part 4 \u2013 Financials and Valuation**\n\nRevenue \u2013 Revenue for the first half of 2021 was $103.4 million, an increase of 52.2% from $67.9 million in the first half of 2021. The increase in revenue was primarily due to growth in sales of \u201cTattooed Chef\u201d branded products. [link](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390021042632/f10q0621_tattooed.htm#a_003). For the full 2021-year, Tattooed Chef expects revenue in the range of $235 million to $242 million, an increase of 58% to 63% compared to 2020. This guidance implies 49% year-over-year growth on the base business to $222 million, and a $13 million to $20 million contribution from one of the two facilities included in the Foods of New Mexico acquisition [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results). Tattooed Chef is expecting to reach revenue of $1 billion in 2026, so increasing by 5x over the next five years [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-this-food-company-growth-stock-plans-to-generate-%241-billion-in-revenue-2021-02-07), with the expected contributions from two key acquisitions this year \u2013 they could reach that number even earlier than 2026.  The Company expects Foods of New Mexico to contribute up to $200 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-enters-agreements-acquire-new-mexico-food), and the Belmont Confections facility to contribute over $100 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-acquire-belmont-confections-120000434.html). If we do some pretty rough (by pretty rough literally don\u2019t take this as any kind of in-depth analysis \u2013 just guesstimating) back of the envelope math and assume conservatively that both acquisitions begin contributing these numbers in 2024, and assume $240 million for the Company in revenue for this year with a slightly lower year on year growth rate of 50% just to make it easier for numbers\u2019 sake, that would mean $360 million in 2022 (excluding acquisitions), $540 million in 2023 (excluding acquisitions), and $810 million in 2024 (excluding acquisitions). Add in the expected $300m the that Foods of New Mexico and Belmont would be expected to contribute by then and you blow past the $1 billion number a couple of years early (this is assuming of course that operational capacity can sustain these numbers \u2013 the Company currently is quadrupling capacity in 2021) [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nGross Profit \u2013 Gross Profit was $13.9 million in the first half of 2021, compared to $13.0 million in 2020 \u2013 while this was an increase in absolute terms, the Gross Profit Margin declined from 19.1% in 2020 to 13.4% in 2021 thus far. This was primarily due to expenditure on infrastructure to support current and expected growth in operations and increased raw materials, packaging, freight and container costs due to inflation [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). The Company has forecasted improving gross profit margins for the full year 2021 in the range of 16% to 22% [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results), due to leverage of fixed costs on higher volume, benefit of new equipment to enhance operating efficiencies, and the product and channel mix [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nAdjusted EBITDA \u2013 Adjusted EBITDA was ($9.2) million in the first half of 2021, as compared to $9.0 million in the first half of 2020. This was primarily due to public company accounting costs that were not present during the 2020 period, as well as significant increases in promotional expenses, marketing expenses, professional services, and freight and container costs [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb), this is forecasted to be ($14) to ($17) million for the full year 2021 so still decreasing in subsequent quarters, but at a lower rate, as the Company is committed to an aggressive plan of growing its brand through extensive marketing and promotional spending that has already produced significant revenue growth in both grocery and mass retail [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results). \n\nMarket cap of TTCF [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TTCF) is $1.5 billion, in comparison to \u2018competitors\u2019 such as Beyond Meat who have a market cap of ~$6 billion [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYND/). Quotation\u2019s emphasis because TTCF is competing in a broader range of segments so they\u2019re not exactly direct comps but one of the closer ones we\u2019d be able to look at here. Beyond has cash on hand of $1 billion compared to the $140 million that Tattooed Chef had in the last quarter, and also has ~2.5x the revenue with $257.59 million compared to $103.4m for Tattooed Chef, however the revenue growth was only 22.4% for Beyond so ~2.5x less than the 52.2% for Tattooed Chef, with Beyond incurring significant losses as well so as a growth story I would really think that TTCF is valued at magnitudes less than it should be. \n\nThe analyst consensus for TTCF is a buy with an average price target of $23.50 so a 32.17% upside from current prices [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TTCF/price-target/), compared to BYND which has a consensus hold and an average price target of $112.24 so a 18.93% upside from current prices [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/BYND/price-target/), with a P/S of 10.22 for TTCF [link](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-TTCF/financials-statistics-and-ratios/price-sales/) compared to 13.25 for BYND[link](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-BYND/financials-statistics-and-ratios/price-sales/), it would also seem like the more attractive investment with higher upside.   \n\n**Part 5 \u2013 Bear Case**\n\nWell the most obvious risk would be that the Company\u2019s not profitable - as a growth story, it has a higher focus on revenue growth than profitability and my interpretation is that achieving higher revenue is the primary concern over the next couple of years, meaning that there is going to be cash burn in the short-term and I wouldn\u2019t expect them to become profitable till probably around mid-2023. The one-off valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $47.22 million skewed numbers a bit for this year, but if they were to continue making similar amounts of losses (excluding the one-off) so in effect  ~$15 million in the first half of 2021 and doubling that to ~30 million for the full year, they would probably have enough cash to last 3 years \u2013 this is of course a very, very crude estimation as losses would not stay the same in absolute terms, the Company has estimated it\u2019s gross profit margin would improve and they could become profitable within a couple of years as well and keep themselves in the running for longer.\n\nFrom what I understand, the Company is also authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and currently have 81,938,668 shares issued and outstanding, meaning if it seemed like there was going to be a cash crunch, they already have the authorization for a potential dilution which would be a point of concern for any equity holder. I doubt they would need to call on this at least for a year or two and potentially not at all if they turn profitable soon but you can never be certain so worth keeping in mind [link](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390021042632/f10q0621_tattooed.htm#a_003).   \n\nAnother risk would be the promotional/marketing/professional service expenses which seem to have the biggest percentage increases since 2020, as the company continues to build brand awareness and expand its distribution points and stores, marketing expenses especially would be likely to continue to rise. The Company has said that \u2018We expect overall operating expenses to decrease over time as a percentage of revenue as many relatively fixed operating expenses will be spread over increasing revenue, but expect freight and container costs to remain high (relative to historical) as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future,\u2019 [link](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390021042632/f10q0621_tattooed.htm#a_007). The latter sentence about freight and container costs is concerning to me because in my opinion that\u2019s one of the types of costs that a Company doesn\u2019t have too much choice over e.g. if someone is selling you raw material and it becomes too expensive it\u2019s within your control (hopefully if the product isn\u2019t too niche) to switch to another supplier, but here with shipping costs companies are less likely to have that sort of leverage and would probably end up just having to absorb the cost, especially in this case where Tattooed Chef has a production facility in Italy \u2013 not something that I would expect to remain constantly high in the long-run but with current supply chain constraints it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on.\n\nFinally, this is more of a mixed bag of bull and bear, as we\u2019ve seen earlier \u2013 the current opportunity market for Tattooed Chef\u2019s diverse range of products is massive and while having a wide variety of products is great as a buffer in the event one particular segment faces issues e.g. as we\u2019re seeing now with Beyond [link](https://www.reuters.com/business/beyond-meat-forecasts-disappointing-revenue-pandemic-uncertainty-2021-08-05/), there is a risk that increasing competition in this market \u2013 especially by firms leveraging economies of scale by operating in just one particular segment, could pressurize margins (although since Tattooed Chef is vertically integrated, it should be more resilient in this regard than competitors that aren\u2019t).\n\n**Part 6 \u2013 Short Interest**\n\nHigh short interest pumps are now everywhere \u2013 like cheese in a mousetrap with half-baked numbers that just act as clickbait or a cause for people to fomo in. Nevertheless, being aware of short interest as a concept and having the numbers is a useful data point to have \u2013 though I would urge anyone reading this not to just look at SI numbers when making an \u2018investing\u2019 decision. Broken clocks are right twice a day and there are undoubtedly companies for which there is a good justification for folks to be doubling down on shorting them. [Let\u2019s take a look at TTCF\u2019s short interest numbers using the SMELL test](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/nzd2zi/whats_that_smell/). \n\n* Short Interest \u2013 15.5 million shares out of 82 million total shares outstanding. With insiders holding almost half the shares, that leads to short interest of 37.43% of free float [link](https://gyazo.com/c18de608d5efde59055092e26bd6c7a3), Additionally, with utilization of 98.56%, there\u2019s very little left for shorts to borrow to depress the price further [link](https://gyazo.com/3b067c76c0cc8c9d268e3089c9b6c498).\n\n* Market Cap \u2013 $1.5 Billion so at the lower range of a midcap stock, would require a few hundred million for shorts to cover if they were the only ones trading on a given day so would require a good amount of capital to exit or to add further to their short position if they decide to double down. Insiders hold 45.03% of shares outstanding, while institutions hold 16.87% of shares outstanding (30.7% of the free float) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TTCF/holders?p=TTCF).  \n\n* Extremely Memeable \u2013 Can\u2019t think of too many better causes to get behind than saving the planet by eating your vegetables \u2013 if only you\u2019d listen to ma when you were a kid and ate some broccoli instead of meatloaf we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\n\n* Low Liquidity \u2013 Average volume per yahoo finance is around 1.5m shares, with current volume around 20% lower than that so &lt;5% of the free float. Any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly, which would be exacerbated by the fact that the most recently reported days to cover was 13.49 [link](https://gyazo.com/817e2edb0eb27d294c414d19eed52f58) which means at the current volume shorts would need almost 3 weeks to cover their positions. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on TTCF for cheap, with institutional inflows of $119M and only $6.57M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TTCF/institutional-ownership/) so a net increase of ~95%.\n\n* Low Risk (IV) \u2013 Yep, current IV is 47.1% for 10/29 and 11/5 options so pretty cheap to load up on if you\u2019re so inclined. A good resource to understand the mechanics of a gamma ramp can be found here in my opinion if that\u2019s the sort of thing that interests you [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prcdnr/why_you_suck_ass_at_gamma_squeezing_and_what_you/). \n\n**Part 7 \u2013 TL; DR**\n\nThe total global plant-based retail market size is expected to reach $162 billion in 2030, increasing by more than 500% from $29 billion in 2020. Key drivers that result in folks pursuing a plant-based diet are typically health, animal welfare and the environment. Tattooed Chef\u2019s current market opportunity is worth $42 billion and consists of several frozen food categories including frozen appetizers &amp; snacks, frozen breakfast foods, frozen entrees, frozen fruits &amp; vegetables, and frozen plant-based meat alternatives.\n\nTattooed Chef is a leading plant-based food company offering a broad portfolio of innovative plant-based food products that taste great and are sustainably sourced with signature products include ready-to-cook bowls, zucchini spirals, riced cauliflower, acai and smoothie bowls, and cauliflower pizza crusts, which are available in the frozen food sections of leading national retail food stores across the United States. The Company\u2019s product portfolio consists of entrees, breakfast, vegetables, pizza, meat alternatives, and with yesterday\u2019s acquisition news \u2013 they\u2019ll also be entering into nutrition bars. The growth in their portfolio and product range has been pretty explosive, especially in the last year where they went from 38 total products and 17 total new innovations in 2020 to 73 total products and 35 total new innovations in 2021.\n\nA key strength of Tattooed Chef and its USP is its vertically integrated operations that enable it to create a strategic advantage with control of ingredients and prioritization of product, the ability to go from innovation to market in as little as 3 months and soon to be 5 manufacturing facilities. Key highlights included 52% year on year growth in revenue from H1 2020 to H1 2021, 82% year on year growth in the established brand from H1 2020 to H1 2021**with no investment in marketing and brand until 2021**, strong resources with ~$140 million cash balance, 275k square feet of manufacturing capacity to quadruple in 2021 and opportunity for strategic M&amp;A (closed 2 key acquisitions in 2021), and growth in sales and marketing including launching the first national media campaign, and tripling of branded store count with key customers including Walmart, Sam\u2019s Club, Costco, Target, Trader Joe\u2019s, Aldi, Kroger, Whole Foods, Albertsons Safeway, Harris Teeter, and Publix. In a study of mass retailers, 3 of the top 10 items including the #1 and #2 since launch in March 2021 of plant based frozen entrees belonged to Tattooed Chef, with dollar velocity over 60% above the nearest top 10 competitor.\n\nRevenue for the first half of 2021 was $103.4 million, an increase of 52.2% from $67.9 million in the first half of 2021. For the full 2021-year, Tattooed Chef expects revenue in the range of $235 million to $242 million, an increase of 58% to 63% compared to 2020. Tattooed Chef is expecting to reach revenue of $1 billion in 2026, so increasing by 5x over the next five years, with the expected contributions from two key acquisitions this year \u2013 they could reach that number even earlier than 2026. Gross Profit was $13.9 million in the first half of 2021, compared to $13.0 million in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was ($9.2) million in the first half of 2021, as compared to $9.0 million in the first half of 2020. \n \nMarket cap of TTCF is $1.5 billion, in comparison to \u2018competitors\u2019 such as Beyond Meat who have a market cap of ~$6 billion. The analyst consensus for TTCF is a buy with an average price target of $23.50 so a 32.17% upside from current prices, compared to BYND which has a consensus hold and an average price target of $112.24 so a 18.93% upside from current prices, with a P/S of 10.22 for TTCF compared to 13.25 for BYND, it would also seem like the more attractive investment with higher upside.   \n\nRisks include the Company not being currently profitable due to an immediate focus on the top-line, potential for dilution as the Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and currently have 81,938,668 shares issued and outstanding, likelihood of increasing marketing expenses even though the Company has an expectation of a decrease in OPEX as a percentage of revenue. \n\nTattooed Chef passes the SMELL test for with high SI if the conditions are right, as short interest is 37.43% of free float with utilization of 98.56%, market cap is at the lower range of a midcap stock so capital required to cover is not insignificant in the event of shorts wanting to exit or doubling down on their positions, meme-ability is high, liquidity is low with around 1.5m shares traded on average and 13.49 days to cover, and low risk as IV is sub 50% for the next couple of weeks of options in the run-up to earnings.\n\nAppreciate y\u2019all for reading this if you made it this far. I\u2019m playing the runup to earnings because the stock has barely moved with yesterday\u2019s acquisition news and I believe there\u2019ll be some short covering going on in the meantime over the next couple of weeks in expectation of a growth beat as certain milestones that could impact that have already been surpassed e.g. the target of 12,000 stores by Q3 2021 was already announced as over 13,000 in the 10/4 press release. If it does end up picking up in the short-term, I\u2019ll be looking to roll the gains into leaps post-earnings. Positions \u2013 30 x 18.5c @ 10/29 and 20 x 20c @ 11/5.",

        "selftext": "For you to understand why I think BABA is a buy, you have to know why BABA's stock price is so low. I will tell you guys something no other media will tell you because I have lived in China most of my life.\n\nIf you have been looking at BABA's price and news, you probably know one of the reasons why the stock price is down. Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, openly spoke against the banking department in the Chinese government.  **Chinese government cares a lot about their face, more than you think.**\n\nWhy did he say dumb shit and cause BABA's stock price to drop? Because he wanted his ant group company to go IPO, and that's why he talked shit to the banking department because he wants some pie and tendies.\n\nThere is a shopping festival in China that happens every year; people call it \"\u53cc\u5341\u4e00\" (Double eleven? lol).  It's like black Friday on Nov 11th. Also, this explains about double eleven.  Anyways, last year Alibaba sold about 332.8 billion yuan of shit. That's about 47.4 billion dollars shit they sold in one day. \n\nFrankly, if you look at their financial statement, you would see a prevalent trend for Chinese companies.  I am not talking about shit company like lucking coffee; I am talking about a company that is in good condition and making a lot of money but is deeply undervalued like Alibaba and Tencent, etc. \n\nAfter all the research I did, I believe these companies' prices are directly affected by how Western media talks and the trade war between America and China. **The bilateral relationship between America and China plays a significant role.** The relationship between Xi and Biden is way less intense than orange head, which is a sign of more investors coming in the future.\n\nAlibaba makes a shit load of money every year, and it has already made a lot of people rich; maybe you should put him on your watch list. \n\nAlso, some random info if you need it. Alibaba's PE ratio is around 19. Alibaba has 900 million active users in China, and some people say that's how many Chinese people have easy internet access. This company is legit rooted in Chinese society. Jack Ma sold all of his share in the company (I think he might have been forced to sell and give up his control for Alibaba). I say Alibaba will do even better without a CEO who talks shit about government all the time, especially when they make the fking rules. If you looking for other undervalued Chinese companies, do not go for shit like RELX, PDD, they are shit and you don't want to buy shit no matter how cheap.\n\nI bought some call credit spread, and I think before the end of this year, Alibaba should be at least 170 if not 180 or higher.\n\nI am currently holding credit spread for this company, hopefully, I will make more than I have made so far :)",

        "selftext": "In this post we're going to check on all of our favorite meme stonks and see if they've got anything left in the tank from a technical analysis standpoint. Come one and come all and hear my tale, whether you're a distraught bagholder ape or someone looking to get in on what I believe may be the final moonshot. Not a financial advisor blah blah blah you know the thing.\n\nFirst off, none of these plays work without Meme Stonk Frenzy Round 3. We had Round 1 late January with GME being the big runner, round 2 early June with AMC melting faces, and while this doesn't make Round 3 a sure thing, I'd like to think retail isn't dead, the shorts haven't covered, and with Tesla being overbought as hell and the Trump Pump near a conclusion, money will flow back into the fucking MEMES.\n\n[The Big Triangle Thingy You've Probably Seen 1,000 Times Already](https://preview.redd.it/7wz09ua0vvv71.jpg?width=1841&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29b78952cc21ea41be357476a63d691169d2ddf7)\n\nAh yes. The fan favorite. I often wonder if u/TheRoaringKitty has secretly cashed in his tendies and escaped all this madness, but then I remember he's not a paper handed bitch, as I'm sure all of you aren't either. Either way, the GME saga could be coming to a massive close in the form of one last big move. Having briefly just broken below the 200 day simple moving average yesterday and bouncing back well, a break to the upside could make everything right in the world once again and bring GME back near 300 territory. A break and hold below the 200 MA is a possible sign of more downside to come. I have to admit the risk to reward here is juicy and am looking to fire up a few 200C  Jan 2022 and will add more upon confirmation of a breakout  of this massive triangle to 300 and beyond. Green line I have there is around 250 where it may be wise to take profits as the hedgies will try to short ladder attack as the perevious resistance of 240ish is broken. Oh yeah and the yellow line is beginning of 2022 so if we don't get a move by then we're prob fucked imo.\n\nGME TLDR: hold 200 MA, breakout top of triangle, then moon.\n\n[Another Triangle Thingy but Not Quite as Big](https://preview.redd.it/d28ufb91yvv71.jpg?width=1829&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc047671ee092bccd4412db8eeb2a0c5ee12c3bb)\n\nAnd now for the second meme that has become many apes meme stonk of choice. This guy has been coiling for a while since the absolute monster rip and like GME could be primed for another move. Sitting at the bottom of our nicely developing trendline, this is another great risk to reward opportunity. 50 would be a take profit zone as the shorts will look to hold it down there at previous resistance but hey, we know you apes aren't selling for that cheap. Red line could be a stop loss for those of you with wrinklier brains at about 32. 200 MA is catching up but not really a factor like GME. Break of 50 MA could easily fuel us to break the wedge and then to 50 and beyond.\n\nAMC TLDR: hold lower trendline, break top of triangle, then moon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Different Triangle Thingy Already Broken to Upside](https://preview.redd.it/16y3bd712wv71.jpg?width=1833&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3aa8314e63d9eac4c37e89f296758ce13e1c98a)\n\nDon't think I forgot about the meme stonk little brother, BB. This was to many not nearly on the same level as GME or AMC, but my how the tables have turned. This meme has actually gotten a LOT of good news (not going to include here but check it out) and many consider it to be more a fundamental play than meme at this point. But don't let them fool you, BB will be there aboard the rocket ship too when Round 3 begins. Already broke our wedge with nice volume a few days ago and has pulled back nicely to the 200 MA. Hold of this and a break above that blue dotted line near 12.25 should get us back to 15+ in no time.\n\nTLDR: Hold 200 MA, break 12.25, then moon.\n\nThese are just the big 3 I've seen upside in, but I'm sure there's many more memes to be had. Be fully prepared to lose all the money you put in as an options play, but if you go stocks then you can control your risk a lot better. Don't take this as real financial advise, as I'm just a fellow retard looking to be ready for Meme Frenzy Round 3.",

        "selftext": "One day ago, a fellow Re\\~\\~dditor\\~\\~tard named /u/stolensupra received and shared a message from the big boned juice gods:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qh44rf/is\\_my\\_juice\\_jug\\_tryna\\_tell\\_me\\_to\\_yolo\\_into\\_bb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qh44rf/is_my_juice_jug_tryna_tell_me_to_yolo_into_bb/)\n\nBeing the curious idiot that I am, I decided to dig a little into the technicals of BlackBerry. The timing on Supra's post is quite impeccable it seems. Interestingly, BlackBerry seems to have broken out of a \\~9 month long consolidation pattern last week and is currently consolidating in a small bullish wedge. Looking at the chart I don't see too many bearish signs, so I am going to list and show  crayons of why I think BlackBerry is potentially about to rally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will start this off by just showing an overall technical TLDR crayon image:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tqunrdfy4aw71.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7f0ae5262f6a51b9f653e55ea9cb5edb3048195\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext, and in my opinion second most importantly, a very strong prior resistance now turned to support.\n\nFrom April until June, BlackBerry found resistance at around $9.58. It attempted to break this resistance once in April, a second time in May, and then the third attempt in June broke through and went on to have a massive rally. That same resistance zone of $9.58 has now turned into support for the past 3 months. This in turn has created a trading range between $9.58 and a new immediate resistance of $11.77. Since $9.58 flipped into support, the $11.77 range has been tagged twice. In the prior example, there was a major breakout after the second hit. The pole of the forming bull flag/wedge has a measured target of right around $13.76:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9idqd8825aw71.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a3487253b361e416f805a2c64038aa7a14248f0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that I've shown the support and resistance flip, I'd like to also point something else out that is also very important.\n\nThere were two occasions where price attempted to break the $9.58 support zone. Both of those attempts were fairly swiftly rejected. This ended up creating a double bottom in price, namely an Adam and Eve double bottom. After the second drop below support, price rose quite significantly after also breaking out of the major long term diagonal trend line:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7h3r9a1m5aw71.png?width=1492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4d225fff9807e189229ce6a3ef8955fd388a604\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not well versed in cup and handle patterns, but I do believe that this potentially seems to fit the bill:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c6bi3spn5aw71.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=178a06c6875463600d936dec491d1e026098a908\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother interesting thing to take note of: the 200 day moving average(DMA).\n\nPrior to the meme rally in January, BlackBerry was consolidating for quite some time around the 200 DMA. After a long enough accumulation period, our beloved /r/WallStreetBets sub took note and that's when all hell broke loose:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39kx74us5aw71.png?width=1507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6c947216ef3e2544de595b2ce5e83523376d234\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe meme rally obviously fizzled out, and BlackBerry eventually drifted downwards to touch the 200 DMA again. Until this point, the 200 DMA had not been touched for a period of 188 days. This MA test came immediately after the second rejection of the $9.58 zone:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j91r2ont5aw71.png?width=1507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dac3043a2958c7f6e1c98ecb272a83c016245cc6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince mid July, BlackBerry has yet again been consolidating around the 200 DMA. I should also mention that yesterdays trading session closed below it. Today, BlackBerry managed to rally back to within $0.02 of breaching back above it. Price is currently holding so far above the exact middle of the trading range at $10.68. One other thing interesting to note. The last time BlackBerry was rejected at breaking above $11.77, it did so in a bearish ascending wedge formation. This time it seems to be the complete opposite, so far ranging in a bullish wedge:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eiu5pl4u5aw71.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=789b6142f5331083392cbb355023858d7ed95a9c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThough signs point bullish for now, BlackBerry is still technically ranging until the $11.77 resistance breaks. Considering recent price action, I believe that if BlackBerry fails here, the $9.58 zone will probably break this time with momentum. After enormously fucking up a life changing trade in Nokia this year, BlackBerry is the last trade I have the money for so fingers crossed this breakout is legit. I'm a broke bitch. ;x\n\nP.S. I've posted here before but I delete everything because afterall, this is my secret upvote account. ;-)\n\nPOSITIONs:\n\n$15c 11/19\n\n$21c $1/21/22",

        "selftext": "When you look at the chart you\u2019re gonna think you missed the boat on this one. I made a pretty penny after Q2 earnings, but I\u2019m still holding shares. Options I rolled strikes up and expiration out. Here are X reasons why it\u2019s not too late to get a Lambo of your own:\n \n**Bank acquisition incredibly successful, but not fully appreciated.**\n\nEven Scott Sanborn, CEO of LendingClub, said on a recent call that even he hadn\u2019t fully anticipated how strong the synergy between LC\u2019s loan marketplace and the new LC Bank would be. This acquisition is already working as intended and will continue to boost LC in two main areas: **Profitability** and **Credibility.**\n\nFirst, profitability. The acquisition cut loan origination expenses drastically, since LC can now originate every loan it makes instead of paying a 3rd party to do so. But that\u2019s not all. The top line will also go up, since loans LC retains on its balance sheet (20-25% of originations) will make them WAY more money in the long run versus loans it sells to investors. Think ~5-6% net yield on loans versus 1% servicing fee.\n\n \n**Demand for LC loans is through the roof with its bank buyers.**\n\nMy employer included. Our orders have been cut back because the order book is so oversubscribed. In a world where short interest rates are near zero, the 5-6% expected yield on LC loans SLAPS. Why does this demand matter? **Pricing power.** With no shortage of investors, LC will be able to slowly raise pricing, either on servicing fees or for more gain on sale. Want to fill your order? That\u2019s fine, but you have to pay 101 for the loans instead of par. Reminiscent of Netflix a few years ago, super popular and affordable, but started creeping subscription fees up without losing customers to boost that top line profitability.\n\n \n**Market (consumer loans) is growing fast, and LC is the main player.**\n\nObviously LC\u2019s origination data for Q3 is not public yet, since they save that for earnings release. However, some of the private company\u2019s in the sector are already reporting originations with sky high growth in July/August compared to Q2. Uncle Biden stopped sending the stimmy checks and I must do something about this credit card that\u2019s building up a balance. I refinance that Mastercard balance with LC and drop my rate from 28% to 15%. More originations means more loans on balance sheet and more revenue from sale/servicing. Cha ching.\n\n \n**Huge, untapped customer base/credit data for expansion to Auto and other loans.**\n\nIn Q1, LC had over 3 million members (borrowers who had used their service). Today almost all revenue stems from consumer lending. As LC leverages this huge amount of borrower relationships and credit data, they will be able to expand to new markets at low cost. The first will probably be auto loans. Imagine this, you get an LC loan, they check your credit and see your 6.5% auto loan. If the LC credit model determines that loan is profitable at 5.5%, they can shoot you an email with an appeal to refinance with them. LC has a Net Promoter Score (measure of customer satisfaction) of 78. Compare this to the average Net Promoter Score of 34 for banks and financial services. The average LC customer loves LendingClub, so what\u2019s stopping them from an Auto refinance? Who wouldn\u2019t prefer a lower rate from a trusted provider?  \n \n**More bang for your buck than UPST (Upstart).**\n\nBEFORE YOU DOWNVOTE THIS POST INTO OBLIVION, please consider. I mean no disrespect to the WSB darling that is UPST. I just want to point out some numbers side by side. You can make of them what you will.\n \n($ in millions)\n\n**Q2 Originations**\nUPST = 2,800\nLC = 2,722\n\n**Q3 Originations guided**\nUPST = NA\nLC = 2,800 to 3,000\n\n**Q3 Orig. growth guided**\nUPST=  NA\nLC = 10.2% on high end\n\n**Q2 Revenue**\nUPST = 194\nLC = 204\n\n**Q2 Net Income**\nUPST = 37\nLC = 9\n\n**Q3 NI Guidance**\nUPST = 28 to 32\nLC = 10 to 15\n\n**Q/Q NI growth guided**\nUPST = 15% decrease on high end\nLC = 60% increase on high end\n\n**Market Cap**\nUPST = ~29.52 billion\nLC = ~3.28 billion\n \nNearly identical originations, nearly identical revenue.\n\nUPST seems to have higher NI, but this is misleading.\n\nLC has an expense related to loans it puts on the bank\u2019s balance sheet to comply with CECL (federal regulation). They expense a loan loss reserve on day 1 equal to cumulative losses expected for the life of the loan. For reference, LC expensed 34.6 million related to CECL in Q2, plus additionally deferred 19.6 million in future loan revenue. The pro forma earnings without these two items would have been 63.2 million in Q2. \n\nThis situation is unique to LC, since UPST does not balance sheet loans at a bank. The effect of this is to defer earnings into future quarters, since the charge offs are already paid for day one, all earnings from the loans go straight to the bottom line. So revenue growth will be HIGH as more and more loans start generating net interest income and this expense remains stable.\n\nThis is the kicker for me. **Market cap of UPST is 9x the LC market cap.** This would only make sense if the total addressable market and growth expectations for UPST were higher than LC\u2019s. However, we can see above that the NI projections from the company\u2019s themselves tell a very different story. A 15% decrease for UPST versus 60% increase for LC.\n\nThe argument for UPST is that \u201cUpstart uses AI, they are gonna disrupt with better technology!\u201d If you think these other marketplace lenders don\u2019t use AI/statistics in their credit models you are lying to yourself. LC, SOFI, and others are not idiots.\n\nThey have the same data (or way more data when you consider lifetime originations).\nBesides this, UPST targets small community banks, because they are already charging 105 for loans (versus par at LC currently).\n\nThey do this so the borrower doesn\u2019t pay a fee. Great for a borrower, not so great for an investor. You think big, regional banks are gonna pay this sucker fee when they can buy the same loans somewhere else? I don\u2019t. If your only investors are community banks (a dying breed in the industry), how big is your total investible market really?\n\nAgain, UPST is probably a fine company to own, but you should know you\u2019re paying a 9x premium.\n\nPositions: 1290 LC shares, five Jan 22 20C, ten Apr 22 30C, one Jan 23 45C\n\nTLDR: In my opinion, LC going rocket emogis after earnings on Oct 27th, but this is not financial advice.",

        "selftext": "In recent years there has been a paradigm shift in the workforce domain.\n\nThis was extremely accelerated during the COVID pandemic.\n\nI\u2019m talking about the freelance industry or the so called Gig sector.\n\nA 2019 study by Mastercard estimated that the global gig economy generates $204 billion in gross volume. In the United States, it has been predicted that by 2027, the country may have more \u201cgiggers\u201d than non-gig workers.\n\nAccording to a 2020 report from Intuit, 25-30 percent of the U.S. workforce is uncertain, and more than 80 percent of large corporations plan to substantially increase their use of a flexible workforce in the coming years.\n\nFurthermore, according to a survey published on Bloomberg, more than 1,000 hiring managers implies that 40.7 million Americans expect to be working remotely by 2026. That\u2019s 4.5 million more than in a previous poll in the third quarter of 2020 -- and about 21 million above pre-pandemic levels!\n\nStudy from Wharton conducted during this \u2018work from home\u2019 huge experiment forced by the pandemic, showed that across the economy, productivity has actually remained stable during the pandemic, with productivity even increasing in many companies.\n\n# People simply don\u2019t want to return to work, the reasons are:\n\n1. The federal government added $600 more per week to unemployment benefits already provided by the states. Even as states have worked to cut benefits, the wages received are still comparable to ones at a regular job.\n2. Inflation rate is higher than the Wages growth rate \u2013 reduced motivation to return to work\n3. People are worried about returning to a more rigid work schedule.\n4. Some people have truly thrived with the newfound flexibility of working remotely.\n5. People are worried that microaggressions at work will worsen your mental health.\n6. People are simply still worried about getting exposed to COVID-19.\n\n**For many, the pandemic has been a wake-up call that revealed how much we actually neglected our self-care before now. Now, many of us have gotten a taste of better balance and aren\u2019t ready to give it up. We want our freedom \u2013 we want to be freelancers.**\n\n# Currently there are two public traded Gig companies: Upwork (UPWK) and Fivver (FVRR).\n\nHere are a comparison table between the two:\n\n|**Company**|**market cap**|**P/S**|**EV/S**|**Revenue**|**Revenue Grow**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Upwork**|6.89|15.5|15.63|440.7|41.90%|\n|**Fivver**|6.35|23.51|24.97|251.81|59.70%|\n\nIt\u2019s true that Fivver is growing at faster rate than Upwork, but it just can\u2019t justify the financial ratios difference between them. **Fivver, simply put, is much more expensive than Upwork**.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Fivver is a great company but it still mainly focuses on End user / small projects, while Upwork is primarily about mid/large scale projects, which is what this paradigm shift is all about.\n\n**Upwork** has collaborations with major Fortune 500 companies including Microsoft, Samsung and Zoom, as more commercial giants turning to online freelancing platforms to find knowledge workers.\n\nSo what do you think? Upwork to the moon and beyond?",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 20, 2021**\n\n***Quick rant:*** *It\u2019s remarkable how quickly market sentiment changes. It seems two weeks ago, everyone was predicting an imminent market crash and, in many occasions, going as far as insulting my intelligence for presenting a different viewpoint and remaining bullish even during the height of the Evergrande situation and a looming US debt default. Now it seems the doomsaying posts and articles have all but disappeared. The market has dipped significantly roughly 5-6 times this year and every time it happens I see the same upswell of doomsaying articles and market crash predictors. Not to go on a rant, but it amazes me how willing people are to fight against the trend. Like I\u2019ve said, it is important to acknowledge risks present in the market and be prepared to react to the unforeseen, but I don\u2019t get why people decide to consciously decide to fight market trends, it is much easier and more profitable to just ride them until you can\u2019t anymore. There\u2019s a saying that goes, pessimists sound smart, optimists make money. I have found this saying to be true.* \n\nThe incredible rally in the stock market continued, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) climbing seven straight days to claw back the losses suffered in September when the index dipped -5% from highs for the first time all year. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly today, the index has rocketed more than 6% higher from the lows on October 4, a stunning comeback. The Dow Jones (DIA) reached a new intraday all-time high, carried by continued strength in financial stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, traded modestly higher today. Market participants remain encouraged by stronger-than-expected corporate profits amid ongoing supply-chain pressures.\n\nVery strong corporate earnings reports from bellwethers like big banks, Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), and Procter and Gamble (PG) have assuaged fears that corporate profits would slow down dramatically amid supply chain constraints. As the earnings season kicked off, market participants were nervous that ongoing inflationary pressures, labor market imbalances, and congestions issues at ports would greatly weigh on corporate profits. So far, that has not proven to be the case. \n\nJon Adams, Senior Investment Strategist at BMO Capital Markets said, \u201cWe think investorshave been too pessimistic on earnings expectations. It does look like Q2 was likely the peak, but Q3 is going to be strong, probably above 30% year-over-year growth. We think the strength will continue into the fourth quarter, we\u2019re not overly concerned about profit margins. We are closely monitoring supply chain issues and increasing wage pressures but still think that profit margins are at healthy levels, and that there's more upside to come.\"\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The price of \u2026 reached new all-time highs, breaking $65k for the first time after the first-ever ETF was launched in the market yesterday.\n* Sharers of Pinterest (PINS) rocketed higher after Bloomberg reported that PayPal (PYPL) was considering acquiring the company for $70 a share (roughly $39 billion). Shares of PINS were up more than 10% while shares of PYPL fell after the report was released.\n* Adobe (ADBE) says it expects holiday-period online sales to reach an all-time high of $207 billion from November 1 to December 31 in the US. That would represent a jump of 10% YoY. The company says it expects global online sales to reach $910 billion, also a record.\n* The 30-year fixed mortgage rate increased to 3.23% for the week ended Oct. 15, according to a weekly update from the Mortgage Bankers Association. This is the highest level in six months and higher than the 3.18% during the prior week. \n* Facebook (FB) will change its name in order to reflect itself as a \u201cmetaverse\u201d company. As a reminder, the metaverse is a shared, 3D virtual space in which people can interact with the environment and other via online avatars accessed using virtual reality technology.\n* Jack MA, founder of Alibaba (BABA) was seen traveling in Europe, specifically Spain, in the first overseas trip since the government began cracking down on his companies over a year ago. \n* DraftKings (DKNG) is launching online betting operations in Connecticut\n* Ford Motors (F) to invest $300 million in building an electric vehicle car parts factory in the UK\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Amazon (AMZN) target set at $4,100 by Mizuho.

        "selftext": "There is a lot of debate in the investing world about the relevance of valuation metrics like the PS ratio, especially in the current climate where valuations across the board have become inflated relative to history. Some people go as far as to say that PS is irrelevant as long as the company is growing strongly. But I've started paying much closer attention to the PS ratio for the following reasons.\n\n1) I came across this article: [http://www.sionna.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dont-be-Fooled-by-the-PS-Insight-Piece.pdf](http://www.sionna.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dont-be-Fooled-by-the-PS-Insight-Piece.pdf). It's just over 2 pages including charts so I'm not going to bother with the tl/dr. It's worth a read.\n\n2) I conducted my own little analysis of stock performance during the 2010-2020 decade, which covers a large chunk of the longest bull market in history. I made a list of all the best performing stocks over that period, added a few notable IPOs from earlier in the decade, and then looked up their highest PS ratios. Here's the list in descending order of highest PS ratio:\n\nDXCM: 123.25 (which it hit on its IPO and then dropped sharply immediately after)  \nOLED: 58.35 (which it hit early, then dropped)  \nWDAY: 32.8 (hit early, then dropped)  \nMKTX: 31.45 (hit recently)  \nABMD: 29.98 (temporary spike, then dropped sharply)  \nTWLO: 27.82 (hit recently)  \nSPLK: 26.65 (hit early, then dropped)  \nNVDA: 25.65 (hit recently)  \nNOW: 25.53 (hit recently)  \nMA: 23.37 (hit recently)  \nREGN: 20.99 (hit on IPO, then dropped sharply)  \nFB: 18.40 (hit early and has been on a long decline since)  \nFTNT: 17.77 (hit recently)  \nEXR: 17.27 (hit recently)  \nZEN: 15.97 (hit recently)  \nNFLX: 12.67  \nFICO: 11.66  \nGOOG: 9.37  \nTTWO: 8.81  \nAVGO: 8.01  \nTDG: 7.89  \nAAPL: 7.80  \nTRU: 7.59  \nSTZ: 6.28  \nCTAS: 6.15  \nZNGA: 5.75  \nAMZN: 4.51  \nDPZ: 4.35  \n\n\n**Observations**\n\n1) From the entire list only 4 stocks hit a PS ratio over 30 at the highest. And almost all the stocks on this list are the best performing stocks of the past decade.\n\n2) In every single case of a PS ratio over 20, that level was only reached temporarily - either early in the decade, a brief spike somewhere along the line, or very recently. THERE ISN'T A SINGLE CASE IN THE SAMPLE OF A STOCK TRADING AT A PS RATIO OVER 20 FOR ANY SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME.\n\n3) The biggest and most successful tech stocks of the last 10 years (the FAANGs) don't even appear anywhere near the top. Facebook's had the highest PS ratio of 18.40, which it hit very early. AMZN's PS ratio has never even hit 5!  \n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe numbers don't lie. The simple truth is that stocks can't trade at high PS ratios for very long because their growth rates can't justify a high PS ratio over the long term. Eventually the stock will a correct, either through price (by selling off) or through time (by trading flat for a long period of time). What this means is that the upside potential for high PS stocks is very limited. The holy grail is to find companies trading at a low PS ratio while also exhibiting strong revenue growth and solid margins. If I find a stock I really like but is trading at a very high PS ratio, I will put it on my watch list and wait for the valuation to come down. The best opportunity is when the stock sells off on a disappointing earnings report. This does mean I might miss the occasional exception to the rule, but history shows those exceptions virtually don't exist.",

        "selftext": "Over the past 3 months, China has taken a beating in the U.S media, and for good reason. The main problem has been the housing market collapse. Some people have immediately compared this to the 2008 GFC. China is a state that can change policies whenever they feel they need to do so, they have less exposure to crises like this. This is one of the only benefits of having a government possess so much power.\n\nChina is also the largest exporter of goods, this is the only country in the top five exporters that maintain growth (+3.7), during the same 2019-20 period, U.S exports fell by -13%. Prominent investors have also voiced their opinion on China. Ray Dalio has recommended diversifying into Chinese stocks for some time. \u201cOur objective is to be there both economically and investment-wise.\" This is coming from someone with actual experience in China.\n\nThe $15b common prosperity fine that the CCP gave BABA is to be paid out over five years. The likelihood of the CCP adding another fine during this period is decreased. Trust is at an all-time low and it\u2019s likely that no more fines will be given bringing U.S investors back into stocks like BABA. Fears of the Chinese market are cyclical, it pops up every 3-5 years, and each time it affects Chinese equities. There are a few common myths about China I\u2019d like to dispel (Disclaimer: I\u2019m Australian).\n\n**Myth:** China is a communist country\n\n**Fact:** It\u2019s true that the state acts as the dominant economic player and uses markets primarily for political gain. However, the\u00a0stock market was\u00a0a strict no-no in the\u00a0Soviet Union\u00a0and other communist countries. China is a capitalist autocracy that loves to call itself communist, the U.S media benefits from playing into this as the name has an awful historical connotation for most of the world. They gain watch time from people fearful of communism.\n\n**Myth:** China will stop foreign investments\n\n**Fact:** Foreign investments generate $212b for them annually, closing themselves to the world is also a step in the wrong direction and they know that. Their actions so far have demonstrated that they intend on being a global superpower and the likelihood of then reverting to soviet foreign policy is very low.\n\n**Myth:** The CCP is evil\n\n**Fact:** The CCP is *very* evil, they have a proven track record of egregiously violating human rights, but are we activists, or are we here to make money?\n\n**Steven Romick** from FPA Crescent Fund increased his position in BABA by 729.92% in Q3 ([https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=FPACX](https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=FPACX)).\n\n**Charlie Munger** has also bought into BABA during Q1 at a price above $220. He has then increased his position by 82.71% in Q3 this year ([https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=DJCO](https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=DJCO)).\n\n**Tweedy Browne** increased their position in BABA by 700% in Q3 as well ([https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=TWEBX](https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=TWEBX)).\n\nThe stock is incredibly undervalued right now, its PE ratio is 20.7, more than 50% below the US online retail industry average. BABA's earnings have grown significantly by 30.4% per year for the past 5 years. They are in a great financial position, even with the $15b fine. Their short-term assets are twice the short-term liabilities and their long-term assets are 4x higher than long-term liabilities. They are also paying off their debt very well, BABA's debt to equity ratio has reduced from 30.6% to 13.6% over the past 5 years.\n\nJack Ma has now been seen traveling around Europe this week, meaning he has been full autonomy to leave China. BABA's management team is also seasoned and\u00a0experienced\u00a0with an average tenure of 5.8 years, which is similar to their board of directors that have an average tenure of 6.7 years. This is the same group responsible for its growth. The number of employees has gone from 122,400 on September 30, 2020, to a staggering 254,700 on June 30, 2021.\n\n**TLDR:** China bad (but not that bad), BABA undervalued.",

        "selftext": "**Vicarious Surgical (RBOT)** has the potential to be the first real, meaningful competition to Intuitive Surgical\u2019s monopoly on robotic surgery with its robotic platform poised for FDA approval in 2023 with commercialization starting at that point. The company expects to hit $1B in revenue by 2027, which on a discounted basis to today assuming a similar EV/sales multiple as ISRG, would value the business today at around $5B, or 300%+ above today\u2019s share price. Note the opportunity is highly speculative as the company has no revenue today and the platform has yet to achieve regulatory approval.\n\n**Background**: Vicarious was founded in 2014 by two MIT engineers with the vision of creating a much more simple, effective, and nimble single port robotic system for abdominal surgeries. The company is backed by Kholsa Ventures, Bill Gates, and Eric Schmidt\u2019s family office, with Auris (acquired by JNJ) former CFO as executive chairman. Beckton Dickenson, one of the largest publicly traded medical device companies, is also an investor in the PIPE. In September 2021, the company completed its combination transaction with D8 holdings, valuing the company at nearly $1B TEV and putting \\~$200MM of cash on the balance sheet. The company\u2019s system was granted the \u201cBreakthrough Device\u201d designation by the FDA, the only robotic system to receive this, which positions Vicarious for a faster approval process. Breakthrough designations are only granted to devices which make meaningful technological and patient outcome leaps relative to existing technologies and solutions. There are about 8MM shares in the free float and the remaining \\~120MM in the hands of longer term institutional and founder owners.\n\nThe company is based in Waltham, MA (just outside of Boston) and currently has 33 job openings posted.\n\n**Market:** the robotic surgery market was born primarily through Intuitive Surgical\u2019s development of the da Vinci surgical system starting in the early 2000s, which originally was a multi-port/incision robotic system comprising of 3-4 surgical arms and a separate console. The platform grew originally from prostatectomy and hysterectomy procedures into heart, lung and other applications. The goal of robotic surgery was to advance from laproscopic procedures (minimally invasive manual surgery) toward greater precision, lower complications, and better accuracy by giving the surgeon greater control (the human hand can be unstable) and visibility (HD cameras inserted into the body). Other platforms serving other niches have been developed, including MAKO (for knee replacements, bought by Stryker), Mazor (bought by MDT), Stereotaxis (EP / cath procedures), Ascensus, and Procept. ISRG today generates nearly $5B of revenue and growing at a 20%+ rate with EBITDA margins of nearly 40%. ISRG\u2019s surgical platforms cost \\~$2-3MM each. Given this growth and share gain from traditional surgery, MDT has developed the Hugo system, JNJ has acquired Auris, and Stryker has made inroads as well.\n\n**The Vicarious Solution**: The next stage of robotic surgery is to accomplish the same or better results but through smaller and fewer incisions. ISRG developed a single port system utilizing a 25mm incision and MDT\u2019s Hugo system is a copy of the ISRG\u2019s multi-port system.\n\nVicarious fits in by providing technology able to bring the same capabilities but into a single 10-15mm incision, which results in about a third of the size of an incision from any other single port platform. Additionally, the Vicarious system has two robotic arms and a camera that fit through a single incision, and the arms have 9 degrees of dexterity with the ability to reach 360 degrees, while other systems cannot do this.\n\nFurther, Vicarious\u2019 system is smaller and cheaper, allowing more existing hospital ORs to adopt the technology without construction or disruption to the surgical suite. More on the technology can be found in various investor presentations by Vicarious and D8 as well as video interviews with Adam Sachs, the founder/CEO.\n\nIn short, the Vicarious system promises to be cheaper, smaller, more nimble, and offer better patient outcomes compared to the competition. The company\u2019s investor materials point to a third party market survey showing that the Vicarious system scored in the 95th percentile in terms of customer feedback and receptivity. Mastering single port abdominal and thoracic surgery via robotics has been the holy grail of the robotic surgery market given it reduces complications, post op recovery time, etc, and Vicarious is poised to be the solution delivering better technology with a lower price.\n\n**What\u2019s the play?:** the company projects $1B in revenue by 2027, which would be about 3 years after FDA approval. Note ISRG is $5B today and likely to continue growing at 15-20% CAGR. Assuming the same valuation multiples as ISRG (20-25 times sales), that would work out to a roughly $20B TEV in 2027, and discounting this back to 2021 would yield a $5B net present value assuming a 25% discount rate. Today\u2019s value is roughly $1.5B, so that is 3x today\u2019s value. Even if you cut the company\u2019s projections by 50%, you get a current value well in excess of today\u2019s value.\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good but my personal view is this company will never hit $1B in sales. Why? It will be bought before then. ISRG has $4B of total cash and no debt. Medtronic has $11B in cash. JNJ has $25B in cash. Beckton Dickenson has $3B of cash. These and many others have a strategic need to get a dominant platform in robotic surgery and ISRG at a $120B market cap is too expensive for any of them to buy out.\n\nAs soon as (or even before) the Vicarious system gets FDA approval, it will likely be bought out. Adam Sachs believes the business can be a $100B company, and I believe him given the novel nature of the technology and its capabilities.\n\nI believe the best way to play this is via the warrants which offer asymmetric upside (trade at \\~$2, which is right at intrinsic value with the share price at roughly $13.50). The warrants get dollar for dollar upside on the shares through $18 (and proportional above that), so these act like LEAP call options though with capped upside at $18 as the company can redeem them at that point in time. I own nearly 500,000 warrants, and this isn\u2019t a quick flip position, as it would take several days to sell out of this. I owned ISRG back at $40-$50/share and sold out too soon - it is now trading at $1000.\n\n**The Big Risks**: the obvious one is failure to achieve FDA approval. The others include the majors developing a competing option that\u2019s even better than Vicarious, though not likely based on what is known to be in the pipeline now. Separately, there is the potential that the company needs future capital to commercialize beyond the $200MM on the balance sheet, though that should provide 2-3 years of support to get through FDA approval.\n\nResources:\n\n1.

        "selftext": "Oct 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is probing Visa Inc's (V.N) relationships with large fintech companies as part of its antitrust investigation of the card giant, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.\n\nAntitrust investigators are looking into the financial incentives that Visa gave Square Inc (SQ.N), Stripe Inc and Paypal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nVisa, which reported its quarterly results on Tuesday, declined to comment.\n\nThe company said earlier in March the Justice Department was looking at its debit practices after reports that the United States was investigating whether Visa uses anti-competitive practices in the debit-card market. read more\n\nThe Justice Department had previously investigated the credit card payments industry but settled with Visa and Mastercard Inc (MA.N) in 2010 when they agreed to allow merchants to offer consumers incentives to use a low-cost credit card.\n\nThoughts on this news?

Square makes it easier for customers to pay for products and services. Square\u2019s biggest product currently is a card reader that enables businesses to offer credit card payments instead of solely using cash. Square owns the popular Cash App which allows users to send payments, receive payments, invest, hold, and buy/sell bitcoin.\n\n**Industry Overview**\n\nThe buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) industry has seen some major growth this past year. There are advantages to using BNPL over credit cards. With BNPL technology, consumers don\u2019t have to worry about their credit scores. This can be seen as both an advantage and disadvantage. If you have a low credit score, you can use Square to avoid taking more hits on your credit. However, you can\u2019t build up your credit score using Square. \n\n**News Timeline**\n\nJuly 20, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://squareup.com/us/en/press/introducing-square-banking](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/introducing-square-banking))\n\nAugust 1, 2021\\[Source\\](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-announces-plans-to-acquire-afterpay)\n\n* Square announces plan to acquire Afterpay\n   * Aimed towards a younger generation\n\nSeptember 20, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-launches-integrated-omnichannel-solutions-for-businesses-in-france](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-launches-integrated-omnichannel-solutions-for-businesses-in-france))\n\n* Square plans to enter France market\n\nSeptemeber 28, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://finance.yahoo.com/m/14b72cf0-0153-3985-ae1e-4ccf7d198700/square-partners-with-tiktok.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/14b72cf0-0153-3985-ae1e-4ccf7d198700/square-partners-with-tiktok.html))\n\n* Square partners with TikTok\n\n\\[Source\\]([https://www.barrons.com/articles/mastercard-bnpl-payments-affirm-square-51632845187](https://www.barrons.com/articles/mastercard-bnpl-payments-affirm-square-51632845187))\n\n* Mastercard announces plan to enter BNPL market\n\n**Competitors**\n\n* PayPal\n* Fiserv\n* Global Payments\n* Affirm Holdings\n* Shopify \n* Clover\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SQ/SdTObmDK-Square-SQ-Descending-Channel/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SQ/SdTObmDK-Square-SQ-Descending-Channel/)\n\n**Bullish Case**\n\n* BNPL industry has global potential to grow \n* Small business lending is increasing\n* Invested heavily in Bitcoin \n\n**Bearish Case**\n\n* Strong competition in the BNPL industry\n* Speculation of future revenue reliant on Bitcoin\n* Invested heavily in Bitcoin\n\n**Management** \n\nSquare CEO Jack Dorsey is somewhat a prodigy.

Not many CEOs can say they\u2019ve helped build their companies' platforms and helped manage them. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI am concerned about Mastercard\u2019s announcement to enter the BNPL market. I believe that other credit cards and banks will follow suit. Up until now, banks have been slow to respond and are sustaining huge losses because of it. The BNPL market is pretty saturated as it is. The BNPL market as a whole is very expensive (coming from a small investor's POV). Square\u2019s P/B ratio is currently at 40, which indicates that the company might be overvalued. On top of that, Squares Total liabilities, D/E ratio, and Long Term Debt have all seen a sharp increase. Square is aggressively trying to expand by financing its debt. This alone makes me hesitant to invest. I am concerned with Square\u2019s ties to bitcoin. I labeled this as both a bullish and bearish case. Square invested a good chunk of money in bitcoin. That means their reliant on bitcoins performance. If bitcoin goes up, they go up. If bitcoin goes down, they do down. There is a lot of news and government intervention surrounding bitcoin which can either be positive or negative. I do believe the BNPL industry is a growing market, but with more competition entering the market, it will be hard for Square to capture market share. \n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice.

        "selftext": " Hello everyone.\n\nRecently I have been thinking and reading about the payment processing sector and its undergoing changes, which can, in my opinion, affect the future of card networks.\n\nAs many might know companies like Visa earn an interchange fee every time me and you utilize a debit/credit card to buy something, effectively acting as a middleman between us and the merchant.\n\nOf course this proved to be a very successful business as most of us have one or more debit/credit cards, and that their stock prices have skyrocketed over the decade.\n\nHowever I am wondering whether the incredible growth for card companies is sustainable, and that, perhaps, we are close to reach a plateau.\n\nBefore jumping to the bear case for cards think about China. Payments with cards are almost non-existent given the dominance of Wechat Pay and Alipay.\n\nI believe similar things are happening in the US as well. Think about Cash App, Venmo, Paypal, all now allow people to transact utilizing QR codes, potentially bypassing the Card Networks. I say potentially because often we still link our debit/credit cards to our mobile apps. But I believe that as transfer of funds get easier, people could potentially start utilizing the available funds stored in their apps to conduct the transaction, effectively bypassing Card Networks. I believe also that Paypal and co. would prefer us to utilize stored value instead of cards when conducting payments, as they would not have to share any fees with MA or V.\n\nNow. I don't live in the US. So I am not sure about the frequency of shops that allow consumers to buy through QR codes, but from what a read the number has been increasing since the outbreak of Covid-19. Furthermore, payment processing companies like Adyen/Stripe could potentially easily enable merchants to toggle a switch and activate the QR payments offered by Venmo/Cashapp/Paypal (similarly to how they enable Wechat Pay/Alipay).\n\nOf course if people go travel overseas cards will remain the first choice of payment. But who knows. In the long future a tourist shop in London could potentially accept Venmo/Cash App QR payments (supposing that they gained significant popularity in the US) if they expect significant number of US customers. Similarly to how may shops (particularly luxury retailers) in the US are accepting Alipay/Wechat Pay.\n\nNow this is a very short summary on what I believe might disrupt card networks. However, I have to say that this does not mean that card networks are going to die, instead, in the short to mid-term they will probably keep growing. However, I believe that in the long-term they are poised for disruption, as new payment methods that can potentially bypass them might gain popularity.\n\nHope I was able to convey my thoughts clearly. What do you guys think? \n\nPersonally I have some money in MA. And I have to say that this transformation in the payment processing industry is both exiting and scary (as a MA shareholder).\n\nTL;DR\n\n1. Credit/Debit cards might be disrupted by new payment methods that bypasses their network.\n2. Credit/Debit cards will not die or disappear. But growth might be reduced.",

And at this price? I think it's at a good fundamental value. The fundamentals are strong. $12B+ in revenue and $45B in Mkt Cap? They make 1/3 of their mkt cap in revenue alone. Yes please. It's only set to grow.\n\nIf you understand what has happened, this is the window of opportunity.\n\nMassive equity and massive short-term covered calls.

But I'm not an investment professional nor condone any trade, this is a casino and we're all degenerates.\n\n==\n\nThey need this to stay below $35 - $38s for twelve months. If you buy equity and sell long-term covered calls above $35-$38, it'll hit them where it hurts. If a massive amount of long equity purchases are combined with a large number short-term covered calls. They can't just lose the premium on the call. But they might have to. Don't you see? Because those puts are there and because call leaps are present, THEY LITERALLY CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO MOVE UP. So if you sell covered calls, you are reducing your cost basis and capturing the premium. But at these prices, this stock is a frekin gold mine. It is the e-commerce of Korea. We all buy from Amazon so you know how convenient it is to shop from Amazon. It's the same shit from Coupang Inc. but with many other services as well.\n\n==\n\nThe MA is simple 30D moving average and is most likely the real equity average. Why? Because it's moved in a straight downward trend for the past 3 months. That is their short average.",

Now it is important to note that you can still get killed even if you have a 89%+ win rate. Gamma ramps into expiry especially if you are near the money so tread carefully. \n\nWhy would 3 days be better than 5? Perhaps momentum and direction has an expiry ie the 'oomf' dissipates quickly. This would be interested for longer period trades like 30 or 45. Your protection for such trades would need to come from being well outside the standard deviations ie low Delta's.\n\nTrade at your own risk",

I felt the timing was right because we've had some big developments recently and potentially, a very interesting week ahead of us...\n\nFor those that haven't seen my initial comprehensive look at $CLOV aka, Clover Health Investments on WSB, I've included a link below.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pn6gev/clov\\_dd\\_the\\_dude\\_diligence\\_report\\_912\\_edition/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pn6gev/clov_dd_the_dude_diligence_report_912_edition/)\n\nThe main reason for creating &amp; publishing these periodic DD updates is to clear up a lot of the rampant misinformation that's continually perpetuated on various online forums w/ regards to Clover Health.\n\nI'll also be updating it, clarifying sections &amp; fixing inaccuracies, if needed, to keep it fresh. My hope's that these summaries can educate and become *the* one-stop shop thread here on WSB that CLOV Apes can reference, direct people to, or get add'l, fact-based info when questions come up.\n\nIn this DD I'll be focusing on significant catalysts happening now and events I believe will be influencing CLOV price action moving forward over the next several months and beyond.\n\nAs with all my write-ups, this is compiled based upon my own opinions, I'm not a financial advisor nor is this intended as financial advice- blah, blah, you're smart- invest at your own risk and do your own due diligence. I like this stock as a long-term growth play (especially now, following CLOV's plan-rating upgrades on Friday \\*detailed out below\\* by the Centers for Medicaid &amp; Medicare Services) ...and I do currently hold a position in Clover Health.\n\nAlso of note, I'm more active on Twitter (follow me here [https://twitter.com/nikiped1a](https://twitter.com/nikiped1a) ) ...than I am here on reddit, so if you like this or any of my other write ups, I'd love to hear your feedback both positive or negative (I'm always doing my best to improve and learn from all of you and I understand I can and do get things wrong on occasion.)\n\n**DUDE DILIGENCE FOREWORD**\n\nLet's start this all off with two simple metrics:\n\n1.

Clover Health **Current Market Cap. is $1.99B** as of EOD Oct 8, 2021 (253M shares outstanding x $7.85 share price)\n\nThis is what we're working with...\n\n**CATALYSTS INFLUENCING CLOV PRICE ACTION LEADING UP TO Q3 EARNINGS**\n\nFor those not yet familiar with Clover Health Investments- by its name alone, you're likely thinking it's in the healthcare space or maybe a crusty insurance company right? Well, wrong... kindof.\n\nClover Health is actually a next-gen, technology focused company (software/AI/machine learning)playing in the slow-to-adapt, healthcare/insurance industry. If you think of it in any other way, you're entirely missing what their core mission is. That mission? ...to change and disrupt an industry through technology- an industry that's generally content w/ the status quo and looking to squeeze out competition.\n\nThrough their software offering, The Clover Assistant (which I explain in further detail below), CLOV feels their members will be able to live their healthiest lives w/ fewer dr/hospital visits all while saving these members money at the same time. This will also help differentiate itself from its competitors from an efficiency/cost savings standpoint.\n\nCLOV is also focused on providing and expanding health equity by offering their services to underserved communities as referenced here by a series of tweets from Chamath Palihapitiya on Friday:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bxwjcomgzos71.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fab96ef081a9644dddd186a3863b0dafd075920f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ie5x53izos71.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53123bfc2541203fb5b6070de3e6e473eb27dac7\n\nBefore I dig into the most recent news and catalysts, I want to reiterate a few details from my last DD that will really come into play in a big way this coming year.\n\nMASSIVE GROWTH INITIATIVES\n\nCLOV announced their intent to double their geographical market size at the end of Q2, which was approved by CMS last month, expanding their addressable market from 108 to 209 counties and from 8 to 9 states for 2022.\n\nTotal population within their TAM is slightly over 29M people or just shy of 9% of the total US population\n\n...sooo, in short, there's a sh\\*tton of future expansion/growth potential during the upcoming years/decades- they're just getting started.\n\nFor perspective, performance of two prominent tickers in CLOV's space over the past 10 years:\n\n**Humana**\n\n$72 in Sept 2011 ----&gt; $412 Today (was $470 in July)\n\n**UnitedHealthcare Group**\n\n$45 in Sept 2011 ----&gt; $408 today\n\nCurrent states and counties where CLOV is now available for enrollment:\n\n[Updated 2022 Clover Health Operating Market \\(Operating in 209 total counties in 9 states, up 101 counties and 8 states in the past 12 months\\)](https://preview.redd.it/gi48a7vkzos71.png?width=946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8294be5f7b5be6e7ff499d3466b13c3c388b473a)\n\nTakeaway- their massive **140% YoY revenue growth announcement identified during Q2 earnings (Aug '21)** did not include any of this upcoming market expansion (doubling number of counties they're available in from 2021 to 2022).\n\n...let that sink in.\n\nCLOV then announced a new partnership w/ ValueH allowing them to do business with their Clover Assistant (Clover's machine learning, proprietary AI software offering) ...and expand into in the state of Florida beginning in 2022 stating through a PR:\n\n\"...*Through the arrangement, ValueH will support Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and Management Services Organizations (MSOs) participating in Clover\u2019s Direct Contracting Entity beginning in 2022.*\n\n*Clover\u2019s DCE (Direct Contracting Entities) will enable providers to manage the care of their Original Medicare patients with the Clover Assistant. The Clover Assistant is a clinical software tool used by doctors at the point of care to provide them with data-driven, personalized recommendations to improve how they care for their patients. Participating providers can benefit from:*\n\n* ***Unified, Actionable Data***\\*: access lab results, prescription lists, and previous diagnoses, including those from other clinicians\\*\n* ***Personalized Care Plans***\\*: receive and share new information at each patient visit and have access to clinical decision support\\*\n* ***Simple, Fast Reimbursement***\\*: receive the Clover Assistant reimbursement within seven days for each patient seen with the Clover Assistant\\*\n\n*\u201cWe are excited to partner with ValueH to help support our efforts to increase the quality of care delivered to patients while simultaneously lowering medical costs...\u201d*\n\nIn summary, nearly doubling their geographical TAM (not including their new partnership in Florida) will be a massive catalyst heading into the Medicare Open Enrollment period that begins this week (Friday) Oct 15, 2021 and continues through Dec 7, 2021. This will give us 17 days of CLOV OE data prior to Q3 ending on the 31st and provide us with a glimpse into their Medicare Advantage enrollment growth momentum heading into Q4, as a teaser in Q3.\n\nA FEW MORE HIGHLIGHTS FROM MOST RECENT Q2 EARNINGS\n\n\\- As of Q2, \"lives under Clover management\" aka **those enrolled in MA plan w/ CLOV grew 126% YoY.**\n\n\\- Lives/enrollees under Clover Assistant mgmt (CLOV's AI Software) **grew 229% YoY.**\n\n\\- Clover Assistant software is **on track to manage over $1B in annualized revenue.**\n\n\\- Clover management **expects a significant increase in total aligned beneficiaries** to the company on Jan 1, 2022, when claims aligned beneficiaries for 2022 become active.\n\n**UPGRADED 2022 MEDICARE STAR RATING BY CMS**\n\nThe biggest announcement, possibly to date, that directly affects Clover Health's business happened this past Friday. It represents a huge momentum shift heading into the Medicare Open Enrollment period for the upcoming year. So, what was this announcement? CLOV's Medicare Adv. PPO plan Star Rating was just upgraded by CMS for 2022.\n\nFor context, every year, the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services evaluates Medicare plans based on a 5-star rating system. Medicare Star Ratings help you know how well your plan has performed historically. You can use these Star Ratings to compare plan's performance to other competing plans. It also dictates how much providers are reimbursed &amp; bonused (paid) by the gov't.\n\nCLOV just announced this past Friday (Oct 8th) that:\n\n\".*..the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has upgraded Clover\u2019s PPO plan to 3.5 stars on the Medicare Star Ratings for its Medicare Advantage (MA) plans for the 2020 measurement year. Currently, over 90% of Clover\u2019s Medicare Advantage membership is served through its PPO plan.*\n\n...The announcement was significant enough that Chamath came out of hiding and tweeted his first tweet about CLOV in over 6 months...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4n7bzy5pzos71.png?width=595&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38af255e6fd127b0c8a5fe403c2bd47e2f8d68a1\n\nThis was a huge announcement for a number of reasons. Let me explain...\n\n1. As mentioned above, there's a significant financial compensation component that comes from an upgraded Star Rating score, specifically in what a company receives as a rebate from the Gov't\n\n[Old CLOV rebate payment &amp;#37; from Gov't was 50&amp;#37;, beginning in 2022 it's bumped to 65&amp;#37;- this is a significant development for Clover Health's financials](https://preview.redd.it/ac2kg6crzos71.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4984a0adc4f4d85d8fd1fa54eb64f5ab84927747)\n\nYou may be asking yourself \"...sooo, why is this such a big deal?\" Well, one of the big arguments by shorts manipulating the share price over the past several months is that their Medical Cost Ratio is high.\n\nAnd there are a few reasons for this, not the least of which has to do with the fact we're currently in the midst of the worst global pandemic in over 100 years. Most, if not all healthcare companies have seen Medical Cost Ratio increase these past few quarters and this is beginning to subside and expenses will normalize over the next few quarters. But this bump up in rebates will help to further discount this inaccurate yet persisting narrative that has been used as FUD.\n\n[Medicare Advantage avg. rebate payout &amp; growth 2015-21](https://preview.redd.it/2xf9kl8vzos71.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f124715517483c4f2c5d83f57df16ddf04343cbe)\n\nMarket's reaction to both the CMS announcement &amp; Chamath's tweet on Friday- ...it appears they were pleased:\n\n[Market reaction on Oct 8 to Star Rating Upgrade and Chamath's subsequent tweet reiterating it.](https://preview.redd.it/mmm15u0yzos71.png?width=1116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6552fad059ef885cad8162d12ab27f3aea78990)\n\n2. The second benefit that could be realized from the star rating bump will be that CLOV nowoffers a more appealing Medicare Advantage plan vs. its competition and possibly an \"easiersell\" for those enrolling new members.\n\nAll in all, this announcement will have a big impact on growth &amp; financials improvementduring the upcoming year as the company moves toward profitability.\n\n3. This is obviously my opinion, but I believe this announcement just has that feel ofbeing the last piece needed to further strengthen their business thesis while furtherdiscrediting many of their most ardent naysayers and negative narratives they've beenpumping about Clover Health and its ability to thrive, since becoming public this past January.\n\nI believe this announcement could be the turning point for this stock in that it'll nolonger be seen as just this meme stock, or a pump and dump squeeze play.It demonstrates &amp; confirms the rapid progress CLOV is making on multiple fronts as itbecomes a disruptive force to be reckoned with in their respective industry.\n\nDo I believe that the shorts and their manipulation tactics all of the sudden end? No-however, I bet we'll start seeing their relentlessness soften (possibly even cover then switch tolong positions) as we see the stock be able to hold on to gains and slowly begin to act morelike a normal stock as people start seeing proof of the vision coming to fruition and it's pricebegins to represent fair market value.\n\n4. And while I'm skeptical of many analysts and the motives behind the entire stock ratingssystem, this announcement may also trigger updated and new analyst ratings/upgrades inthe upcoming weeks/months as strong growth was confirmed last quarter, and nowfinancials being positively influenced through the star rating upgrade/higher rebatepayments. When we see these new analyst ratings start to roll out, we'll see strongmovement upward.\n\n**HAS THE BOTTOM ARRIVED AND IS A MOMENTUM SHIFT COMING IN HOT?**\n\nI understand many of you are mainly focused on a CLOV squeeze, and while that's still definitely in the cards, with all of this recent news, traders/investors are starting realize that CLOV may even be a better long-term growth play w/ higher top-end potential than a short lived squeeze.\n\nOf note, publicly available Short Interest data (not including dark pool shorting) has shown a decrease from 40%+ SI earlier this summer to closer to \\~17% today. With DP data, it could easily be double or triple that figure.\n\nOne thing I feel, that has been frustrating for some investors and slowed price action to this point, is how CLOV's management team hasn't directly disputed any of the misinformed attacks on the company, but instead, acted through a more subtle strategy of deliberate actions while exceeding expectations.\n\nPersonally, I don't mind this approach as we all know talk is cheap, and actions speak much, MUCH louder than words. It also shows a composed confidence that Sr. Management appears to have in their product, strategy and growth opportunity.\n\nI can't confirm this for certain, but these past few weeks, something interesting has been happening.Numerous, massive, after-hours dark pool prints have been clearing day after day. Many have speculated it could be institutional shorts covering and transitioning to long positions.\n\nWe're talking multiple occasions where 800K -1.2M single block prints were being made AH day for a solid week.\n\n[Example of numerous After Hours large volume prints \\(returns to longs?\\) that happed for 5 straight days in mid-late Sept](https://preview.redd.it/vpkvjq810ps71.png?width=687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa07bbd89b592c9e385a0da710b8eddfe21da4e6)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iozyppsf0ps71.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb9a49170d945c47a49cba71d41a0d618db58204\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jfpftsqh0ps71.png?width=666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=febf366781a3dfbe8726b74a860313870131477a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/03kgjuzi0ps71.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ebd24a9ed9bbc2730b241c9b04740ce1c0f7d80\n\n**LOOKING AHEAD TO Q3, Q4 AND BEYOND**\n\nAs I start to wrap this up, I want to give you all an idea of how I think about CLOV's potential price action over the next 9-12 months. And before I even begin, I want to make it clear: \\*THESE ARE NOT PRICE TARGETS\\* but instead a general range and timeline on how I think about CLOV.\n\n**Oct 11th - approx. Nov 15 (whenever Q3 earnings are released):**\n\nI see price action prob staying above $7.50 moving forward with this most recent news as this has been artificially depressed by shorts for some time. I do think we could see a quick spike into the $9+ range this week and possibly even into the 10's by the end of the month but crossing and staying above $11 prob won't happen until we get concrete Q3 data along w/ solid guidance and a clearer picture of the company in terms of FCF, revenue, open enrollment momentum, etc. Want to emphasize, this is a very conservative view on my part.\n\n**Nov 15 - approx. Feb 15 (when Q4 earnings are released):**\n\n\\*If Q3 ER comes in strong\\* expect a significant bump in price possibly even mid-teens, which should be sustainable, not just a pump and dump. I also feel this is conservative, but I like setting conservative expectations and then being surprised w/ strong upside. Unless a squeeze happens, I still feel short forces will still be pushing back on the stock during the quarter but I wouldn't be surprised if price action maintains low to mid-teens leading up to Q4 ER in mid-Feb.\n\nMoving ahead, I really think Q4 ER could be a significant transformational quarter in terms of a setup for a sustained run on price because Open Enrollment will have come and gone (which prob accounts for 95%+ of their new MA growth for the year). Following OE, CLOV Medicare Advantage lives under mgmt will probably jump from 65Kish currently to 75-80K+ while continuing their 20-25%+ annual growth rate. However, where it could get interesting is with their Direct Contracting Entity numbers that currently stand at \\~60K lives.\n\nThe Q4 ER will not only include all the MA enrollees, but it will also include a month of the DCE number that'll be counted between Jan 1-31 2022. I wouldn't be surprised if we see this jump 10's of thousands (as well as additional revenue starting to trickle in from the new Florida partnership becoming active) ...CLOV could have 100-150K+ DCE enrollees and be nearing 180-240K total lives (DCE+MA) under mgmt.\n\nOf note, and not that it matters because I think all these ratings firms are corrupt and play into the intertwined market manipulation, but CLOV initially had $18-$20 PT's earlier this year from a number of these analysts when CLOV had mentioned the potential of having 200K lives under mgmt. If CLOV has 15-20% or more above that, where does the valuation go?\n\n**Feb 15- approx. May 15 (whenever Q1 earnings are released):**\n\nQ1 Earnings has the potential to be game changing. If at this point, we've seen 3 solid earnings reports (or even 2 out of the 3) for Q2, Q3 and Q4, it'll be hard to stop this beast moving forward, at least for awhile.\n\nThe biggest news to look for from Q1 Earnings is that the higher Medicare rebate amount will be added in this quarter. Remember, with their bump in star rating, their rebate payment from the Gov't increases 30% (from 50% to 65%). They could also potentially see 250-300K total lives under management at this point as well, depending on how DCE is rolled out next year.\n\nCould be fun to watch, and if this all happens as detailed, or even partially, there is so much good news happening over the next few months, we will finally start to see CLOV's fair value being represented in the actual stock price.\n\nAnd last but not least- I'm basing these ranges off of fundamentals, not \"the\" squeeze... Do remember, there IS the potential of a juicy squeeze built in there at some point- ...but in my mind, that's just the icing, suckaaas!\n\nThe $DUDE\n\n[https://twitter.com/nikiped1a](https://twitter.com/nikiped1a)",

        "selftext": "# Excerpt: Thanks TD Advanced Dashboard\n\nSo I came across Xenon Pharmaceuticals ($XENE) using the options screener on TDAD as a \"Highly Recommend\" covered call play and I was rinse and repeating on monthlies for a little while, then got busy with my day job and didn't sell 10/15 calls... and I opened the mobile app today to find that my underlying magically DOUBLED IN PRICE?!? I would've cried monke tears if I got assigned.\n\nTLDR: I doubled a portion of my portfolio by accident\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fig. 1: Candles so insignificant that the MA trendlines cover them up](https://preview.redd.it/sq6bjctfvjr71.png?width=1311&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c4c34eb3e28e6273faf6f0a879a20860fba8230)\n\n# The Actual DD: $XENE\n\nThe good news: 65mil volume on 10/04 on 41mil Shr Out after news of their cutting edge epilepsy drugs had very successful mid-stage trials, before open. XENE hopes to accelerate the FDA approval on the basis of the safety and efficacy of their medication (Source: EDGAR).\n\nTheir advantage? The mechanism for the drug allows for high efficacy while reducing the side effects that plague current medications. The current market for epilepsy medication is estimated to be around $7bil growing at about 6.6% compounded annually (Source: Coherent Market Insights).\n\nThe bad news: Epilepsy drugs are a tight market with a lot of competitors, it's hard to say how much of a market share they can enjoy this early on. There are internal discussions on how to move the drug into production and into the market but no hard plans (Source: EDGAR). These first 2 are significant risk factors in my opinion, however for short-medium term, the following section is likely the single biggest contributor to the high IV:\n\n# The Wildcard: Shelf Prospectus\n\nWhat justifies the current IV is the shelf prospectus filed during the day after the price skyrocketed before open, worth $250mil. What exactly is a shelf prospectus? Basically a way for companies to sell secondary offerings without actually filing a secondary offering. We all know how negatively secondary offerings affect share price due to dilution (See: $HEXO); even hearing the words uttered drops a share 5% instantly.\n\nA shelf prospectus is a way for the company to better control the share price while diluting the float, by divvying up the money they want to raise and selling shares in phases. This offers three advantages:\n\n1. The company doesn't need to go through the lengthy process of filing with the SEC every time they want to raise funds.\n2. The company doesn't have to sell shares if they don't want to/need to.\n3. The company can play it by ear and only offer shares when the market conditions are optimal.\n\nNow obviously, slow and steady dilution is dilution and there's no other way around that, but the decision to file a shelf prospectus indicates to me that the management of this company is somewhat capable. Fundamentally speaking, as a company you want to raise as much money as possible at the least possible expense\n\ni.e. if you file the prospectus at a 52 week high and calculate the number of shares to be offered   \nbased on that high price, you don't need to sell as many shares for the same amount of money\n\ni.e. less dilution of shares.\n\nAnother thing to note is their posted tangible net book value increasing \\~$4 per share since June, under the assumption that the underwriters exercise the full value of the offering at the price of $31.50\n\nAnother interesting note in the shelf prospectus filed is that RBC Capital Markets is actually listed in the table of underwriters, so the fact that one of the biggest banks in Canada is backing this thing gives me a little more confidence for the long-term.\n\nThere are also small notes about lock-ups for insider shares but not enough details revealed in the SEC filings yet. IMO they are not significant enough anyway as the last known % of float owned by insiders was only around \\~5%\n\nOne more major risk is that the negative effect of the dilution drops the price too low, resulting in the need of ANOTHER prospectus if they don't raise enough funds on the 1.2mil shares in this current offering (See: TMC the metals company)\n\n# \"That was a lot of fancy words, so what are you calling?\"\n\nI'm thinking very near term bullish as this stock gains a bit of momentum, but I am hedging with medium-term puts as I do think that the medium term for the next couple years will be bearish as dilution occurs. Long term bullish so I took some profits but am still maintaining a decent (for my size portfolio) long position. After hours trading supports my near-near term views but I've seen with many pharma companies where they don't post any news for a while and the interest dies off after a couple months.\n\nCurrent positions: \n\n* 500 shr @ cost basis of \\~$15\n* 5 lots Oct15 Calls SP $25\n* 3 lots Jan21 Puts SP $25",

I believe that other credit cards and banks will follow suit. Up until now, banks have been slow to respond and are sustaining huge losses because of it. The BNPL market is pretty saturated as it is. The BNPL market as a whole is very expensive (coming from a small investor's POV). Square\u2019s P/B ratio is currently at 40, which indicates that the company might be overvalued. On top of that, Squares Total liabilities, D/E ratio, and Long Term Debt have all seen a sharp increase. Square is aggressively trying to expand by financing its debt. This alone makes me hesitant to invest. I do believe the BNPL industry is a growing market, but with more competition entering the market, it will be hard for Square to capture market share. \n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice.

Square owns the popular Cash App which allows users to send payments, receive payments, invest, hold, and buy/sell bitcoin.\n\n**Industry Overview**\n\nThe buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) industry has seen some major growth this past year. There are advantages to using BNPL over credit cards. With BNPL technology, consumers don\u2019t have to worry about their credit scores. This can be seen as both an advantage and disadvantage. If you have a low credit score, you can use Square to avoid taking more hits on your credit. However, you can\u2019t build up your credit score using Square. \n\n**News Timeline**\n\nJuly 20, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://squareup.com/us/en/press/introducing-square-banking](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/introducing-square-banking))\n\nAugust 1, 2021\\[Source\\](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-announces-plans-to-acquire-afterpay)\n\n* Square announces plan to acquire Afterpay\n   * Aimed towards a younger generation\n\nSeptember 20, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-launches-integrated-omnichannel-solutions-for-businesses-in-france](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-launches-integrated-omnichannel-solutions-for-businesses-in-france))\n\n* Square plans to enter France market\n\nSeptemeber 28, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://finance.yahoo.com/m/14b72cf0-0153-3985-ae1e-4ccf7d198700/square-partners-with-tiktok.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/14b72cf0-0153-3985-ae1e-4ccf7d198700/square-partners-with-tiktok.html))\n\n* Square partners with TikTok\n\n\\[Source\\]([https://www.barrons.com/articles/mastercard-bnpl-payments-affirm-square-51632845187](https://www.barrons.com/articles/mastercard-bnpl-payments-affirm-square-51632845187))\n\n* Mastercard announces plan to enter BNPL market\n\n**Competitors**\n\n* PayPal\n* Fiserv\n* Global Payments\n* Affirm Holdings\n* Shopify \n* Clover\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SQ/SdTObmDK-Square-SQ-Descending-Channel/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SQ/SdTObmDK-Square-SQ-Descending-Channel/)\n\n**Bullish Case**\n\n* BNPL industry has global potential to grow \n* Small business lending is increasing\n* Invested heavily in Bitcoin \n\n**Bearish Case**\n\n* Strong competition in the BNPL industry\n* Speculation of future revenue reliant on Bitcoin\n* Invested heavily in Bitcoin\n\n**Management** \n\nSquare CEO Jack Dorsey is somewhat a prodigy.

Not many CEOs can say they\u2019ve helped build their companies' platforms and helped manage them. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI am concerned about Mastercard\u2019s announcement to enter the BNPL market. I believe that other credit cards and banks will follow suit. Up until now, banks have been slow to respond and are sustaining huge losses because of it. The BNPL market is pretty saturated as it is. The BNPL market as a whole is very expensive (coming from a small investor's POV). Square\u2019s P/B ratio is currently at 40, which indicates that the company might be overvalued. On top of that, Squares Total liabilities, D/E ratio, and Long Term Debt have all seen a sharp increase. Square is aggressively trying to expand by financing its debt. This alone makes me hesitant to invest. I am concerned with Square\u2019s ties to bitcoin. I labeled this as both a bullish and bearish case. Square invested a good chunk of money in bitcoin. That means their reliant on bitcoins performance. If bitcoin goes up, they go up. If bitcoin goes down, they do down. There is a lot of news and government intervention surrounding bitcoin which can either be positive or negative. I do believe the BNPL industry is a growing market, but with more competition entering the market, it will be hard for Square to capture market share. \n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice.

Key drivers that result in folks pursuing a plant-based diet are typically health, animal welfare and the environment [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44488051). In a world where worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975, 39% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in 2016, and most of the world's population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight, [link](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight along with other statistics such as 463 million people live with diabetes and 1.13 billion people live with hypertension (also known as high blood pressure) \u2013 conditions that often occur together and are among the leading global causes of poor health and death [link](https://world-heart-federation.org/news/the-cost-of-inaction-on-diabetes-and-hypertension/), it\u2019s not too surprising that people are turning towards plant-based foods-\u2013 which are a large part of a vegan diet \u2013 particularly fruit, vegetables, nuts, pulses and seeds, as they have been shown to help in the treatment of many chronic diseases and are often associated with lower levels of type 2 diabetes, less hypertension, lower cholesterol levels and reduced cancer rates [link](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/enjoy-food/eating-with-diabetes/veganism-and-diabetes). \n\nFrom an animal welfare perspective \u2013 it turns out that an estimated 99% of US farmed animals are living in factory farms at present. By species, it\u2019s estimated that 70.4% of cows, 98.3% of pigs, 99.8% of turkeys, 98.2% of chickens raised for eggs, and over 99.9% of chickens raised for meat are living in factory farms [link](https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates), less than ideal conditions within these farms where \u2018animals are packed in as tightly as possible to maximize output and profit, even though this causes many to die from disease or infection before being sent to the slaughterhouse\u2019 [link](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/) has also contributed to an increase in the awareness of and consumption of plant-based foods on ethical grounds.\n\nThe third driver\u2019s been getting the most airtime recently since it seems the planet\u2019s actually pretty fucked, with a new report by the UN Environment Programme that came out yesterday finding \u2018new and updated Nationally Determined Contributions only take 7.5% off predicted 2030 emissions, while 55% is needed to meet the 1.5\u00b0C Paris goal\u2019 [link](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/updated-climate-commitments-ahead-cop26-summit-fall-far-short-net) a.k.a a bunch of countries do not want to make the necessary concessions to preserve the planet in its current state. These \u2018Latest climate promises for 2030 put the world on track for a temperature rise this century of at least 2.7\u00b0C\u2019 [link](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/updated-climate-commitments-ahead-cop26-summit-fall-far-short-net), with the planet still on track for catastrophic heating [link](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/10/1104012). Why is any of this important/relevant in this context? It turns out that \u2018the animal agriculture sector is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions,\u2019 [link](https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/climate-change-animal-agriculture-factsheet.pdf) highlights include 9% of annual human-induced CO2 emissions,3\n37% of methane (CH4) emissions, which has more than 20 times the global warming potential of CO2,\nAnd 65% of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, which has almost 300 times CO2\u2019s global warming potential [link](https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/climate-change-animal-agriculture-factsheet.pdf). Not that it\u2019ll happen anytime soon but it turns out that cutting meat and dairy products from diets could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by up to 73 per cent. If everyone stopped eating these foods, researchers at the University of Oxford found that global farmland use could be reduced by 75 per cent, an area equivalent to the size of the US, China, Australia and the EU combined \u2013 leading to a significant drop in greenhouse gas emissions [link](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/veganism-environmental-impact-planet-reduced-plant-based-diet-humans-study-a8378631.html). One survey found that ~23% of people were interested in cutting down meat consumption for the sake of the environment, showing an additional market for producers of plant-based food [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44488051). \n\n**Part 2 - Company Overview and Value Proposition** \n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what Tattooed Chef\u2019s all about and what sets it apart in the marketplace. In the company\u2019s own words - Tattooed Chef is a leading plant-based food company offering a broad portfolio of innovative plant-based food products that taste great and are sustainably sourced. Tattooed Chef\u2019s signature products include ready-to-cook bowls, zucchini spirals, riced cauliflower, acai and smoothie bowls, and cauliflower pizza crusts, which are available in the frozen food sections of leading national retail food stores across the United States. Understanding consumer lifestyle and food trends, and a commitment to innovation, allows Tattooed Chef to continuously introduce new products. Tattooed Chef provides great-tasting, approachable, and innovative products not only to the growing group of consumers who seek to adopt a plant-based lifestyle, but to any of the \u201cPeople Who Give a Crop\u201d [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/).\n\nThe Company\u2019s current market opportunity is worth $42 billion and consists of a number of frozen food categories including frozen appetizers &amp; snacks, frozen breakfast foods, frozen entrees, frozen fruits &amp; vegetables, and frozen plant based meat alternatives [link](https://gyazo.com/c586290597f7fccff2db2ad399e09f41). It\u2019s worth noting that frozen plant-based meat alternatives in which some of its most comparable comps are, is only worth $0.8 billion, in comparison to the other massive segments such as frozen entrees at $23.1 billion and frozen fruits and vegetables at $7.6 billion. The growth in the frozen food category (a key areas where TTCF competes) has been primarily driven by the recent product innovation as a response to the growing demand for great tasting, clean label and convenient options. The overall frozen food category outpaced the general center of store food categories. Millennials and Gen Z are driving growth in the frozen foods section due to convenience, frozen fresh and plant based foods, with the number of consumers who say convenience had a significant impact on their food purchase decision growing from 49% in 2017 to 57% in 2019 [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nThe Company\u2019s product portfolio consists of entrees, breakfast, vegetables, pizza, meat alternatives, and with yesterday\u2019s acquisition news \u2013 they\u2019ll also be entering into nutrition bars. The growth in their portfolio and product range has been pretty explosive, especially in the last year where they went from 38 total products and 17 total new innovations in 2020 to 73 total products and 35 total new innovations in 2021 (thus far) [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb).  \n\nA key strength of Tattooed Chef and its USP is its vertically integrated operations that enable it to create a strategic advantage, through vertical integration they have control of ingredients and prioritization of product, the ability to go from innovation to market in as little as 3 months with experience in manufacturing, distribution, supply chain. As of their past IR deck presentation they highlighted four manufacturing facilities and capacity available to achieve $500+ million in revenue. This will be increasing to five with Belmont\u2019s acquisition and likely higher revenue potential.\n\nIn September 2021, key highlights included 52% year on year growth in revenue from $67.9 million in the first half of 2020 to $103.4 million in the first half of 2021, 82% year on year growth in the established brand from $38.0 million in the first half of 2020 to $69.1 million in the first half of 2021 **with no investment in marketing and brand until 2021**, strong resources with ~$140 million cash balance, 275k square feet of manufacturing capacity to quadruple in 2021 and opportunity for strategic M&amp;A (closed 2 key acquisitions in 2021), and growth in sales and marketing including launching the first national media campaign, tripling of branded store count and creation of 35 new product in 2021 [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). Despite the initial lack of marketing \u2013 testimonials such as President and CEO Salvatore Galletti stating that \u2018Target said it was the most successful frozen food launch in the history of Target\u2019 during the Q1 2021 earnings call show how popular the products are \u2013 even with minimal marketing.\n\nThe expansion in national distribution has been remarkable, with growth from 1,614 stores in 2019 to 4,272 in 2020 i.e., ~165% increase. The goal in 2021 was to reach 10,000 total stores, with 8,355 already achieved in the 1H of 2021 \u2013 by the 3Q 2021 it\u2019s expected that national distribution will have expanded to over 12,000 stores which would be a ~180% increase with the year not even being over. This was facilitated in part by the number of major retail customers that Tattooed Chef was able to onboard \u2013 in 2020 key customers included Walmart, Sam\u2019s Club, Costco, Target, Trader Joe\u2019s, and Aldi. In 2021 this list expanded with 20 additional key customers highlighted, including Kroger, Whole Foods, Albertsons Safeway, Harris Teeter, and Publix. In a study of mass retailers, 3 of the top 10 items including the #1 and #2 since launch in March 2021 of plant based frozen entrees belonged to Tattooed Chef, with dollar velocity over 60% above the nearest top 10 competitor [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb).   \n\nMarketing and branding only really became a component of Tattooed Chef\u2019s outreach in 2021, which makes their success thus far even more impressive in my opinion. The goal is to reach 80% of all Plant Based Intenders (78 million customers) through the national media campaign. I would really recommend taking a look at the IR presentation which has been linked here in several other places to understand more about how Tattooed Chef describes the plant-based intender and the wide cross section of society from which they come \u2013 urban dwellers, parents, under 35 year olds, people who want to eat less meat, aspiring &amp; practicing vegetarians/vegans, pescatarians &amp; flexitarians \u2013 there\u2019s something for everybody in Tattooed Chef\u2019s product portfolio and they\u2019ve segmented their target audience pretty well. The campaign is running through 10,000+ TV spots plus targeted digital video and streaming \u2013 one every 15 minutes, and 24 top tier networks plus Hulu and Programmatic Connected TV/Streaming. As of August 3, 2021, brand awareness grew from 6% to 15% [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nThe Company has stable leadership and has been family run, while also adding experienced folks from the industry to the management team. This includes Sam Galletti \u2013 the CEO and President with 35 years of experience in the food industry having served in both operational and investor roles within seafood, breaded vegetables, salsas and dips, grilled chicken, and organic foods companies. Sarah Galletti \u2013 the Tattooed Chef &amp; Chief Creative Officer who was the creator of the \u201cTattooed Chef,\u201d joined the Company in 2014 and spearheaded shift to plant based and has experience as a former chef in Italy. Stephanie Dieckmann \u2013 Chief Financial Officer &amp; Chief Operating Officer who joined Tattooed Chef in 2017 and has over 12 years of experience in the food industry, also being the former CFO of APPA Fine Foods. Matt Williams \u2013 Chief Growth Officer who joined Tattooed Chef July 2020, has over 25 years\u2019 experience in CPG including roles at Dean Foods, Coca Cola and PepsiCo [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\n**Part 3 \u2013 Recent Updates**\n\nYesterday on 10/27, Tattooed Chef entered into an agreement to acquire Belmont Confections, a private label co-manufacturer of nutrition bars, for approximately $18 million in cash and stock. The transaction has been unanimously approved by Tattooed Chef\u2019s Board of Directors and the acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021. The transaction allows Tattooed Chef to further diversify its product offerings and enter into the $10 billion global plant-based bar category. At full capacity, Tattooed Chef believes the Belmont facility can contribute over $100 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-acquire-belmont-confections-120000434.html), for a reference point \u2013 TTCF currently expects 2021 revenue to be $235 million to $242 million so having just under half of that come from Belmont alone in a couple of years in a new market segment is a pretty big deal.\n\nEarlier this month on 10/4, Tattooed Chef announced six of its entr\u00e9e bowls are available in approximately 1,200 Publix Super Markets (\u201cPublix\u201d) stores as of October 1, 2021. Sam Galletti, President and CEO of Tattooed Chef, added that with the addition of Publix, Tattooed Chef products are now in more than 13,000 stores nationwide including Kroger, multiple divisions of Albertsons, Sprouts Farmers Market, Target, Walmart, Costco, and Sam\u2019s Club [link]( [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-now-available-publix-120000419.html).\n\nOn August 10th, Tattooed Chef announced it has launched four entr\u00e9e bowls including two new flavors at Sprouts Farmers Market in approximately 340 stores [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-launches-innovation-items-120000798.html). \n\nIn July, Tattooed Chef announced that it expects to launch its branded products across multiple categories in approximately 1,800 Kroger stores nationwide later this summer. By September, shoppers can find a variety of Tattooed Chef\u2019s plant-based offerings including pizzas, entr\u00e9e bowls, and vegetables in nearly every Kroger. A total of 12 SKU\u2019s will be rolled out nationally [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-launch-kroger-stores-120000706.html). \n\nOn May 18th, Tattooed Chef completed the acquisition of New Mexico Food Distributors, Inc. and Karsten Tortilla Factory, LLC (collectively referred to as \u201cFoods of New Mexico\u201d) for approximately $37.0 million in cash [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-completes-acquisition-mexico-100000887.html). The acquisition of Foods of New Mexico allows Tattooed Chef to expand further into the $20 billion Hispanic/Southwest Food sector and beyond, including frozen, refrigerated, and ambient products. Utilizing these new capabilities, the Company expects to launch Tattooed Chef branded products in additional categories. Foods of New Mexico\u2019s two facilities total 118,000 square feet and\nprovides Tattooed Chef additional capacity to continue to innovate [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb) and is expected to contribute $200m to annual revenues in the next two to three years [link](https://www.just-food.com/news/plant-based-firm-tattooed-chef-to-acquire-foods-of-new-mexico/). \n\nSo in the span of 5 months, some of the highlights of Tattooed Chef include completing an acquisition that doubled the number of manufacturing spaces it had (from just Italy and California to adding Foods of New Mexico, Albuquerque and Foods of New Mexico, Karsten), agreeing on another acquisition that will enable it to enter a new market segment and have another production facility (both of these acquisitions are expected to contribute a combined $300m to revenues in two-three years \u2013 more than the expected full year revenue of the Company this year), launching into two major nationwide chains and continuing to innovate and launch new products \u2013 whatever knock anyone may have on them you can\u2019t deny that they\u2019re moving pretty quickly to lock in sources of major revenue growth. \n\n**Part 4 \u2013 Financials and Valuation**\n\nRevenue \u2013 Revenue for the first half of 2021 was $103.4 million, an increase of 52.2% from $67.9 million in the first half of 2021. The increase in revenue was primarily due to growth in sales of \u201cTattooed Chef\u201d branded products. [link](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390021042632/f10q0621_tattooed.htm#a_003). For the full 2021-year, Tattooed Chef expects revenue in the range of $235 million to $242 million, an increase of 58% to 63% compared to 2020. This guidance implies 49% year-over-year growth on the base business to $222 million, and a $13 million to $20 million contribution from one of the two facilities included in the Foods of New Mexico acquisition [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results). Tattooed Chef is expecting to reach revenue of $1 billion in 2026, so increasing by 5x over the next five years [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-this-food-company-growth-stock-plans-to-generate-%241-billion-in-revenue-2021-02-07), with the expected contributions from two key acquisitions this year \u2013 they could reach that number even earlier than 2026.  The Company expects Foods of New Mexico to contribute up to $200 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-enters-agreements-acquire-new-mexico-food), and the Belmont Confections facility to contribute over $100 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-acquire-belmont-confections-120000434.html). If we do some pretty rough (by pretty rough literally don\u2019t take this as any kind of in-depth analysis \u2013 just guesstimating) back of the envelope math and assume conservatively that both acquisitions begin contributing these numbers in 2024, and assume $240 million for the Company in revenue for this year with a slightly lower year on year growth rate of 50% just to make it easier for numbers\u2019 sake, that would mean $360 million in 2022 (excluding acquisitions), $540 million in 2023 (excluding acquisitions), and $810 million in 2024 (excluding acquisitions). Add in the expected $300m the that Foods of New Mexico and Belmont would be expected to contribute by then and you blow past the $1 billion number a couple of years early (this is assuming of course that operational capacity can sustain these numbers \u2013 the Company currently is quadrupling capacity in 2021) [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nGross Profit \u2013 Gross Profit was $13.9 million in the first half of 2021, compared to $13.0 million in 2020 \u2013 while this was an increase in absolute terms, the Gross Profit Margin declined from 19.1% in 2020 to 13.4% in 2021 thus far. This was primarily due to expenditure on infrastructure to support current and expected growth in operations and increased raw materials, packaging, freight and container costs due to inflation [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). The Company has forecasted improving gross profit margins for the full year 2021 in the range of 16% to 22% [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results), due to leverage of fixed costs on higher volume, benefit of new equipment to enhance operating efficiencies, and the product and channel mix [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nAdjusted EBITDA \u2013 Adjusted EBITDA was ($9.2) million in the first half of 2021, as compared to $9.0 million in the first half of 2020. This was primarily due to public company accounting costs that were not present during the 2020 period, as well as significant increases in promotional expenses, marketing expenses, professional services, and freight and container costs [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb), this is forecasted to be ($14) to ($17) million for the full year 2021 so still decreasing in subsequent quarters, but at a lower rate, as the Company is committed to an aggressive plan of growing its brand through extensive marketing and promotional spending that has already produced significant revenue growth in both grocery and mass retail [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results). \n\nMarket cap of TTCF [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TTCF) is $1.5 billion, in comparison to \u2018competitors\u2019 such as Beyond Meat who have a market cap of ~$6 billion [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYND/). Quotation\u2019s emphasis because TTCF is competing in a broader range of segments so they\u2019re not exactly direct comps but one of the closer ones we\u2019d be able to look at here. Beyond has cash on hand of $1 billion compared to the $140 million that Tattooed Chef had in the last quarter, and also has ~2.5x the revenue with $257.59 million compared to $103.4m for Tattooed Chef, however the revenue growth was only 22.4% for Beyond so ~2.5x less than the 52.2% for Tattooed Chef, with Beyond incurring significant losses as well so as a growth story I would really think that TTCF is valued at magnitudes less than it should be. \n\nThe analyst consensus for TTCF is a buy with an average price target of $23.50 so a 32.17% upside from current prices [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TTCF/price-target/), compared to BYND which has a consensus hold and an average price target of $112.24 so a 18.93% upside from current prices [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/BYND/price-target/), with a P/S of 10.22 for TTCF [link](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-TTCF/financials-statistics-and-ratios/price-sales/) compared to 13.25 for BYND[link](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-BYND/financials-statistics-and-ratios/price-sales/), it would also seem like the more attractive investment with higher upside.   \n\n**Part 5 \u2013 Bear Case**\n\nWell the most obvious risk would be that the Company\u2019s not profitable - as a growth story, it has a higher focus on revenue growth than profitability and my interpretation is that achieving higher revenue is the primary concern over the next couple of years, meaning that there is going to be cash burn in the short-term and I wouldn\u2019t expect them to become profitable till probably around mid-2023. The one-off valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $47.22 million skewed numbers a bit for this year, but if they were to continue making similar amounts of losses (excluding the one-off) so in effect  ~$15 million in the first half of 2021 and doubling that to ~30 million for the full year, they would probably have enough cash to last 3 years \u2013 this is of course a very, very crude estimation as losses would not stay the same in absolute terms, the Company has estimated it\u2019s gross profit margin would improve and they could become profitable within a couple of years as well and keep themselves in the running for longer.\n\nFrom what I understand, the Company is also authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and currently have 81,938,668 shares issued and outstanding, meaning if it seemed like there was going to be a cash crunch, they already have the authorization for a potential dilution which would be a point of concern for any equity holder. I doubt they would need to call on this at least for a year or two and potentially not at all if they turn profitable soon but you can never be certain so worth keeping in mind [link](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390021042632/f10q0621_tattooed.htm#a_003).   \n\nAnother risk would be the promotional/marketing/professional service expenses which seem to have the biggest percentage increases since 2020, as the company continues to build brand awareness and expand its distribution points and stores, marketing expenses especially would be likely to continue to rise. The Company has said that \u2018We expect overall operating expenses to decrease over time as a percentage of revenue as many relatively fixed operating expenses will be spread over increasing revenue, but expect freight and container costs to remain high (relative to historical) as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future,\u2019 [link](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390021042632/f10q0621_tattooed.htm#a_007). The latter sentence about freight and container costs is concerning to me because in my opinion that\u2019s one of the types of costs that a Company doesn\u2019t have too much choice over e.g. if someone is selling you raw material and it becomes too expensive it\u2019s within your control (hopefully if the product isn\u2019t too niche) to switch to another supplier, but here with shipping costs companies are less likely to have that sort of leverage and would probably end up just having to absorb the cost, especially in this case where Tattooed Chef has a production facility in Italy \u2013 not something that I would expect to remain constantly high in the long-run but with current supply chain constraints it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on.\n\nFinally, this is more of a mixed bag of bull and bear, as we\u2019ve seen earlier \u2013 the current opportunity market for Tattooed Chef\u2019s diverse range of products is massive and while having a wide variety of products is great as a buffer in the event one particular segment faces issues e.g. as we\u2019re seeing now with Beyond [link](https://www.reuters.com/business/beyond-meat-forecasts-disappointing-revenue-pandemic-uncertainty-2021-08-05/), there is a risk that increasing competition in this market \u2013 especially by firms leveraging economies of scale by operating in just one particular segment, could pressurize margins (although since Tattooed Chef is vertically integrated, it should be more resilient in this regard than competitors that aren\u2019t).\n\n**Part 6 \u2013 SI and Squeeze Potential**\n\nI swear I\u2019ve probably noticed the use of the word squeeze like a dozen times in my life prior to last year, but now it\u2019s everywhere \u2013 like cheese in a mousetrap with half-baked numbers that just act as clickbait or a cause for people to fomo in. Nevertheless, being aware of short interest as a concept and having the numbers is a useful data point to have \u2013 though I would urge anyone reading this not to just look at SI and squeeze numbers when making an \u2018investing\u2019 decision. Broken clocks are right twice a day and there are undoubtedly companies for which there is a good justification for folks to be doubling down on shorting them. [Let\u2019s take a look at TTCF\u2019s short interest numbers and squeeze potential using the SMELL test](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/nzd2zi/whats_that_smell/). \n\n* Short Interest \u2013 15.5 million shares out of 82 million total shares outstanding. With insiders holding almost half the shares, that leads to short interest of 37.43% of free float [link](https://gyazo.com/c18de608d5efde59055092e26bd6c7a3), Additionally, with utilization of 98.56%, there\u2019s very little left for shorts to borrow to depress the price further [link](https://gyazo.com/3b067c76c0cc8c9d268e3089c9b6c498).\n\n* Market Cap \u2013 $1.5 Billion so at the lower range of a midcap stock, would require a few hundred million for shorts to cover if they were the only ones trading on a given day so would require a good amount of capital to exit or to add further to their short position if they decide to double down. Insiders hold 45.03% of shares outstanding, while institutions hold 16.87% of shares outstanding (30.7% of the free float) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TTCF/holders?p=TTCF).  \n\n* Extremely Memeable \u2013 Can\u2019t think of too many better causes to get behind than saving the planet by eating your vegetables \u2013 if only you\u2019d listen to ma when you were a kid and ate some broccoli instead of meatloaf we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\n\n* Low Liquidity \u2013 Average volume per yahoo finance is around 1.5m shares, with current volume around 20% lower than that so &lt;5% of the free float. Any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly, which would be exacerbated by the fact that the most recently reported days to cover was 13.49 [link](https://gyazo.com/817e2edb0eb27d294c414d19eed52f58) which means at the current volume shorts would need almost 3 weeks to cover their positions. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on TTCF for cheap, with institutional inflows of $119M and only $6.57M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TTCF/institutional-ownership/) so a net increase of ~95%.\n\n* Low Risk (IV) \u2013 Yep, current IV is 47.1% for 10/29 and 11/5 options so pretty cheap to load up on if you\u2019re so inclined. A good resource to understand the mechanics of a gamma squeeze can be found here in my opinion if that\u2019s the sort of thing that interests you [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prcdnr/why_you_suck_ass_at_gamma_squeezing_and_what_you/). \n\n**Part 7 \u2013 TL; DR**\n\nThe total global plant-based retail market size is expected to reach $162 billion in 2030, increasing by more than 500% from $29 billion in 2020. Key drivers that result in folks pursuing a plant-based diet are typically health, animal welfare and the environment. Tattooed Chef\u2019s current market opportunity is worth $42 billion and consists of several frozen food categories including frozen appetizers &amp; snacks, frozen breakfast foods, frozen entrees, frozen fruits &amp; vegetables, and frozen plant-based meat alternatives.\n\nTattooed Chef is a leading plant-based food company offering a broad portfolio of innovative plant-based food products that taste great and are sustainably sourced with signature products include ready-to-cook bowls, zucchini spirals, riced cauliflower, acai and smoothie bowls, and cauliflower pizza crusts, which are available in the frozen food sections of leading national retail food stores across the United States. The Company\u2019s product portfolio consists of entrees, breakfast, vegetables, pizza, meat alternatives, and with yesterday\u2019s acquisition news \u2013 they\u2019ll also be entering into nutrition bars. The growth in their portfolio and product range has been pretty explosive, especially in the last year where they went from 38 total products and 17 total new innovations in 2020 to 73 total products and 35 total new innovations in 2021.\n\nA key strength of Tattooed Chef and its USP is its vertically integrated operations that enable it to create a strategic advantage with control of ingredients and prioritization of product, the ability to go from innovation to market in as little as 3 months and soon to be 5 manufacturing facilities. Key highlights included 52% year on year growth in revenue from H1 2020 to H1 2021, 82% year on year growth in the established brand from H1 2020 to H1 2021**with no investment in marketing and brand until 2021**, strong resources with ~$140 million cash balance, 275k square feet of manufacturing capacity to quadruple in 2021 and opportunity for strategic M&amp;A (closed 2 key acquisitions in 2021), and growth in sales and marketing including launching the first national media campaign, and tripling of branded store count with key customers including Walmart, Sam\u2019s Club, Costco, Target, Trader Joe\u2019s, Aldi, Kroger, Whole Foods, Albertsons Safeway, Harris Teeter, and Publix. In a study of mass retailers, 3 of the top 10 items including the #1 and #2 since launch in March 2021 of plant based frozen entrees belonged to Tattooed Chef, with dollar velocity over 60% above the nearest top 10 competitor.\n\nRevenue for the first half of 2021 was $103.4 million, an increase of 52.2% from $67.9 million in the first half of 2021. For the full 2021-year, Tattooed Chef expects revenue in the range of $235 million to $242 million, an increase of 58% to 63% compared to 2020. Tattooed Chef is expecting to reach revenue of $1 billion in 2026, so increasing by 5x over the next five years, with the expected contributions from two key acquisitions this year \u2013 they could reach that number even earlier than 2026. Gross Profit was $13.9 million in the first half of 2021, compared to $13.0 million in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was ($9.2) million in the first half of 2021, as compared to $9.0 million in the first half of 2020. \n \nMarket cap of TTCF is $1.5 billion, in comparison to \u2018competitors\u2019 such as Beyond Meat who have a market cap of ~$6 billion. The analyst consensus for TTCF is a buy with an average price target of $23.50 so a 32.17% upside from current prices, compared to BYND which has a consensus hold and an average price target of $112.24 so a 18.93% upside from current prices, with a P/S of 10.22 for TTCF compared to 13.25 for BYND, it would also seem like the more attractive investment with higher upside.   \n\nRisks include the Company not being currently profitable due to an immediate focus on the top-line, potential for dilution as the Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and currently have 81,938,668 shares issued and outstanding, likelihood of increasing marketing expenses even though the Company has an expectation of a decrease in OPEX as a percentage of revenue. \n\nTattooed Chef passes the SMELL test for a squeeze if the conditions are right, as short interest is 37.43% of free float with utilization of 98.56%, market cap is at the lower range of a midcap stock so capital required to cover is not insignificant in the event of shorts wanting to exit or doubling down on their positions, meme-ability is high, liquidity is low with around 1.5m shares traded on average and 13.49 days to cover, and low risk as IV is sub 50% for the next couple of weeks of options in the run-up to earnings.\n\nAppreciate y\u2019all for reading this if you made it this far. I\u2019m playing the runup to earnings because the stock has barely moved with yesterday\u2019s acquisition news and I believe there\u2019ll be some short covering going on in the meantime over the next couple of weeks in expectation of a growth beat as certain milestones that could impact that have already been surpassed e.g. the target of 12,000 stores by Q3 2021 was already announced as over 13,000 in the 10/4 press release. If it does end up picking up in the short-term, I\u2019ll be looking to roll the gains into leaps post-earnings. Positions \u2013 30 x 18.5c @ 10/29 and 20 x 20c @ 11/5.",

And this one\u2019s a *doozy*.

Be sure to give our mentioned authors some love as well. Onward!\n\n## Uranium??\n\nThe story is so strange here that I couldn\u2019t even think of a catty section title, so strap in. Ever since the Fukushima nuclear meltdown in 2011, uranium has been nearly uninvestable to institutions. Uranium futures prices peaked in 2011 above $70 and decayed below $18 by late 2016 \\[1\\]. Prices hover slightly upward for the next 4 years, entering 2021 around $30. Now, things get interesting. An important note on Uranium production and use brought to you by Kuppy at [AdventuresInCapitalism](https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2021/09/02/the-new-gbtc/):\n\n*Shot*\n\n&gt;\u201c\u2026 let\u2019s use some VERY broad numbers. The world is producing roughly 125 million pounds from primary mining, 25 million pounds from secondary sources and consuming roughly 180 million pounds, for an overall deficit of 30 million pounds a year.\u201d\n\n*Chaser*\n\n&gt;\u201c\u2026 almost everyone who owns uranium today, owns it because they intend to consume it in their reactors \\[\u2026\\]. In a market with a deficit, they\u2019re all implicitly short uranium. With an entity buying up the free float, they\u2019re going to get squeezed. We all know how squeezes work, but I don\u2019t know of any similar scenario where the squeeze was as aggressive or blatant.  \n*The utilities are blissfully unaware, they\u2019re eventually going to panic and pay any price for uranium as a reactor that runs out of uranium is just an expensive paperweight.*\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right folks, ever since April of 2021, a buyer has come out of the woodwork to buy every last piece of uranium they can get their hands on in a market with a desperate demand, and that buyer is [Sprott Physical Trus](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)t.\n\nAnd they\u2019re \u2026 Canadian?\n\nAs of today, the fund owns over 32 *million* pounds of uranium and is buying at a pace that tracks the *entire yearly production*. I\u2019ll leave you with closing thoughts from [Doomberg](https://doomberg.substack.com/) in [Is Uranium About to Go Nuclear?](https://doomberg.substack.com/p/is-uranium-about-to-go-nuclear):\n\n&gt;\u201c\u2026 this will soon undoubtedly become one of the most interesting and talked about stories in the financial world, if it isn\u2019t already. The situation is truly unprecedented. Given the critical nature of the commodity being cornered, I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if governments eventually intervene\u2026\u201d\n\n\\[1\\] - For anyone keeping score at home, that means the price of uranium had a half-life of about 2.83yr, as opposed to uranium itself, which has a half-life of about 4.5 billion years.\n\nAuthor Links:\n\n* Kuppy \\[[Blog site](https://adventuresincapitalism.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdvInCap)\\]\n* Doomberg \\[[Substack](https://doomberg.substack.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DoombergT)\\]\n\n## Sentimental Support\n\nIt\u2019s been a weird year for growth stocks. $ARKK is down 6.9% on the year, and over 25% off its February peak. I/O Fund writer and Portfolio Manager, Knox Ridley, shows us in his Oct. 7th analysis why the fund believes select names in Big Tech will end the year strong from here. A bit from [Sentiment Puts a Floor Under this Dip](https://io-fund.com/sentiment-puts-floor-under-this-dip):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65in5vndkpt71.png?width=1430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb4a6681b3246aa840876278356654d922621793\n\n&gt;\u201cNote the pattern in 2020 \u2013 as the indexes makes a new high, the % of stocks above their 200-Day MA makes a lower high. This was a warning that the markets were weakening under the hood. Starting in March of this year the same divergence began, and is still playing out right now.\u201d\n\nSo we see that select names are showing strength and putting the S&amp;P on their backs, so to say. And as market indexes don\u2019t select for these strong performers, the sentiment seems bearish:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/020aq0qfkpt71.png?width=1430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cedf4137b1a695039c4a41d2794085c2f6fe6792\n\n&gt;\u201cNote the pattern going into the February bear market. As realized volatility was actually increasing, investors couldn\u2019t buy enough calls compared to puts. \\[\u2026\\]  \nCompare that pattern to today. We are seeing the opposite unfold \u2013 as realized volatility continues to trend down, investors are buying more puts. This is signaling that sentiment is rather bearish to cautious as the market continues to climb higher in a low volatility environment.\u201d\n\nInvestors appear worried and are working to cover their downside risk. So, even while October to year\u2019s end is historically strong, Knox encourages you to be especially selective.\n\n&gt;\u201cWhen you note seasonal trends and historic patterns, coupled with an unusual amount of negative sentiment and the recent relative strength in economically sensitive sectors, we believe a similar trend will unfold into year-end. For this reason, we have been accumulating high conviction names that are showing excellent relative strength. Many of these names are embedded in strong tech microtrends that we anticipate to continue into the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nAuthor Links:\n\n* Knox Ridley \\[[Twitter](https://twitter.com/knox_ridley)\\]\n\n## Quick Bites\n\n**Ondas making moves**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1liwo7tikpt71.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dae7674b60a59c24b3aeb6ce442cb17ee34caf96\n\nOndas ($ONDS) is an interesting company at a very early stage (i.e. high risk), working on providing secure private broadband internet primarily for infrastructure companies.

        "selftext": "# Crypto Market Weekly Analysis By FINESTEL\n\n# (SEP 26 - OCT 2, 2021)\n\n\ud83d\udd30 In this post, we go through this week's Technical, Fundamental, and On-Chain analysis of the cryptocurrency market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Regarding Bitcoin's importance during this period, we focused our analysis on Bitcoin and its effects on the whole crypto market.\n\n# \u2b55 1. News &amp; Fundamentals\n\n# \n\nAfter a month-long shake out full of liquidations and FUDs, mainly from **China**, eventually this week was full of exciting and positive news related to both **El Salvador**'s adoption, and **Twitter**'s implementation of the **Bitcoin Lightning Network**.\n\nBesides that, Morgan Stanley announced that they are increasing their exposure to Bitcoin by buying 58,000 shares of **Grayscale**\u2019s GBTC followed by the announcement of **Coinbase** which allows American\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 users to deposit all or part of their paychecks in crypto or Dollars without a fee.\n\n\ud83d\udc02 Another extremely bullish news which helped BTC to start a rally and break its Short-term Key Resistance was Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech about not banning crypto in America.\n\nAlso, **Canadian**  ETF issuer **EvolveETF**, has launched a diversified exchange traded fund. The two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap back the product: **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum**.\n\nHence, market\u2019s sentiment has become positive after this news.\n\n# \u2b55 On-Chain\n\n# 2. All Exchange's Reserve\n\nNow let\u2019s check the on-chain data for Bitcoin:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udd05 One of the most important metrics to check is **Bitcoin\u2019s all exchange\u2019s reserve** which shows the behavior of players, whether they want to put sell pressure or not.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 As you can see after a dip in price on July 20th, the exchange\u2019s reserve continued to **decrease** reaching new lows since 2020.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 In the long term, a decrease in spot reserves would likely push the upward price trend because it shows that people are **accumulating BTC**, sending it to their wallets, and aren\u2019t interested in selling their Bitcoins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 3. Network\u2019s Activity\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look into the network\u2019s **activity** since May 2021. The chart below shows that transaction counts have declined since BTC\u2019s major price crash in May, returning to what could be considered a '\ud83d\udc3b bearish on-chain activity channel' (\ud83d\udfe2 Box).\n\nHigher transaction count is a sign of \ud83d\udc02 **bullish conditions** as new entities come into the network and increase demand. You can see that the transaction count has been increasing since July 2 till now (\ud83d\udfe3 Box).\n\n# 4. Hash-Rate\n\nAfter **China** cracked down on miners and banned Bitcoin mining, which caused a price crash in May 2021, we witnessed that BTC\u2019s **hash rate crashed down** as well.\n\nAfter hitting a low at the end of June (\ud83d\udd34 Box), the BTC hash rate has started its course of **recovery** and continued to rise to a new local high.\n\nMiners are bullish \ud83d\udc02 about the future prospect of Bitcoin as more hash rates come along. It is just a matter of time until a full recovery, with new miners coming online and others being relocated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 5. Active Users\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe can see a similar pattern in BTC\u2019s active users on the network. It has been recovering after the crash and continuously rising since then (\ud83d\udfe1 Box).\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 This indicates that on-chain activity is rising which is necessary for a healthy market and is a bullish\ud83d\udc02 sign.\n\n# 6. NVT\n\nAs you may know, **NVT** is a metric that shows if a network is undervalued/overvalued according to its **daily transaction** **value** compared to the **market cap**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 Higher values indicate that we\u2019re in a bubble and BTC is overvalued. For lower values it's vice versa. NVT has been in a downtrend since late June (again after the major crash), and it is reaching  its all-time lows.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 As a result, we think that BTC is undervalued and we will have another rally to new all-time highs soon. As you can see, many on-chain metrics confirm that.\n\n# \u2b55 Technical Analysis\n\n# 7. MAs\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udd3a After hitting a new **local high** of $52,600 on Sep 7th, BTC\u2019s price started to fall down in a descending channel pattern as investors have been waiting to see if the support at $40k could hold.\n\n\ud83d\udc41\u200d\ud83d\udde8 The **$40K zone** was an important one because price\u2019s 20-Week MA and 100-Day MA were at this zone at the same time and if the price wanted to break this support level, it had to break these two important moving averages too.\n\n# 8. Higher Highs\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udd3aToday\u2019s strong rally could be the beginning of the next leg up for Bitcoin to reach new ATHs after many short positions were squeezed out of their positions and liquidated; specially an incredible **539 BTC short liquidation** which happened in just one minute, BTC soared into $48K area forming a **higher high price action pattern** and broke its 200-Day Moving average suggesting that a healthy correction likely completed.\n\n# 9. Fibonacci Retracement\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udd38 If you take a look at **Fibonacci retracement**, you can see that the $40K-$41K area was exactly at 0.5 level of the former leg up which shows a great healthy correction of another leg up move for Bitcoin.\n\n\ud83d\udd6f The weekly candle will be closed tonight; so reclaiming the 200-day moving average and 21-week EMA on a weekly closing basis will be a very \ud83d\udc02 **bullish signal**.",

        "selftext": "Agenus (AGEN) is an immuno-oncology company based in Lexington, MA. It currently trades around $5.70/share. I've been following it for a while so I wanted to share some of the more recent, exciting news for you to consider if you're looking to invest in a small biotech with plenty of potential.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Bristol Myers would pay Agenus up to $1.56 billion to develop and commercialize one of its experimental cancer drugs. It paid Agenus $200 million up front. A large, reputable drug maker like Bristol Myers doesn't do that with a small biotech unless they see a lot of promise in it. \n\nIn June, Agenus announced that the FDA granted priority review for one of its important treatments for cervical cancer. The FDA set a target action date of December 16, 2021. \n\nAgenus is scheduled to present data on their potential blockbuster treatment AGEN1181 next month. On last quarter's earnings call, Agenus's Chief Commercial Officer said, \"I've had the good fortune to have led and been a part of over 20 product launches in my career. I believe that the promise that 1181 has, clinically and commercially, is seldom seen in a career. And it is a big reason of what got me to come to Agenus.\" Obviously the data could go both ways, but this could be a catalyst.\n\nThese are only a few things that Agenus has going for it. I encourage you to check out their pipeline on their website. In addition to Bristol Myers, they have many more partnerships (Merck, Incyte, GSK, etc) and studies in different phases. If you're looking for a biotech with a lot of potential and upcoming catalysts, consider taking a shot on this one.",

S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures both traded in solidly positive territory.\n*****\n&gt; Ford saw its shares jump more than 9% on blockbuster earnings while also raising guidance. The automaker said increased availability of semiconductors during the quarter allowed it to ramp up production.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Twilio fell around 13% in after-hours trade, despite a beat on both earnings and revenue for the third quarter, after the cloud communications platform projected a fourth-quarter loss. Ebay also fell by about 5% on weak fourth-quarter revenue guidance.\n*****\n&gt; Pharmaceutical giant and Dow component Merck saw its shares rise nearly 1% premarket after the company posted an earnings beat on the top and bottom lines. Fellow bluechip index company Caterpillar topped profit estimates but fell just shy on revenue, sending its shares up nearly 2%.\n*****\n&gt; The market will be getting more big earnings news, with tech giants Amazon and Apple reporting after the closing bell.

The blue-chip Dow dipped more than 250 points, falling for the first time in four days.\n*****\n&gt; Major averages have been marching higher on earnings momentum this month. The S&amp;P 500 has gained 5.6% in October, on pace to post its best month since November 2020. The Dow is up 4.9% this month, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has rallied 5.5%.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly 40% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported earnings and more than 80% of them beat Wall Street expectations, according to CNBC calculations. S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to grow profit by about 37.6% in the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings have helped and a reminder that US reporting so far has been better than the long-term average in terms of beats,\u201d Jim Reid, head of thematic research at Deutsche Bank, said in a note. \u201cIt has still been healthier relative to some of the stagflationary gloom stories seen through September and early October which has perhaps helped the relief rally.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/tFhXxGs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Z1GaYCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3gNdLsD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/blUbzGe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/Hf5aMlH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($AAPL $AMZN $FB $AMD $MSFT $GOOGL $UPS $BA $SHOP $F $GM $GE $XOM $V $OTIS $TZOO $TWTR $KO $MA $MMM $X $LMT $CAT $ABBV $MCD $KMB $JBLU $BMY $SBUX $TDOC $SPOT $LII $RTX $ENPH $CVX $HOOD $MRK $WM $QSR $HAS $MO $PKG $TXN $LLY $TWLO)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/JrlDETW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SHOP $MA $CAT $NOK $MRK $OSTK $MO $DQ $BUD $YUM $CMCSA $SIRI $AMT $RDS.A $NEM $CHKP $RS $FLWS $SWK $HSY $BTU $TAP $TPX $STM $MDC $TREE $AVNT $TROW $ADS $NOC $CNX $CARR $IMAX $SNY $LH $OSK $SAH $CBRE $AEP $AGCO $SNDR)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/toObqWO.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/x0wSXqQ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/uYEDyCd.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/kjKf0vv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/lEZ59gr.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/pNlS6ZK.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hE59JOO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fNRHx1w.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/EM9W0zY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GSji0yN.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/G7XcB4i.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/kv3CiQv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/x8X44ks.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fSbIfWH.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/57hzopa.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Mwi1ykX.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/gX6sxVH.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/xLGlice.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* DOGE.X\n* IRNT\n* F\n* NOK\n* SHOP\n* FUTU\n* CAT\n* TIGR\n* TDOC\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-comcast-caterpillar-merck-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Comcast (CMCSA)** \u2013 The parent of NBCUniversal and CNBC reported adjusted quarterly earnings of 87 cents per share, 12 cents above estimates.

        "selftext": "Hey gang!\n\nMarkets continued to edge higher, led by the continued bullish sentiment for third-quarter earnings and a new record high for everyone's favorite speculative asset - bitcoin. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) posted a record high after gaining 0.4%. The S&amp;P 500 Index ETF (SPY) rose 0.3% and is 0.4% from its own new high. The Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) added 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) posted a minor loss, falling 0.1%. \n\nQQQ may have been adversely affected by Netflix (NFLX), as the company fell more than 2% after reporting earnings. Overall, earnings reports continue to have a positive effect on the market, drowning out concerns over supply chain constraints, inflation, and the delta variant.\n\nBitcoin surged to a new all-time high, near $67,000. The first bitcoin futures ETF (BITO) began trading on Tuesday. In addition to a measure of validation from Wall Street with the new ETF, bitcoin is perhaps being seen as an inflation hedge, adding fuel to the current run. \n\nWith overall uptrends appearing to continue, chart watchers should notice the difference between SPY and QQQ. The tech-heavy QQQ posted a small pullback today, and with many of the mega-cap tech companies comprising top weighted holdings of SPY, this divergence could mean that the S&amp;P 500 Index ETF may pull back to be closer in line with QQQ in the near term. \n\nTesla (TSLA) is currently down 0.23% after hours after reporting earnings. Will have to wait until tomorrow for results on my latest earnings-based plays - Tesla, Las Vegas Sands (LVS), and Danaher (DHR). I also took a crazy speculative SPY position today as I think the market will let it hit a new high before any sort of serious large pullback. \n\nObligatory: these are not stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that kind of advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing unusual option data, (so if you don't see your favorite stonk, don't take it personally) please do you own DD, etc. etc. etc.\n\nI pull my data from a premium Market Chameleon account. News I generally get from Finviz, but I also check Google. For economic reports, my go to is ForexFactory. Unusual option activity is defined as options that see at least 1.4x the average option activity by volume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|STOCK|PRICE|VOLUME (AVG)|CALLS% - PUTS%|MOST ACTIVE|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|INVZ\\*|5.05|7.8K (2.7K)|100 - 0|Nov 7.5c (7.1K)|\n|SOS|2.92|162.4K (46.5K)|96 - 4|Oct 22 3c (37.3K)|\n|SESN|1.23|78.9K (8.6K)|88 - 12|Nov 2c (21K)|\n|PROG|2.74|62K (29.3K)|91 - 9|Nov 3c (16.4K)|\n|UEC|3.98|19.8K (5.5K)|89 - 11|Dec 5c (4.7K)|\n|EBON|2.25|18.3K (7.8K)|97 - 3|Nov 2.5c (9.5K)|\n|ATIP|2.91|14.5K (1.7K)|47 - 53|Dec 2.5p (2.5K)|\n|ADMP|1.08|10.6K (3.1K)|97 - 3|Nov 1.5c (7.2K)|\n|AGEN|5.00|9.1K (3.8K)|97 - 3|Jan22 10c (3.3K)|\n|PLX|1.19|8.5K (978)|1 - 99|Feb 3p (2.1K)|\n|WATT|2.03|8.2K (2K)|86 - 14|Nov 2.5c (1.6K)|\n|SANW|3.20|5.9K (82)|97 - 3|Feb22 2.5c (3.4K)|\n|VIEW|4.84|5.4K (1.6K)|100 - 0|Dec 7.5c (5.1K)|\n|FTEK|2.20|5.4K (789)|92 - 8|Nov 3c (2.4K)|\n|FTFT|2.40|5.1K (1.9K)|94 - 6|Nov 2.5c (3.8K)|\n|CSPR|4.52|5K (811)|99 - 1|Dec 10c (2.6K)|\n|BTG|4.23|4.4K (1.7K)|95 - 5|Nov 5c (2.7K)|\n|CYCN|2.96|4K (1K)|96 - 4|Jan23 5c (750)|\n|LIZI|3.53|3.9K (637)|100 - 0|Nov 5c (3.7K)|\n|GRTX|2.07|3.7K (2K)|71 - 29|Nov 2.5c (1.7K)|\n|YRD|4.16|3.3K (155)|96 - 4|Nov 5c (2.1K)|\n|TRYP|4.83|3.1K (1.7K)|0 - 100|Dec 1p (1K)|\n|KRBP|2.13|2.9K (1.7K)|100 - 0|June 7.5c (1.3K)|\n|CTIC|2.76|2.8K (341)|98 - 2|Dec 2c (1.5K)|\n\n\\*started the day below $5 per share\n\nNotes:\n\n**INVZ +3.49% (+0.3%)** No news. Nearly all of the option activity stemmed from a single order for 5,000 of the November $7.50 calls. \n\n**SOS +16.95% (+5.8%)** Oooh I did not realize that SOS had weekly options. Not many penny stocks do, could be good for a micro-wheel strategy. No news for SOS other than bitcoin raging to a new all time high. \n\n**SESN +25.74% (-3.15%)** SESN was up 44% at one point, after the FDA granted its request for a meeting to discuss the issues brought up within the complete response letter (AKA death sentence) for one of its treatments. SESN saw nearly 10x the average volume today. Is this too big of a gain? Puts my print, I reckon. \n\n**PROG -9.33% (+0.74%)** PROG *just* missed falling enough to land on the short sale restricted list. Volume was down today, with over 71 million shares changing hands. After falling for the second day in a row, I still haven't bought back the covered call I sold, as volatility is keeping premiums high. The relative uptrend from PROG is still nice, but it will be interesting to see how the share price reacts in the coming days if volume continues to fall. There are currently over 160,000 options in the open interest for November 19 expiry, however IV suggests that the $3.50 and $4 calls are being sold more than bought. On the plus side, it does appear that puts at each strike from $2 to $3.50 are being sold more than bought as well. VegaGang in action. \n\n**UEC +12.08% (-0.25%)** No specific news for UEC, however *The Wall Street Journal* did have a write up about how day traders are driving uranium prices higher. \n\n**EBON +11.11% (+2.27%)** Bitcoin go brrrr. Anything crypto related is going to go bananas right now. \n\n**ATIP -21.64% (+1.75%)** ATIP tanked after announced preliminary third quarter results. The drop can be attributed to revising 2021 guidance lower. \n\n**ADMP -3.57% (+0%)** No news. \n\n**AGEN -0.99% (+0%)** AGEN opened to a nearly 3% gain before falling the rest of the day. No news. \n\n**PLX -4.03% (+0%)** No news. Nearly all of the option activity came from 4,170 put calendar spreads between November and February - 2,170 at the $3 strike and 2,000 at the $4 strike. \n\n**WATT -7.31% (+0%)** Well, WATT finished giving back all of the 30% gain it saw early yesterday. \n\n**SANW +12.98% (-0.62%)** No news. \n\n**VIEW -0.41% (+0%)** Hard to find any news when all that comes up is lawsuits against the company. \n\n**FTEK -5.17% (+0%)** Apparently the target of some fin-twit groups, FTEK pulled back today after a huge gain yesterday. \n\n**FTFT +6.76% (+1.27%)** Bitcoin go brrr = blockchain related stuff go brrrr. \n\n**CSPR +1.8% (+0%)** No news for the mattress maker. I couldn't imagine over paying for one of their mattresses. \n\n**BTG +2.17% (+0%)** No news for BTG, and I wonder if this stock sees some weird bitcoin sympathy since it has the same ticker symbol as Bitcoin Gold. \n\n**CYCN +10.90% (+0.34%)** No news. There appears to be multiple multi-leg strategies with far-dated options for CYCN, but I can't figure out what they are, much less if they're bullish or bearish. \n\n**LIZI +8.72% (+1.15%)** The company was named among the \"Top 20 Internet Companies in Guangzhou in 2021\" and \"Most Innovative Internet Companies in 2021\" by the Guangzhou Internet Society. Neat!\n\n**GRTX -5.33% (-2.82%)** Sing it with me kids! *Don't. Catch. The fall-ing knife. The fall-ing knife. The fall-ing knife. Don't. Catch. The fall-ing knife before it finds a bottom!* Yayyyyyyyy great job!\n\n**YRD +12.06% (-0.48%)** No news. Jack Ma reappears so China goes brrrr? Eh, just invest in BABA. \n\n**TRYP -1.24% (+0%)** This is a relatively new ETF that debuted in May. From SonicShares, TRYP provides exposure to core business and leisure travel stocks. Its top holdings are Hilton (HLT), Marriott (MAR), Raynair (RYA ID), Royal Caribbean (RCL), Delta Airlines (DAL) and so on and so forth. And whatnot. Looks like big algorithmic trading for the $1 put for December, which just seems so ass backwards - reopening/pandemic easing so travel is already accelerating, plus holiday season travel? Hmmmm.\n\n**KRBP -3.62% (+0%)** No news. It appears much of the option activity came from over 1,200 call spreads in June across the $2.50 and $7.50 strikes. \n\n**CTIC +1.85% (+0.36%)** After spending most of the trading session in the negative, CTIC recovered for a modest gain. Most of the option activity came from over 1,000 call spreads in December at the $2 and $3 strikes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkeeee byeeeeeeee\n\nboom",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, October 28th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures push higher on strong earnings and ahead of big economic news](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/27/stock-futures-rise-slightly-after-sp-500-slips-from-a-record.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Stock futures edged higher in premarket trading Thursday, a day after after the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped from their record highs and as Wall Street looked to more earnings news and an important read on economic growth.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 84 points. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures both traded in solidly positive territory.\n*****\n&gt; Ford saw its shares jump more than 9% on blockbuster earnings while also raising guidance. The automaker said increased availability of semiconductors during the quarter allowed it to ramp up production.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Twilio fell around 13% in after-hours trade, despite a beat on both earnings and revenue for the third quarter, after the cloud communications platform projected a fourth-quarter loss. Ebay also fell by about 5% on weak fourth-quarter revenue guidance.\n*****\n&gt; Pharmaceutical giant and Dow component Merck saw its shares rise nearly 1% premarket after the company posted an earnings beat on the top and bottom lines. Fellow bluechip index company Caterpillar topped profit estimates but fell just shy on revenue, sending its shares up nearly 2%.\n*****\n&gt; The market will be getting more big earnings news, with tech giants Amazon and Apple reporting after the closing bell. NBC Universal and CNBC.com parent Comcast posted a solid earnings beat before the bell, sending shares up 3.4%.\n*****\n&gt; Investors awaited the first estimate for third-quarter annualized gross domestic product growth from the Commerce Department. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected an increase of just 2.8% as products remained stranded at normally bustling ports, employers struggled to find workers and consumers battled with inflation.\n*****\n&gt; On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.5% for its first down day in three as the rally on a strong earnings season started to ease. The blue-chip Dow dipped more than 250 points, falling for the first time in four days.\n*****\n&gt; Major averages have been marching higher on earnings momentum this month. The S&amp;P 500 has gained 5.6% in October, on pace to post its best month since November 2020. The Dow is up 4.9% this month, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has rallied 5.5%.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly 40% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported earnings and more than 80% of them beat Wall Street expectations, according to CNBC calculations. S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to grow profit by about 37.6% in the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings have helped and a reminder that US reporting so far has been better than the long-term average in terms of beats,\u201d Jim Reid, head of thematic research at Deutsche Bank, said in a note. \u201cIt has still been healthier relative to some of the stagflationary gloom stories seen through September and early October which has perhaps helped the relief rally.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/tFhXxGs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Z1GaYCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3gNdLsD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/blUbzGe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/Hf5aMlH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($AAPL $AMZN $FB $AMD $MSFT $GOOGL $UPS $BA $SHOP $F $GM $GE $XOM $V $OTIS $TZOO $TWTR $KO $MA $MMM $X $LMT $CAT $ABBV $MCD $KMB $JBLU $BMY $SBUX $TDOC $SPOT $LII $RTX $ENPH $CVX $HOOD $MRK $WM $QSR $HAS $MO $PKG $TXN $LLY $TWLO)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/JrlDETW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SHOP $MA $CAT $NOK $MRK $OSTK $MO $DQ $BUD $YUM $CMCSA $SIRI $AMT $RDS.A $NEM $CHKP $RS $FLWS $SWK $HSY $BTU $TAP $TPX $STM $MDC $TREE $AVNT $TROW $ADS $NOC $CNX $CARR $IMAX $SNY $LH $OSK $SAH $CBRE $AEP $AGCO $SNDR)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/toObqWO.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/x0wSXqQ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/uYEDyCd.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/kjKf0vv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/lEZ59gr.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/pNlS6ZK.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hE59JOO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fNRHx1w.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/EM9W0zY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GSji0yN.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/G7XcB4i.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/kv3CiQv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/x8X44ks.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fSbIfWH.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/57hzopa.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Mwi1ykX.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/gX6sxVH.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/xLGlice.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* DOGE.X\n* IRNT\n* F\n* NOK\n* SHOP\n* FUTU\n* CAT\n* TIGR\n* TDOC\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-comcast-caterpillar-merck-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Comcast (CMCSA)** \u2013 The parent of NBCUniversal and CNBC reported adjusted quarterly earnings of 87 cents per share, 12 cents above estimates.

We got the 10% move into Volume Price Trend buy @ $10.23 golden ratio breakout on the daily. @$11.27 triggers a weekly buy on VPT still under the Fibonacci resistance. Months and years of bullishness on the way hahaha. this is my dark horse. \n\nHere are the photos to follow. \n[$BB Screenshots 10/15](https://imgur.com/a/9NXTMiA)\n\n10 and 15 min macd bullish cross premarket/post market. 200 MA broke and held on the 4 hr chart. Bullish momentum breakout on the daily and 4 hr with Volume Price Trend buy signal. Bullish institutional buying on the 1 hr underneath and in the 2 hr. This might be a crazy Friday and the option chains could go crazy with a breakout of $10.50 and $10.80-10.85 with volume.\n\nThere is a lot of strong bullish Fibonacci confluence at the golden ratio $10.23 between quarterly, yearly, daily, 4 hr, and 5 min Fibonacci resistances. the bottom indicator is daily momentum. It breaking and holding 0 and the 100 MA I put on it would indicate a bullish trend.\n\nThe quadruple bottom here on the daily is also enough to make this a potentially crazy momentum trade. Once that VPT goes green I think the volume profile of the stock will change to super bullish long term.\n\nThe bullish institutional order block shows me some big players are placing block orders exactly where it popped on this recent bottom. Aka dips are very juicy buys.\n\nSee y\u2019all on Pluto soon. I think this can see some dope upside sooner than we think.",

        "selftext": "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!! I present to you yet another high redemption small float play! The ticker symbol is called BKKY. Once again, I\u2019m not going to pretend like I know what the company does, nor does it matter when it comes to this type of play. But to sweeten the deal, MasterCard and Fiserv partnered with them last week!! This company will literally become the next airmiles for digital currency! Frickin airmiles!!! You know how big that is?? \n\nSo the protocol on this is the same as always! BUY BUY BUY!!!! This stock is only up 400% from NAV. Some might think that\u2019s high, but I say those are rookie numbers compared to what it can be. I\u2019ve seen a couple of posts saying this thing can run to like $80, that\u2019s like another 100%+ of additional upside.\n\nBut don\u2019t take my word for it. There\u2019s a couple of other posts about BKKT that has garnered hundreds of upvotes and several awards already over the last two days. This type of attention simply can\u2019t be ignored. The attention is either fake and the hype is just fabricated or this might be an explosive week for BKKT. \n\nSome people say that usually once the ticker appears on this subreddit it marks the top, but I beg the differ, I think it\u2019s the beginning before the top. So get in on this money making train. \n\nOnce again, I don\u2019t know what this company does, nor do I care. The only thing that matters to me is that the redemption rate is high and that the float is low. \n\nYOLO what you can into this and you won\u2019t regret it!

        "selftext": " \n\nHey folks,\n\nVirgin Galactic's backkk !!! Finally! Options volume for next week is decidedly bullish, with huge volume ranging from 25-30$ call contracts, with highest volume being on that 30$ call contract. Looking at puts, the most volume seems to be imbetween 24-25$. After that, interest and volume dwindles significantly.\n\nTherefore, main resistance for next week is 24-25. As soon as we get both feet firmly above 25, preferably 26, those puts are toast, and we can rocket higher. The higher we go, the more violent a rise will be with a large amount of higher strike prices going into the money, causing a gamma squeeze as MM's hedge against large call volumes.\n\nAfter all, why wouldn't we go above 25 next week? I fully expect a move above 26 will very quickly lead to prices near 30. The main headwind off the stock, a governmental organisation, has now been lifted. This has alleviated the risk of the stock significantly. 'True bulls' were always expecting it to be lifted, but for people only mildly interested, it means a great deal in buying back.\n\nIt also shows that the flight is coming soon, and I assure you, there is a lot of $ that will want to come in before the next first commerical flight with the Italian Air Force. I also expect an update next week regarding flight window, as the company moves to register a new slot after FAA authorisation imminently, and middle of october (yes i know, earliest) looms only 2 weeks away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vxxcvzjdn2r71.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c53c0b97dfad5950013173b06d59c16d748b6a5\n\nMeanwhile, above is my attached graph. We're still holding that important fib level that has proved to be support many, many times over the past 7 weeks. We also have that downwards pressure taken off from the descending triangle. The weekly 9 ma and daily 50 ma seems to be the biggest resistance here. Once we pass those key milestones it'll be a rocket higher, gap fill to 30 (gap to 22 is as good as filled from wednesday's decline)\n\nHonestly, it blows my mind to why people would sell now, with good news upcoming and at a very strong 7-week tested support area. Other stocks are a lot, lot more risky than this one right now as we really do seem to be at bottom-prices right now.\n\nIf you liked this analysis, please consider upvoting as this is quite a new account :), and as always, post your thoughts below",

        "selftext": "What's up Degens??  The $DUDE here w/ my periodic \"Dude Diligence\" DD report on $CLOV.  I felt the timing was right  because we've had some big developments recently and potentially, a very interesting week ahead of us...\n\nFor those that haven't seen my initial comprehensive look at $CLOV aka, Clover Health Investments on WSB, I've included a link below.  \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pn6gev/clov\\_dd\\_the\\_dude\\_diligence\\_report\\_912\\_edition/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pn6gev/clov_dd_the_dude_diligence_report_912_edition/)\n\nThe main reason for creating &amp; publishing these periodic DD updates is to clear up a lot of the rampant misinformation that's continually perpetuated on various online forums w/ regards to Clover Health.  \n\nI'll also be updating it, clarifying sections &amp; fixing inaccuracies, if needed, to keep it fresh.  My hope's that these summaries can educate and become *the* one-stop shop thread here on WSB that CLOV Apes can reference, direct people to, or get add'l, fact-based info when questions come up.\n\nIn this DD I'll be focusing on significant catalysts happening now and events I believe will be influencing CLOV price action moving forward over the next several months and beyond.\n\nAs with all my write-ups, this is compiled based upon my own opinions, I'm not a financial advisor nor is this intended as financial advice- blah, blah, you're smart- invest at your own risk and do your own due diligence.  I like this stock as a long-term growth play (especially now, following CLOV's plan-rating upgrades on Friday \\*detailed out below\\* by the Centers for Medicaid &amp; Medicare Services) ...and I do currently hold a position in Clover Health.\n\nAlso of note, I'm more active on Twitter (follow me here [https://twitter.com/nikiped1a](https://twitter.com/nikiped1a) ) ...than I am here on reddit, so if you like this or any of my other write ups, I'd love to hear your feedback both positive or negative (I'm always doing my best to improve and learn from all of you and I understand I can and do get things wrong on occasion.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DUDE DILIGENCE FOREWORD**\n\nLet's start this all off with two simple metrics:\n\n1. Clover Health **Annual Revenue moving forward is $1.5-1.6B/yr.**\n\n2.  Clover Health **Current Market Cap. is $1.99B** as of EOD Oct 8, 2021 (253M shares outstanding x $7.85 share price)\n\nThis is what we're working with... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CATALYSTS INFLUENCING CLOV PRICE ACTION LEADING UP TO Q3 EARNINGS**\n\nFor those not yet familiar with Clover Health Investments- by its name alone, you're likely thinking it's in the healthcare space or maybe a crusty insurance company right?  Well, wrong... kindof. \n\nClover Health is actually a next-gen, technology focused company (software/AI/machine learning)   \nplaying in the slow-to-adapt, healthcare/insurance industry. If you think of it in any other way, you're entirely missing what their core mission is.  That mission?  ...to change and disrupt an industry through technology- an industry that's generally content w/ the status quo and looking to squeeze out competition.  \n\nThrough their software offering, The Clover Assistant (which I explain in further detail below), CLOV feels their members will be able to live their healthiest lives w/ fewer dr/hospital visits all while saving these members money at the same time.  This will also help differentiate itself from its competitors from an efficiency/cost savings standpoint.\n\nCLOV is also focused on providing and expanding health equity by offering their services to underserved communities as referenced here by a series of tweets from Chamath Palihapitiya on Friday: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4a1gyp8ons71.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f09d5b94a7cd75d71ac8314a06df18c0c849cf3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/puni6evsons71.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ceb6e061b553471b961a151828116ba0022035e\n\nBefore I dig into the most recent news and catalysts, I want to reiterate a few details from my last DD that will really come into play in a big way this coming year.\n\nMASSIVE GROWTH INITIATIVES\n\nCLOV announced their intent to double their geographical market size at the end of Q2, which was approved by CMS last month, expanding their addressable market from 108 to 209 counties and from 8 to 9 states for 2022.  \n\nTotal population within their TAM is slightly over 29M people or just shy of 9% of the total US population \n\n...sooo, in short, there's a sh\\*tton of future expansion/growth potential during the upcoming years/decades- they're just getting started.  \n\nFor perspective, performance of two prominent tickers in CLOV's space over the past 10 years:\n\n**Humana** \n\n$72 in Sept 2011 ----&gt; $412 Today (was $470 in July) \n\n**UnitedHealthcare Group** \n\n$45 in Sept 2011 ----&gt; $408 today \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrent states and counties where CLOV is now available for enrollment:\n\n[Updated 2022 Clover Health Operating Market \\(Operating in 209 total counties in 9 states, up 101 counties and 8 states in the past 12 months\\)](https://preview.redd.it/25h5uiumiis71.png?width=946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28e75e512400272014ccde5a297d0e7c3bfb1eb4)\n\nTakeaway-  their massive **140% YoY revenue growth announcement identified during Q2 earnings (Aug '21)** did not include any of this upcoming market expansion (doubling number of counties they're available in from 2021 to 2022). \n\n...let that sink in.\n\nCLOV then announced a new partnership w/ ValueH allowing them to do business with their Clover Assistant (Clover's machine learning, proprietary AI software offering) ...and expand into in the state of Florida beginning in 2022 stating through a PR:\n\n\"...*Through the arrangement, ValueH will support Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and Management Services Organizations (MSOs) participating in Clover\u2019s Direct Contracting Entity beginning in 2022.*\n\n*Clover\u2019s DCE (Direct Contracting Entities) will enable providers to manage the care of their Original Medicare patients with the Clover Assistant. The Clover Assistant is a clinical software tool used by doctors at the point of care to provide them with data-driven, personalized recommendations to improve how they care for their patients. Participating providers can benefit from:*\n\n* ***Unified, Actionable Data***\\*: access lab results, prescription lists, and previous diagnoses, including those from other clinicians\\*\n* ***Personalized Care Plans***\\*: receive and share new information at each patient visit and have access to clinical decision support\\*\n* ***Simple, Fast Reimbursement***\\*: receive the Clover Assistant reimbursement within seven days for each patient seen with the Clover Assistant\\*\n\n*\u201cWe are excited to partner with ValueH to help support our efforts to increase the quality of care delivered to patients while simultaneously lowering medical costs...\u201d*\n\nIn summary, nearly doubling their geographical TAM (not including their new partnership in Florida) will be a massive catalyst heading into the Medicare Open Enrollment period that begins this week (Friday) Oct 15, 2021 and continues through Dec 7, 2021. This will give us 17 days of CLOV OE data prior to Q3 ending on the 31st and provide us with a glimpse into their Medicare Advantage enrollment growth momentum heading into Q4, as a teaser in Q3.\n\nA FEW MORE HIGHLIGHTS FROM MOST RECENT Q2 EARNINGS\n\n\\- As of Q2, \"lives under Clover management\" aka **those enrolled in MA plan w/ CLOV grew 126% YoY.**\n\n\\- Lives/enrollees under Clover Assistant mgmt (CLOV's AI Software) **grew 229% YoY.**\n\n\\- Clover Assistant software is **on track to manage over $1B in annualized revenue.**\n\n\\- Clover management **expects a significant increase in total aligned beneficiaries** to the company on Jan 1, 2022, when claims aligned beneficiaries for 2022 become active.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**UPGRADED 2022 MEDICARE STAR RATING BY CMS**\n\nThe biggest announcement, possibly to date, that directly affects Clover Health's business happened this past Friday.  It represents a huge momentum shift heading into the Medicare Open Enrollment period for the upcoming year.  So, what was this announcement?  CLOV's Medicare Adv. PPO plan Star Rating was just upgraded by CMS for 2022.  \n\nFor context, every year, the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services evaluates Medicare plans based on a 5-star rating system. Medicare Star Ratings help you know how well your plan has performed historically. You can use these Star Ratings to compare plan's performance to other competing plans.  It also dictates how much providers are reimbursed &amp; bonused (paid) by the gov't.\n\nCLOV just announced this past Friday (Oct 8th) that: \n\n\".*..the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has upgraded Clover\u2019s PPO plan to 3.5 stars on the Medicare Star Ratings for its Medicare Advantage (MA) plans for the 2020 measurement year. Currently, over 90% of Clover\u2019s Medicare Advantage membership is served through its PPO plan.*\n\n...The announcement was significant enough that Chamath came out of hiding and tweeted his first tweet about CLOV in over 6 months...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjwd5laewhs71.png?width=595&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b766a0ec8843f38fe05bc966f21a17005195610\n\nThis was a huge announcement for a number of reasons.  Let me explain...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.  As mentioned above, there's a significant financial compensation component that comes from an upgraded Star Rating score, specifically in what a company receives as a rebate from the Gov't\n\n[Old CLOV rebate payment &amp;#37; from Gov't was 50&amp;#37;, beginning in 2022 it's bumped to 65&amp;#37;- this is a significant development for Clover Health's financials](https://preview.redd.it/3eb9ikjexhs71.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27319da52d7ccf704e977ccbd5755a7c21a448d8)\n\nYou may be asking yourself \"...sooo, why is this such a big deal?\"  Well, one of the big arguments by shorts manipulating the share price over the past several months is that their Medical Cost Ratio (MCR) is high.  \n\nAnd there are a few reasons for this, not the least of which has to do with the fact we're currently in the midst of the worst global pandemic in over 100 years.  Most, if not all healthcare companies have seen MCR increase these past few quarters and this is beginning to subside and expenses will normalize over the next few quarters.  But this bump up in rebates will help to further discount this inaccurate yet persisting narrative that has been used as FUD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Medicare Advantage avg. rebate payout &amp; growth 2015-21](https://preview.redd.it/745cc3nfbis71.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=291120df5dc2a1e0f55461aa17ed843e43c360d5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarket's reaction to both the CMS announcement &amp; Chamath's tweet on Friday- ...it appears they were pleased:\n\n[Market reaction on Oct 8 to Star Rating Upgrade and Chamath's subsequent tweet reiterating it.](https://preview.redd.it/ztkw086wqis71.png?width=1116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77abcf20cb15d6dad201419ffd32187fd0106a0c)\n\n2.  The second benefit that could be realized from the star rating bump will be that CLOV now   \noffers a more appealing Medicare Advantage plan vs. its competition and possibly an \"easier   \nsell\" for those enrolling new members.  \n\nAll in all, this announcement will have a big impact on growth &amp; financials improvement   \nduring the upcoming year as the company moves toward profitability.\n\n3.  This is obviously my opinion, but I believe this announcement just has that feel of   \nbeing the last piece needed to further strengthen their business thesis while further   \ndiscrediting many of their most ardent naysayers and negative narratives they've been   \npumping about Clover Health and its ability to thrive, since becoming public this past January.  \n\nI believe this announcement could be the turning point for this stock in that it'll no   \nlonger be seen as just this meme stock, or a pump and dump squeeze play.    \nIt demonstrates &amp; confirms the rapid progress CLOV is making on multiple fronts as it   \nbecomes a disruptive force to be reckoned with in their respective industry.  \n\nDo I believe that the shorts and their manipulation tactics all of the sudden end?  No-   \nhowever, I bet we'll start seeing their relentlessness soften (possibly even cover then switch to   \nlong positions) as we see the stock be able to hold on to gains and slowly begin to act more   \nlike a normal stock as people start seeing proof of the vision coming to fruition and it's price   \nbegins to represent fair market value.\n\n4.  And while I'm skeptical of many analysts and the motives behind the entire stock ratings   \nsystem, this announcement may also trigger updated and new analyst ratings/upgrades in   \nthe upcoming weeks/months as strong growth was confirmed last quarter, and now   \nfinancials being positively influenced through the star rating upgrade/higher rebate   \npayments.  When we see these new analyst ratings start to roll out, we'll see strong   \nmovement upward.\n\n**HAS THE BOTTOM ARRIVED AND IS A MOMENTUM SHIFT COMING IN HOT?**\n\nI understand many of you are mainly focused on a CLOV squeeze, and while that's still definitely in the cards, with all of this recent news, traders/investors are starting realize that CLOV may even be a better long-term growth play w/ higher top-end potential than a short lived squeeze.  \n\nOf note, publicly available Short Interest data (not including dark pool shorting)  has shown a decrease from 40%+ SI earlier this summer to closer to \\~17% today.  With DP data, it could easily be double or triple that figure.\n\nOne thing I feel, that has been frustrating for some investors and slowed price action to this point, is how CLOV's management team hasn't directly disputed any of the misinformed attacks on the company, but instead, acted through a more subtle strategy of deliberate actions while exceeding expectations. \n\nPersonally, I don't mind this approach as we all know talk is cheap, and actions speak much, MUCH louder than words. It also shows a composed confidence that Sr. Management appears to have in their product, strategy and growth opportunity.\n\nI can't confirm this for certain, but these past few weeks, something interesting has been happening.   \nNumerous, massive, after-hours dark pool prints have been clearing day after day.  Many have speculated it could be institutional shorts covering and transitioning to long positions.  \n\nWe're talking multiple occasions where 800K -1.2M single block prints were being made AH day for a solid week.\n\n[Example of numerous After Hours large volume prints \\(returns to longs?\\)  that happed for 5 straight days in mid-late Sept.](https://preview.redd.it/w3n7lxcx7js71.png?width=687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c2e695532e83fba2c23bf0ffef2a0ea3d86dded)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zea9yevr9js71.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=090d89501dacb9df5a35ce267151212e13d49dbe\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvfws311uos71.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4896c926e86a219435968a6b043a823cfea9291\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/inzsfgav9js71.png?width=666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af09928334180e7373fd33af75fbe2abf4f1b55\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**LOOKING AHEAD TO Q3, Q4 AND BEYOND**\n\nAs I start to wrap this up, I want to give you all an idea of how I think about CLOV's potential price action over the next 9-12 months. And before I even begin, I want to make it clear: \\*THESE ARE NOT  PRICE TARGETS\\* but instead a general range and timeline on how I think about CLOV.\n\n**Oct 11th - approx. Nov 15 (whenever Q3 earnings are released):** \n\n I see price action prob staying above $7.50 moving forward with this most recent news as this has been artificially depressed by shorts for some time.  I do think we could see a quick spike into the $9+ range this week and possibly even into the 10's by the end of the month but crossing and staying above $11 prob won't happen until we get concrete Q3 data along w/ solid guidance and a clearer picture of the company in terms of FCF, revenue, open enrollment momentum, etc.  Want to emphasize, this is a very conservative view on my part.\n\n**Nov 15 - approx. Feb 15 (when Q4 earnings are released):** \n\n\\*If Q3 ER comes in strong\\* expect a significant bump in price possibly even mid-teens, which should be sustainable, not just a pump and dump. I also feel this is conservative, but I like setting conservative expectations and then being surprised w/ strong upside.  Unless a squeeze happens, I still feel short forces will still be pushing back on the stock during the quarter but I wouldn't be surprised if price action maintains low to mid-teens leading up to Q4 ER in mid-Feb.\n\nMoving ahead, I really think Q4 ER could be a significant transformational quarter in terms of a setup for a sustained run on price because Open Enrollment will have come and gone (which prob accounts for 95%+ of their new MA growth for the year).  Following OE, CLOV Medicare Advantage lives under mgmt will probably jump from 65Kish currently to 75-80K+ while continuing their 20-25%+ annual growth rate.  However, where it could get interesting is with their Direct Contracting Entity numbers that currently stand at \\~60K lives.\n\nThe Q4 ER will not only include all the MA enrollees, but it will also include a month of the DCE number that'll be counted between Jan 1-31 2022. I wouldn't be surprised if we see this jump 10's of thousands (as well as additional revenue starting to trickle in from the new Florida partnership becoming active)  ...CLOV could have 100-150K+ DCE enrollees and be nearing 180-240K total lives (DCE+MA) under mgmt.\n\nOf note, and not that it matters because I think all these ratings firms are corrupt and play into the intertwined market manipulation, but CLOV initially had $18-$20 PT's earlier this year from a number of these analysts when CLOV had mentioned the potential of having 200K lives under mgmt. If CLOV has 15-20% or more above that, where does the valuation go?\n\n**Feb 15- approx. May 15 (whenever Q1 earnings are released):** \n\nQ1 Earnings has the potential to be game changing.  If at this point, we've seen 3 solid earnings reports (or even 2 out of the 3) for Q2, Q3 and Q4, it'll be hard to stop this beast moving forward, at least for awhile.  \n\nThe biggest news to look for from Q1 Earnings is that the higher Medicare rebate amount will be added in this quarter.  Remember, with their bump in star rating, their rebate payment from the Gov't increases 30% (from 50% to 65%).  They could also potentially see 250-300K total lives under management at this point as well, depending on how DCE is rolled out next year.  \n\nCould be fun to watch, and if this all happens as detailed, or even partially, there is so much good news happening over the next few months, we will finally start to see CLOV's fair value being represented in the actual stock price.\n\nAnd last but not least- I'm basing these ranges off of fundamentals, not \"the\" squeeze... Do remember, there IS the potential of a juicy squeeze built in there at some point- ...but in my mind, that's just the icing, suckaaas!\n\nThe $DUDE\n\n[https://twitter.com/nikiped1a](https://twitter.com/nikiped1a)",

I've been following it for a while so I wanted to share some of the more recent, exciting news for you to consider if you're looking to invest in a small biotech with plenty of potential.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Bristol Myers would pay Agenus up to $1.56 billion to develop and commercialize one of its experimental cancer drugs. It paid Agenus $200 million up front. A large, reputable drug maker like Bristol Myers doesn't do that with a small biotech unless they see a lot of promise in it.\n\nIn June, Agenus announced that the FDA granted priority review for one of its important treatments for cervical cancer. The FDA set a target action date of December 16, 2021.\n\nAgenus is scheduled to present data on their potential blockbuster treatment AGEN1181 next month. On last quarter's earnings call, Agenus's Chief Commercial Officer said, \"I've had the good fortune to have led and been a part of over 20 product launches in my career. I believe that the promise that 1181 has, clinically and commercially, is seldom seen in a career. And it is a big reason of what got me to come to Agenus.\" Obviously the data could go both ways, but this could be a catalyst.\n\nThese are only a few things that Agenus has going for it. I encourage you to check out their pipeline on their website. In addition to Bristol Myers, they have many more partnerships (Merck, Incyte, GSK, etc) and studies in different phases. If you're looking for a biotech with a lot of potential and upcoming catalysts, consider taking a shot on this one.\n\nDISCLOSURE: I'm long AGEN with 800 shares at an average of $3.33/share.",

        "selftext": "Over the past 3 months, China has taken a beating in the U.S media, and for good reason. The main problem has been the housing market collapse. Some people have immediately compared this to the 2008 GFC. China is a state that can change policies whenever they feel they need to do so, they have less exposure to crises like this. This is one of the only benefits of having a government possess so much power. \n\nChina is also the largest exporter of goods, this is the only country in the top five exporters that maintain growth (+3.7), during the same 2019-20 period, U.S exports fell by -13%. Prominent investors have also voiced their opinion on China. Ray Dalio has recommended diversifying into Chinese stocks for some time. \u201cOur objective is to be there both economically and investment-wise.\" This is coming from someone with actual experience in China.\n\nThe $15b common prosperity fine that the CCP gave BABA is to be paid out over five years. The likelihood of the CCP adding another fine during this period is decreased. Trust is at an all-time low and it\u2019s likely that no more fines will be given bringing U.S investors back into stocks like BABA. Fears of the Chinese market are cyclical, it pops up every 3-5 years, and each time it affects Chinese equities. There are a few common myths about China I\u2019d like to dispel (Disclaimer: I\u2019m Australian).\n\n**Myth:** China is a communist country\n\n**Fact:** It\u2019s true that the state acts as the dominant economic player and uses markets primarily for political gain. However, the\u00a0stock market was\u00a0a strict no-no in the\u00a0Soviet Union\u00a0and other communist countries. China is a capitalist autocracy that loves to call itself communist, the U.S media benefits from playing into this as the name has an awful historical connotation for most of the world. They gain watch time from people fearful of communism.\n\n**Myth:** China will stop foreign investments\n\n**Fact:** Foreign investments generate $212b for them annually, closing themselves to the world is also a step in the wrong direction and they know that. Their actions so far have demonstrated that they intend on being a global superpower and the likelihood of then reverting to soviet foreign policy is very low.\n\n**Myth:** The CCP is evil\n\n**Fact:** The CCP is *very* evil, they have a proven track record of egregiously violating human rights, but are we activists, or are we here to make money?\n\n**Steven Romick** from FPA Crescent Fund increased his position in BABA by 729.92% in Q3 ([https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=FPACX](https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=FPACX)). \n\n**Charlie Munger** has also bought into BABA during Q1 at a price above $220. He has then increased his position by 82.71% in Q3 this year ([https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=DJCO](https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=DJCO)). \n\n**Tweedy Browne** increased their position in BABA by 700% in Q3 as well ([https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=TWEBX](https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=TWEBX)).\n\nThe stock is incredibly undervalued right now, its PE ratio is 20.7, more than 50% below the US online retail industry average. BABA's earnings have grown significantly by 30.4% per year for the past 5 years. They are in a great financial position, even with the $15b fine. Their short-term assets are twice the short-term liabilities and their long-term assets are 4x higher than long-term liabilities. They are also paying off their debt very well, BABA's debt to equity ratio has reduced from 30.6% to 13.6% over the past 5 years.\n\nJack Ma has now been seen traveling around Europe this week, meaning he has been full autonomy to leave China. BABA's management team is also seasoned and\u00a0experienced\u00a0with an average tenure of 5.8 years, which is similar to their board of directors that have an average tenure of 6.7 years. This is the same group responsible for its growth. The number of employees has gone from 122,400 on September 30, 2020, to a staggering 254,700 on June 30, 2021.\n\n**TLDR:** China bad (but not that bad), BABA undervalued.",

The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.5%, helped by a 12% rally in Tesla\u2019s stock as the electric carmaker hit a $1 trillion market capitalization for the first time.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq Composite was the outperformer, rising 0.9%. The technology-focused average is about 1.1% from its record high.\n*****\n&gt; Technology darlings Alphabet and Microsoft traded higher heading into their earnings reports after the bell on Tuesday. Microsoft bulls are expecting a strong quarter for Microsoft, bolstered by its key Azure business. Analysts are expecting Alphabet earnings to come in 43% higher year over year.\n*****\n&gt; Twitter, Advanced Micro Devices and Robinhood also report quarterly earnings after the bell on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Intercontinental Exchange jumped 3.7% premarket, the day after CNBC reported that Mastercard will partner with ICE\u2019s spinoff Bakkt in a move to allow customers to integrate cryptocurrencies into their products.

Bullish momentum breakout on the daily and 4 hr with Volume Price Trend buy signal. Bullish institutional buying on the 1 hr underneath and in the 2 hr. This might be a crazy Friday and the option chains could go crazy with a breakout of $10.50 and $10.80-10.85 with volume.\n\nThere is a lot of strong bullish Fibonacci confluence at the golden ratio $10.23 between quarterly, yearly, daily, 4 hr, and 5 min Fibonacci resistances. the bottom indicator is daily momentum. It breaking and holding 0 and the 100 MA I put on it would indicate a bullish trend.\n\nThe quadruple bottom here on the daily is also enough to make this a potentially crazy momentum trade. Once that VPT goes green I think the volume profile of the stock will change to super bullish long term.\n\nThe bullish institutional order block shows me some big players are placing block orders exactly where it popped on this recent bottom.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 20, 2021**\n\n*Quick rant: It\u2019s remarkable how quickly market sentiment changes. It seems two weeks ago, everyone was predicting an imminent market crash and, in many occasions, going as far as insulting my intelligence for presenting a different viewpoint and remaining bullish even during the height of the Evergrande situation and a looming US debt default. Now it seems the doomsaying posts and articles have all but disappeared. The market has dipped significantly roughly 5-6 times this year and every time it happens I see the same upswell of doomsaying articles and market crash predictors. Not to go on a rant, but it amazes me how willing people are to fight against the trend. Like I\u2019ve said, it is important to acknowledge risks present in the market and be prepared to react to the unforeseen, but I don\u2019t get why people decide to consciously decide to fight market trends, it is much easier and more profitable to just ride them until you can\u2019t anymore. There\u2019s a saying that goes, pessimists sound smart, optimists make money. I have found this saying to be true.* \n\nThe incredible rally in the stock market continued, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) climbing seven straight days to claw back the losses suffered in September when the index dipped -5% from highs for the first time all year. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly today, the index has rocketed more than 6% higher from the lows on October 4, a stunning comeback. The Dow Jones (DIA) reached a new intraday all-time high, carried by continued strength in financial stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, traded modestly higher today. Market participants remain encouraged by stronger-than-expected corporate profits amid ongoing supply-chain pressures.\n\nVery strong corporate earnings reports from bellwethers like big banks, Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), and Procter and Gamble (PG) have assuaged fears that corporate profits would slow down dramatically amid supply chain constraints. As the earnings season kicked off, market participants were nervous that ongoing inflationary pressures, labor market imbalances, and congestions issues at ports would greatly weigh on corporate profits. So far, that has not proven to be the case. \n\nJon Adams, Senior Investment Strategist at BMO Capital Markets said, \u201cWe think investorshave been too pessimistic on earnings expectations. It does look like Q2 was likely the peak, but Q3 is going to be strong, probably above 30% year-over-year growth. We think the strength will continue into the fourth quarter, we\u2019re not overly concerned about profit margins. We are closely monitoring supply chain issues and increasing wage pressures but still think that profit margins are at healthy levels, and that there's more upside to come.\"\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The price of \u2026 reached new all-time highs, breaking $65k for the first time after the first-ever ETF was launched in the market yesterday.\n* Sharers of Pinterest (PINS) rocketed higher after Bloomberg reported that PayPal (PYPL) was considering acquiring the company for $70 a share (roughly $39 billion). Shares of PINS were up more than 10% while shares of PYPL fell after the report was released.\n* Adobe (ADBE) says it expects holiday-period online sales to reach an all-time high of $207 billion from November 1 to December 31 in the US. That would represent a jump of 10% YoY. The company says it expects global online sales to reach $910 billion, also a record.\n* The 30-year fixed mortgage rate increased to 3.23% for the week ended Oct. 15, according to a weekly update from the Mortgage Bankers Association. This is the highest level in six months and higher than the 3.18% during the prior week. \n* Facebook (FB) will change its name in order to reflect itself as a \u201cmetaverse\u201d company. As a reminder, the metaverse is a shared, 3D virtual space in which people can interact with the environment and other via online avatars accessed using virtual reality technology.\n* Jack MA, founder of Alibaba (BABA) was seen traveling in Europe, specifically Spain, in the first overseas trip since the government began cracking down on his companies over a year ago. \n* DraftKings (DKNG) is launching online betting operations in Connecticut\n* Ford Motors (F) to invest $300 million in building an electric vehicle car parts factory in the UK\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Amazon (AMZN) target set at $4,100 by Mizuho.

        "selftext": "https://aikya.co.uk/investment-update-summer-2021/\n\nEmperor\u2019s foie gras\n\u2018Most Chinese billionaires are like geese \u2013 they get fat on their political connections and close to party leaders, but at some point the Emperor decides he wants to eat foie gras\u20191\nIntroduction\nChina offers one of the most compelling investment opportunities of our time. The country is experiencing the fastest expansion of consumer spending power the world has ever seen, and by 2027, almost 1.2 billion Chinese will be in the middle class, making up a quarter of the world\u2019s middle class.2 Chinese consumers have followed the path of their Western counterparts, with economic growth driving investments in home ownership, vehicle purchases, as well as stimulating demand for high quality discretionary products. At the same time though, Chinese consumers have set their own trends through rapid adoption of e-commerce and digital finance. Moreover, China is not just the \u2018consumption epicentre\u2019 of the world, it is also home to an excellent entrepreneurial culture with a vibrant stock market. There are close to 5,000 publicly listed firms in the country, which in terms of its breadth and depth is matched by only a few other nations such as the United States.\nHowever, the history of capitalism is relatively short in China. The government still runs large parts of the economy and retains considerable influence across a wide range of industries. As investors in Emerging Market countries, crony capitalism and state influence are not foreign to us, but what makes China unique is the way state or crony influence subtly blends into the private sector. Ownership is blurred between private sector and state influenced actors, and the real shareholders are hidden to such an extent that it is often difficult to determine what is genuinely private. This vagueness is compounded by a lack of free media, as well as the absence of an independent court system and respect for private property rights, which many Western investors usually take for granted.\nFat Geese businessmen\nWu Xiaohui started out as a low-level bureaucrat in Wenzhou, a city known for its entrepreneurialism. In 1996, he got a dealership license for SAIC, a large state-owned automobile company which manufactured Volkswagen and General Motors cars in China. During this time, he also cultivated a close relationship with Zhuo Ran, the granddaughter of China\u2019s former paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping. He eventually married her and used the Deng family\u2019s considerable political clout, to obtain licenses to sell auto-insurance and other financial services. He also forged a close relationship with Chen Xiaolu, who was a prominent princeling3, as the son of Marshal Chen Yi (one of the eight leading Generals in Mao\u2019s revolutionary army).\nBy 2010, Wu\u2019s flagship company Anbang Insurance was sufficiently large enough to bid for large prestigious property plots in major Chinese cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. In 2014, Anbang bought New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria hotel for USD 1.9 billion, which was the highest amount ever paid for a single property. In 2016, it tried to acquire Starwood Hotels (owner of Sheraton, Westin and W brands) for USD 14 billion. By 2017, Anbang emerged as one of the largest insurance companies in the country by asset size (USD 300 billion). Even with this size, its shareholder structure and the exact source of its funds was never entirely clear. Anbang\u2019s takeover of Fidelity and Guaranty Life, an insurer operating in Iowa and New York was blocked by local regulators in 2016, as Anbang failed to provide information on its opaque shareholder structure.\nThe Chinese government decided to put the brakes on these big-ticket deals to acquire trophy Western assets in early 2017, and around the same time, Wu seemed to have lost political backing in Beijing. Soon, the Chinese insurance regulator stopped Anbang from selling new insurance products, and it seemed that Anbang had lost the support of large Chinese banks. The government eventually seized control of the company in early 2018 and Wu ended up with 18 years jail sentence for fraud and embezzlement.\nThere is a long list of such \u2018fat geese\u2019 billionaires, at the top of China\u2019s corporate food chain; Chen Feng (HNA group, linked to Wang Qishan, Xi Jinping\u2019s trusted aide), Wang Jianlin (Dalian Wanda group, linked to Xi Jinping\u2019s sister), Xiao Jianhua (Tomorrow Holdings, close to Jiang Zemin, China\u2019s supreme leader from 1989-2002), Guo Guangchang (Fosun International, close ties with Ling Jinhua, a former top aide of Hu Jintao, President of China from 2003-2013), and Jack Ma (Alibaba, closely linked to the Shanghai faction of the Party, chronicled in our Winter 2020 investor letter).\nWhile the prominent \u2018fat geese\u2019 billionaires are well documented by media, information on smaller corrupt and politically connected businessmen is not as readily available. Yet, the culture of cronyism, corruption and favouritism goes all the way down to small/mid-size companies. Many prominent private equity funds in the country are populated with princelings who help the investee companies win government favours through their connections. For example, a major medical diagnostics chain we evaluated for a potential investment had multiple minority investors in various labs they ran across the country; and most of these minority investors were relatives of locally influential party officials. This chain also had an equity investment from a powerful national conglomerate controlled by one of the \u2018fat geese\u2019 billionaire, which helped them with appropriate connections in Beijing.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with backing these \u2018fat geese\u2019 businessmen?\u201d, you might ask. Being connected to the right people in power, could even be the most important short-term competitive advantage in a place like China. The problem for a long-term investor is that if we buy shares in this medical diagnostic chain, how do we know whether their success is linked to the way they run their operations, or to their links with local party bosses? What if those local party bosses lose power? If we do not even know what makes them successful, how can then we be sure about the resilience of the business, or how can we value the company for the long-term?\nMore importantly, expropriation is a risk always present in those Emerging Markets that have fragile institutions and low respect for property rights. If a business is built on cronyism and political connections, it is much easier for governments (and political opponents) to bend circumstances to their objectives and go after these businesses. That said, investing alongside corrupt businessmen is not the only way to invite the Emperor\u2019s wrath; the other way is to back companies which lack social purpose.\nProfit at all costs\nThe market for private tuition in China grew at 11% CAGR between 2015-2020, with leading players such as New Oriental (EDU) and TAL Education (TAL) experiencing 25-30% top line growth during this period. These companies appeared to have fantastic business models, earning high gross profit margins (55-60%) and high returns on equity (30%+), with their shares very highly rated (PEs of 60x). For someone analysing these companies with the lens of a traditional investment analyst, these were great compounding-type businesses to be held for the long-term.\nBut were these companies serving a social purpose? Were they solving a problem for the community around them or creating a problem themselves? The fantastic profit margins they reported were perhaps the other side of the significant costs they imposed on the parents and students, which went unaccounted for in traditional financial models.\nIn China, millions of students compete every year for just a few thousand seats in prestigious top colleges. This success is based on a single entrance exam, meaning parents and students are naturally very anxious to do their best preparing for this exam. After-school private tuition companies, through aggressive marketing, succeeded in turning this anxiety into a nationwide \u2018Fear of Missing Out\u2019, where parents felt compelled to enrol their children to their programs, even though they could barely afford the fees. As per some estimates, Chinese urban households spend close to 25% of their income on private education services4; and almost 75% of children in urban China are enrolled into private tutoring of some kind. There is very little evidence that these courses raised the education level for children, as they are often run by mediocre tutors and focused on making students cram for exams. These companies not only raised the cost of parenting for everyone in urban China, without any material benefit; they also imposed more pressure on an entire generation of Chinese children.\nIn this context, it should not come as a surprise that the Chinese government decided to act against the entire sector. Companies that pursue profit at the expense of the local community risk losing their social licence to operate. When they do, the results are disastrous for the business and shareholder returns. Especially in an autocratic state such as China, the rulers are extra sensitive to any potential criticism from powerful interest groups such as the urban middle class. Serving a social purpose and creating goodwill in the local community becomes critical to the long-term survival of the business.\nAikya\u2019s Investment Approach\nChina usually evokes extreme behaviour from investors. One set of investors, who are overly focused on near term financial metrics, tend to ignore some of the risks highlighted above and are happy to buy Chinese companies regardless of who owns them or whether they serve a social purpose. Another set of investors usually get put off by governance risks, a general lack of Western-style institutions, and the lack of easy access to trustworthy information; they simply stay away from investing in the country.\nWe believe that a more nuanced approach is needed. The team at Aikya has spent the last 20 years researching China and have collectively analysed close to 1,000 Chinese companies. We are highly sensitive to some of the risks highlighted above and therefore very selective in the companies we choose to back. We have rejected almost 97 companies out of every 100 companies that we have analysed in China. But we equally appreciate the entrepreneurialism and breadth of the market and hence have been able to select 26 Chinese companies to our investable Quality List. These 26 companies are run by some of the best stewards of capital in the world and are well positioned to benefit from the unprecedented consumption growth China is currently undergoing.\nSo, what type of companies do we like?\nWe like companies with strong principal owners. These are the people with \u2018soul-in-the-game\u2019 who are emotionally invested in their companies. A permanent owner-mindset enables these entrepreneurs to make decisions which are likely to strengthen the business in the long-run, without falling for either short termism or not caring about returns on capital at all, which is so common with companies with state-owned or ownerless corporations.\nWe avoid \u2018fat geese\u2019 businessmen. Our starting point is to understand the original source of wealth of the entrepreneur or business family that we are investigating alongside. How did they get their initial success? Is it a clean story, or did they need the help of government or politicians at any point? We always explore the inner mechanisms of a business model to try to understand if there is any government influence either through positive regulations or favourable operating licenses. We then assess if these regulations are transparent and fair, or if they favour a certain set of players?\nWe usually avoid companies where the government or government-owned entities are the primary customers and look at how much of the goods and services produced by a business are directly sold to the government, or at least sold through a government tender. Because of these reasons, we have hardly any companies on our Quality List which operate in Financials, Real Estate, Utilities, Telecom, Materials and Energy sectors in China, as these sectors see high levels of government involvement.\nIn a country, where media is not free and information is not easy to obtain, uncovering political linkages and the real shareholder structures of small relatively less known Chinese companies is not easy. It requires patient due diligence, a contextual understanding of how things work in China, and a strong set of trusted relationships on the ground.\nAll the companies on Aikya\u2019s Quality List display high levels of social stewardship, which essentially means they pay fair taxes, do not cut corners in the way they treat employees, and generally behave well towards the community they operate within. Such exemplary behaviour gives little opportunity for politicians to start interfering with a business.\nOur purpose is to generate healthy long-term returns with strong downside protection. Years of experience investing in Emerging Markets have taught us that ensuring \u2018return of capital\u2019 is almost as important as pursuing \u2018return on capital\u2019. As a result, our investment approach has evolved to mitigate the risks which could result in our investee companies ending up as Emperor\u2019s foie gras.",
