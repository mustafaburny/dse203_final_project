How does this happen? Shares can be borrowed, sold, then borrowed from the buyer (making two people technically borrowing the same 1 share). This is insane and has never happened before without causing a short squeeze. (look up volkswagen short squeeze chart to see what it looks like when short interest exceeds 100%). \n\n[https:\\/\\/finance.yahoo.com\\/quote\\/GME\\/key-statistics?p=GME](https://preview.redd.it/n8sr8ifnww161.png?width=840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3f3ef131a7d5bdee19acd4c6bd8196fad9c66aa)\n\nSo if gamestop stock goes up, the shorts will have to cover, which is literally impossible since theyve shorted over 100% of shares, so the price will be driven to an absolute retard height. But, whats gonna make gamestop go up? how are the shorts wrong?\n\n**Consoles**\n\nWell, the obvious is console sales, but thats not really it. Yes, the consoles will help, however more importantly there are key indicators that gamestop is not going bankrupt. Recently, they just paid off a metric fuckton of debt *voluntarily* which means they have the cash to do that, aka not bankrupt. People are literally camping out at gamestop for consoles. They will not struggle.\n\n**Cohen**\n\nAlso, they are getting the help from ryan cohen, who successfully competed with amazon by launching an online pet store called Chewy, which made him a billionaire. This is good news for gamestop because he will help pivot them from brick and mortar towards a more digital world, which means gamestop now has realistic growth prospects. Also, there is rumors that cohen will announce a tender offer, which would immediately trigger a short squeeze, end of story. Cohen has openly critiqued the BoD about their '20th century mindset' so it is likely he is going to take over soon. \n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Also, massive completely random spikes in volume off seemingly no news indicate that cohen is buying up shares. ](https://preview.redd.it/e19xcu0qxw161.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81f7c9aeb4df33cc2d416f7fda3b2e8ee257cc43)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positioning**\n\nThey have also positioned themselves to benefit from non traditional 'brick and mortar' revenue streams. Another thing that gamestop has is online revenue sharing with sony, which means they will be benefiting from digital game sales. They also just announced that they would be selling TVs on their website, showing that they are positioning themselves to compete as an online retailer. \n\n[https:\\/\\/www.theverge.com\\/2020\\/10\\/15\\/21517970\\/gamestop-revenue-sharing-microsoft-xbox-digital-downloads-games](https://preview.redd.it/cijd0o25xw161.png?width=1518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=310955852b0224bfff2fc36825d50a741475f46c)\n\n[https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/](https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/)\n\n\\^Link about TVs. \n\n**The move:**\n\nBuy as many shares as you can and hold. Set a limit sell on all your shares for at least $500, to make sure that you dont miss the squeeze. That alone would be a 3,233% gain.  \n\nImportant note: This quarters earnings will likely not be a catalyst for a short squeeze. It is likely that there will be a run up and then small dump after. Remember, the shorts are working hard to fuck over longs. Dont be a retard and fall for it. Buy up the dips. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: BUY GAMESTOP SHARES, HOLD WITH A LIMIT SELL OF AT LEAST $500/share**",

        "selftext": "I have done previously succesful DDs so I am not just talking shit. \n\nWe all know Gamestop is going to crash it's business model is dead. But so does everyone else. In fact nearly everyone is shorting the shit out of it. Even your wife's bf and Cramer is shorting the fuck out of it. \n\n[There is more shorts than outstanding shares!](https://preview.redd.it/up5ukv9180261.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb5140a7bd7a1d84494f89d99d2d792e3b6a267)\n\nThere are just a bit more shorts than outstanding shares, and nearly 3 times more than the floating shares. Which means those assholes will need to close their positions and buy back their shares. But what is going to happen is that there is not enough supply float. So the price will skyrocket faster than PLTR or NIO or any other meme in 2020.\n\nRight but what if they don't want to close their shorts all at once. Then nothing happens, right? Yes... and no. As they start buying back the price will rise slowly and some people that did not want to buy will at some point get a margin call. This will force more short sellers to buy (at a lose cause fuck gay bears). And this will accelerate the rising of the price creating more margin calls and so on and so on. Until we run out of short sellers trying to buy. At this point the price will stop increasing. Basically, we only need a small (comapared to 22.70 Mill) amount of people buying to trigger this.\n\nSo there is still a thing that needs to happen a small amount of people need to suddenly buy or close the shorting positions. For the price to start going up. Then here is the best part. GME earnings are happening on the 8th of December. Two things can happen either they ace it and people start buying or they screw it up and the price goes down.\n\nFirst scenario it's golden the price starts rolling and GME goes to the moon. The second one sounds bad, right? No, if the price drops by 20% some people might start closing their shorts. Then as that happens the price will bounce back and start the process again.\n\nBasically GME is a ball at the top of the hill right now. If only a bit of wind blows is going to start rolling.\n\nNot only that but imagine if we all buy some shares we can show the market who is in control! Fuck Cramer fuck the bears. It is only 22 million shares, we are 1.6m we could even trigger the squeeze if we wanted to...",

        "selftext": "**TLDR:** Donate to St. Jude for extra luck!\n\nHello WSB,\n\nI want to run through a trade I made for anyone who is confused about the finer points of options trading and the mechanics of an infinite squeeze like the one we saw in TSLA, PLTR, etc. \n\nI encourage anyone who has questions on options to ask in the comments. I see a lot of posts asking about the basics and I want to pay forward all the help I received on reddit.\n\nPart 1: Sell Puts\n\nI sold a Put at $30 strike price expiring in 1/15/2020. I got $1680 premium, which I used to fund the rest of my trade. Some may ask why I used this method instead of just using $3000 to buy calls? The answer is that this is to mitigate risk. If GME goes up but does not hit $30 by 1/15/2020, then some of my loses will be mitigated by the increase in the share price. \n\nPart 2: Buy Calls\n\nThe next step was to buy 25 GME call options at $30 1/15/2020. This cost $1500, which I sourced from selling my put above. This means I control 2,500 shares of GME above the $30 price point. \n\nPart 3: Forced Buying\n\nMarket Makers hedge the options they sell by buying 20% of the shares they have shorted in case the option ends in the money. This means that the MM who sold me those calls bought 500 shares of GME at $13.80 each. I removed $6,500 of shares from the market while only putting $1,500 on the line. As Gama changes, so will the number of shares the MMs are forced to buy as a hedge. \n\nPart 4: The Short Squeeze to Infinity\n\nGME already has 140% of their shares shorted. If MMs must buy shares and hold them until 1/15/2020, that makes it even more difficult for the shorts to cover. Short squeezes are violent and lead to huge increases in price. Overstock grew over 500% and VW briefly became the most valuable company due to similar strategies (Porsche literally bought tons of call options). \n\nIt is not impossible to see GME hit $100/share and maybe even $1,000/share (dream with me) since there is no precedent for a company that has this much short interest. If this occurs, then anyone who put 3K down on this trade would cash out with $2.5 Million.\n\nRisk Mitigation\n\nIf we get a squeeze: If GME goes over $30, I will make mad money. Many retail investors will become millionaire off of GME.\n\nIf GME Stagnates: My cost basis for GME is $4.10 on 1,000 shares. Even if my calls expire worthless, that will only add $1.36/share to my cost basis. As long as we stay over $5.46, I will profit on my position. I plan to sell a few weekly CC to bring my cost basis back down to $4. I have 6 weeks to make back $1500 which means I probably only need to pledge 400 shares at .2 Delta. \n\nIf GME Crashes: Even if we crash 50%, I will be making money on the trade. I will sell CCs until my cost basis is $0.\n\nPositions: GME short squeeze to infinity and beyond",

        "selftext": "Gooood morning!\n\nI hope you are all enjoying this wonderfully green day.\n\nAfter PLTR reached $20 yesterday u/ZanderPerk \\- a stranger from this subreddit - gave me $400 USD to cover the costs of my PS5. I already have the console in hand, and there is a custom bumper sticker coming in his honour. You can read the full story here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzrj3y/legend\\_of\\_the\\_wsb\\_ps5\\_i\\_promise\\_to\\_pay\\_pltr/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzrj3y/legend_of_the_wsb_ps5_i_promise_to_pay_pltr/)\n\nAs promised, I will be paying it forward and giving some other lucky Palantir bull a Digital Edition PS5 if PLTR\u2019s stock price reaches $30.00 this year. Here is how it will work.\n\nThe day Palantir touches 30.00 (before the end of 2020) I will come back to WSB and post a form for you to enter the draw. \n\nAnd it gets better.\n\nIt must be the season of giving, because another generous redditor - u/degenerate-hotdog has reached out to me and offered to cover the costs of TWO other PlayStation 5\u2019s.\n\nThat\u2019s right. There are **THREE** **PLAYSTATION 5**\u2019s being given away if Palantir hits $30 this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# FAQ:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How do I enter?**\n\nWhen Palantir hits $30, I will post a form on this subreddit for you to complete to enter the draw. Messages sent to me and comments in this or other threads do not count as entering the draw. The winner will be selected directly from the survey results. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What information will be required to enter?**\n\nThe form will only ask for your 1) reddit username, 2) an email address and 3) your selection of a number between 1 and 1,000,000. Do not give anyone any other information who may be posing as someone who is part of this draw. I will be doing the draw, and those are the only 3 details I will be asking for. &lt;- This part is important. Don\u2019t get scammed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How can I find the post to enter?**\n\nThere are three ways to ensure you don\u2019t miss the post. You can follow me on reddit and get notifications about when I post. Also, when Palantir reaches $30, the post will be titled \u201c$PLTR - WSB PLAYSTATION 5 DRAW\u201d. I will also update THIS post with a link to the draw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What exact price action will trigger the draw?**\n\nIf Palantir touches $30.00 USD before the end of 2020 the draw will occur. That means that even if it touches and then retreats, the draw will still occur.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How will the draw be done?**\n\nThere will be a 48 hour window from when the post is created to enter. I will post the exact draw closing time in the post. When entry closes, I will remove the link to the entry form from the post. After all entries have been collected, I am going to log into World of Warcraft, on a character aptly named Palantir. I will then use the World of Warcraft loot rolling system to roll for a random number between 1 and 1,000,000. This rolling system is entirely random. I will \u201c/roll 1000000\u201d ONCE and then I will check that number against a spreadsheet of all the entries. Whoever is closest will win. The entire WoW draw and spreadsheet lookup process will be recorded and I will post it on YouTube. Winners will be announced on the draw post, along with the recording of the draw process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How many winners will there be?**\n\nThere will be 3 winners. The closest 3 numbers will be given a console. However, I only personally guarantee the console for the first closest number. The second and third consoles are u/degenerate-hotdog\u2019s responsibility. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How will winners be contacted?**\n\nWinners will be contacted via email and reddit private message, using the addresses and usernames collected via the form.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What if they don\u2019t respond?**\n\nYou will have 7 days to respond before I move on to the next winner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What if** u/degenerate-hotdog **changes his mind?**\n\nThat\u2019s unfortunate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What if there is a tie?**\n\nIn the event that two numbers are the same distance from the drawn number and there is a tie, whoever can prove to me that they were bullish on Palantir first wins. A bullish reddit post about why you like the company will suffice, as there are no financial requirements for this draw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How will the winner get their PS5?**\n\nThe PS5 that I am giving away will be ordered from Amazon, Walmart, Bestbuy or Gamestop straight to an address of your choosing. If you don\u2019t want to reveal your personal address, we can send it to a post office box or your place of work. Alternatively, we can try to set up in-store pick up.\n\nWith regards to u/degenerate-hotdog, he has told me that he wants to do GameStop gift cards instead. In any case, I will do my best to put the second and third place winners in touch with him, and how you get your prize from him is between the two of you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What if we can\u2019t get one because they are all sold out?**\n\nWe will try to get one for a couple of weeks. If we are struggling to get one, I will send you an appropriate gift card valued at $400 USD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What if some unforeseen challenge prevents us from getting a PS5 sent to me?**\n\nI will send you a gift card, intended to be used on a PS5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Will you buy a more expensive one from a scalper?**\n\nNegative. Regular price from a reputable retailer only.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Who qualifies?**\n\nIn order to qualify you must be over the age of 18, a member of this subreddit and you must be bullish on Palantir. You do not have to own a security or option relating to Palantir, but bulls are encouraged to participate. I am not sure that I can legally provide kickbacks to individuals, so I am choosing to just remove the position requirement to be safe. Please do not enter if you or your family members will not play the PS5. These things are in high demand. You must also reside in a country that receives shipments from Walmart, Amazon, Bestbuy and/or Gamestop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Do I have to get a PS5?**\n\nYes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Can I pay the extra to get a disc edition?**\n\nYes, but you will have to send me $100 USD plus transfer fees first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Can I get an xbox?**\n\nNo. Xbox sucks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Can I get cash instead?**\n\nNo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What does the winner have to do?**\n\nWinners will be asked to please post a picture of their PS5 on WSB and tag myself and u/degenerate-hotdog in it. We would also strongly encourage you to pay this forward at the next aggressive Palantir price target or resistance point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Is this legal?**\n\nThere are no laws preventing me from giving away gifts, and I am not requiring you to take any trading action to enter this draw. So yes. This is legal.",

        "selftext": "# PLTR OVER $30 USD IN EUROPE. FREE TOYS AT THE BOTTOM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWelp my friends. Like 2 days ago I said if Palantir made it to $30 by the end of the year, I\u2019d give out a PS5 to someone in this subreddit.\n\nWhile a 50% gain over 6 weeks sounded aggressive, turns out things are moving a tad faster around here.\n\nLooks like we are over $30 in Europe. Fuck it. Let\u2019s do this draw now. It\u2019s American Thanksgiving after all.\n\n\\--\n\nBut before I live up to my promise and get into the details of how you enter this draw, I think I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t use this opportunity to get my thoughts in about Palantir.\n\n**First and foremost, will everyone who is calling PLTR a quote \u201cmeme stock\u201d shut the hell up?**\n\nJust because a bunch of gorilla IQ memers happen to be buying something, does not mean that the thing they are buying is stupid. All those dingleberries also own Androids and iPhones, does that doesn\u2019t mean Google and Apple are \u201cmeme companies\u201d? No.\n\nUnlike actual meme stocks such as: unprofitable weed companies, camera companies gone pharma, car rental companies gone bankrupt, and little airlines living off corporate welfare - Palantir is actually a ROCK SOLID COMPANY with an extremely promising future.\n\nThis rally was predictable and **it will keep on going in the long run.**\n\nMyself and many others in WSB, r/investing and r/stocks got in on day one - not out of chance - but because we did our due diligence and we could see the writing on the wall: Palantir has the potential to possibly become one of the most important tech companies in the world, and it is being led by people with a track record to back it up.\n\nThis stock isn\u2019t mooning because we have posted 10,000 memes and shit posts. I'm sorry kiddos and Cramer, but our TikTok videos with a few thousand views aren't powerful enough to create $25B of stock market value.\n\nThere is something much larger at play here, and we in WSB are lucky enough to be along for the ride.\n\nPLTR is heading to Mars because the financial institutions didn\u2019t have the opportunity to get in before the IPO and now they are racing to catch up. Moreover, now that **Palantir\u2019s first quarterly report has proven they are the real deal,** and everyone has started googling this pandora\u2019s box of a company - the market is going \u201choly shit\u201d.\n\nThe only question mark that was in Palantir\u2019s path was the impact Joe Biden\u2019s administration might have on the company's relationship with the US government.\n\nWith a former Palantir consultant Avril Haines at the helm of the entire US intelligence community as of this week, the risk of the new administration working against Palantir has been all but removed.\n\nThat\u2019s why we are up bigly this week.\n\nBut more importantly, **you need to consider the global technological context of this company, to truly understand its future potential.**\n\n1. In the 90\u2019s PC\u2019s took over. \n2. In the 2000\u2019s it was all about the .coms.\n3. The 2010\u2019s was the era of wireless and mobile platforms.\n4. 2020 WILL be the decade of smart automation through a global wifi network.\n\nAnd because of that, there is now an information and technology cold war brewing. China and USA are racing to get control of the global internet infrastructure, and they are doing everything they can to invent true AI. \n\nOnce the entire world and everything in your home goes \u201csmart\u201d and becomes connected to Starlink\u2019s grid, someone or some*thing* is going to need to sift through the quintillions of zeroes and ones, to make sense of it all in real time. Guess who is **the only company in the world that has the know-how and business/political connections to fill that void?**\n\nAt the risk of getting too deep in the weeds here, I need to mention one last detail: You all need to read up on Project Maven.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Project Maven is an AI drone project that Google was originally supposed to fulfill for the US Airforce. Google walked from the contract citing \"ethical\" concerns, and then Palantir picked up the pieces. Imagine how pissed the US Airforce was when Google called them unethical and embarrassed them?\n\nThis has a **very** important underlying implication. If you accept the premise that the American government is going ham in this technological revolution, there still remains the question as to who will be the primary benefactor. \n\nCommon sense would suggest that companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft will be working with the US government to create AI. However, Project Maven changed all that. \n\nGoogle's refusal to fulfill their top secret contract taught the government that they cannot trust the trillion dollar megacaps to be unequivocally and unapologetically pro-USA. Those companies are so big, that they don't need to choose a side in geopolitics, and they will almost certainly continue to offer their products to everyone around the world. \n\nWhen it comes to matters of national cybersecurity, the odds are that **the US government is going to put all it's eggs in a company that is unquestionably loyal and patriotic.** When the pentagon is creating a trillion dollar AI behemoth, they know they need to work with someone they can trust when push comes to shove. Palantir is the only AI company that is bold enough to do so, and **their founders have created a special the corporate share structure to ensure they will never lose control**.\n\nSo again, this is not a fucking \"meme stock\".\n\nPLTR is mooning like your pubescent boner on viagra because everyone is starting to realize that this **magnificent titan the CIA created** (*see In-Q-Tel*) has gone public and will probably be at the forefront of the next global technological revolution.\n\nSo: \n\n* Stop worrying about a dip next week. (*Yes it might happen. So what?*)\n* Stop worrying about a price crash post lock up. (*This will happen. But from what price to what price? Who cares?*)\n* Stop trying to time the market to squeeze out an extra $1000. (*We aren\u2019t smart enough or fast enough to win that game.*)\n* Stop viewing Palantir like it\u2019s a penny stock. It\u2019s not.\n\n**Start** looking at the year 2030 and imagine what you will do with your money then, if you grow the man balls (or lady balls) required to hold that long.\n\nHow you handle your positions over the next 6-12 months may be the most important decision of your life: do... not... sell\u2026\n\nThere are only a handful of times in your life when a person should truly go all in. 1) When you meet the person you know you want to marry. When you decide to change your career. And when a company like Palantir goes public.\n\nIn 10 years, you can thank me. Today, I would like to thank you for your time and consideration.\n\nGod speed.\n\n\\--\n\nNow for the fun stuff.\n\n# RULES:\n\n* You must be 18 or older to enter.\n* You must be in a country where you are able to receive shipments from Walmart, Amazon, Bestbuy and/or Gamestop.\n* Your reddit account must be at least 1 week old to claim the prize.\n* There are no financial or trading requirements for this draw.

        "selftext": "I've been seeing a lot of comparisons between GME now and the VW short squeeze back in 2008. For those of you who've been living under a rock, GME's short is currently more the entire number of outstanding shares. This is a very interesting, but the more important fact is that the number of shares sold short is roughly 3x the entire float. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/udkkxz9ok1261.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f98f9645d9e2bf94dc3ccbd409f2d2b375be6d91\n\nThis is very important, as to cover short positions, MM's will have to buy from the float, the greater the Short % of Float, the greater the squeeze. In comparison, VW had a short float of just under 13% right before the insane short squeeze. Now, roughly 30-35% of VW shares were in the float, with Porsche holding 42.6%, the state of Lower Saxony holding 20%, and about 5-6% held by passive investors. This made the Short % of Float about 40%, far less than GME currently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe short squeeze occurred because Porsche announced that they were going to exercise options to buy another 31.5% of the float, taking their total up to 74.1%, and had plans to hold 75% of VW the following year. This triggered a squeeze as shorts rushed to buy to cover before Porsche exercised the options. As you can see from the graph, VW's share price jumped nearly 5x, and then quickly fell back down. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8720v4xm1261.png?width=310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=116f1045eacf3e73ecde3e44868b0867ca0b1231\n\nA GME short squeeze will likely do the same thing, with possibly an even greater climb. However, this is no sure thing. To trigger the squeeze, GME would likely need to demonstrate long term profitability and growth. If MM's continue to believe GME's business model is dead, they will continue to be short as they can wait the 2 years it takes for GME to die. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the play, I personally think that GME is going to use the boost from console revenue to change its business model and help GME adapt to the tech age. With an already decent supply of cash (735 million as of 7/31/20), as well as major investors like Michael Burry (Big Short Guy) and Ryan Cohen (CHWY co-Founder) backing GME, all we need is a change in business model to trigger the squeeze. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Call leaps if you love to gamble your life savings, Shares if you're slightly less of a degenerate than the rest of us",

        "selftext": "They always make fun of us ~~traders~~ gamblers here at r/WallStreetBets, but who \\*really\\* has the last laugh? Is it us Chads while we eat our crayons on the way to the Lambo shop? Or are the virgin traders truly better than us?\n\nI'm going to show you something. Something that's never been seen by human eyes, never computed by any type of algorithm, something our wive's boyfriends wouldn't even pay attention to. This is the WallStreetBets sentiment and hype detection.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that WallStreetBets is #1 when it comes to finding trends and finding stocks. It doesn't matter if this is after-the-fact that the stock price shot up 50% in 2 days. It doesn't matter that the stock is something nobody paid attention to until finally the whole world start trading it (PLTR). What it comes down to is the fact that WSB will find literally any stock after it has already mooned. Stock up 10% for the day? WSB knows about it. Stock up 20% in the last week? WSB has already traded it. It's genius.\n\n**Here's the kicker**. \\*Most\\* times after a stock has mooned once and WSB hops on the trend, the stock will go through another 1 or 2 periods of \"mooning\". If you are new to the industry of printing tendies, grab a tequila on the rocks and have a drink with me while I go through some sentiment on the WallStreetBets forum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not even going to start with PLTR (Palantir) because that would be too obvious. Let's start with XPEV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**XPEV**\n\nLook at this sentiment chart. The stock wasn't even mentioned a single time until some autist found an alternative EV company to gamble on after it shot up 10% in a single day.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/un64jt1z47261.png?width=1608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=311103e4373fa04790226cebe751d1d35ca9aa9b\n\n1st wave sentiment peaked at 3% of the sub-reddit's comment volume. What happened next? The stock stayed flat for 7 days and you autists completely forgot about it. Next stop - Wave 2: Comment volume peaking at roughly 5% of all comments after the stock price went from $33 to $43 in one day. Massive spike in chatter around the ticker and the stock price continues it's meteoric climb for a whole month. You can see another 1 or 2 waves where sentiment rises after big moves in stock prices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CRSR**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0scjg83257261.png?width=1612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbaca71ea742ea0c1431dde33304aa009c277ba8\n\nNext up is Corsair Gaming. None of you autists even knew the stock existed 2 months ago. We can see wave 1 happened early November with small gains in the stock price. Sentiment was steady as autists everywhere were drooling over consistent gains for the first time, loving every minute of it, kind of like when you kiss your cousin for the first time. Wasn't long after we see wave 2 and 3 of the trend where the stock continues it's mission to Mars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**LI** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alxnfwz257261.png?width=1612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c9ebd19dec396d22ad8146e8fb1732277cd10e0\n\nNext we'll look at LI. 99% of you, including myself, don't even know what this company does. All we know is that STOCKS ONLY GO UP. The first wave happened 3 weeks ago when comment volume reached 5% of all the comments on the sub-reddit. Stock price shot up 30% in a single day. Sounds insane that the momentum would continue upward, but it has. Not only that, the stock price has gone up another 30% in the last 3 weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PLTR**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vs5zaon357261.png?width=1630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f6c883545d1bf1b550890d7c4ad4518dafdde02\n\nThe PLTR sentiment chart is nothing short of magnificent for a sentiment junkie like myself. Comment volume has been rising at the same rate as the stock price. On Friday roughly 50% of discussion comments mentioned the ticker PLTR. Something that you either loved or found incredibly annoying. The only other tickers to ever break the 50% comment volume barrier are Tesla and NIO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhat's the next meme stock going to be? Is it GME? Do we regress back to PRPL gang? Nobody really knows, but one thing I can agree with is that wave 1 of the trend is almost always the early adopters with gorilla balls willing to risk large amounts of capital on a stock nobody's ever traded before. Once a few believers hop on the train the whole sub-reddit jumps on the bandwagon headed to hell or Valhalla.",

        "selftext": "  \n\n\\- In April 2019 GME brings in former president of Best buy Services named \u201cGeorge Sherman\u201d who has tremendous amount of experience in Brick &amp; Mortar retails. George made huge changes to the company (e.g., hired a former president of Nintendo America in order to solve supply issues for Nintendo Switch during the beginning of Pandemic).\n\n\\- As a result, E-commerce revenue grew 500% YTY in Q1 2020 and 800% YTY in Q2 2020.\n\n\\- Ryan Cohen, a self-made Billionaire, who co-found Chewy .com shows interest in Gamestop and purchases 9.98% of GME shares. \n\n\\- Ryan Cohen recognizes the booming gaming industry and realizes the goldmine that Gamestop is sitting on with strong brand and 55million + PowerUp members. \n\n\\- Despite George Sherman\u2019s proven success in E-comm sales, Ryan Cohen believes a more aggressive change needs to happen in order to make GameStop Great Again.\n\n\\- Ryan Cohen believes that in order to make GME Great Again, it is absolutely necessary for GameStop do the following:\n\n1) Forgo the upcoming 2-year lease renewal on all underperforming stores\n\n2) Non-core operations in Europe and Australia to be streamlined or sold.\n\n3) By cutting cost with the above two methods and with the revenue generated from the biggest ever console cycle, GameStop should invest heavily on boosting E-comm sales.\n\n(Hire proficient E-comm gurus, invest more in GME website and App, secure delivery channels that are better or at least on par with Amazon.\n\n[http://wsj.com/public/resources/documents/RC%20Ventures%20Letter%20to%20GameStop.pdf](http://wsj.com/public/resources/documents/RC%20Ventures%20Letter%20to%20GameStop.pdf)\n\n\\- Ryan Cohen demands the company to layout the roadmap as soon as possible (\\*hint\\* December 8 Earnings call)\n\n**2 possible scenarios:**\n\n1. GameStop addresses Cohen\u2019s letters and agrees to implement Cohen\u2019s ideas.\n\n2. GameStop completely disagrees with Cohen as they believe they are on the right track or doesn\u2019t address Cohen\u2019s letter at all.\n\n\\- Scenario 2 is where it could get interesting as many speculate a potential hostile takeover by Ryan Cohen. \n\nMy take on this:\n\n\\- Ryan Cohen is not a WSB autist. He sees the potential short squeeze opportunity. Ryan Cohen could be holding massive amount of ITM calls which he can exercise and reduce the supply of shares significantly. This way, he could easily takeover the company with the shares his holding and possibly even ride the short squeeze with us. This would force the shorts the cover. Similar to what happened in 2008 with Volkswagen.\n\n[https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/)\n\n\\- Or, Cohen could actually plan a hostile takeover and call up a proxy vote. This could lead to recalling shares by the company, forcing the shorts to cover and triggering the short squeeze.\n\nIcing on the cake:\n\n\\- On 12/11/20, GameStop voluntarily pays off debt as their cash on hand deems healthy.\n\n[http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-voluntary-early-redemption-senior-notes](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-voluntary-early-redemption-senior-notes)\n\n\\- Microsoft multi-year revenue sharing partnership meaning, they will receive constant revenue flow from sales of Xbox All Access. \n\n[http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft)\n\n\\- Short Squeeze will happen with enough short interest even with the most retarded stocks:\n\n[https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/](https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/)\n\n\\- Michael Burry from \u201cThe Big Short\u201d sees an undervalued stock that is massively shorted.

        "selftext": "If you are just joining GME gang, it's important for you to know how manipulated this stock is by shorts.\n\nToday is like most other days for the past few months. Pump in the morning with real, organic buying, then the shorts (Melvin Capital) melt the price over the course of the afternoon by short selling on basically non-existent volume.\n\nSo it's important for everyone to know that there's a war being waged in this stock on both ends. If you are going to paper-hand and dump your shares (don't do this lmfao), do it in the first 15 minutes of trading and don't sell during the other market hours while the share price is being artificially suppressed.",

        "selftext": "Alright listen up fellow autists, sit down and strap in, because I'm gonna sling you some DD so solid you won't be able to close those videos of your wife and her boyfriend over at [r/cuckold](https://www.reddit.com/r/cuckold/) fast enough.\n\n**The Big Short**\n\nYou morons ever see the Big Short? No? Well, let me give you a rundown:\n\n\\*Autist reads about a million pages of subprime housing loan structures.  \\*Determines that they are unsustainable and eventually they will go into default. \\*Goes to a big bank and purchases CDS, or credit default swap to short the housing market. \\*Doesn't buy puts because he isn't a  gaybear, or something. \\*Housing market collapses, he makes billions.\n\nSo that's basically it. Lazy, poorly explained rundown? Yep. And fuck you, just go watch the movie.\n\nSome of his other notable trades this year are:\n\n* GME,  which he bought back in Q1 2020, and we all know how that shit worked out. \n* PDS, which he purchased 4 million shares of at around $0.75 in Q2,  currently trading at $17.85. \n* BBBY, 1 million shares bought around  $10.60, currently trading at $20.24 \n* CPA, flipped 155k shares, bought for around $50.56, currently trading at $75.78.\n\n[13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920019679/0001567619-20-019679-index.htm)\n\n**Overview**\n\nI  could go on, but my point here is Christian Bale is extremely autistic,  and if you want to be autistic too, go long on one of his recent additions per his latest 13F: LUMN Technologies. Mr. Bale added a  whopping 800k shares in Q3, his 4th largest addition to his portfolio this past quarter.\n\nWhat is LUMN,  you ask? Well, they are formally Centurylink. And yes, we all know how much of a shit company that was. Hear me out though.\n\nA  lot of companies are going through a bit of a renaissance these days.  COVID is forcing public companies to be smarter, more efficient, and adaptable.\n\nOut are the boring days of boomer telephone lines. Centurylink has transformed themselves into  Lumen Technologies, switching their focus to helping companies enter the  \"4IR\", or Fourth Industrial Revolution. The term makes me gag.\n\nSome of their business exposure includes:\n\n* Adaptive  Network Systems \n* Advanced Collaboration Platforms \n* AI-Driven Adaptive  Threat Intelligence \n* Edge Computing \\*Hybrid Cloud Networks\n\nNow I'm no network engineer, but that shit sounds pretty fancy right?\n\n[LUMN](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/home.html)\n\n**Financials:**\n\n* Recently beat their Q3 earnings, with non GAAP EPS at .40, the consensus estimate was .34.\n* EBITDA was $2.19B, and the company grew net income to $366M from a year-ago $302M.\n* Adjusted net income rose to $430M from $328M last year.\n* Generated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $1.794 billion for the third quarter 2020.\n* Revenues fell 3.4% overall to $5.17B, compared to $5.350 billion for the third quarter 2019.\n\nBut revenue being down is bad right? Shut the fuck up, LUMN has almost fully recovered their revenue stream from last year, showing solid management in an era of COVID.\n\n[Q3 ER](https://ir.lumen.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/Lumen-Technologies-Inc-Q3-2020-Earnings/default.aspx)\n\nI  think this is a positive growth stock moving forward. Additionally,  with further lockdowns on the horizon, we should start to see this equity continue to pick up traction, think NFLX, ZM, etc.\n\n[In ](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/fiber-optic-cable-market)[fact, this report from Mordor Intelligence estimates that the CAGR of  Fiber Optics and IT solutions will grow at a 15% rate by 2025. ](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/fiber-optic-cable-market)\n\nPositions: 1/21 10c, 4/21 12c, 7/21 15c, and 11/21 15c\n\nThese contracts are dirt cheap folks, all under a buck as it stands right now.

They probably have an actual short position too (don't have to file that in an 13F) they're also underwater on. No one else has a put position this big in the 13F's.\n\nWhat are the chances they're responsible for half the short interest? It'd make sense on why we're not seeing significant covering on GME yet. They're a bunch of stubborn boomers that have collateral in the billions. It wouldn't be crazy if they made a $200 million bet on Gamestop becoming the next Blockbuster when it was under $6. They've made similar bets in the past like their $400 million short on Nintendo back in 2018.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u7ttqxuym8261.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b39a443a7d7cdc8d62ede4680a5b540af920f1d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course that $200 million bet would have turned to a $500 million (and growing) that they owe. They might not get a margin call, but surely there's a point where their risk management and exit strategy tells them they have to cut losses instead of paying $100K daily in interests (\\~7% APR fee) on a losing position that's getting bigger and bigger.\n\n**Note:** the short squeeze is just a bonus so don't be a paperhand retard. There's more to the GME play than just hoping the short sellers pay for your lambo. GME is unusually undervalued compared to its peers (0.13x revenues if you're basing it on TTM revenues), it can go up without a short squeeze. These boomers still think that digital consoles are going to kill Gamestop even though Microsoft threw them a safety net and that disc consoles are still the vast majority of sales. Surprise surprise, no one wants digital consoles in America when downloading a game uses up their entire bandwidth cap for the month.",

Although the nature of recent posts can bring up a debate if there is a mass enthusiasm being built around PLTR and if that enthusiasm can be considered manipulation, there are now DD that show clear basis in breaking sec rules, most specifically the recent GME DD on the short squeeze.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2qhdg/ok\\_boys\\_gme\\_is\\_rocket\\_ship\\_and\\_it\\_is\\_nearly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2qhdg/ok_boys_gme_is_rocket_ship_and_it_is_nearly/)\n\n\u201cBasically, we only need a small (comapared to 22.70 Mill) amount of people buying to trigger this.So there is still a thing that needs to happen a small amount of people need to suddenly buy or close the shorting positions. For the price to start going up.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only that but imagine if we all buy some shares we can show the market who is in control! Fuck Cramer fuck the bears. It is only 22 million shares, we are 1.6m we could even trigger the squeeze if we wanted to...\u201d\n\nEven if this DD has a bit of technical here and there it wouldn\u2019t fucking matter, the op of the post is literally asking people in this sub to buy GME to cause a short squeeze now is this illegal?\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#:\\~:text=Although%20some%20short%20squeezes%20may,a%20short%20squeeze%20is%20illegal](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#:~:text=Although%20some%20short%20squeezes%20may,a%20short%20squeeze%20is%20illegal).

NO, THEY WONT.\n\nI know that when there is money involved its difficult to be levelheaded, even I almost placed an order for GME today until I decided to think for a singular fucking second.\n\nSo many of these new people are financially illiterate and gullible that if nothing is done trends like this can take off and people will follow it unaware of the legality of the situation. \n\nThe mods really can\u2019t fucking sleep on this and the fact that we are a sub group in a much bigger social platform means that we will be terminated the second there is legal trouble, for fuck sake even 4 chan mods are better than this.",

        "selftext": "Alright, my beloved retards, listen up.  I know many of you, myself included, are jacking it to the thought of infinite tends from the GME short squeeze.  Problem is, unlike those bosses u/DeepFuckingValue and u/Sir_Jack_A_Lot  many of you retards are poor as shit, and can't afford the shares necessary to become overnight millionaires when this bitch squeezes to infinity.  Yeah, you might make some tendies on the meager 10 shares you bought with the allowance your wife's boyfriend gave you, but who cares if you become a thousandaire, you'll just lose that shit next week.  I'm gonna walk you all through how we can harness the collective power of WSB autism, stick it to the MMs , and gobble up all the tendies.\n\nAt this point you may be asking how are we going to pump this bitch to infinity, were just a modest collection of 1.6M retards?  My answer is simple, and something you all should understand: FDs.  \n\nWay OTM weeklies are cheap as shit, every week I have been buying 20 30C for the current week, and the following week.  If you find the right ask, you can get them for $1 each.  If this squeezes, I walk away rich, if it doesn't Im out max $40.  \n\nIf we all start buying up all the OTM weeklies we can, it will force the MMs that sell them to hedge, this means they will need to buy roughly 20% of the shares, which reduces the float, which accelerates the squeeze.  One autist buying 20 FDs won't move the market, but 1.6M may just have a chance. \n\nGodspeed, my fellow retards, lets all hop aboard that train to Tendie Town.\n\nTLDR: Buy weekly GME 30C at .01.

        "selftext": "Ok retards, GME ShortSqueeze is not going to happen. But what will happen is the share price will pop. Currently they have a shit load of cash. How come they have so much cash despite losing about 1b over the past 2 financial years and not raising money thru debt or equity.\n\nWell some autist accountant back in the day decided to create some bullshit called double entry. GME bought some companies along the way which resulted in Goodwill. Which is basically the premium above net assets GME bought acquisitions for EB games ect.\n\nAs a result GME had a Profit of 74m total over the past 2 years before tax when you add back the goodwill impairment. Goodwill impairment over the last 2 years was roughly 1.3b.\n\nWhy is this important? Because the business for the past 2 years has been treated as a bankrupt despite actually holding its own in a digital era. If leadership manage to realise they can get out of most of the lease in the next 2 years and more to a online sale delivery plus pick up in store at foot traffic heavy locations / most profitable stores GME will remain profitable and cash flow positive for years to come.\n\nTLDR; Adding back fake accounting lossing for the past 2 years results in a profitable company.",

        "selftext": "supp guys, hope you are ready for another busy week of loss porn and short selling reports that gonna destroy your accounts. \n\nFor all those of you who missed the pltr and gme train or are too scared to get in (if you are than gtfo of this subreddit), I'm going to show you a company that is so undervalued it hurts and its to take off soon\ud83d\ude80\n\n**So what is Alteryx?**\n\nglad you asked, Alteryx is a data analytics data science company that provides a platform for companies to perform analysis of the data, share it, and deploy lots of analytic models. The platform can be used by business analysts, programmers, and trained data scientists. The company wants to solve the problem of wasting time in the organization for doing simple Data analytics. As for 2020 60 BILLION DOLLARS per year wasted on analysts doing repetitive manual work in spreadsheets. The uniqueness of this company is that the interface of the platform is very intuitive and user friendly, using drag and drop interface and mainly reduces the need to write complex software code. Their platform is designed to interact with almost any data source, starting from IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP to AWS, Google Analytics, Workday, and more.\n\n**Who are the customers?**\n\nSo the company has, as of 2020, approx. 7000 customers in more than 90 countries and big names like Netflix, Salesforce, Toyota, Chevron, Uber, Twitter, Xerox, Nasdaq, and many more. The company already has a name in the big boys' playground and we can expect it to continue to expand. \n\n**Tell me more, please.**\n\nNo problem amigo. The company continues its growth strategy by a series of acquisitions mainly for developing tools and talented people. in 2019 they acquired ClearStory Data mainly because the developers are very good and can leverage them to help to develop and improve their tools. They acquired Feature Labs to augment their machine learning capabilities and to penetrate to the East coast of the US. Also the company announced strategic alliances with Adobe, UiPath and ABBYY to accelerate adoption of APA (analytic process automation) which altreyx is a leader at. \n\nAlteryx is a subscription-based software which makes it a SaaS company the same as TTD, Shopify and so on, but it focuses on analytics. Their main competitors are the big software companies (IBM, Microsoft, SAP) and some small ones which most of them are private.                  So in order to compare them to check if they are under/overvalued, I will use companies in the same field as Datadog, Splunk, and more.\n\n**Let's dig in for some numbers**\n\nAnnual revenue has increased from 86M to 418M in just 4 years (2016-2019) that is a 48% CAGR which is amazing. This year the company expects to grow revenues at around 15% mainly because of covid, which made companies cut expenses.\n\nQ3 revenues growth is 38% YOY, customer growth is 24% YOY.                                                        Gross Margin is 93% (Amazing) Operating Margin is 24%. This company is super efficient and with great margins.\n\nThe company is profitable as of the 3Q with a positive EPS of 0.07. It uses more than 50% of its gross profit for R&amp;D which is exactly what we want to see in a growing tech company.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nCash is down to 95M from 409M mainly because of acquisitions, but short term investments are almost double YOY with 627M. **Current Ration** is 1:4 approx. and **asset to liabilities ratio** is 1:1.5 so the company is indeed solvent and can survive even black swans like covid.                 Liabilities wise the company has 650M in convertible bonds which as we see can be covered by the short-term investments, It is something we should consider when the company starts to underperform, not now though. \n\nCash from Operating Activities for the 3Q is 16.3 M an improvement of 20%                              FCF is negative for the quarter mainly because of the investments they made (240M) \n\nSo the company is performing really well so far this year and is able to grow despite covid and companies reducing expenses. Of course, they need to increase their FCF but as long as they are growing and acquiring companies it's all good.\n\n**Let's use some gay TA to see what's going on**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AYX 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/eu91ywiifd261.jpg?width=1374&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96335b788ca104400101c7f29fdc13435ce4aac7)\n\nWell as you see AYX is in a range for quite a while (since May) with 104 and 80 acting as support and 150 and 178 as resistance. It hits 104 twice and couldn't break it and in the last 2 weeks, it tried again, and again was denied. \n\nSo the stock can now go to 150 easily or contest again the 104 level. with the tech trend going up I can see it going to retest that 150 level hoping to break it.\n\n**Now we compare this company with other companies**\n\n \n\n* SNOW: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~100x\n* DDOG: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 40x\n* MongoDB: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 25x\n* **Alteryx: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 15x**\n* JFROG: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 30x \n* PLTR \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 50x\n\n(thanks  [u/xwpv8j62](https://new.reddit.com/user/xwpv8j62/) for the info)\n\nAs you see AYX is the most UNDERVALUED company here which means a lot of room to grow.\n\nGross Margin:\n\n**AYX- 92%**\n\nDDOG- 78%\n\nSNOW - 55%\n\nMongoDB- 69%\n\nP/S Ratio:\n\n**AYX-  16.95**\n\nDDOG- 51.71\n\nSNOW - 150.15\n\nMONGODB-  30.88\n\nPLTR - 47.76\n\nAYX has the best margin, best ratios, and still is way undervalued than its peers. This is wrong and YOU have a chance to take advantage of it.\n\n**TL:DR,**  Shares and January Calls at 120/130 strike will do the work.\n\nHave fun guys happy trading and tendies for y'all.",

        "selftext": "[LINK](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html)\n\nTDLR: Ryan Cohen believes that GME can grow biggie. He believes the company can be the ultimate destination for gamers, starting with a strong e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a  high touch experience that excites and delights customers, including content and community. It needs to become the Amazon of gaming, with the added expertise and specialized customer service as a key differentiator.\n\nTo do this, Cohen urges the company to cut excessive real estate costs, streamline or sell non-core operations in Europe and Australia and hire the right talent.\n\nRyan Cohen, the former CEO of Chewy, thinks the maligned video-fame retailer can turn itself around by shifting its focus away from physical stores in favor of a building robust e-commerce platform. Cohen thinks GameStop can use its brand and large customer base to make that transition. He has taken a large stake in the company to try and push it in that direction. He alludes to the fact that one board seat would not be acceptable to him as he wants the company to actually focus on a shift in mindset.\n\nCohen seems like the type of shareholder who will take it the distance if necessary. In that case, he would have two potential headwinds. \n\nFirst, the company recently added four new directors through settlements and nominations by shareholders. That could be enough to placate certain institutional shareholders and ISS if they do not see as dire of a situation as Cohen does in this ultra-fast-moving industry. \n\nSecond, a large part of the shareholder base is comprised of index funds such as BlackRock (12.12%), Vanguard (8.12%) and State Street (4.0%), who are reluctant to back an activist without the cover of an ISS or Glass Lewis recommendation. \u00a0However, what is interesting here is there is an unusually high short interest, with approximately 90% of the shares in lending programs, so we don\u2019t really know who has loaned their shares, who can vote them and who can recall them before the meeting.\n\n POSITIONS: JAN 25C, 30C AND SHARES\n\n**Stock Market Value**: $828 million ($12.71 per share)\n\n## Activist: Ryan Cohen\n\n**Percentage Ownership:**\u00a09.98%\n\n**Average Cost:** $5.98\n\n**Activist Commentary:** Cohen is not an activist but an extremely successful entrepreneur. Cohen is the co-founder and former CEO of e-commerce company [Chewy](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=CHWY), which he built up and sold to PetSmart in 2017 for $3.35 billion. Cohen remained CEO following the acquisition until March 2018, and in June 2019, Chewy went public at a valuation of $8.7 billion. This is Cohen\u2019s first 13D filing, but what he lacks in activist experience he makes up for in strategic and operational qualifications in building and running a company in the digital era, giving him a ton of credibility here, even more so than the average activist with respect to certain areas.\n\n## What\u2019s Happening:\n\nOn Nov. 16, 2020, Cohen sent a letter to the company\u2019s board, urging them to immediately conduct a strategic review and to provide stockholders with a credible and publicly available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets and building the e-commerce ecosystem.\n\n## Behind the Scenes:\n\nCohen resorted to this public letter because his private attempts were not productive. GameStop sells video games and consoles and has been bearishly compared to Blockbuster. Cohen does not make that direct analogy, but he certainly paints the picture of a company that is on that same path if it does not change.\n\nSales have declined from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019; EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in 2011 to only $111 million in 2019; net income has fallen from $339 million in 2011 to a loss of $470 million in 2019; and in the two most recent quarters alone, the company lost another $277 million. All of this happened while the size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle. Cohen sees a company that is stuck in a brick-and-mortar mentality and is unwilling to embrace the digital mindset necessary to grow with gamers.\n\nHowever, Cohen also sees a company with valuable assets, including a strong brand and large customer base and a path to success and shareholder value. He believes the company can be the ultimate destination for gamers, but that destination must start with a strong e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high touch experience that excites and delights customers, including content and community. It needs to become the Amazon of gaming, with the added expertise and specialized customer service as a key differentiator.\n\nTo do this, Cohen urges the company to cut excessive real estate costs, streamline or sell non-core operations in Europe and Australia and hire the right talent. While Cohen does not specifically target CEO George Sherman, he does note that Sherman has substantial experience working for large brick-and-mortar retailers such as [Advance Auto Parts](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAP), [Best Buy](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BBY) and [Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TGT) and is committed to a twentieth century focus on physical stores and walk-in sales despite the transition to an always-on digital world.\n\nThe company is at an inflection point to make this change. Cohen notes that the company will be able to temporarily mask some of its issues with the new console cycle that will appear to validate its adherence to an outdated business model that is overdependent on brick-and-mortar sales. However, it is also this new console cycle and additional sales that can provide the cash flow to finance this strategy change into the future as the global gaming market is expected to reach $174.9 billion this year and $217.9 billion by 2023.\u00a0\n\nCohen alludes to the fact that one board seat would not be acceptable to him as he wants the company to actually focus on a shift in mindset. This would require at least two \u2014 and probably three or more \u2014 new directors to the ten-person board, depending on who is replaced. While it looks like Cohen might have an ally on the board in James Symancyk, the CEO of PetSmart while Cohen was running Chewy, Symancyk also has a brick-and-mortar background and might not see it the same way Cohen does.\n\nIf this does end up going to a proxy fight, Cohen seems like the type of shareholder who will take it the distance if necessary. In that case, he would have two potential headwinds. First, the company recently added four new directors through settlements and nominations by shareholders. That could be enough to placate certain institutional shareholders and ISS if they do not see as dire of a situation as Cohen does in this ultra-fast-moving industry. Second, a large part of the shareholder base is comprised of index funds such as BlackRock (12.12%), Vanguard (8.12%) and State Street (4.0%), who are reluctant to back an activist without the cover of an ISS or Glass Lewis recommendation. \u00a0However, what is interesting here is there is an unusually high short interest, with approximately 90% of the shares in lending programs, so we don\u2019t really know who has loaned their shares, who can vote them and who can recall them before the meeting.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if the board will be able to stomach the change necessary to propel GameStop into the 21st century. In the words of former U.S. Army General Eric Shinseki: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like change, you\u2019re going to like irrelevance even less.\u201d",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve started compiling the list of GME\u2019s holders from WallstreetBets, to get a sense of how much fire power we have.\n\nHere's the list: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uWWAlPtJhUFpITlZAJZqJgf69WmETJ\\_qXorrxoEYE80/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uWWAlPtJhUFpITlZAJZqJgf69WmETJ_qXorrxoEYE80/edit#gid=0) currently including  u/Tomatotowers ,  u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT,  u/OutrageousDesk , u/DeepFuckingValue , u/powahTEN , etc. \n\nPlease reply with your position if you are interested in making the list more complete. \n\nI\u2019ve been invested in the company since it was $4 and have been averaging up. I have never been more convinced of anything in my life.\n\nThe laziness of short sellers is in my opinion insane.\n\nGamestop is currently trading at an enterprise value of $500M ($1bn Market cap - $500M of net cash). That\u2019s what all the skeptics cannot seem to figure out: that\u2019s a value that is certainly below liquidation value. You can\u2019t just forget what investing is about: trying to buy one dollar for 50 cents!\n\nEven with no changes from the current status quo, this is what\u2019s already happening here. We are buying one dollar for 30 cents... \n\nFurthermore, the new console cycle is giving Gamestop the oxygen necessary to implement the changes necessary to trade well above liquidation value. Think of e-commerce, further gaming merchandise (PCs, TVs, collectibles, etc.), esports, etc.\n\nIs Gamestop perfect? Fuck no! I have been writing to the company about several easy changes to be made (specifically in e-commerce) and they are very receptive. But it\u2019s not hard to find many many weaknesses that the company currently has.\n\nBut again. One needs to assess these issues vs. what we are paying.\n\nGamestop is trading at less than 0.1x Revenues (see Enterprise Value calculation above).\n\nEven in the very worst quarter (last quarter \u2013 Q2 2020), they were able to generate $181M of free cash flow! This is insane!!\n\nAgain, the point is they deserve to be worth multiples more, based on simple earning power. But they can be worth significantly more if they do pull off an actual turnaround and initial signs are very encouraging.\n\nThink of 800% e-commerce growth, think about an app that is constantly ranking in the top25 of the shopping category. Think of them partnering with Buy now \u2013 Pay Later providers. Think of them selling TVs and PCs. They have already done so much and there\u2019s so much more than can be done ( I\u2019d obviously would want change to happen way faster but such is life and it does take time to change a large organization).\n\n**I see myself as an owner in the business. I\u2019m not here for a quick buck. I think the real money is to be made in the long term. I\u2019ll keep on increasing my position on eventual dips.**\n\nI want people to understand Gamestop\u2019s story and not mindlessly invest and sell at the first price increase. It will take time but patient investors will be rewarded hugely. \n\nGood luck and wealth to all!",

        "selftext": "If you'd like to read my methodology for finding which stocks are being traded by politicians or track congress' stock trading yourself, you can see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/ghv7m7/a_site_that_lets_you_track_stock_trading_by_us/).\n\n---\n\n**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**\n\nComstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.\n\nShe bought \\~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.\n\n---\n\n**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***\n\nLowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say Lownethal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.\n\n---\n\n**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***\n\nThe Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A less man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.\n\n---\n\n**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***\n\nPat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.\n\nInsider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.\n\nWSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.\n\n---\n\n**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***\n\nMarshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.\n\nWhat Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.\n\n---\n\n**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***\n\nThe story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that some of you might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.\n\nOn July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.\n\nAlthough he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.\n\nSadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.\n\nAfter holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up.",

        "selftext": "I just wanna start off by saying, it's no coincidence that this news came yesterday - on RELEASE DAY which **also** happens to be the day when short interest data was to be released. That's what you call execution *chef kiss*.\n\nYes, this is only the beginning. The console cycle begins has just begun and GameStop is the largest retailer of games and consoles in the world, with over **5,000** stores worldwide in 10 countries. This cycle will lasts (at least 5) years, as all have previously. GME's pivot to e-commerce combined with an entry into the gaming equipment market will be the defining edge for GameStop.\n\nGameStop. The only place you *know* will have whatever gaming-related item you want - with same day delivery in many locations. This is where GameStop is headed. \n\nMost of you will already have heard the news from GameStop regarding \"Voluntary Early Redemption of Senior Notes\". For anyone that's unsure, this means that they are repaying debts equivalent to $125mn *voluntarily*; as in they are not *required* to pay them back right now. \n\nWe already knew that GameStop reported $700mn+ in cash so this reaffirms that GameStop are able to use the cash for deleveraging as opposed to them being *in a tight spot for cash*, so to speak, during the pandemic. This is great news for a brick-and-mortar store (since half of Reddit wants to keep calling it that) considering the sheer number of funds that are about to flow through GameStop (as they have been on pre-orders and will continue for YEARS). I'm no longer concerned about the next earnings as the cost-cutting by Management has been ridiculous. GameStop WILL beat ER expectations.\n\nThe news of a vaccine does not negatively impact GameStop or GME stock, in my opinion. People aren't going to game any less than they were before lockdowns, simply because lockdowns are (allegedly) going to go away soon. Before covid was a thing, the gaming industry was continuing to explode as it as has been year on year. It's not gonna slow down any time soon. Not now. Not when Sony and Microsoft just blessed us the next generation of gaming consoles.\n\nAlso, short interest is down this time around but only by around 2 million shares. We still have about 68 million shares short. Any more big news and we'll be off \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1a.\n\nTo recap: \n\n-Burry/Cohen still **in**\n- u/DeepFuckingValue still *IN* (big respects for \ud83d\udc8e hands)\n-institutions increasing their stakes in GME\n-short interest still over 100% (insane, in itself)\n-new console cycle JUST started and it's going to last YEARS (GameStop bout to make bank and keep making bank)\n-debts have been reduced by $125mn\n-costs being reassessed and cut down regularly\n-MSFT deal\n-yada yada yada\n\n**TL;DR** If you thing GameStop is going bust, idk for you fam. Quit while (you think) you're ahead. It may squeeze, it may not. But if you don't think it's gonna moon, think again.\n\nI wonder I many times I said GameStop in this post.\n\nPositions: GME shares",

Q2 total sales (including retail) were \\~942m for GME. So this will be a huge quarter for them. One big assumption he's made is that orders will continue at this rate for the entire Q4, when actually they could decrease or even increase dramatically - this remains to be seen as the holiday season progresses.

I also think basket size is underestimated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPotential Upcoming Catalysts:\n\n\\- Sony/Nintendo partnership\n\n\\- Console sales figures\n\n\\- Blockbuster sales figures for gaming - watch NPD reports\n\n\\- Debt rating upgrade after voluntary retiring of 60%+ of their debt\n\n\\- Trade-in business picks up as more people trade in their old consoles for credit on new consoles\n\n\\- E-commerce boom\n\n\\- The new advertising business is mentioned in earnings\n\n\\- Entering huge PC gaming market - parts, components, accessories\n\n\\- enter E-Sports market\n\n\\- Fastest growing gaming market, ever\n\n\\- COVID vaccine, increasing mall footfall, increased sales\n\n\\- Increased institutional ownership\n\n\\- Large short interest \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions:\n\nGME duh",

        "selftext": "Warning: Post contains voodoo and magic line faggotry. Not Safe For Retards\n\nSo I was bored. Wife is out with her boyfriend, Cyberpunk was supposed to be out, NNN means I can't pull out my JPOW anime body pillow, etc. So with nothing to do and TSLA memes still fresh in the one crease on my silky smooth brain, I decided to read up on the dark arts (Investopedia) and this is what I unveiled.\n\nAAPL is the next TSLA.\n\nTSLA blasted off Monday after hours into new atmospheric highs. Could the voodoo have predicted this? Well let's take a [look](https://imgur.com/a/kHx0SI4). Tesla was consolidating within a pennant. Low [ADX](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/adx-trend-indicator.asp) (lack of clear trend) and low implied volatility also suggested Tesla was laying dormant and ready to erupt. Volume was declining since the September highs verifying bullish consolidation. During the days before takeoff, volume was dead quiet, as quiet as it was in July, where it also consolidated within a astrology triangle before a bullish breakout. Then Elon launched astronauts to the ISS on Sunday, stockholders to the moon on Monday, and call holders to Mars on Tuesday. The green dildo volume spikes this week confirmed the breakout. The rise in ADX and IV confirmed this as well. Finally, [Andrew's Pitchfork](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/andrewspitchfork.asp) (pink lines) is valid due to multiple reactions on the median and bottom line, which some autist named Andrew claims price will have an 80% chance of reaching the median of the pitchfork. In short, more magic lines screaming TSLA is going bigly up. \n\n\"Oh look now you bring up this hocus pocus bullshit after its muuned. Your retard ass could only stitch this mumbo jimbo wizardry together after the breakout.\" \n\n\"If this is legit, then why the fuck didn't you say anything earlier - you busy sucking dicks at the gloryhole?\" (they meet COVID safety standards btw)\n\n\"This is bullshit, if you knew this where are your gains? You don't earn enough flipping burgers to where you can't afford a tier 3 Pokimane sub and TSLA fds?\n\n\"This is a waste of time, you're such a gay cucktard that you make the bull on Wall Street, who's had its balls fondled everyday for decades look straight.\"\n\nOnly one of these is true. And is why I present to you all \ud83c\udf4e.\n\nApple is the girl you start dating, where after a few dates you find out she has a twin. Damn two hot girls that look exactly alike? You're a lucky man you think in your head. Then she takes you to her home for Thanksgiving and there you meet her sister, a celebrity. Her name's Tesla and she is S3XY. However, she doesn't look like the sister you're dating. She is the hottest girl you've seen and with curves all in the right places; it is no wonder why her assets bring her a massive cult following. This is when you realized you dated the wrong sister. But it's not like Apple isn't hot. Tesla is way out of your league anyways. With her beauty (stock) reaching new all time highs and her fame (IV) skyrocketing, perhaps you shouldn't chase. After all [Apple](https://imgur.com/a/bt0mJC6) is still hot right? They are twins and share [similar](https://imgur.com/a/ZaghU7R) features. \n\nApple is consolidating in a pennant. AAPL has declining volume since the September highs confirming bullish consolidation. ADX is low as well as IV. Low IV is when options (calls and puts) are typically cheap, so preferably you want to be on the buy side of option premium. Volume last week was noticeably silent marking some of the lowest traded volume this year. Simply put, AAPL looks just like TSLA two weeks ago, ready to go bigly up or bigly down.\n\nLet me tell you why Tim Apple is most likely polishing his rocket and not his drill. First, declining volume displays bullish consolidation. Second, AAPL has a valid Andrew's Pitchfork with reactions on the median and lower bound, so it has a higher likelihood of reaching the median. Third, the QQQ will print a new all time high. If SPY and IWM have printed a new all time high, whats the likelihood the monster that is Tech (up 36% YTD) would not go past its September high? Already large holdings in the Nasdaq are past the September high. For example, QCOM and particularly GOOGL. If Google can do it, why can't the rest of FANG?\n\n\"I'm scared. There's an autist here spewing shit about demonic triangles and pitchforks. All of a sudden dude starts a creepy cringe tandem about twin girls. This dipshit probably summoned a succubus with his voodoo bullshit, and gave up his soul for this shitpost\"\n\nShrooms are fucking amazing.\n\nBack to the topic. Don't forget Tim Apple and Papa Musk are basically [butt buddies](https://oracleoftime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Elon-Musk-vs-Tim-Cook-2.jpg). When Apple said they were gonna split their stock this summer, who decided to throw his own tendie party weeks later? Now that Tesla is leaving the atmosphere to Mars, do you think Tim Apple will want to miss out?\n\n\"What will be the catalyst?\" Fuck would I know what Tim Apple is cooking. But this voodoo astrology can smell the tendies he's about to serve.\n\n\"But but the rising cases, the winter lock down, the fundament-\" Shut the fuck up. When was the last time fundamentals mattered? You gay bears like it up the ass so much, you fur fags can't shut up. Fuck the news, we'll only crash if JPOW runs out of ink and we have another liquidity crisis.\n\nI can't guarantee AAPL will be as explosive as TSLA. It's already a 2 trillion dollar company. I can't guarantee AAPL will even go up. This post is simply an argument why it is probable it will muun. But with 3 months of consolidation and eerily silent volume, Apple is gearing up for a big move that will move the markets with it.\n\nIf you actually got this far (wtf?), thank you for letting me waste your time. \n \nPositions: Well I'm fucking balls deep in GME, so this is all I could cough up. AAPL 11/27 125C. Will probably go for December/January expirations once I can get another paycheck from Wendy's.\n\nTL;DR: Yall autists clambering about those commie ass EVs being the next Tesla are missing the iRocket Tim Apple is building to join Elon on Mars. Buy calls. Or just do what you want. At the end of the day it's just magic lines right? It's fugazi. It's a whazy. It's a woozie. It's fairy dust.",

When GME first started making its rounds, every post had a target date of January. This target is still good as we will see Black Friday sales as well as GME earnings and Christmas sales as well. There is bound to be a catalyst. Check out options activity for clues. A lot of deep ITM puts \u2013 someone is accumulating GME shares.\n\nEV Gang: Looks like a great run, but I saw multiple WSB commenters arguing that NIO stock was fairly valued because they would be more productive than Tesla in 2032. If you are pricing to perfection for the next 12 years to justify today\u2019s price, then it may be a good idea to take profits.\n\nVale: Dead meme \u2013 last post mentioning this company. However, if WSB is so confident on EVs, it may be better to sell shovels during a gold rush.\n\nPalantir: Wow! Amazing price action! Great numbers on their recent earnings report and institutions are waking up. I don\u2019t see any direct catalysts through December, but we may see sustained demand since large institutions had to compete with a direct listing rather than a traditional IPO. (Soros is in it to win it!)\n\nPG&amp;E: yes, many have all been burned on this one! However, strong buying has commenced, and it looks like we are seeing a run up. A president Biden would bail out California and PG&amp;E.\n\nClang gang: Gonna be a while on this one. Markets are still discounting current prices on future earnings for gold and silver miners. We are going to see a huge increase, but the powers that be are working overtime to keep this down. I am well over 50% return on my GDX, GDXJ, and AG holdings due to CCs. Get paid to wait!\n\nTanker Gang: You held through the darkest night. Now is when demand may finally recover. We are looking really good on STNG, DHT and EURN. Remember that a supercycle works on a multi-year time horizon. I will bet that STNG hits $12 by early next year just because their CEO is a madlad who probably doesn\u2019t want his options to expire worthless.\n\nVix: UVXY is cheap, buy shares and sell CCs in the event that a correction takes a bite out of your meme stocks!!!\n\nGay Bear Gang: FAANGT stocks were the market leaders through the Covid recovery.

Company\u2019s products are beloved by all the losers in your life (i.e. your loser childhood friend who works at McDonald\u2019s and spends all their paycheck towards RH YOLO trades, weed, and video games).\n\nThis is the number one seller of high-performance computer memory, cases, power supplies, coolers and gaming keyboards as well as #2 in performance controllers and streaming gear. Per Andy Paul (CEO) in their most recent earnings call, he reported that most of their product lines maintain a top 3 US market share positions, with several number one positions according to data from NPD group.\n\n\n**So what? Why should I care?**\n\nListen you retard. When there\u2019s unexpected nudity during that HBO show that you watch on Sunday night, you say thank you. You don\u2019t stop and ask, \u201cMan, I thought this show was rated PG. Why is there nudity?\u201d Similarly, when someone tells you about a promising stock that is going to double, triple, and quadruple from the current price point, you fucking listen and continue to read the wisdom documented in this long ass fucking post.\n\nCorsair generates their revenue from two segments.\n\nSegment 1: Gamer/Creator Peripherals.\n\nFor you retards who can\u2019t understand big words like peripherals, this segment includes gaming keyboards, mice, controllers, headsets and other streaming equipment such as capture cards and microphones. And I am not talking about $10 mice or $20 keyboards that your broke ass buy at Staples. These are high margin, high end, top of the line gaming/computer peripherals used by those talent-less hacks streaming live on Twitch, YouTube, OnlyFans, etc for \u201cdonations\u201d. Today, 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming video content on streaming platforms for an average of almost 6 hours per week. There are over 6 million committed streamers in the world today who viewed over 12 billion streaming hours in 2019 alone.\n\nThe revenue in this segment spiked 129% YOY in the most recent quarter to $161.1 million. It made up for 35% of CRSR\u2019s total revenue. This is high fucking margin business, which means Corsair is a winner that rips off those losers mentioned above. Their gross margin was 37.1% in the most recent quarter.\n\nSegment 2: Gaming Components and Systems.\n\nThis segment includes sales of equipment such as computer cases, RAM, cooling solutions, power supply units and pre-built gaming PCs. You know those losers with a big ass gaming desktop PCs with \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b LED lights around the case? Those \ud83e\udd21 s spend shit load of money on these gaming systems because it makes them feel important when they play video games with other losers. The gross margin for this segment is 28%. Not too shabby.\n\nIn the most recent filing, their total revenue increased 60.7% YOY to $457.1 million and the gross margin jumped significantly. Adjusted operating income increased 194% to $61.4 mil.\n\n**Ok. So they rocked this quarter. But what about their future? What is their outlook?**\n\nWell you ungrateful greedy f*ck, CRSR is well positioned to benefit from long term growth trends in the gaming hardware market, making it an ideal play for retards like you who can only ask questions like, \u201cPS5 or the new XBOX? SNE or MSFT?\u201d. No you retard. Those stocks are not gaming pure plays, and they are not fucking cheap. Your broke ass can\u2019t afford them. \n\nCRSR can rely on the gamer and creator peripherals business to drive sustained growth in the future. Why? Because of the fast growing e-sports market. According to some smart ass industry experts, they estimate that the global e-sports market could clock a compound annual growth rate of over 24% thru 2027. That means, the demand for video game streaming equipment and other peripherals is expected to increase in the coming years, adding $2.8 billion worth of incremental revenue over the next four years in this market alone.\n\nCRSR reportedly has 18.3% of the peripherals market today and controls 41.9% of the PC components market. The entire PC gaming hardware market is expected to add $3.6 billion in incremental revenue this year, thanks to all the losers playing games at home due to COVID. The total market size for PC gaming hardware market today is $40 billion, of which 83% was spending from competitive and committed gamers. These are true retards who will spend between $1,000 to over $1,800 on gaming hardware and accessories. \n\n**But the stock ran up quite a bit. Should I wait will it drops?**\n\nThe stock is still cheap. Their POS (Price to Sales) ratio is 1.91. In comparison, Logitech\u2019s POS is at 4.3. Additionally, CRSR is currently priced at 80x trailing earnings and has a forward P/E ratio of 26. Both are favorable compared to their peers.\n\nBecause of COVID, upcoming holidays and other factors/trends that are favorable to Corsair (i.e. anticipated next generation gaming hardware/GPU to be launched by NVDA and AMD), CRSR is expected to generate full year revenue of $1.6 billion this year (which is 45% increase YOY)\n\n- Second Wave COVID: Will force consumers to stay at home and people will need other activities apart from binging Netflix.\n\n- Holiday Retail Sales Outlook is still positive. Gaming products will be boosted by Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas shopping.\n\n- People are upgrading their home PCs. As more people stay at home or work from home, more attention is being paid to the home PC and people are spending $ on upgrades.\n\nThey focus heavily on the higher end of the market, with product focus on performance and innovation. With gaming growing rapidly and big money flowing into this market, demand for performance is increasing. CRSR\u2019s products meet the expectation of what the gamers want (i.e. speed, precision, reliability, great processing power, etc)\n\nAlthough the competitive and committed gamers accounted for 83% of the $40 billion spend in the global market for PC and streaming gears in 2019, that only accounts for 18% of the worldwide total of 524 million PC gamers in 2019 with the remaining being casual gamers, who do not often rely on specialized high end gears yet. (Translation,there is untapped market of 82% among the 524 million PC gamers who have yet discovered the beauty of high end gaming stuff)\n\nIf the average spend of this group of gamers were to significantly move up going forward, then the market will also grow by multiples (for high end gaming stuff). \n\nThis stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers like Logitech and Razor. Not only that, the current P/E ratio of CRSR is roughly 3% below the overall P/E of NASDAQ. Additionally, looking at POS (Price to Sales) and MCS (Market Cap to Sales), CRSR is cheap by discount of 57% and 45% respectively to the NASDAQ. Sales are expected to grow next year by more than 30%.\n\n**Risks**\n\nF*ck risks. F*ck that mindset. This company is already profitable and prints money. If you retards can blindly throw money at losers like GME and NKLA, you can throw money at a company with actual sales, actual products and actual profits.\n\n**Price Target**\n\n$40+ per share by May 2021. You can play the call option or you can just buy the stock.\nEither way, it will get to $40 range and above once this stock\u2019s valuation catches up with the rest of the market. By end of 2021, I expect this stock to be $70-80. Oh, and for you retards who are risk averse, this stock is considered \u201cStay at Home\u201d stocks. It will moon during the pandemic, and it will moon after the pandemic.",

Could someone please explain (with reliable sources) what is happening ?\n\n\"A short squeeze occurs when a stock or other asset jumps sharply higher, forcing traders who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to forestall even greater losses. Their scramble to buy only adds to the upward pressure on the stock's price.\"\n\n\"KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* A short squeeze accelerates a stock's price rise as short-sellers bail out to cut their losses.\n* Contrarian investors try to anticipate a short squeeze and buy stocks that demonstrate a strong short interest.\n* Both short-sellers and contrarians are making risky moves.
