AMD hit ATH of 94.28 on September 1 before pairing back gains with the entire market.\n\nIf you believe in AMD's 3 year plan, getting in at this price may be a good opportunity. The price of AMD hasn't been this lost since July 30 when it broke through the resistance at 60 and then surged to 95 based on big earnings and INTC's poor results.\n\nThe entire market seems volatile because of the recent JPow messaging on 0% interest rates through 2023. Its understandable to be skittish.\n\nBut as a long term hold, I feel confident that AMD will see the 90's again within 1 year, which makes a nice 1 year hold to benefit from capital gains.\n\nThe main risk is the news that broke recently that Sony has cut back production estimates on PS5 due to yield issues with AMD CPUs through manufacturing. We know that AMD uses TSMC to manufacture the chips, but its unclear currently whether this news has widespread impact or what the root cause of the issue was.

        "selftext": " \n\nThe former largest holder of the American bank Wells Fargo &amp; Co, Berkshire Hathaway Inc of mega-investor Warren Buffett, continues to withdraw money from bank shares.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has sold more than 100 million shares, the equivalent of $ 2.5 billion or more than $ 10 billion since June, according to a report published on Friday. As a result, Warren Buffett's company now owns only 3.3% of Wells Fargo's shares.\n\nThe North American bank reported a big loss in the second quarter of this year, with a negative US $ 2.4 billion. Credit losses and provisions were the causes, but the bank is also involved in scandals.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2016, employees used fraud to meet impossible sales targets. They opened millions of accounts in customer names without their knowledge, hired involuntary account holders for credit cards and bill payment programs, created fake personal identification numbers, forged signatures and even secretly transferred customers' money.\n\n## [Short the banks?](https://read.cash/@SamHamou/buffett-sells-100000-bank-shares-and-increases-stake-in-gold-and-coca-cola-a95715de#short-the-banks)\n\nBut it seems that it\u2019s not just financial problems or customer treatment that Warren is withdrawing from his favorite bank.\n\nThe investor reduced its stake in Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, PNC, M&amp;T Bank, Mastercard and Visa. While he bought a slice of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold, despite historic criticism of the precious metal.\n\nHowever, Warren has increased his positions in Apple, Coca-Cola and Bank of America. It is speculated that Warren is predicting that the effects of Covid19 will last longer than Wall Street imagined.\n\n&gt;\u201cAccumulating money and finding gold mining attractive \u2013 suggests that he sees the crisis last longer and perhaps worsen before it gets better. No one knows whether this will be the case, but Buffett has his finger on the pulse of the economy through all the various sectors in which Berkshire operates: from freight railways to aircraft parts, insurance policies to car dealerships, building bricks from households and Fruit of the Loom underwear, Dairy Queen industrial chemicals for fast food, jewelery for private jets and more. \u201d  \nsays Tara Lachapelle, Bloomberg columnist\n\nBuying more gold-related assets makes a lot of sense in times of crisis, but what is the reason for increasing participation in Coca-Cola? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://read.cash/@SamHamou/buffett-sells-100000-bank-shares-and-increases-stake-in-gold-and-coca-cola-a95715de](https://read.cash/@SamHamou/buffett-sells-100000-bank-shares-and-increases-stake-in-gold-and-coca-cola-a95715de)",

If there is more upside than downside and media surrounding the stock is positive I generally buy. If a stock gets close to its target price and the price isn't raised or the industry looks like it is going down, I sell.\n\nEven though a lot of these stocks are good set it and forget stocks, what else can I incorporate into my process that is relatively easy to review - P/E?

Yesterday was our first taste of closing higher than open, and just like Tesla last week this may be your opportunity to get in on this high value company.  \nApple Inc. is expected to show off its latest smartwatch and iPad Tuesday amid an uptick of interest in such devices by weary, homebound users looking for help tracking exercise and logging hours of remote work and learning. The  Cupertino, Calif., tech company will hold its first virtual-only product reveal at  1 p.m. New York time from its headquarters, where past events have attracted enthusiastic crowds of journalists, employees and guests on hand to help hype the latest offerings. Chalk up  Apple's  keynote event to another annual rite changed by the coronavirus pandemic. Instead of Chief Executive  Tim Cook  unveiling the company's latest flagship iPhone as he has done every September since 2012,  Apple  is expected to focus on the new Watch Series 6 and iPad Air.

On September 9th, GEVO showed that they have $81 million in cash on their balance sheet, removing the fear of an offering at least for the time being.\n\nIn September alone this stock dropped nearly 30%.

Photo: Winson Wong\nThe plea came after the Court of Final Appeal on Tuesday threw out the last-ditch bids of 24 Uber drivers who were found guilty of carrying passengers for hire or reward without a hire-car permit, and were fined between HK$3,000 (US$380) and HK$4,500 in 2018.\nThe defeat was a devastating blow to Uber, which has provided millions of trips to residents since arriving in 2014, as well as delivering food orders.\n\u201cWe are extremely disappointed with the court\u2019s decision, and we will continue to support the 24 partners and their families during this challenging time,\u201d Wilder said.\n\nThe senior executive admitted the top court\u2019s ruling, coupled with a lack of regulatory progress on ride-sharing in Hong Kong, had \u201cprofound consequences\u201d for Uber and the 14,000 active drivers who hoped to find flexible earning opportunities during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe know that the single most common reason for becoming a driver-partner is to make up for lost income during the current economic crisis, with the second most important reason being the need to meet ongoing obligations to support their families,\u201d Wilder said.\nFor the second quarter this year, the US-based firm posted a net loss of US$1.8 billion with global revenue dropping 29 per cent year on year to US$2.2 billion.

I will never bet against America because it's the greatest fucking country on earth, but our Euro brethren are fair game. \n\nThe Eurostoxx index have largely traded equally or somewhat better than the SNP thus far. I have taken a short position against the Eurostoxx due to the following reasons:\n\nHard Brexit: Two weeks ago prime minister Johnson introduced a bill that is in direct contradiction to previous agreements. His defense was basically that Europe can go eat shit, no reason needed. Germany is Europe's enforcer, however the COVID pandemic has lead to a dry run of a hard brexit and German exports largely survived. This time around they will be much less likely to fight against a hard Brexit seeing as how it's been in place for the majority of the year in any case.\n\nBanking scandals: Obvious reason. The EU economy is heavily reliant on it's banking sector. This sector is terrible and will continue lower.\n\nCOVID peeking it's ugly head again: The seven day MA of new covid cases are at all time highs in EU countries. I could give a shit about COVID, but our EU brethren are likely to implement another round of lockdowns, much more so than the USA.  American case counts are down but Europe has steadily been ticking higher.\n\nNo tech: No Amazon, no Adobe, no PayPal to save their market.\n\nCurrency: In a time of severely limited economic growth countries cannot afford to let their currencies rally, we've seen this before. I causes severe deflation and weakened financial asset prices.\n\nLack of fiscal stimulus: As usual the EU will be late to the party with further fiscal stimulus.\n\nThe timing seems perfect to open this position and option volatility on FEZ is still low.

        "selftext": " ***$YCBD:*** \n\nOn September 9th, BZ Newswire announced that YCBD would maintain their \u201cbuy\u201d rating and raise the price target from $3 to $4. We played the run back in the second half of July and secured decent profits before earnings. Earnings unfortunately were unimpressive, and resulted in the stock price tumbling down to $1.98 off of highs of $4.20. They had reported earnings of -$.18 cents per share, the first quarter to report negative this year.\n\nThanks to u/Kdbar for his observation and recommending that I take a look, we are now just starting to see indication of the trend reversing. Yesterday, $YCBD ran from $2.05 to a high of $2.41 before settling down at 2.26 at market close. This price action came with no direct news from YCBD, but the CBD industry as a whole moved with the announcement of Martha Stewart CBD &amp; Direct CBD Online, who carries hundreds of the world\u2019s top CBD products on one platform. Could see the beginning of a new swing here, will be looking for an entry this morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Trend Reversal](https://preview.redd.it/fu09anixapn51.png?width=1623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94b0808419ce16789e9bb9971495a7bb841f81b5)\n\n ***$DPW:***\n\nNEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Sept. 17, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  DPW Holdings, Inc.  (NYSE American: DPW) a diversified holding company (\u201cDPW,\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), announced that its power electronics business,  Coolisys Technologies Corp.  (\u201cCoolisys\u201d), is introducing its new industry leading High Density (\u201cHD\u201d) AC/DC power supply/switcher product line targeting the medical, industrial and telecom sectors. This new product series is designed for very high operating efficiency and power density with universal input and built-in active power factor correction (\u201cPFC\u201d). \n\nThe new HD Series is a power switcher product line that can produce a single output of 12VDC, 24VDC, or 48VDC and offers high power in high-density packaging even under natural convection cooling conditions. The new product line features a compact, low profile footprint, and best-in-class performance, optimized for broad industrial, telecommunication and medical applications. Additionally, the ability to operate within a wide temperature range make this new HD Series ideal for commercial off-the-shelf (\u201cCOTS\u201d) implementations for the defense industry.\n\nInterestingly enough, although this news this morning it looks as if people knew about it beforehand. Yesterday it had positive price action closing around +6% on the day. Could be indicating an overall trend reversal, I will be watching this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[50 + 200 MA Crossing](https://preview.redd.it/wj7s8g20bpn51.png?width=1617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efa5b6f5483ad0bfcaa4fad9a5d1982be9bffae2)\n\n ***$GRIL:***\n\nBurleson, Texas, Sept. 16, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Muscle Maker, Inc. (Nasdaq:GRIL) the parent company of Muscle Maker Grill, Healthy Joe's &amp; MMG Burger Bar, a fast-casual concept known for serving \"healthier for you\" meals, today announced that it has signed a lease and a letter of intent to open two new ghost kitchens in the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn in New York City. Upon opening, the company will be operating nine ghost kitchen facilities, covering three major cities within the U.S.  \n\nEach ghost kitchen location will serve all three of the company's food concepts including Muscle Maker Grill, Healthy Joe's and Meal Plans AF. These locations will provide food to customers via 3rd party food delivery applications i.e. DoorDash, GrubHub, Seamless, UberEats, Postmates, ChowNow and Caviar. The Manhattan location is unique in a sense that, while it will operate as a ghost kitchen, its location offers forward facing capabilities for guests. The location is situated in a walk-up food court setting, and once restrictions are lifted in NYC at the end of this month, will give customers not only the opportunity to pick up food for themselves but a place to sit down and eat it as well. We believe this combination will bode well in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan where high end residences are mixed with commercial buildings. The Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan is one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the country with a median age group of 35 and with the ability to serve roughly 3.5 million people within a one-mile radius.\n\nGRIL had a public offering close on September 11th priced at $1.70 per share. This caused the price to fall down to $1.50 before consolidating. After hours yesterday we saw the first signs of upward momentum, and considering the stock is still priced under the offering amount at $1.55, will definitely be looking for a swing entry this morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Still below offering price.](https://preview.redd.it/tpmgox44bpn51.png?width=1627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a43d717234c0a195762646362ece7b5b96dd42ae)\n\n**Never forget to do your own DD; remember: For all you know, all the stocks that I mention here will dip 90% tomorrow; Do your own DD, I'm not some magic fairy.

        "selftext": "I was looking at some options flow from airlines mid last week and realized that it was quite an imbalance between the CALL premiums and PUT premiums. The chart setups were all looking great so I thought about giving them a few more days before taking a look again. I analyzed the flow today and it looks like airlines are gaining some momentum by options traders. Let's do some DD, shall we?\n\nFor the analysis, we only consider five airline symbols and option contract trades with premiums above $25k. \n\nIn order to start our analysis, let us first take a look at the aggregated options flow from the week of **September 8th to September 11th**. Below are the aggregated stats:\n\n[Aggregated Options flow from the week of September 8th to September 11th, 2020](https://preview.redd.it/ccd8ael7reo51.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b48975fc9806276bf0a972ceaaf015cd0d972ca9)\n\nA couple of observations from here. Most airlines had a pretty even flow **except $DAL** which moved quite a bit this week because of the large flow in the September 8th week. But the other airlines had a fairly low options flow.\n\nNow, let, us take a look at this week's option flow which is significantly different.\n\n[Aggregated Options flow from the week of September 14th to September 18th, 2020](https://preview.redd.it/fv57rwz1reo51.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9861fa877c2d52a7026bb0fb01adeda53ba8ad5b)\n\nPretty clear differences here. Although we had one more trading day last week, the premiums and volume is way higher than the week prior to that. There are some stark differences in the call and put flow.\n\n* **$AAL** had some differences in volume but almost the same premiums for both CALLs and PUTs. That has been a consistent pattern. If I want to go long on airlines, I'll stay away from AAL just based on the flow.\n* **$DAL** as usual had a difference of 13 million between CALL and PUT premiums. That is massive. The volume was also 3x.\n* **$JETS** had a way higher volume for CALLs than PUTs. The premiums are also like 4x for CALLs vs PUTs. This is excellent for someone who wants to go long on airlines and JETS right now.\n* Both **$UAL** and **$LUV** were also massive on the CALL volume and markedly low on PUT volume. The same goes for premiums. Things are heating up!\n\nIf you look at the price action of some of the airlines, you can also see bulls taking over for the last few days. Let's do that as well. I will draw a few loose trend lines to show that the airlines have been on a slow bullish run for the past few days and based on the flow, that is expected to continue.\n\n[UAL has a trend line and is right on the 20 MA right now. ](https://preview.redd.it/jxi0bbn5qeo51.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71d644fefda561ef4be2e114fb2633b327d7ce24)\n\n[JETS also has a slightly loose but clear trend line](https://preview.redd.it/s4rzx78bqeo51.png?width=1564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e23556daab17115283677ba02d9a4f266e15d42)\n\n[DAL needs to come down just a bit before it becomes a good bullish setup.](https://preview.redd.it/r6dytcahqeo51.png?width=1559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eda952747457fae46646d30f8c45034952f8e01c)\n\nThat's it from me folks. Hope you like the analysis and will keep an eye on the airlines. Would love to hear everyone's thoughts and hope you folks have a fantastic week ahead.\n\nCheers",
