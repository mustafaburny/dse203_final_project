        "selftext": "I got an email from Robinhood about confirming tax status. \n\nI bought a few shares of #GME and #AMC back in late January. I transferred to Fidelity after about a month because of speculations that Robinhood is a shady company at the time. I then bought more of each stock through Fidelity. I can see through Fidelity of when I bought all my shares of each stock, the first amount of shares through Robinhood, and then the rest that I had bought through Fidelity. I very much intend to pay the appropriate capital gains taxes after I sell during the #MOASS. Do I still need to confirm my tax status with Robinhood, even though that account I started with them this year is closed after I transferred everything?\n\nI\u2019m just a dumb ape who has continued holding his bananas.",
