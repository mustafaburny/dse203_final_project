So I skipped those and continued on the list till I had the top 10 public companies.  Also, the formatting is hard so I just included total results for each period and the total for all 5 periods.  I did not include dividends.  \n\nThis is not perfect, but just for fun.  I based the results on the begining and ending share price.

I'm not going to comment on this is much because it's a much smaller part of their business, and frankly don't know enough about health insurance to comment on this as much as their financial services. I'd rather look like I'm a retard than a bullshitter.\n\nI honestly don't get why they are shorted so much, according to their financial results, their operating income did decline 9% yoy and yoy gaap income decreased 13% yoy, however that was due to the pandemic, and does not reflect their core fundamentals. Excluding revenues from the foreign exchange, travel, e-learning and remittance businesses that were impacted the most by COVID-19, Q1 2021 revenues grew 187% as compared to Q1 2020.They have over $130 million in cash which is almost enough to cover *all* of their $139 million SG&amp;A expenses last year. \n\n**SOURCES**\nQ1 Financial results \nhttps://www.ebix.com/press-release/ebix-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-financial-results\n\nStock fundamentals/ PG&amp;A costs https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ebix/financials\n\nshort interest https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/EBIX.htm\n\nEbix cash website, about us page\nhttps://www.ebixcash.com/aboutus/\n\nSmart Office by Ebix\nhttps://www.ebixcrm.com/smartoffice-for-financial-advisors\n\nRemittences percent of GDP\nhttps://www.compareremit.com/money-transfer-guide/the-nris-contribution-to-the-indian-economy/#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20the%20World%20Bank,around%2022%25%20to%2023%25.\n\nI'm open to any dissenting thoughts, thank you for reading my dd.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the awards!",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following is not financial advice.  I just love Daddy Karp, Daddy Thiel, and the PLTR Stock.\n\nWe all know **Daddy Karp.**  This is him forcing his employees to engage in combat dancing or some shit...right, lets carry on.\n\n[Daddy Alex Karp is a character, PERFECT for the memes.](https://preview.redd.it/agr1i21kjq571.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bf213a80de565ca37a90823e90e60d97c61e95b)\n\n**So why does this matter?**  Because Daddy Karp is a founder and one of two influencial arms of Plantir.  He is the negotiator for one side of american politics.\n\nThis matters because PLTR relies on large govt. contracts and MUST maintain a neutral political position.\n\nIt's other founder is Peter Thiel, or **Daddy Thiel.**  You might say he is a powerful man, and he handles the other side of american politics.\n\n[Thiel is an extremely influential and powerful billionaire contrarian known for playing 3D chess and looking decades out...PLTR is his baby.](https://preview.redd.it/knpdewpcht571.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e83e232d334be4533531385d1ed5fe15e8297495)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why does the govt. buy their software?**\n\nTheir software can take unbelievable amounts of video data, and give predictions on where enemies might attack, and various other events on a battlefield like it's a videogame.  The **CIA** helped them create their technology, and **SOCOM** just renewed a $300M a year contract with them.  These orgs. don't buy anything that doesn't work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This shit looks like it's out of the movies, or a real time strategy game.  It works and it forms the backbone of US military operations.  It also transfers very well to the enterprise software space...](https://preview.redd.it/a3kgc5j2pq571.jpg?width=1555&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9680a8142d5345a5b694a4467cb2af3387e20f4)\n\nThis is just one use case; their engineers have been refining this tech for 17 years where they could create a secret moat.  In-fact, Peter Thiel himself has a book and has given speeches on the power of moats and \"not competing, but forming a monopoly.\"  Zero to One.\n\n**So why all this info?  It's critical to understand the facts I am about to present to you.**\n\nWith a ton of hype, and plenty of meme power, PLTR rose to past $40 a share earlier this year.\n\nMost if not all did not truly understand how special the technology was, and it fell on FUD surrounding stock based compensation and Daddy Karp selling shares.  We will get to this FUD at the end.\n\nW**hy it's special:**\n\n**MOAT:  I see people say, \"it's just data analytics, anyone can compete with them.\" no.**\n\nThis is like people saying, \"it's just an airplane copy it and it should fly great.\"  An analytics platform that is able to \"gameify\" real world problems in real time and present solutions using integrated Ai/ML is a MASSIVE engineering problem.  Think, a ton of PHD level skilled engineers making the highest salaries in Tech.  So much, that they can retire after a few years if they want.  Now imagine them working for 17 years on something before any other company even thinks to start competing.  This is a bigger moat than many darlings of the tech world have in their software, such as TSLA, which had google, apple, etc. working on competing solutions for years.  And it has saved it's clients MILLIONS in Skywise.  For anyone in the software space; you know how brutal implementation is for SAP and similar platforms.  Often it's unsuccessful and expensive.  PLTR is already demonstrating PROFITABLE implementations.  This is a sign of a massive moat for anyone who understands the enterprise software world.\n\n[This is just a summary of one application of PLTR's Skywise platform; built on Foundry.  They are going to do this to every industry; true prescriptive analytics with rapid deployment of a custom solution.  If you understand that, it's insane.  If you don't, ask a friend that is intelligent and knows about software.](https://preview.redd.it/eg2qwmim1r571.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26b9bdc63c34c5ad1b0fab1bfafe473444e34ee6)\n\n**Earnings Expectations:  They are Sandbagging Sons of Bitches**\n\nRight now we are pricing Palantir at about 40X revenue as a SAAS company.  Their margins aren't the best as they continue to invest and maintain future monopoly status, but they are landing $300M govt. deals (SOCOM) and expanding that business which is EXTREMELY STICKY.\n\nTheir revenue growth officially is about 30% per year.\n\nHowever, as all SAAS companies do, internally they have a goal/target of around 50% per year.  That is absolutely achievable, in fact a few large deals can accomplish this, AND MUCH MORE.  I would argue this in itself is sandbagging due to the potential size of their enterprise deals (just ONE big deal would annihilate that number) and they have been offering their product for literally less than a year now...\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[With two Daddy's like this, what could go wrong?  Why is PLTR hated by the media?](https://preview.redd.it/wuid619x4r571.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=998b2feb59674afacc6dad5b7217cbde56e98e0c)\n\n**FUD:  What could go wrong, why has the stock dropped after it's meteoric rise?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **It's custom software! That's expensive, time consuming, hard to scale!  Companies won't buy it.**\n\nSAP is horrible and it's implemented all the time, takes years to implement, costs HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to implement, and is often not successful.  It's actually a running joke in the enterprise software world.  Palantir has a history of successful implementations (it's custom but designed so low-code it can be developed and delivered quickly in any enterprise), a testament to the 17 years that Karp and Thiel spent training their team in high gravity (lul).  **This is like a SMART salesforce, which by the way, was the fastest growing software company IN HISTORY and is worth $400B now, and it has competition in the CRM space.  PLTR is the next evolution, and has ZERO competition.**\n\nSalesforce was created to be a single source of truth in an enterprise. \u00a0Pltr takes that a step further by allowing you to simply plug in business units and allow it to act as your \u201csky net\u201d and tell you what to do. \u00a0It literally is that incredible. \u00a0It\u2019s true mass available prescriptive analytics, sprinkled across an entire company.\n\n**Is it unreasonable to think the mkt cap of pltr could be a multiple of salesforce in the near future when it is the next evolution of data platforms, has no competition, and salesforce previously held the record for fastest growing software company in history?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2.   Daddy Karp made the most of any CEO this year and he sold hundreds of millions of shares!**\n\nThe way he is paid, his Stock granted is income.  So he pays TAXES on it.  That means he has to sell shares just to cover the taxes so he doesn't go to federal prison.  The dude can't pay it any other way he doesn't have hundreds of millions of dollars laying around...he's spent 17 years building this as his baby.  This is all stupid media FUD because it makes awesome headlines and scares the shit out of boomers that aren't used to the financing around an insanely fast growing software company.  The numbers look crazy on the surface but make sense once you realize it's all because of the meteoric rise in the stock price.\n\n**3.  They are compensating their employees with Stock! It Dilutes us!**\n\nThey are hiring the worlds best software engineer PHD Data Scientists to make sure their moat and monopoly doesn't even come close to being encroached on.  These people are expensive.  They continually train their models in their client's environments, without keeping their clients data, only evolving their own model.  This maintains privacy and creates momentum for their algorithm that makes it impossible to catch up to PLTR's Foundry.  Think google with their threatgraph for search.  They have too much data and too much time refining their algorithms for anyone to catch them in that category.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Price Targets:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Holy Fucking Shit, look at that Q1 rev. growth despite being brand new to enterprise...](https://preview.redd.it/rkgyuszcuq571.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14ea1be3ff5dbdbadd731a7ae8a69d94fcabe713)\n\nIf they grow at the internal, non-sandbagged rate they think they will hit **according to internal docs shared with public (google Q4 2020 PLTR business update, can't link).**\n\nThey will have $4B in revenue, in 4 years.  Imagine in 4 years, if a SAAS company was priced at just 10x Revenue with 50% + growth yoy....which will accelerate as proof of concept is demonstrated at large orgs.\n\n**My price target is $80 EOY** because I believe at least one HUGE contract will roll in that will provide further proof of FOUNDRY as a concept and the impact will be undeniable.  Companies will be lining up to get Foundry and projected demand will show implied growth off the charts that no one has accounted for.  The Skywise project finalized my opinion on this, PLTR told them WHEN VALVES IN ENGINES WERE BEHAVING ODDLY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED PRIOR TO FAILURE, OPTIMALLY, TO SAVE MILLIONS A YEAR PER AIRLINE IN SCHEDULING AND OTHER COSTS you can read about that on another subreddit, the info is out there if you do a google search on skywise.\n\n**Price target in 4 years: $500.  1. its Cathy Bae's Number(not for that time period)**, but also because I think revenue growth will be more like salesforce was as a necessary platform to enterprises.  This would give it a larger MKT cap than Salesforce.  **If this becomes a hyped meme to add fueld to the fire, it will accelerate beyond what we can even comprehend, TESLA style.  Just the US GOVT. alone will be TRILLIONS of dollars potentially as they are investing trillions in Ai software solutions over the next 20 years.**   [Forbes GSA Article 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2020/08/16/how-the-us-government-is-using-ai-to-help-procure-trillions-of-dollars-of-products-and-services-an-interview-with-keith-nakasone-gsa/?sh=22a1193670ac)  [2021 Article about AI spending push..$Trillions with PLTR as the clear leader](https://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2021/04/biden-budget-requests-major-investments-federal-technology-and-cybersecurity/173262/)\n\n**if this happens....then.....**\n\n**Possible Price Target with hype and diamond hands TSLA style = $1000** when everyone figures out this Stock is literally magic because it will be bigger than google.  It's data analytics and threat-graph will be more useful to smart money and BIG money than google and it will rule the world.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Conclusion:** Both Daddy's have spent 17 years using the most advanced govt. resources (U.S. DOD spends the most on R&amp;D of any industry or company in the world...by FAR) to craft a secret Ai/ML platform that allows companies and Govts. to play Starcraft in real-life, with WALLHACKS on that tell them what their opponent is going to do, and what they need to do to stay competitive.  They released  at the perfect time by going public when it was ready to scale and unable to be dethroned.\n\n**This software will be mandatory for most large companies just to be competitive.**\n\n**My positions:** 25x 40C 366 DTE, 762 shares at $24.57.  This is my entire account, i've seen enough to be 100% sure I don't need to day or swing trade anymore.  That $11k avail is just margin, i'm out of cash, this is how it displays in the TDA-TOS app.  I'm all in on this.  I actually want more leaps but I only have $26 dollars left in cash so I will buy 1 more share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Based on my positions and an addiction to optionsprofitcalculator.com, I will make millions if the $500 thesis comes true in the next year.  in fact, at this thesis approx. 25 leaps worth $6k right now would make someone a millionaire.  Is that worth the gamble to you?](https://preview.redd.it/5jkde0871r571.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ac3de19f0e926adfe500397910270389bbce4d1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice.  I just love the stock, and I love my Daddy's Karp and Thiel.",

A group of investors, including Palantir, committed to invest a combined $230 million into the Babylon transaction...\n\n...By participating in the PIPE, or private investment in public equity, Palantir is guaranteed ownership of a certain amount of stock once the transaction closes and the shares in the operating company start trading.\n\nWhile many tech companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have large venture groups that back start-ups at various stages, Palantir\u2019s focus on SPACs is unique among strategic investors.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 30, 2021**\n\n*Please Note: Apologies for not sending the Daily Recap out yesterday, I was having technical issues on my end. Thankfully, all the issues were resolved, it's full steam ahead.*\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after hitting record highs for many consecutives days. In short, stocks continue to hover near record highs. Market participants are encouraged a stronger-than-expected gain on private payrolls and tempered inflationary fears. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Q2 earnings season and incoming economic data. \n\nToday, ADP\u2019s June private payroll report showed private payrolls increased faster than expected[.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adp-june-private-payrolls-jobs-market-pandemic-economy-recovery-121542029.html) This underscores the ongoing economic recovery with the US economy reporting its sixth straight monthly increase in employment. Job openings rose by 692,000 versus the 600,000 expected. Consumer confidence has also risen and pointed to Americans' increased propensity to spend, with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index racing to its highest level since February 2020. \n\nDavid Lefkowitz, UBS Global Wealth Management Head of Equities, said \u201cIf you look at what's really been powering the economy and powering the stock market, it's been the fact that there's been so much fiscal stimulus poured into the economy. What's really crucial though is that a lot of that fiscal stimulus has actually not been spent this year. It's sitting on the balance sheets of consumers.\" I totally agree. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. Now that the economy is reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, I expect saving-laden consumers to step out and spend big this summer after enduring social distancing guidelines for more than a year. \n\nToday marks the last trading session of the second quarter of the year, so I thought it would be useful to take a look back at the performance of different assets since March. Year-to-date through Tuesday's close, the S&amp;P 500 has increased 14.3%, the Nasdaq by 12.7% and the Dow by 12%. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a year-to-date peak of 1.77% in March but is on track to end the quarter yielding just under 1.5%. The West Texas intermediate crude oil rebounded by 23% as demand for energy picks up. Digital currencies, on the other hand, had a very difficult quarter, with prices sharply down across the board compared to the beginning of the quarter. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Pending home sales were up 8% in May month-on-month, helping reverse April's 4.4% drop, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. This brought the pending home sales index to 114.7, or the highest reading for the month of May since 2005. \n* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi (DIDI) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company sold 316.8 million shares to raise $4.4 billion, making it one of the largest initial public offerings of a Chinese company in the U.S. since Alibaba's (BABA) $25 billion listing in 2014. Trading began trading at $18, roughly 29% higher than its $14 IPO price, though throughout the session the stock lost most of its IPO gains. \n* General Mills (GIS) said it is raising prices across nearly all its grocery categories by around 7% due to higher costs for ingredients and labor. \n* Ford Motor (F) said it will be forced to cut output across more than a half-dozen U.S. factories in July due to continued pressure from the global shortage in semiconductors.\n* PayPal (PYPL) is intensifying competition with Square (SQ) by launching its own physical card reader to put in stores. While both are undisputed leaders in fin-tech, PYPL has always focused more intensely on peer-to-peer transactions while SQ put more of an emphasis on consumer-to-business transactions.\n* Twitter Inc on Tuesday named Sarah Personette as chief customer officer to oversee the social media platform's global ad sales, global content partnerships and revenue operations. The company has been making a big push to increase revenue lately. \n* **\\*\\*Current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Salesforce (CRM) target raised by Evercore from $290 to $300 at Outperform. Stock currently around $244\n* Crowdstrike (CRWD) target raised by Truist Securities from $250 to $300 at Buy. Stock currently around $252\n* Facebook (FB) target raised by Argus from $385 to $410 at Buy. Stock currently around $349\n* Hess (HESS) target raised by Wells Fargo from $98 to $104 at Overweight. Stock currently around $87.50\n* Paychex (PAYX) target raised by Citigroup from $1095 to $121 at Buy. Stock currently around $107\n* Shopify (SHOP) with two target raises. Stock currently around $1464\n   * Loop Capital from $1400 to $1600 at Buy\n   * Royal Bank of Canada from $1500 to $1700 at Outperform\n* Exxon Mobil (XOM) target raised by Wells Fargo from $67 to $72 at Overweight. Stock currently around $63\n\n\u201cHow long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself?\u201d - Epictetus",

BEST always promotes green logistics solutions by emphasizing plastic reduction at all aspects, reducing carbon emissions in the transportation, and meeting government\u2019s environmental protection requirements. They do this through green packaging, low-carbon transportation, and smart route planning.\n\nBEST Statistics: \n\nMarket Capitalization: $509.48 Million  \nSales: $48.5 Billion  \nEmployees: 6,927  \nBook/Share: 0.74  \nCash/Share: 0.51  \nForward P/E: 4.30  \nRecommendation: 2.80 Buy-to-hold  \nPrice/Share: 0.10 !!!  \nPrice/Book: 1.73 !!!  \nPrice/Cash: 2.49 !!!  \nShares Outstanding: 245.63 million  \nInstitution Owned: 32.50%  \nInsider Owned: 20.54%  \nShares Float: 52.36 million  \nAverage Volume: 3.09 million  \nShort Float: 25.67%  \nBeta: 0.53\n\n The BEST catalyst: (Cryptocurrency in supply chain financing.)\n\n Traditionally, supply chain financing happens in five steps.\n\n1) First, the buyer (typically a manufacturer or distributor) issues a purchase order to a foreign or domestic supplier. \n\n2) The supplier then ships the goods to the buyer and issues an invoice to the buyer. In a supply chain financing arrangement, the buyer then submits approved invoices to a supply chain finance company for processing.\n\n3) The supplier requests discounted payment of its approved invoices from the supply chain finance company. \n\n4) The supply chain finance company sends the discounted payment to the supplier. \n\n5) The buyer pays the supply chain finance company the amount of the approved invoice on the negotiated maturity date.\n\nHowever this has some drawbacks.\n\nSupply chain financing is available to large global manufacturers and distributors and their suppliers. Middle market buyers and their suppliers haven\u2019t been able to take advantage of the benefits of these programs because they are often too small and not as credit-worthy as larger rated companies.\n\nThis method of financing requires the negotiation of a confirmed payment amount between buyer and supplier up front and limits deductions, setoffs, counterclaims against billed invoices that typically occur in trade transactions. However, these constraints must be weighed against longer payment terms by the buyer and quicker receipt of payment by the supplier.\n\nCryptocurrency and digital asset payment will disrupt all of this. Payments will be immediate with smart contracts. This will remove all the inefficiencies of the old financing system. This lesson became evident during the pandemic when supply chains where strained. \n\nThe problem with Memestocks:\n\n Memestocks suffer from survivor bias. For every one person you see post massive gains, there are ten other people that suffered small losses. You never hear from the losers because of embarrasment. People don't like to show their losses or hide their gains. Once a stock has been \"Meme'd\", hedge funs will start buying the stock to increase the price which attracts more investors to the stock. Once the price has been sufficiently inflated, they can simply take their time and short it, bleeding money away from retail investors. Hedge funds always come out the winner. \n\nThis play is the BEST because it is a pure fundamentals play in an disruptive technology industry.",

SmallCap Communications offers fully managed social media programs designed to help public companies reach and connect with an investor audience.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**JBN Partners, LLC, based in South Carolina**, is providing investor relations and corporate financial public relations services for an initial term of six months, for a fee of US$100,000. The contract may be renewed for additional six-month terms by agreement of the parties.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Xigem also announced the cancellation of 200,000 warrants to purchase common shares of the Company, the issuance of which was previously announced\u00a0[on June 2, 2021](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-closes-private-placement-financing-and-issuance-of-stock-options-and-warrants/). Xigem further advises that the Finder Warrants, issued in conjunction with the private placement that was announced on June 2, 2021, were common share purchase warrants.\n\n**And the question is:** why does a small Canadian company that stumbles around 0,3 for a month need a United States PR company? And why do they pay them 3 times more than they pay for PR in Canada?\n\nIn previous press-release here they hired two other PR companies: \n\n[**https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-retains-advisors-for-capital-markets-awareness/**](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-retains-advisors-for-capital-markets-awareness/) \n\n\\- Aktiencheck.de AG of Westerburg, Germany and Messina Consulting of Bremen, Germany - because they are on Frankfurt Stock Exchange; \n\n\\- Proactive Investors - for - quote - \u00abglobal market awareness\u00bb\n\n\\- NOW - Vancouver-based Whoa Is Media Inc., dba SmallCap Communications - because they are on Canadian Stock Exchange; \n\n**- AND - JBN Partners, LLC, based in South Carolina - for what?** \n\nDid they just forget to specify the \"global\" thing this time? They\u2019re supposed to specify such things. Or they\u2019re going to the US market? \n\nToo many questions for such a low volume stock. \n\n**tl;dr:** Xigem Technologies hired new PR companies, and one of them is in the United States. It looks like they\u2019re going to enter the US market or even change or add a new stock exchange (can they do it, like, legally? I'm not really sure). Anyway, they brake 2 weeks of silence with this and still look cheap AF.",

As a grad student who grew up on the lower end of the middle class, I recognize how pumped some fo you must feel and commend everyone's brass balls- it's never easy to make money in a casino as heavily manipulated as the free market that is the USA. But turning to BB: it was never meant to be just some squeeze (although its end result could technically be called that if you really wanted too)- it's a retooling company embedded in a crucial sector to the modern global economy.\n\nAnd so while some of us have become capable of retirement in recent weeks, I want to talk about a name that is on the cusp of a resurrection.\n\n# For BB Holders, it's been tough lately.\n\nMany people have harsh memories of Blackberry: it was on the cusp of bankruptcy as recently as 2015. Revenue growth sunk from $20B at its peak in 2011 (82% hardware sales) to under a $1B in the 2010s; $BB stock sunk from a peak of $146 in 2008 to single digits, thanks to negative cash flows and rapidly declining top line growth.\n\n[Not surprising BB ate shit for so long- this useless Etch-a-Sketch was 82&amp;#37; of their revenue in 2011!](https://preview.redd.it/w7dt7c4bwd371.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80e0a1b70f7bad3078d8bb3d3982d69b1d12f1bb)\n\n[It's been a long, tough run for Blackberry shareholders since they ended hardware production\\/sales. The stock has been largely irrelevant for years, falling from a peak of $146 in May 2008 to single digits \\&lt; $5B market cap. But its transition into a cybersecurity company is only beginning to pay fruit, which I believe the market will catch on to very soon. Times are a-changing!](https://preview.redd.it/f5zqz58dwd371.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=763644f3ae3cc922a25d1e06d7d0a295ae5d5ed9)\n\n# A Rebranded Business for the Digital Economy\n\nLike we've seen with the Chads in Gamestoink, successful companies are the ones willing to renounce their fading legacy businesses and embrace initiatives and industries that sit on the cusp of the digital age. Enter Blackberry. Now we all remember Blackberry's legacy business- the handheld pagers that looked like shit, but only quirky people embraced (POTUS and CEOs used Blackberry pagers over iPhones for the longest of times, until Blackberry discontinued its hardware line).\n\nHowever, the primary focus for Blackberry has never changed. Blackberry was always security-centric, and with the installation of CEO John S. Chen in 2013, Blackberry pivoted towards software- a trend that was always going to happen given Apple's prowess in manufacturing superior smartphones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[John S. Chen's my homie. If you're scared about holding BB bags, just reassure yourself that that chin can hold both yours and his. But seriously, he's an innovator, having been credited with \\\\\"Saving Blackberry\\\\\"- pay attention, his vision doesn't end with subsistence.](https://preview.redd.it/l39tl9rfwd371.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91ee66024cfba9e04ea1566f5690aeb57ecd2497)\n\nBut like Ryan Cohen with Gamestop/Chewy, Blackberry recognized it needed to adapt to survive, and that's exactly what it has done under Chen's stewardship. A glimpse at Blackberry today is far different than the pioneer that once controlled 20%+ of the mobile hardware market.\n\n[Revenues have intuitively followed a similar trajectory as Blackberry's market cap. But the transformation under Chen's leadership so far is tangible: after hardware sales alone accounted for 82&amp;#37; of revenue in 2011, the company made a wide U-turn. After establishing \\(and meeting\\) a goal for fiscal 2020 revenue to top $1B again, hardware has fallen to just \\~3&amp;#37; of sales. Enterprise software \\(44&amp;#37;\\), Licensing &amp; IP \\(31&amp;#37;\\), and Technology Solutions \\(22&amp;#37;\\) now dominate BB's topline as of 2020, cementing its push and admittance to the cybersecurity market.](https://preview.redd.it/u9mg373iwd371.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c8790440834c2d2f933eb88018fa6971d95ce0e)\n\n# So what does Blackberry actually do now?\n\nTo be clear, the only people walking around with Blackberry \"phones\" nowadays are old junkies trying to revive some 2000s nostalgia. Blackberry doesn't make that archaic crap anymore. All you need to remember are three phrases when thinking about the new Blackberry: **enterprise software, licensing IP,** and **technology solutions**.\n\n* **Enterprise software** is one of the fastest growing components of BB's cybersecurity offering. It includes products like the Blackberry Enterprise Mobility Suite, which provides endpoint management and BlackBerry AtHoc, a secure communications platform.\n* **Licensing IP** is the segment responsible for the monetization of the Company\u2019s global patent portfolio as well as the mobility licensing operations, which license the BlackBerry brand and device software to handset vendors.\n* **Technology Solutions** is the business that includes BlackBerry QNX embedded software as well as several emerging businesses such as the BlackBerry Radar fleet management solutions.\n\nExciting Partnerships, Soaring Ambitions\n\n*\\*\\*You should really take a look at some of Blackberry's partnerships in the last 2 years- this is not a company that makes shitty pagers anymore, it's the company that embodies \"digital transformation.\"*\n\nTake a look at some of the companies Blackberry is sleeping with and tell me your smooth gorilla brain doesn't swell:\n\n* **Baidu** has an extensive partnership with BB in its autonomous vehicle unit, dating back to 2018. In January 2018, the two companies announced they would [partner](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) to utilize Blackberry QNX's OS as the backbone of Baidu's autonomous system. Blackberry also agreed to help Baidu integrate smartphone integration software for Chinese connected cars (CarLife), conversational AI (DuerOS), and HD maps. In January 2021, these two [expanded](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) their relationship: Blackberry's QNX Neutrino Real-Time OS is being utilized for all future EV models produced with the EV branch of GAC (Guangzhou Automotive Group, yes the C isn't a typo). Pretty exciting stuff to say the least..\n* **Motional**, which is a Hyundai backed AV startup, [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform) in February 2021 its intentions to use BB's Black Channel communications technology for all of Motional's future AVs. A very integral input for Motional and impressive win for Blackberry, being able to ensure safe data communication exchanges within vehicle safety systems is essential for AVs' successful integration in society... otherwise where is the trust in accepting that ride? Not to mention that Apple (*the Tim Apple*) was chirping around with Hyundai and Kia, talking about making a \"smart car,\" *earlier this year!* I guess all the ape memes about Blackberry being a legitimate competitor to Apple shouldn't be sneezed at by Wall St equity research analysts and BB \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs...\n* **AWS**, yes Amazon Web Services (!), is another credible player lining up with Blackberry. Although not quite as exciting as building actual AVs, the work they do is still essential to ensure this dream can actually be realized. In December 2020, the two Chads [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform) a multi-year partnership to develop BB's IVY platform (Intelligent Vehicle Data, yes the \"Y\" is weird, but makes sense for ape leadership), allowing automakers to read sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from the data both in the vehicle and in the cloud.\n\nTake it from Amazon's new CEO, Andy Jassy himself: *\u201cAWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user\u2019s needs and preferences. Through this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.\u201d*\n\n[These geniuses love Blackberry, starting with their most intelligent, scalable business: AWS! Shouldn't you apes like BB as well?](https://preview.redd.it/ktha1d7nwd371.png?width=1218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892b2415869531f1cf47f9c54b6d6e668c252877)\n\nBut why should I stop there? I'm tired of seeing fear-mongering Wall Street hedge funds, investment bankers, and research analysts attempting to push their positions (BB's primary competitors are IBM, Microsoft, VMware, and Mobile Iron, the former 3 of which are all significantly owned by \"institutions\" - &gt;75%) and allege Blackberry is a dying business that makes crappy hardware.\n\n* **Microsoft** (Yes its rival!) even realizes its budding competitor is crafting innovative solutions, announcing a partnership in [October 2020](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management) for Microsoft Teams! Microsoft plans to integrate Blackberry AtHoc, which will allow organizations on Teams to contact, alert, and account for all members of their group directly through Teams should some calamity transpire. Especially as we witness more cyber attacks (the digital economy's biggest threat will stem from this), it will be an all hands-on-deck effort to safeguard the integrity of our software. BB's partnership with Microsoft (and [ServiceNow](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-athoc-and-servicenow-partner-to-deliver-secure-and-re) for incident response management) not only grounds its strong advance to cybersecurity industry disruption, but its diverse agility to penetrate various sectors, ranging from AV/EV, CRM software, IoT, 5G, and so much more.\n* If the corporate pedigree isn't enough for you, I'll end with the **U.S. Air Force**. No, unlike what bulge bracket banks may lead you to believe, BB's revenue stream is well-diversified, as the USAF [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/the-united-states-air-force-chooses-blackberry-spark-for-secure-productivity) a partnership in September 2020. Blackberry Spark, utilized for UEM and UES, will help the Air Force with their secure productivity needs, enabling virtual work environments whilst ensuring premium security. As we face more threats in the cyber space and continue pivoting towards a \"work-from-home environment\" regardless of the permanent trends form Covid, BB's wide-ranging partnerships, from Fortune 500 tech companies to the U.S. military prove it is an essential cog in the 21st century digital economy. Not to mention consistent ARR is exactly what investors (the suits) should be looking for, so what gives with the nasty financial press?\n\n# Blackberry's Financial Trajectory (Revs, Bottom Line, CF)\n\nWe have to take a look at Blackberry's financials, after all that is what this casino allegedly runs on. Luckily, if we ignore what the \"experts\" in Battery Park are shilling, we'll notice Blackberry is not the capsizing Titanic all the research analysts make it out to be. I'll take you into a deeper dive into the top &amp; bottom line with just the facts and my brilliant takes, and y'all can make your own decision on whether BB stock is seriously a pile of rat shit or an emerging growth stud.\n\n[As you might expect, Blackberry's overall top line consistently declined until roughly 2020+ \\(when every single one of these dope partnerships was announced\\). As BB wound down its legacy hardware, handset, and related service products, sales declined nearly $400M over the course of final two years, a marked decline from the near $20B struck in 2011. This trend seems to be on the reverse though: the new partnerships in 2020\\/21 have certainly underscored BB's transition into a software company, a trend even Wall St has had to acknowledge by lifting growth targets for fiscal year 2021. IMO, the $1.2B projected top line figure for '21 is conservative, and I think these figures could start to double, triple, and \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 in 2024+. Let me explain why with more charts:](https://preview.redd.it/3pq5gyspwd371.png?width=874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1a643492be05c1ec2f4830bd0b66b180276b6b3)\n\n[All those dope corporate and military partnerships I highlighted earlier? They mainly fit into BB's Enterprise software\\/services revenue stream, which is now 44&amp;#37; of overall revenue. This is the first component that I believe is going to drive revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and tendies for us and BB in the years to come. We'll first notice that growth in this space really picked up in 2020 for BB, similarly to when their overall topline reversed trend- because this is the soul of 2021 Blackberry! And no, this doesn't even really include the innovative AV\\/EV partnerships, these are just institutional clients like Microsoft, ServiceNow, or Salesforce who want to buy one of Blackberry's SaaS established offerings. Think of the potential addressable market in the years to come: work from home, AI, 5G, IoT, we can keep going- all of these things need to be protected, without security, there is no system- every software, hardware, and appliance company under the sun is going to be lining up because they have no choice. You are adapt or go extinct. I expect BB to continue driving this aspect of its growth in a gargantuan way: think 25-50&amp;#37; growth YoY.](https://preview.redd.it/m106ixxswd371.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59e12724037bc3b9f099ab2859bea4b6608f00ee)\n\n[If Enterprise Software is to be Blackberry's Patrick Mahomes, Technology Solutions will be Blackberry's Tom Brady. Since 2017, this aspect has doubled as a portion of overall BB revenue, from roughly 10&amp;#37; in '17 to over 22&amp;#37; projected in '21, reflecting BB's successful ongoing foray into innovative technologies. In this segment we see BB's partnerships with Motion\\/Baidu reflected, cutting-edge technology projects that will enable unfathomable innovations in the future. We could say autonomous vehicles, or drones or anything that will be automated- they will all need to be securitized, whether with each other or on the cloud. BB's deep partnerships with global leaders like Baidu indicate John Chen has been playing 4D Chess since 2013: intensive capital expenditures to transform a company's creative intelligence don't just happen with the snap of your fingers. Put simply, you don't just go from making pagers to making AVs overnight- it's a lengthy process that will affect your growth\\/profitability, as evidenced by Blackberry's fall from grace. But if my instincts are right, Enterprise Software and Technology Solutions will drive BB's revenue growth\\/profitability, propelling it back to $100B market cap in the not-so-distant future.](https://preview.redd.it/1h96psxuwd371.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=595d7f66d80d079394875a718984ee589b593bcc)\n\n[BB earns a decent amount of revenue from Licensing\\/IP, which is quite frankly a pleasant surprise to me. Essentially this component comprises BB's monetization of its global patent portfolio and licensing operations, which do things like license the Blackberry brand\\/device software to various vendors \\(a lot of handset\\). It is somewhat impressive that it's currently 31&amp;#37; of BB's top line, but then again not too surprising. Considering the Enterprise Software\\/Technology Solutions streams are at really nascent stages of growth, it makes sense that this more \\\\\"legacy\\\\\" revenue stream is so prominent. But then again, this component jumped over 20&amp;#37; in 2020 \\(what seems to be BB's turning point\\), so it's not like I'm going to argue with more revenue either. I'd say this the Matt Stafford component of BB: a reliable and solid contributor, but not something I would be betting the bank on either. But if it produces \\(which is certainly not out of the question\\), I won't complain either \\(unless I'm from Detroit\\).](https://preview.redd.it/fx1ebhmxwd371.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06730b56ca47298cd1347a8c090542c1e90eae96)\n\n[I think we've established hardware\\/handsets are a legacy business for Blackberry. Why do I talk about it? B\\/c Wall Street does, and WSB often falls prey to their fear-mongering. DON'T PAY ATTENTION. It's like Mitch Trubisky- yeah that ish was dope in 2015-2016, but we all know it's washed now and the only reason we keep talking about is because shillers want to use it to keep diverting from the real gold.](https://preview.redd.it/j0fszgu0xd371.png?width=896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4b2250478ab2cb6ad49956d4b2f4f89560fc56c)\n\n[I'm not going to hammer earnings to crazy... to actually say with strong conviction that you can accurately forecast that out YoY is bullshit, and anyone from Wall St telling you they can is likely doing the same thing. Never the less, we see a clear trend: great profitability growth when Blackberry pagers led the mobile handset market, awful declines from 2012-2018 as BB closed hardware operations and invested in software\\/cybersecurity ambitions, culminating in the mixed bag we've been seeing in 2018 and beyond. Wouldn't be surprised to see this earnings churn to continue until \\~2023-2025, after all, you have to invest\\/incur losses if you want long-term profitability. I'm going to stay watching the 3 primary components of BB's revenue growth for now.](https://preview.redd.it/voaefw43xd371.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71f9cc1c63d585f57e3b88e20803c7f0f3ab4d79)\n\n[I care about Cash Flow far more than net income. Yeah, it's nice to look profitable, but how much money is actually coming in to your company? We see... a slow pick-up after 2020 \\(\\*pinch me\\*\\), when BB's resurrection appears to have started. Even in its legacy days, Blackberry was seeing hella cash leave the company, which just underscores software is a more profitable business than hardware. 2021 projections indicate Cash Flow could increase at the largest YoY rate in Blackberry's history \\(albeit from it's near-zero base\\). Nevertheless, if revenue growth booms like I think it will, FCF metrics are gunna look pretty green in 2022+.](https://preview.redd.it/ja112d95xd371.png?width=1234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d56e1feaa214463cd5b3b518e9b1c6171368f65b)\n\n# My Strongest Convictions on BB\n\nWell apes, thanks for enduring my BB nut. Now time for you to swallow:\n\n* I don't believe BB is \"just a meme.\" To the tards that made fuckloads of money on BBBY, KOSS, SNDL, and even AMC (not GME, PM me if you want to debate what I would call GME) to an extent in these \"not-exactly-the-future\" businesses with high amounts of short interest- kudos to you, here's your \ud83d\udc51, King. But the tough truth is I'm skeptical that \"squeezing\" is always going to work. For starters, you think the hedgies are really that fucking stupid? I mean, come on, Chancellor/Emperor Ken Griffin had to extend Melvin $5B in credit, lather up Vlad, and testify in front of Congress. Don't exactly think continuous losses and Congressional subpoenas are exactly what the hedgies want either... I'm sure their risk management committee have been popping Addies daily since January to make sure they aren't overfuckingextended in one bet. \\*Cough\\* \\*Bill Hwang\\* Cough\\*\n* No, I truly believe Blackberry Ltd is the 2016 version of AMD in the 2021 cybersecurity market. Back then, AMD's legacy business was flailing, and the entire chip market was dominated by Intel. They went into the changing room, made themselves up, and reorganized. Capturing 1%, then 2%, then 3% of the market share seems so little nominally, but means so much for the top line, bottom line, and the share price when you go from 0 to 1. 1 to 10 may seem like a big jump, but it's launching from the ground (a baseline of 0) that is most lucrative- and that is *exactly where Blackberry (BB) sits right now*. Capturing 2% of the global cybersecurity market would send BB flying, and we'd be soaring back to $140. If BB is actually as innovative as I think, who knows?\n* Unfortunately, if you think this is a short squeeze, I'm sorry, get out. I actually kinda like seeing closes like today (plummeting down 15%), because we shake out the weak hands and I can buy more cheap shares. No one's forcing you to buy this stock, I just like it. Facts &amp; numbers don't lie either. Short interest is 9% on roughly 500M shares outstanding, so we would likely need Jay Powell, Cathie Wood, Elon, and Chamath to hop in if there was actually to be a \"squeeze\" overnight.\n* But to contradict myself somewhat, I also think June 2021 (right now) could be one of the most preferential entry points into BB ever. Data indicates 40% of the shares are owned by institutions (similar numbers to GME), indicating 60% is retail, many of them apes. The suits may scream \"overvalued reeeee,\" and they have a point, BB stock isn't exactly cheap. As it trades at roughly 8X forward sales, BB is valued as a fast growing company, but not beyond the likes of PLTR &amp; SNOW (yes different industries, but valuations that are multiple times higher) or competitors like Palo Alto Networks or Cisco. As a graduate student attempting to be not completely rarted with my limited capital, I love the risk-reward for BB, especially considering they report earnings on June 22. I suspect these numbers will come in far stronger than the St is saying, and at least they will start to lift future guidance in a significant way (both catalysts for a 50-100% move in BB IMHO). I guess we'll see how the financials reward BB's transition, but I am truly convinced this is the AMD of cybersecurity.\n* This last part is a mixed-bag (but suspicious if we dive deeper), and I'm sure a lot of apes will downvote me and possibly completely avoid BB with this knowledge, but I want to share facts since they are evidently so hard to find. We got the usual mutual funds (Vanguard, Fidelity, TD, etc) who own BB (roughly 25%) and two woke funds who invest in \"innovative trends\" own the other 15%. But data does indicate nasty little Ken (Citadel) reported buying 1.3M shares of BB in Q1. BB was heavily shorted pre-GME (like 30%+), and Citadel/gey bears almost definitely bought shares to cover. The question I'm wondering was did Citadel actually buy BB b/c they were so worried about a squeeze since it is a legitimate growth stock or b/c he shares my sentiments about its turnaround? Regardless, both seem like positive catalysts for the stock, and hopefully Ken answers my question.... oh wait...\n\n[Self-explanatory.](https://preview.redd.it/w33d8rdaxd371.png?width=1886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab406b459250bc6669c79e67c65c145f9b879709)\n\nObligatiory: BB to the moon.",

        "selftext": "Market perspective through charts and commentary I've listened to/read recently.\n\nWas out of town last week so missed putting together an update there; this is a short one.\n\n##Has Covid Pulled Forward our General Desensitization?\n\nIn the past months we\u2019ve had some rather abnormal revelations (seems a strong word\u2026): from ramped-up UFO discussion in anticipation of a forthcoming Pentagon report to cyber attacks on a pipeline and meet supplier to a shift in perception regarding the Wuhan Lab Leak theory\u2026 yet public reaction has seemed\u2026 apathetic.   \n\nA recent episode of Josh Brown\u2019s compound show touched on this (at least the cyber attacks). Sure, there has been some general shock and media attention, but maybe not as much as should be warranted? Has it just been too much lately without enough time to process? Or are we as a society just generally over it now? \n\nPerhaps the Have we just become so desensitized to ridiculousness over the last year (arguably 5 years\u2026) that nothing is really that shocking anymore? Or maybe none of this has really affected our daily lives in a meaningful way (yet) and so we\u2019ve quickly moved on to process the more pressing things at hand.\n\n##Inflation\n\nBond markets, despite media furor earlier this year suggesting the concurrent jump in yields was due to inflation, have yet to price in any expectations of it long-term. While inflation data has come in hot the last two months, a composed review suggests it\u2019s not all doom and gloom, at least for now. Following our latest surprise in CPI data (and leading up to it), US10Y yields dropped, possibly a further unwinding of shorts built up during the runup earlier this year but certainly suggesting bonds aren\u2019t paying much attention to this data at the moment.\n\nWho are we to believe? The bond market? The data? The Fed? None? Perhaps the noisiness in the data e.g. base effects, supply chain woes, requires more time for things to recover before we can make any conclusions.By then it may be too late, but why spoil the good time now?\n\n[TNX 1y](https://imgur.com/gecj9QW)\n\nOn to the charts...\n\n#Charts\n\n[Sector Compare, 1y](https://imgur.com/tZn1Pf8)  \n\n[Sector Compare, YTD](https://imgur.com/qBhhTue)  \n\n\nSector-wise, financials have been lagging recently while tech and more specifically unprofitable growth stocks have ticked up recently. As we discussed earlier, bond yields have been giving ground again and this could be a correlated move.\n\n[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/vLj7V82)\n\n[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/7lB7RC7)\n\n[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/iwbN8Ny)\n\n- SPY has managed to break above (barely) it\u2019s recent range; with the recent stability in the face of surprising data and no real catalysts until August / Q3, conditions seem good for a melt-up in the short term.\n- QQQ has broken above the 336 mark that I previously felt was upside resistance and a constraint on any buying; like the SPY I think conidiations are generally conducive to a melt-up in the short term.\n- IWM touched the top end of its range, but failed to push through to new highs. This may pick back up, but given IWM has led this recent rally to the top end of our ranges it could be a warning sign that this is a short-lived bull run.\n- Overall I think indicators are generally bullish, and without a real catalyst until August/Q3 data at least, it\u2019s hard not to be bullish and expect something of a melt-up. Still, I don\u2019t expect much upside remaining and the danger of downside is growing; I\u2019d be long but looking to pare down positions and/or hedge. \n\n####What I\u2019ve Been Reading\n\n[Gideon Lewis-Kraus (The New Yorker) - How the Pentagon Started Taking U.F.O.s Seriously](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/10/how-the-pentagon-started-taking-ufos-seriously)\n\n##Bonus Charts\n\n[CRM 1y](https://imgur.com/ctJ8QqY)\n\nCRM broke above this downtrend on their last earnings report, and since has stayed above. RSI and momentum have been building here, and there\u2019s a possibility this breaks upward as long as market conditions remain generally conducive to a bullish posture. \n\n\n####Previous\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nolej2/market_perspective_recent_trends_and_performance/](Market Perspective: Recent Trends and Performance in Charts)\n\n[Market Review: A look at recent trends, performance, and some assumptions on where we go from here](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njdxao/market_review_a_look_at_recent_trends_performance/)",

I'd rather look like I'm an idiot than a bullshitter.\n\nI honestly don't get why they are shorted so much, according to their financial results, their operating income did decline 9% yoy and yoy gaap income decreased 13% yoy, however that was due to the pandemic, and does not reflect their core fundamentals. Excluding revenues from the foreign exchange, travel, e-learning and remittance businesses that were impacted the most by COVID-19, Q1 2021 revenues grew 187% as compared to Q1 2020.They have over $130 million in cash which is almost enough to cover *all* of their $139 million SG&amp;A expenses last year. \n\n**SOURCES**\nQ1 Financial results \nhttps://www.ebix.com/press-release/ebix-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-financial-results\n\nStock fundamentals/ PG&amp;A costs https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ebix/financials\n\nshort interest https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/EBIX.htm\n\nEbix cash website, about us page\nhttps://www.ebixcash.com/aboutus/\n\nSmart Office by Ebix\nhttps://www.ebixcrm.com/smartoffice-for-financial-advisors\n\nRemittences percent of GDP\nhttps://www.compareremit.com/money-transfer-guide/the-nris-contribution-to-the-indian-economy/#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20the%20World%20Bank,around%2022%25%20to%2023%25.\n\nI'm open to any dissenting thoughts, thank you for reading my dd.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the awards!",

        "selftext": "If you don't know, now you know. Zuora is in the business of subscription software which launches other business into subscription business and manages this business. Business = money. Subscriptions = more money. Basically we're talking about a company which makes money exponentially year on year.\n\nThis year is no different. Zuora is lighting up all it's boxes in Q1, finishing above expectation.\n\nThe Founder/CEO Tien Tzou is one of the Salesforce OG's - having been the chief strategy officer needless to say the guy knows his way around the cloud software business.\n\nSo you've got the foundations, 12.5% of the stock is owned by insiders. Free cash flow is up $6mil on previous quarter. High value contracts are up 5%. Retention is up and research spending costs are down as are operating costs and those gains have been aggressively plugged into the marketing spending.\n\nNow you've read some numbers, you see it's growing and they're investing in growth.. you're ready to buy.. but as usual with a WSD DD you've missed the boat. It's too late, the stocks already popped... but not today!\n\nToday, you are ahead of the game. Institutions have been quietly accumulating positions since Q1 but the volume is low, it's picking up but we're still *probably* 2-3 weeks before the numbers start cranking up for real and it's like clockwork with Zuora. 1 pop per quarter and this time you're here before the market has woken up!\n\nSome you forgot but this is what real business with high ceilings look like.   There's a nice opportunity for a short term bump around the corner but the game is long and strong on this one. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa",

        "selftext": "CBDX:CSE  \n\n\nChances are, as an investor, you weren't actively looking for a health and wellness products conglomerate that encompasses hemp CBD, Psychedelics and Plant Protein. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Yahoo Finance](https://preview.redd.it/3gb12ou94v371.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c6e86d62c89fcf05649bf90c84e2d5fbf8f4555)\n\nIt's becoming clear that you probably should. Let's get the boilerplate out of the way: [**Canbud**](https://canbudcorp.com/) Distribution Corporation ([**CSE: CBDX**](https://thecse.com/en/listings/life-sciences/canbud-distribution-corporation)**)** (the \"**Corporation**\"); \"is a science company focused on the cannabis and hemp sectors. Currently, the Corporation, through its subsidiaries, holds three industrial hemp licenses and a sales license to supply the markets with medically focused products. In addition, the Corporation is also exploring opportunities within the medical   psychedelics markets. Through the Corporation's wholly-owned subsidiary [Empathy Plant Co](https://www.empathyplantco.com/)., the Corporation is also involved in developing plant-based wellness products.\"  \n\nProducts will include (in biodegradable packaging) Complete (Hemp-Based) Plant Protein and recently announced Vegan Multivitamins and Vegan Protein Bars. S the forecast chart to the correct details, Vegan lifestyle and products are here to stay and grow impressively over the next decade.  \n\n\n Jumping ahead a bit here, but necessary to note that CBDX is steered under the experienced hand of Steve Singh, a highly successful entrepreneur with multiple successes over the past 35 years. Steve has developed a method of finding high potential companies in different sectors and creating opportunities for these companies to build significant shareholder value. The rest of the team is no less impressive and has the provenance to add CBDX to their respective 'WIN'columns.\n\nGo ahead; have a look at [**the team**](https://canbudcorp.com/our-team/), and you'll undoubtedly agree.  \n\n\nMagic Mushrooms, 'Shrooms or Psilocybin.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lt49kfm05v371.png?width=225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64314d9f340ea47bb8a38b7123b57c42da4c1492\n\nRelatively new (mushroom hallucinogenics isolated in 1957) research has continued apace and has shown promising efficacy in several mental disorders. Derivations are found in about 100 species of mushrooms. \n\n   \n**From John Hopkins:** ***\"****In a small study of adults with major depression, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers report that two doses of the psychedelic substance psilocybin, given with supportive psychotherapy, produced rapid and large reductions in depressive symptoms, with most participants showing improvement and half of study participants*    \n\n\n Do not dismiss this area of research. More data is needed, but the initial findings show that 2 doses produced depression symptom reduction, with some subjects achieving complete remission for a month. The ultimate goal is to use natural compounds and get people off of synthetic drug compounds. Canbud's progress in the psychedelic vertical is impressive:\n\n* LOI with Molecular Science Corp (R&amp;D, Testing and Importation.\n* It Will be critical to Canbud's import of commercial products from Jamaica operation (more below)\n* MSC is obtaining approval from Health Canada for the testing of controlled substances, including psychedelic compounds.\n* MSC holds an Analytical Testing Licence for Cannabis and Drug Establishment Licence (DEL).  \n\n\n **Why Jamaica?** \n\n**Canbud** has established a significant physical footprint in psychedelics permissible Jamaica. In addition, CANBUS is at the forefront of psilocybin micro-dosing development. The Company is in the process of discussing an off-take agreement to supply psilocybin extract for R&amp;D purposes. On the functional mushroom front, CANBUS is developing immune and nootropic cognitive enhancement products. \n\nCANBUS has positioned itself as a critical early mover within this fast-growing industry. Jamaica's acceptance of psychedelics has caused what might be called a 'Shroom' rush, and companies set up medical and recreational retreats, production and eventually export.\n\n[**Empathy**](https://www.empathyplantco.com/) **Plant Co; Wholly Owned Subsidiary. The Vegans are here.**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1t3vzo8s4v371.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf9c68cb31daeec53482a30bef6304e077165185\n\nPlant-based foods are a huge US market across various product groups, rising 7% in 2020 to $7b. In addition, the products found their way into 57% of US homes, up 4% over 2019. Globally, by 2027 the market is forecast to exceed $30b.    \n\n\n The runway for growth is vast, with only 1/3 of Canadians following an animal reduced diet. It appears we now know 'Who Likes a Good Steak?' Apparently less every year.\n\nEmpathy is continually expanding its product line and has hired a top salesforce to raise market share.\n\n'*Empathy Plant Co.'s Complete Plant Protein are plant-based, a blend of pea and hemp protein, have no artificial colouring or flavours, are non-GMO, gluten-free, soy-free and especially free of any chalk-like taste. In addition, to further position the brand firmly in the market, all Empathy Plant Co. CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) offerings will showcase 100% compostable packaging.*  (CBDX 04/14/2021 PR)   \n\n\n \n\n**CBD Health Market.**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lcu4oqgd5v371.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ef75abbde94ebd2494867e3b23b1ceaee963770\n\nMarket projected to hit double the size of the plant-based market at a 2027 projected size of $123.2b. Canbud's initial products will be:\n\n* Extracts for drinks, edibles, cosmetics\n* In-House Brands\n* Co-branding with 3rd party CBD brands.  \n\n\nThis market is massive, and room for lots of products and therapies. Purity will be the significant aspect sought by consumers, and as has been shown in other areas, consumers will pay a reasonable premium for the best products.\n\nThe other area, which is very exciting is Canbud's work in Cloning through DNA strains. These DNA markers coupled with breeding could create game-changing high CBD and other cannabinoid-like CBG and CBN plants with \"infertile\" traits (cannot be pollinated). \n\nCBG has been tested at McMaster university to break bacteria resistance which would solve enormous billion-dollar superbugs challenges (in hospital, in food packaging, in anti-biotic resistant drug treatment).\n\nTo see the benefits/differences/similarities, check out this [**video**](https://www.labroots.com/trending/cannabis-sciences/18030/difference-cbd-cbg)**.** \n\nIt is hard to see an area CBDX is developing that doesn't exhibit massive growth potential. Initially, people used CBD because it was trendy and impressed their friends. However, through research and testing that is only increasing, a conclusion can be reached. It works on a myriad of conditions.\n\nThe CBDX story, which has only been touched on here, has pretty impressive legs.

BEST always promotes green logistics solutions by emphasizing plastic reduction at all aspects, reducing carbon emissions in the transportation, and meeting government\u2019s environmental protection requirements. They do this through green packaging, low-carbon transportation, and smart route planning.\n\nBEST Statistics: \n\nMarket Capitalization: $509.48 Million  \nSales: $48.5 Billion  \nEmployees: 6,927  \nBook/Share: 0.74  \nCash/Share: 0.51  \nForward P/E: 4.30  \nRecommendation: 2.80 Buy-to-hold  \nPrice/Share: 0.10 !!!  \nPrice/Book: 1.73 !!!  \nPrice/Cash: 2.49 !!!  \nShares Outstanding: 245.63 million  \nInstitution Owned: 32.50%  \nInsider Owned: 20.54%  \nShares Float: 52.36 million  \nAverage Volume: 3.09 million  \nShort Float: 25.67%  \nBeta: 0.53\n\n The BEST catalyst: (Cryptocurrency in supply chain financing.)\n\n Traditionally, supply chain financing happens in five steps.\n\n1) First, the buyer (typically a manufacturer or distributor) issues a purchase order to a foreign or domestic supplier. \n\n2) The supplier then ships the goods to the buyer and issues an invoice to the buyer. In a supply chain financing arrangement, the buyer then submits approved invoices to a supply chain finance company for processing.\n\n3) The supplier requests discounted payment of its approved invoices from the supply chain finance company. \n\n4) The supply chain finance company sends the discounted payment to the supplier. \n\n5) The buyer pays the supply chain finance company the amount of the approved invoice on the negotiated maturity date.\n\nHowever this has some drawbacks.\n\nSupply chain financing is available to large global manufacturers and distributors and their suppliers. Middle market buyers and their suppliers haven\u2019t been able to take advantage of the benefits of these programs because they are often too small and not as credit-worthy as larger rated companies.\n\nThis method of financing requires the negotiation of a confirmed payment amount between buyer and supplier up front and limits deductions, setoffs, counterclaims against billed invoices that typically occur in trade transactions. However, these constraints must be weighed against longer payment terms by the buyer and quicker receipt of payment by the supplier.\n\nCryptocurrency and digital asset payment will disrupt all of this. Payments will be immediate with smart contracts. This will remove all the inneficiencies of the old financing system. This lesson became evident during the pandemic when supply chains where strained. \n\nThe problem with Memestocks:\n\n Memestocks suffer from survivor bias. For every one person you see post massive gains, there are ten other people that suffered small losses. You never hear from the losers because of embarrasment. People don't like to show their losses or hide their gains. Once a stock has been \"Meme'd\", hedge funs will start buying the stock to increase the price which attracts more investors to the stock. Once the price has been sufficiently inflated, they can simply take their time and short it, bleeding money away from retail investors. Hedge funds always come out the winner. \n\nThis play is the BEST because it is a pure fundamentals play in an disruptive technology industry.",

BEST always promotes green logistics solutions by emphasizing plastic reduction at all aspects, reducing carbon emissions in the transportation, and meeting government\u2019s environmental protection requirements. They do this through green packaging, low-carbon transportation, and smart route planning.\n\nBEST Statistics: \n\nMarket Capitalization: $509.48 Million  \nSales: $48.5 Billion  \nEmployees: 6,927  \nBook/Share: 0.74  \nCash/Share: 0.51  \nForward P/E: 4.30  \nRecommendation: 2.80 Buy-to-hold  \nPrice/Share: 0.10 !!!  \nPrice/Book: 1.73 !!!  \nPrice/Cash: 2.49 !!!  \nShares Outstanding: 245.63 million  \nInstitution Owned: 32.50%  \nInsider Owned: 20.54%  \nShares Float: 52.36 million  \nAverage Volume: 3.09 million  \nShort Float: 25.67%  \nBeta: 0.53\n\n The BEST catalyst: (Cryptocurrency in supply chain financing.)\n\n Traditionally, supply chain financing happens in five steps.\n\n1) First, the buyer (typically a manufacturer or distributor) issues a purchase order to a foreign or domestic supplier. \n\n2) The supplier then ships the goods to the buyer and issues an invoice to the buyer. In a supply chain financing arrangement, the buyer then submits approved invoices to a supply chain finance company for processing.\n\n3) The supplier requests discounted payment of its approved invoices from the supply chain finance company. \n\n4) The supply chain finance company sends the discounted payment to the supplier. \n\n5) The buyer pays the supply chain finance company the amount of the approved invoice on the negotiated maturity date.\n\nHowever this has some drawbacks.\n\nSupply chain financing is available to large global manufacturers and distributors and their suppliers. Middle market buyers and their suppliers haven\u2019t been able to take advantage of the benefits of these programs because they are often too small and not as credit-worthy as larger rated companies.\n\nThis method of financing requires the negotiation of a confirmed payment amount between buyer and supplier up front and limits deductions, setoffs, counterclaims against billed invoices that typically occur in trade transactions. However, these constraints must be weighed against longer payment terms by the buyer and quicker receipt of payment by the supplier.\n\nCryptocurrency and digital asset payment will disrupt all of this. Payments will be immediate with smart contracts. This will remove all the inefficiencies of the old financing system. This lesson became evident during the pandemic when supply chains where strained. \n\nThe problem with Memestocks:\n\n Memestocks suffer from survivor bias. For every one person you see post massive gains, there are ten other people that suffered small losses. You never hear from the losers because of embarrasment. People don't like to show their losses or hide their gains. Once a stock has been \"Meme'd\", hedge funs will start buying the stock to increase the price which attracts more investors to the stock. Once the price has been sufficiently inflated, they can simply take their time and short it, bleeding money away from retail investors. Hedge funds always come out the winner. \n\nThis play is the BEST because it is a pure fundamentals play in an disruptive technology industry.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 30, 2021**\n\n*Please Note: Apologies for not sending the Daily Recap out yesterday, I was having technical issues on my end. Thankfully, all the issues were resolved, its full steam ahead.*\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after hitting record highs for many consecutives days. In short, stocks continue to hover near record highs. Market participants are encouraged a stronger-than-expected gain on private payrolls and tempered inflationary fears. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Q2 earnings season and incoming economic data. \n\nToday, ADP\u2019s June private payroll report showed private payrolls increased faster than expected[.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adp-june-private-payrolls-jobs-market-pandemic-economy-recovery-121542029.html) This underscores the ongoing economic recovery with the US economy reporting its sixth straight monthly increase in employment. Job openings rose by 692,000 versus the 600,000 expected. Consumer confidence has also risen and pointed to Americans' increased propensity to spend, with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index racing to its highest level since February 2020. \n\nDavid Lefkowitz, UBS Global Wealth Management Head of Equities, said \u201cIf you look at what's really been powering the economy and powering the stock market, it's been the fact that there's been so much fiscal stimulus poured into the economy. What's really crucial though is that a lot of that fiscal stimulus has actually not been spent this year. It's sitting on the balance sheets of consumers.\" I totally agree. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. Now that the economy is reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, I expect saving-laden consumers to step out and spend big this summer after enduring social distancing guidelines for more than a year. \n\nToday marks the last trading session of the second quarter of the year, so I thought it would be useful to take a look back at the performance of different assets since March. Year-to-date through Tuesday's close, the S&amp;P 500 has increased 14.3%, the Nasdaq by 12.7% and the Dow by 12%. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a year-to-date peak of 1.77% in March but is on track to end the quarter yielding just under 1.5%. The West Texas intermediate crude oil rebounded by 23% as demand for energy picks up. Digital currencies, on the other hand, had a very difficult quarter, with prices sharply down across the board compared to the beginning of the quarter. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Pending home sales were up 8% in May month-on-month, helping reverse April's 4.4% drop, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. This brought the pending home sales index to 114.7, or the highest reading for the month of May since 2005. \n* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi (DIDI) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company sold 316.8 million shares to raise $4.4 billion, making it one of the largest initial public offerings of a Chinese company in the U.S. since Alibaba's (BABA) $25 billion listing in 2014. Trading began trading at $18, roughly 29% higher than its $14 IPO price, though throughout the session the stock lost most of its IPO gains. \n* General Mills (GIS) said it is raising prices across nearly all its grocery categories by around 7% due to higher costs for ingredients and labor. \n* Ford Motor (F) said it will be forced to cut output across more than a half-dozen U.S. factories in July due to continued pressure from the global shortage in semiconductors.\n* PayPal (PYPL) is intensifying competition with Square (SQ) by launching its own physical card reader to put in stores. While both are undisputed leaders in fin-tech, PYPL has always focused more intensely on peer-to-peer transactions while SQ put more of an emphasis on consumer-to-business transactions.\n* Twitter Inc on Tuesday named Sarah Personette as chief customer officer to oversee the social media platform's global ad sales, global content partnerships and revenue operations. The company has been making a big push to increase revenue lately. \n* **\\*\\*Current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Salesforce (CRM) target raised by Evercore from $290 to $300 at Outperform. Stock currently around $244\n* Crowdstrike (CRWD) target raised by Truist Securities from $250 to $300 at Buy. Stock currently around $252\n* Facebook (FB) target raised by Argus from $385 to $410 at Buy. Stock currently around $349\n* Hess (HESS) target raised by Wells Fargo from $98 to $104 at Overweight.

Right now they are valued at 5.5b which is criminal in my mind for the growth they are projecting but still we are talking about high multiples which scares some value investors.  I am using this consolidation period to add to my position.  The real question is what am I missing here?

Third, this post was created using SEC 13F filings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What are SEC 13F Filings?**\n\n**TLDR;**\n\n\"The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Form 13F is a quarterly report that is required to be filed by all institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management. It discloses their equity holdings and can help smaller investors determine what the \"smart money\" is doing in the market. However, studies have found that 13F filings also have serious flaws and can't be taken at face value.\" For more info on SEC 13F filings, click \\[here\\]([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-13f.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-13f.asp))\n\n\\*13F filings are a valuable way of tracking the investment strategies of industry leaders\n\n\\*13F filings can have issues with reliability and timeliness\n\n\\*Filers are not required to disclose short positions, long positions, or cash\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Made using Microsoft Excel](https://preview.redd.it/rs6slvbbye771.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0d83b8cd5b43966fcf04e02faf79266a0123e57)\n\n**1.

        "selftext": "Buy and hold! and accumulate much as you can while they keep the stock price low. \n\ni know many of us are armed with Robinhood and we're trigger happy with buy/sell but if you want to win you must learn to buy and hold. Yes, Blackberry is one of those stock. In my view it's massively undervalued Cyber Security and IoT company. Their Blackberry Spark platform is taking over everything and overtaking Crowdstrike business too. How i make this assessment? Simple, if Crowdstrike was a good technology compnay the entire US federal government would be using it....BUT there're NOT! they are going to Blackberry.  **Blackberry has integrated artificial intelligence into all their products now.** \n\nEven IBM has decided to ditch their own cyber security software and switched to selling Blackberry Spark suite in Canada. When one of your biggest competitor ditches their own product and starts selling your product, that's a sign that you have an amazing crazy magic like product. \n\n[here's the proof](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-and-ibm-canada-establish-a-new-partnership)\n\nCompared to industry the blackberry spark artificial intelligence machine is years in advance. **No other** ai based cyber security comes close to blackberry engine, this is why US government and 77% of fortune 100 companies have switched to blackberry. i will list their growing customers(big enterprises) in next part. **BB holds the biggest ai patent portfolio in cyber security!!**\n\nRevenue growth will explode in coming months and quarters. The ai based spark platform was launched last year and it took them few months to get their ducks and marketing in row! \n\nNext article i will dive deep into their latest product called Blackberry Persona! it's a god like ai that stops insider threats and stolen password(the pipeline hack could have been prevented if they had used blackberry). Password will be history and no longer will be required as we move into the future. \n\n**if we compare valuation to peers, the company should be around 70 Billion minimum or about $140 per share.** \n\nNot a financial advice.

        "selftext": "As a sequel to \"10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM\", I'm back with 10 more ETFs that have less than $1b AUM but that I think are interesting and possibly useful and some comments on each.  Too often only the biggest ETFs, or most popular, get people's attention. I think it's worth looking further to see what's out there.\n\nStarting with a Peter Lynch inspired strategy (Lynch popularized the price/earnings-to-growth ratio),\n\n1. SPGP: Invesco S&amp;P 500 GARP ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP) . \"Growth at a Reasonable Price\" (GARP).  This ETF is an interesting combination factor screener.  It only selects from S&amp;P 500 stocks, and screens them first for 3-year earnings and sales growth, and second for financial leverage (debt), return on equity, and earnings yield (trailing-twelve-month or \"TTM\" net income / market cap).  Holdings are weighted by growth score, not market cap.  GARP's historical performance is surprisingly good; it beat the S&amp;P 500 since January 2020 and beats both the S&amp;P and traditional CRSP growth/value factors YTD.  It also outperforms the S&amp;P on some longer timeframes.  Index rebalanced semiannually (3rd Friday June/Dec), and it costs a moderate 0.34% ER.  It's designed to hold 75 stocks.  Check SPGP out when it rebalances later in the month!\n\nMoving on to Factor ETFs,\n\n2.  FVAL: Fidelity Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL) .  This ETF tracks and index that calculates scores for: free cash flow yield, EBITDA to enterprise value, book value to price, and forward earnings to price. The first two factors result in it having some tech giants such as FB, GOOGL, AMZN, and AAPL in the index. But not some others, such as TSLA, which scores very poorly on... well, every factor. Banks are just scored on book to price and forward earnings to price, as their business model is not comparable to most other stocks. FVAL provides an interesting way to get exposure to possibly-not-overpriced intellectual property-heavy companies, as well as traditional value stocks.  Currently holds about 130 stocks.\n\n3.  FIVA: Fidelity International Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA) .  The international (mostly developed markets) counterpart to FVAL, this ETF fills a great niche since forward-looking international value ETFs are few and far between.  Most value ETFs are heavy on book value, and rely on backward looking metrics or ignore free cash flow.  FIVA (and FVAL) take a different approach.  Currently holds about 120 stocks.  FIVA is perhaps the single most overlooked ETF in this entire list -- it provides a unique type of international exposure, and at only 0.39% ER. International factor funds often have slightly higher ERs than total market funds, but may provide much greater total return given desirable macro-economic conditions.  For example, since the first vaccine was proven effective (which kicked off the value rally), FIVA has outperformed VEA by about 6 percent.\n\n4.  JVAL: JPMorgan U.S. Value Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753) .  JVAL's index is also a value screen. It scores via four metrics: earnings yield, book to price, free cash flow yield, and TTM dividend yield. Pretty well-rounded in that it includes earnings, book, and yield measures. It does not include forward earnings metrics. Due to the cash flow and earnings metrics, it ends up including some big tech companies like FB, GOOGL, and MSFT. While it includes a dividend metric, the JVAL ETF has a lower 30-day SEC yield than VTV or dividend-focused ETFs such as SCHD, so I would not consider it as a dividend fund.  Holds about 350 stocks.  \n\n5. FQAL: Fidelity Quality Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal) .  Quality ETFs depart from value ETFs in that they're less concerned about price/earnings metrics.   Fidelity's offering in the space weights stocks on free cash flow margin, return on invested capital (one of Charlie Munger's favorite metrics), and free cash flow stability.  For banks, it looks at return on equity and debt to assets.  This ends up having a lot of overlap with the S&amp;P 500, but it ends up filtering out companies like TSLA and as per its goal, only has about 130 companies overall.  Like FVAL, this costs 0.29% ER.  Fairly common for US factor funds.\n\n6. JQUA: JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761) .  JPMorgan handles \"quality\" a bit differently.  They have 10, yes ten, different metrics that go into measuring quality.  They're grouped into categories for \"profitability\", \"solvency and financial risk\", and \"earnings quality\".  Loosely stated, they're looking for companies making reliable cold hard cash hand over fist that are not too indebted.  Like the Fidelity offering, it ends up looking a lot like the S&amp;P 500 but with slightly different weights.  GOOGL currently sits at the top of its holdings.\n\nLet us not forget commodities,\n\n7. COM: Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf](https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf) .  A fascinating ETF, it covers 12 different commodity futures in categories for metals, agriculture, and energy.  Different from most other commodity ETFs, it's almost like a commodity trend advisor (CTA) fund because it can take both long and \"flat\" (neutral/no) position in each commodity.  This helped COM wonderfully during the commodity crash in 2Q20 because they were able to go flat and preserve value, avoiding the oil crash.  If inflation comes back big time, commodities will benefit.  And if a commodity bubble bursts, this fund may be able to avoid some of the downside.  No K-1 form.  Might be my go-to outside of GUNR (equity ETF) for commodity exposure.\n\n8. CMDY: iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund) .  A somewhat newer offering from Blackrock, this broad commodity fund systematically positions itself to best handle carry cost in the futures curve (and thus adjusts for contango / backwardation curves).  It has generally outperformed other popular long-only commodity funds, and avoid being overweight on oil/energy futures.\n\nSeeking dividends?\n\n9. SCHY: Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF, [https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy) . A new offering from Schwab, it's the international counterpart to SCHD.  Its index filters for companies that have made 10 consecutive years of dividend payments, and ranks them by cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and 5-year dividend growth rate.  After a volatility screen, the results are weighted by a capped market capitalization approach.  A wonderful mirror to SCHD for those seeking reliable income, but who also want to diversify outside of US markets.  I predict its AUM will go up by 10x in less than 2 years.  Also quite inexpensive at 0.14% ER -- Schwab is likely subsidizing this, in order to help it grow.\n\nFinally, like it or not, blockchain is here to stay,\n\n10. BLOK: Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html) .  The AUM of this ETF is right around the $1b mark, but I'm including it anyway.  It seems to be the best-of-breed actively managed ETF for exposure to stocks benefiting from bitcoin mania and blockchain tech.  Clearly, it's volatile.  And it's not a pure bitcoin/ethereum play -- some small amounts of Samsung, IBM, and so on sneak in due to them having a connection to the space.  But it does hit all the big names, including recently listed Coinbase ($COIN).  If you can't be bothered to follow or deal with crypto in general but want something that will remain correlated to it, this is the ETF.  Pricey at 0.71% ER, but, it's actively managed and still has a lower ER than ARK's funds.\n\nDisclaimers: this is not financial advice. I currently have a position in FVAL, but no position in any of the other ETFs at time of posting.  That may change at any point in the future.  I am not predicting future performance for any of these funds.  Do your own due diligence (and please post in reply with what you find!).\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?",

        "selftext": "Hey Ya! Remember the early 2000s? It was all about lace-up jeans, giant cargo shorts, Gilmore Girls, Lord of the Rings, the Atkins Diet ... and the BlackBerry.\n\nLong before the iPhone, the BlackBerry was the most beloved mobile gadget in the universe, known especially for its reliability, its security, and its full keyboard. But Research In Motion, the company that made it, didn't change quickly enough with the times, and the sweet fruit of its labors went sour. The company renamed itself BlackBerry (NYSE: BB) in early 2013 and set on a course of reinvention \u2014 first around smartphones, and then around software. Many people wrote it off.\n\nAnd that's where we see a major opportunity.\n\nBlackBerry has been quietly accelerating in its new mission securing all the connected devices that the modern world increasingly relies on. You've heard of the Internet of Things, chips embedded in all the stuff around us transmitting a wealth of data? Call the business angle \"the Enterprise of Things.\" BlackBerry's new focus still draws on its expertise in endpoint security, which shows us the fruit hasn't fallen so far from the tree. But this time around, it's securing things like self-driving vehicles, emergency health networks, financial reporting, and much more.\n\nIf your image of BlackBerry is stuck in the past, read on. This is a company with a future.\n\nSecond Bloom!\n\nIt's no surprise that most investors would pass BlackBerry by after a quick glance. Revenue has declined every year since 2011 \u2014 and even then, the company's share price was far below the peak of nearly $150 that it reached in mid-2008.\n\nBut this is, quite simply, an entirely different company than the BlackBerry most people remember, and its turnaround is just starting to take hold. Moreover, the company's progress is masked by the continuing decline of old legacy businesses that aren't part of management's vision or our investment thesis going forward.\n\nBlackBerry continued to sell its own handheld devices until mid-2016, and there are still BlackBerry-branded devices available, so current results continue to suffer from the decline of this business. Service access fees (SAF), related to legacy users of BlackBerry operating systems, are also dwindling. Given that these two businesses still represented roughly 50% of revenue in fiscal 2017, their continued decline has been keenly felt.\n\nBut the meat of the current business, Software and Services, has grown at an average annual pace of 15% over the past three years, reaching $782 million in fiscal 2018 (the company's fiscal year ends in February). This is now by far the largest part of BlackBerry, and we expect revenue for the company as a whole to stabilize this year and start rising thereafter.\n\nThe company's QNX operating system, in particular, has been driving growth. Traditionally used in vehicle infotainment systems, it has grown into the software backbone that can run all the chips in a vehicle, including safety and communications. BlackBerry has struck key deals with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), and others around this technology. Baidu, in turn, has made QNX the core of its Apollo platform, and has partnered with automakers like Ford (NYSE: F) and Hyundai to make this the core of future autonomous vehicles.\n\nThis certainly isn't the only area where BlackBerry's business is growing, but it's emblematic of the niche the company is carving out: securing endpoints in the Internet of Things, with a particular focus on enterprises. It has been a leader in Gartner's (NYSE: IT) Magic Quadrant for enterprise mobility management for the past two years, making it one of the Top Dogs in a sector that's expected to grow revenue at a 25% annual pace through 2021. \n\nStill Green!\n\nThat hasn't yet put BlackBerry in the black, but it's building the core of a very profitable business.\n\nSince being recapitalized by Fairfax Financial in 2013, BlackBerry has boasted a strong balance sheet, with $2.2 billion in cash and $810 million in convertible debt (which will likely convert to shares rather than being repaid). Gross margin improved from 49% in fiscal 2017 to an amazing 73% in fiscal 2018, indicating not only the company's shift from hardware to software, but also some considerable pricing power. Management also expects the company to deliver positive free cash flow this year (it did last year, too, albeit thanks to a large one-time adjustment).\n\nAdd it up and this is a $5.4 billion company currently generating around $800 million in very high-margin software revenue (leaving aside the remaining hardware and SAF businesses), with over 80% of that revenue recurring. With a gross margin that improved to 76% in the most recent quarter, we expect this business to ultimately produce profit margins in the 20% to 25% range, even as the top line continues to grow. That looks like an attractive price point.\n\nRisks and When We'd Sell!\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to look more deeply at BlackBerry's financials, but the surface picture remains unflattering. For the time being, this remains a company with shrinking revenue and marginal profitability. Changing that relies not just on continued growth of the software business, but scaling the business so that BlackBerry's relatively high sales, marketing, and R&amp;D costs come down as a percentage of revenue.\n\nThe company is a leader in a growing sector, but its competitors \u2014 companies like IBM (NYSE: IBM), VMware (NYSE: VMW), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), and others \u2014 have a lot of resources. That's why it's important that BlackBerry establish an especially strong presence in areas like vehicles, but we would like to see it keep getting wins in other areas, too.\n\nThe Foolish Bottom Line!\n\nNot every turnaround works, but BlackBerry has already become a leader in enterprise mobility management by leveraging its security DNA. This company has spent the last five years under CEO John Chen honing its new focus, and at this point he says the company is \"largely done reinventing itself\" and ready to focus on furthering its leadership. Chen should know \u2014 he's a turnaround expert who was previously brought into database company Sybase, returning it to profitability before it was sold to SAP (NYSE: SAP) in 2010.\n\nWhether or not BlackBerry remains on its own or is ultimately acquired, we expect it to continue expanding its capability and reach in keeping connected \"things\" safe and secure. The best part is that many investors can't see the green shoots growing from the rotten fruit of a decade past. That's a sweet opportunity.",

The company provides software-as-a-service applications that enable customers to rapidly develop, deploy, and operate large-scale Enterprise AI applications across any infrastructure. It provides solutions under three divisions namely:\n\n* The C3 AI Suite: proprietary model-driven architecture, addresses the requirements for the digital transformation software stack, providing a low-code/no-code AI and Internet of Things, or IoT, platform that accelerates software development, reduces cost and risk, and delivers applications that are flexible enough to meet evolving needs.\n* C3 AI Applications: a large and growing family of industry-specific and application-specific turnkey AI solutions that can be immediately installed and deployed such as:\n   * Inventory Optimization: a solution to optimize raw material, in-process, and finished goods inventory levels\n   * Supply Network Risk: provides visibility into risks of disruption throughout the supply chain operations for enterprise supply chain managers\n   * Customer Churn Management: enables account executives and relationship managers to monitor customer satisfaction using transactional, behavioral, and contextual information, as well as to take action to prevent customer churn with AI-based and human-interpretable predictions and warning\n   * Production Schedule Optimization: a solution for scheduling production \n   * Predictive Maintenance: provides insight into asset risk to maintenance planners and equipment operators\n   * Fraud Detection solution\n   * Energy Management solution \n* C3.ai Ex Machina: analytics for applying data science to every-day business decisions\n\n**FINANCIALS**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zudwz718ew471.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12d05673719c96e4bce13e8389d0f2c8a63f3006)\n\nC3 is growing rapidly with a total revenue of $156.7M in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020 compared to $91.6M in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019 representing a year-over-year growth of 71%. Over the same period, the subscription revenue grew to $135.4M from $77.5M representing a 75% increase.\n\nC3 has high total contract values for software subscriptions. The average total subscription contract values were:\n\n* 2016: $1.2M\n* 2017: $11.7M\n* 2018: $10.8M\n* 2019: $16.2M\n* 2020: $12.1M\n\n**BULL ARGUMENT**\n\nC3 has a first-mover advantage in Enterprise AI due to investment into their products and technology over the last decade. They have \u201cLighthouse Customers\u201d, or large global early adopters, in Europe, Asia, and the United States across a range of industries that serve as proof points for other potential customers. Some customers include:\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6v6m5kedew471.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e44125b37976abacc041856b3b4fda5e7608a95)\n\nThere is an extensive partner ecosystem that includes strategic relationships with established technology leaders like:\n\n* [Amazon Web Services](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181010005314/en/C3-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Expand-Collaboration-to-Drive-Enterprise-Artificial-Intelligence-Adoption)\n* Fidelity National Information Services\n* [Google](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180821005202/en/C3-IoT-and-Google-Cloud-Announce-Partnership)\n* [IBM](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-02-27/correcting-and-replacing-ibm-services-and-c3-ai-announce-strategic-alliance-for-digital-transformation-with-ai)\n* [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/microsoft-sees-gain-on-c3ai-investment-concurrent-with-ipo.html)\n\nAlthough the average total subscription value is decreasing and may continue to decrease, C3 has restructured the sales organization and expanded the market-partner ecosystem to address small, medium, and large sales opportunities. The progress is promising as the average total subscription contract value for six months ended October 31, 2020 was $7.7M.\n\nOn February 1, 2021, the [launch of the Open AI Energy Initiative](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-c3-ai-baker-hughes-220000073.html) was announced by Shell, C3, Baker Hughes, and Microsoft. The initiative provides a framework for energy operators, service providers, equipment providers, and independent software vendors for energy services to offer interoperable solutions powered by the [BHC3 AI Suite](https://bakerhughesc3.ai/bhc3-ai-suite/model-driven-architecture/) and Microsoft Azure.\n\n**BEAR ARGUMENT**\n\nC3 faces intense competition and which could be an \u201cearly bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese\u201d type of situation as second movers could develop technology to improve upon any shortfalls. The main sources of potential competition include:\n\n* Greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger customer bases\n* Larger sales and marketing budgets and resources, and the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing across a broader portfolio\n* Wider geographic presence\n* Lower labor and research and development costs\n* Larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios\n* Greater financial, technical, and other resources to provide support, make acquisitions, hire talent, and to develop and introduce new products\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Tom Siebel has received many [honors and awards](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181112005818/en/EY-Honors-Thomas-M.-Siebel-as-2018-Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year%C2%AE), but if he, or other senior management team members, were to leave the company C3 may not be able to execute their business strategy. Siebel is critical to the overall management and continued development of the AI suite and AI Applications. All of the executive officers are at-will employees and they do not maintain any key person life insurance policies.\n\nC3 has a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. The sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and the sales efforts require considerable time and expense. This is due to investing into sales to large organizations that typically undertake a significant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organization structure, and approval requirements. A limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of C3\u2019s revenue. The top three entities together accounted for 34% and 44% of the revenue for years ended April 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The same entities have been with C3 for an average of 3.3 years.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nGiven the success of C3\u2019s customers, I feel it will increase penetration of their existing customer base. They are primed to expand the major account sales organization to focus on large enterprise software agreements. Additionally, C3 will continue to develop high volume distribution channels to address the needs of small and medium businesses. I think they will continue to bring new product families to market that will develop into substantial recurring revenue streams. The total addressable market is rapidly growing and estimated to grow to $271B in 2024, a 12% CAGR from 2020's estimate of $174B.  This is a big opportunity for C3.  The lock up period [ended on June 7, 2021](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=907559-94759), and earnings happened on June 2, 2021. I believe everyone who wanted to sell has sold at this point. I am bullish and think C3 has great potential for a swing trade, but more so a long-term investment. \n\n*I am not a financial advisor.

Citadel securities has taken short position in WKHS. They are short 2,099,000 shares in Puts, have 1,822,200 shares tied into Calls, and own 779,284 shares. ([https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings\\_tab\\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings_tab_link))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese filings don't include if they sold the calls/puts, or bought the calls/puts. But I have reason to believe, given that they have 2,099,000 shares short (which stands for about 21,000 Puts contracts; 100 share multiplier per contract) and are in the 6/18 Strike Price of 6 Put and the 9 Put as well. Just look at the open interest from thinkorswim below (Boxed in orange, right side). And obviously you might think, just coincidental. But..... I have coded the change of open interest to determine when this position was made, and if it was made all at once. To the right of the picture below, you can see that this position was placed between 15-20 trading days prior (OI (-15/-20Days). AKA 3-4 weeks prior, which puts us at the week prior to their fillings, May 17th. Like I said, these fillings were reported on May 21st.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow what about the call? They are tied into 1,822,200 shares or about (18k call contracts). Now again, looking at the coded option chain data, you can see that once again there was a position placed again for the 20 Call of this weeks, 6/18 expiration. The open interest increased to 18,513 15 days ago, or again, right at the time of Citadels fillings on May 21st.\n\nAs per u/JulianFranklin \"They sold 18,000 call contracts with a $20 strike price. That means they are promising to SELL 1.8 million shares (18,000 contracts X 100 shares per contract) at $20 each. That means, if WKHS finishes Friday at less than $20 they don't have to do anything, all the money they made selling the options is pure profit. Remember, options don't exist until someone sells them. An option is just a promise to either buy or sell at a later date under certain conditions. If the conditions aren't met by the timeline in the promise, then the option vanishes and the person who sold it wins. Now to the REAL part of your question...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCitadel wins if WKHS finishes above $9 and below $20. For every dollar ABOVE $20 that WKHS gets to by Friday closing bell, Citadel will lose $1.8 million (less whatever they were paid when they sold the option). So if WKHS goes to $25.55 at closing bell, Citadel loses $10 million. If it goes to $31.11 they lose $20 million. If WKHS goes to $50, they lose $54 million.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA protective collar strategy is performed by purchasing an out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously writing an out-of-the-money call option. The underlying asset and the expiration date must be the same. This strategy is often used by investors after a long position in a stock has experienced substantial gains. This allows investors to have downside protection as the long put helps lock in the potential sale price. However, the trade-off is that they may be obligated to sell shares at a higher price, thereby forgoing the possibility for further profits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn example of this strategy is if an investor is long on 100 shares of IBM at $50 and suppose that IBM rises to $100 as of January 1. The investor could construct a protective collar by selling one IBM March 105 call and simultaneously buying one IBM March 95 put. The trader is protected below $95 until the expiration date. The trade-off is that they may potentially be obligated to sell their shares at $105 if IBM trades at that rate prior to expiry.\n\nThe main drawback of this strategy is that the investor is giving away upside in the stock in exchange for obtaining downside protection. The protective collar works like a charm if the stock declines, but not so well if the stock surges ahead and is \"called away,\" as any additional gain above the call strike price will be lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore details can be found here [https://www.reddit.com/r/WKHS/comments/nyxnrj/fellow\\_ape\\_brothers\\_and\\_sisters\\_of\\_wkhs\\_we\\_must/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&amp;utm\\_name=iossmf&amp;utm\\_term=link](https://www.reddit.com/r/WKHS/comments/nyxnrj/fellow_ape_brothers_and_sisters_of_wkhs_we_must/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;utm_term=link)",

Aside from the company's name is coming from Lord of the Rings aka the \"seeing-stones,\" described as indestructible balls of crystal used for communication and to see events in other parts of the world, the CEO Alex Karp\u2019s interviews keep me more and more interested.\n\nThis is the dip to buy in my opinion.\n\nWith contracts with the US and UK in military intelligence police heathcare and others with IBM, Amazon etc, I\u2019m intending to ride this to not just the moon but to Mars.\n\nShort term I see this going to $27 and attempting to break/ hold that key level. It is already showing the golden cross formation of crossing moving averages.

        "selftext": "Why I think BB is legit\n\nHonest View on BB\n\nApe Research Analyst Report on BB: To the Moon\n\nWhat's up apes, I know the last couple weeks have been life-changing for some of us. As a grad student who grew up on the lower end of the middle class, I recognize how pumped some fo you must feel and commend everyone's brass balls- it's never easy to make money in a casino as heavily manipulated as the free market that is the USA. But turning to BB: it was never meant to be just some squeeze (although its end result could technically be called that if you really wanted too)- it's a retooling company embedded in a crucial sector to the modern global economy.\n\nAnd so while some of us have become capable of retirement in recent weeks, I want to talk about a name that is on the cusp of a resurrection.\n\n# For BB Holders, it's been tough lately.\n\nMany people have harsh memories of Blackberry: it was on the cusp of bankruptcy as recently as 2015. Revenue growth sunk from $20B at its peak in 2011 (82% hardware sales) to under a $1B in the 2010s; $BB stock sunk from a peak of $146 in 2008 to single digits, thanks to negative cash flows and rapidly declining top line growth.\n\n[Not surprising BB ate shit for so long- this useless Etch-a-Sketch was 82&amp;#37; of their revenue in 2011!](https://preview.redd.it/w7dt7c4bwd371.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80e0a1b70f7bad3078d8bb3d3982d69b1d12f1bb)\n\n[It's been a long, tough run for Blackberry shareholders since they ended hardware production\\/sales. The stock has been largely irrelevant for years, falling from a peak of $146 in May 2008 to single digits \\&lt; $5B market cap. But its transition into a cybersecurity company is only beginning to pay fruit, which I believe the market will catch on to very soon. Times are a-changing!](https://preview.redd.it/f5zqz58dwd371.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=763644f3ae3cc922a25d1e06d7d0a295ae5d5ed9)\n\n# A Rebranded Business for the Digital Economy\n\nLike we've seen with the Chads in Gamestoink, successful companies are the ones willing to renounce their fading legacy businesses and embrace initiatives and industries that sit on the cusp of the digital age. Enter Blackberry. Now we all remember Blackberry's legacy business- the handheld pagers that looked like shit, but only quirky people embraced (POTUS and CEOs used Blackberry pagers over iPhones for the longest of times, until Blackberry discontinued its hardware line).\n\nHowever, the primary focus for Blackberry has never changed. Blackberry was always security-centric, and with the installation of CEO John S. Chen in 2013, Blackberry pivoted towards software- a trend that was always going to happen given Apple's prowess in manufacturing superior smartphones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[John S. Chen's my homie. If you're scared about holding BB bags, just reassure yourself that that chin can hold both yours and his. But seriously, he's an innovator, having been credited with \\\\\"Saving Blackberry\\\\\"- pay attention, his vision doesn't end with subsistence.](https://preview.redd.it/l39tl9rfwd371.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91ee66024cfba9e04ea1566f5690aeb57ecd2497)\n\nBut like Ryan Cohen with Gamestop/Chewy, Blackberry recognized it needed to adapt to survive, and that's exactly what it has done under Chen's stewardship. A glimpse at Blackberry today is far different than the pioneer that once controlled 20%+ of the mobile hardware market.\n\n[Revenues have intuitively followed a similar trajectory as Blackberry's market cap. But the transformation under Chen's leadership so far is tangible: after hardware sales alone accounted for 82&amp;#37; of revenue in 2011, the company made a wide U-turn. After establishing \\(and meeting\\) a goal for fiscal 2020 revenue to top $1B again, hardware has fallen to just \\~3&amp;#37; of sales. Enterprise software \\(44&amp;#37;\\), Licensing &amp; IP \\(31&amp;#37;\\), and Technology Solutions \\(22&amp;#37;\\) now dominate BB's topline as of 2020, cementing its push and admittance to the cybersecurity market.](https://preview.redd.it/u9mg373iwd371.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c8790440834c2d2f933eb88018fa6971d95ce0e)\n\n# So what does Blackberry actually do now?\n\nTo be clear, the only people walking around with Blackberry \"phones\" nowadays are old junkies trying to revive some 2000s nostalgia. Blackberry doesn't make that archaic crap anymore. All you need to remember are three phrases when thinking about the new Blackberry: **enterprise software, licensing IP,** and **technology solutions**.\n\n* **Enterprise software** is one of the fastest growing components of BB's cybersecurity offering. It includes products like the Blackberry Enterprise Mobility Suite, which provides endpoint management and BlackBerry AtHoc, a secure communications platform.\n* **Licensing IP** is the segment responsible for the monetization of the Company\u2019s global patent portfolio as well as the mobility licensing operations, which license the BlackBerry brand and device software to handset vendors.\n* **Technology Solutions** is the business that includes BlackBerry QNX embedded software as well as several emerging businesses such as the BlackBerry Radar fleet management solutions.\n\nExciting Partnerships, Soaring Ambitions\n\n*\\*\\*You should really take a look at some of Blackberry's partnerships in the last 2 years- this is not a company that makes shitty pagers anymore, it's the company that embodies \"digital transformation.\"*\n\nTake a look at some of the companies Blackberry is sleeping with and tell me your smooth gorilla brain doesn't swell:\n\n* **Baidu** has an extensive partnership with BB in its autonomous vehicle unit, dating back to 2018. In January 2018, the two companies announced they would [partner](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) to utilize Blackberry QNX's OS as the backbone of Baidu's autonomous system. Blackberry also agreed to help Baidu integrate smartphone integration software for Chinese connected cars (CarLife), conversational AI (DuerOS), and HD maps. In January 2021, these two [expanded](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) their relationship: Blackberry's QNX Neutrino Real-Time OS is being utilized for all future EV models produced with the EV branch of GAC (Guangzhou Automotive Group, yes the C isn't a typo). Pretty exciting stuff to say the least..\n* **Motional**, which is a Hyundai backed AV startup, [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform) in February 2021 its intentions to use BB's Black Channel communications technology for all of Motional's future AVs. A very integral input for Motional and impressive win for Blackberry, being able to ensure safe data communication exchanges within vehicle safety systems is essential for AVs' successful integration in society... otherwise where is the trust in accepting that ride? Not to mention that Apple (*the Tim Apple*) was chirping around with Hyundai and Kia, talking about making a \"smart car,\" *earlier this year!* I guess all the ape memes about Blackberry being a legitimate competitor to Apple shouldn't be sneezed at by Wall St equity research analysts and BB \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs...\n* **AWS**, yes Amazon Web Services (!), is another credible player lining up with Blackberry. Although not quite as exciting as building actual AVs, the work they do is still essential to ensure this dream can actually be realized. In December 2020, the two Chads [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform) a multi-year partnership to develop BB's IVY platform (Intelligent Vehicle Data, yes the \"Y\" is weird, but makes sense for ape leadership), allowing automakers to read sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from the data both in the vehicle and in the cloud.\n\nTake it from Amazon's new CEO, Andy Jassy himself: *\u201cAWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user\u2019s needs and preferences. Through this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.\u201d*\n\n[These geniuses love Blackberry, starting with their most intelligent, scalable business: AWS! Shouldn't you apes like BB as well?](https://preview.redd.it/ktha1d7nwd371.png?width=1218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892b2415869531f1cf47f9c54b6d6e668c252877)\n\nBut why should I stop there? I'm tired of seeing fear-mongering Wall Street hedge funds, investment bankers, and research analysts attempting to push their positions (BB's primary competitors are IBM, Microsoft, VMware, and Mobile Iron, the former 3 of which are all significantly owned by \"institutions\" - &gt;75%) and allege Blackberry is a dying business that makes crappy hardware.\n\n* **Microsoft** (Yes its rival!) even realizes its budding competitor is crafting innovative solutions, announcing a partnership in [October 2020](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management) for Microsoft Teams! Microsoft plans to integrate Blackberry AtHoc, which will allow organizations on Teams to contact, alert, and account for all members of their group directly through Teams should some calamity transpire. Especially as we witness more cyber attacks (the digital economy's biggest threat will stem from this), it will be an all hands-on-deck effort to safeguard the integrity of our software. BB's partnership with Microsoft (and [ServiceNow](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-athoc-and-servicenow-partner-to-deliver-secure-and-re) for incident response management) not only grounds its strong advance to cybersecurity industry disruption, but its diverse agility to penetrate various sectors, ranging from AV/EV, CRM software, IoT, 5G, and so much more.\n* If the corporate pedigree isn't enough for you, I'll end with the **U.S. Air Force**. No, unlike what bulge bracket banks may lead you to believe, BB's revenue stream is well-diversified, as the USAF [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/the-united-states-air-force-chooses-blackberry-spark-for-secure-productivity) a partnership in September 2020. Blackberry Spark, utilized for UEM and UES, will help the Air Force with their secure productivity needs, enabling virtual work environments whilst ensuring premium security. As we face more threats in the cyber space and continue pivoting towards a \"work-from-home environment\" regardless of the permanent trends form Covid, BB's wide-ranging partnerships, from Fortune 500 tech companies to the U.S. military prove it is an essential cog in the 21st century digital economy. Not to mention consistent ARR is exactly what investors (the suits) should be looking for, so what gives with the nasty financial press?\n\n# Blackberry's Financial Trajectory (Revs, Bottom Line, CF)\n\nWe have to take a look at Blackberry's financials, after all that is what this casino allegedly runs on. Luckily, if we ignore what the \"experts\" in Battery Park are shilling, we'll notice Blackberry is not the capsizing Titanic all the research analysts make it out to be. I'll take you into a deeper dive into the top &amp; bottom line with just the facts and my brilliant takes, and y'all can make your own decision on whether BB stock is seriously a pile of rat shit or an emerging growth stud.\n\n[As you might expect, Blackberry's overall top line consistently declined until roughly 2020+ \\(when every single one of these dope partnerships was announced\\). As BB wound down its legacy hardware, handset, and related service products, sales declined nearly $400M over the course of final two years, a marked decline from the near $20B struck in 2011. This trend seems to be on the reverse though: the new partnerships in 2020\\/21 have certainly underscored BB's transition into a software company, a trend even Wall St has had to acknowledge by lifting growth targets for fiscal year 2021. IMO, the $1.2B projected top line figure for '21 is conservative, and I think these figures could start to double, triple, and \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 in 2024+. Let me explain why with more charts:](https://preview.redd.it/3pq5gyspwd371.png?width=874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1a643492be05c1ec2f4830bd0b66b180276b6b3)\n\n[All those dope corporate and military partnerships I highlighted earlier? They mainly fit into BB's Enterprise software\\/services revenue stream, which is now 44&amp;#37; of overall revenue. This is the first component that I believe is going to drive revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and tendies for us and BB in the years to come. We'll first notice that growth in this space really picked up in 2020 for BB, similarly to when their overall topline reversed trend- because this is the soul of 2021 Blackberry! And no, this doesn't even really include the innovative AV\\/EV partnerships, these are just institutional clients like Microsoft, ServiceNow, or Salesforce who want to buy one of Blackberry's SaaS established offerings. Think of the potential addressable market in the years to come: work from home, AI, 5G, IoT, we can keep going- all of these things need to be protected, without security, there is no system- every software, hardware, and appliance company under the sun is going to be lining up because they have no choice. You are adapt or go extinct. I expect BB to continue driving this aspect of its growth in a gargantuan way: think 25-50&amp;#37; growth YoY.](https://preview.redd.it/m106ixxswd371.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59e12724037bc3b9f099ab2859bea4b6608f00ee)\n\n[If Enterprise Software is to be Blackberry's Patrick Mahomes, Technology Solutions will be Blackberry's Tom Brady. Since 2017, this aspect has doubled as a portion of overall BB revenue, from roughly 10&amp;#37; in '17 to over 22&amp;#37; projected in '21, reflecting BB's successful ongoing foray into innovative technologies. In this segment we see BB's partnerships with Motion\\/Baidu reflected, cutting-edge technology projects that will enable unfathomable innovations in the future. We could say autonomous vehicles, or drones or anything that will be automated- they will all need to be securitized, whether with each other or on the cloud. BB's deep partnerships with global leaders like Baidu indicate John Chen has been playing 4D Chess since 2013: intensive capital expenditures to transform a company's creative intelligence don't just happen with the snap of your fingers. Put simply, you don't just go from making pagers to making AVs overnight- it's a lengthy process that will affect your growth\\/profitability, as evidenced by Blackberry's fall from grace. But if my instincts are right, Enterprise Software and Technology Solutions will drive BB's revenue growth\\/profitability, propelling it back to $100B market cap in the not-so-distant future.](https://preview.redd.it/1h96psxuwd371.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=595d7f66d80d079394875a718984ee589b593bcc)\n\n[BB earns a decent amount of revenue from Licensing\\/IP, which is quite frankly a pleasant surprise to me. Essentially this component comprises BB's monetization of its global patent portfolio and licensing operations, which do things like license the Blackberry brand\\/device software to various vendors \\(a lot of handset\\). It is somewhat impressive that it's currently 31&amp;#37; of BB's top line, but then again not too surprising. Considering the Enterprise Software\\/Technology Solutions streams are at really nascent stages of growth, it makes sense that this more \\\\\"legacy\\\\\" revenue stream is so prominent. But then again, this component jumped over 20&amp;#37; in 2020 \\(what seems to be BB's turning point\\), so it's not like I'm going to argue with more revenue either. I'd say this the Matt Stafford component of BB: a reliable and solid contributor, but not something I would be betting the bank on either. But if it produces \\(which is certainly not out of the question\\), I won't complain either \\(unless I'm from Detroit\\).](https://preview.redd.it/fx1ebhmxwd371.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06730b56ca47298cd1347a8c090542c1e90eae96)\n\n[I think we've established hardware\\/handsets are a legacy business for Blackberry. Why do I talk about it? B\\/c Wall Street does, and WSB often falls prey to their fear-mongering. DON'T PAY ATTENTION. It's like Mitch Trubisky- yeah that ish was dope in 2015-2016, but we all know it's washed now and the only reason we keep talking about is because shillers want to use it to keep diverting from the real gold.](https://preview.redd.it/j0fszgu0xd371.png?width=896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4b2250478ab2cb6ad49956d4b2f4f89560fc56c)\n\n[I'm not going to hammer earnings to crazy... to actually say with strong conviction that you can accurately forecast that out YoY is bullshit, and anyone from Wall St telling you they can is likely doing the same thing. Never the less, we see a clear trend: great profitability growth when Blackberry pagers led the mobile handset market, awful declines from 2012-2018 as BB closed hardware operations and invested in software\\/cybersecurity ambitions, culminating in the mixed bag we've been seeing in 2018 and beyond. Wouldn't be surprised to see this earnings churn to continue until \\~2023-2025, after all, you have to invest\\/incur losses if you want long-term profitability. I'm going to stay watching the 3 primary components of BB's revenue growth for now.](https://preview.redd.it/voaefw43xd371.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71f9cc1c63d585f57e3b88e20803c7f0f3ab4d79)\n\n[I care about Cash Flow far more than net income. Yeah, it's nice to look profitable, but how much money is actually coming in to your company? We see... a slow pick-up after 2020 \\(\\*pinch me\\*\\), when BB's resurrection appears to have started. Even in its legacy days, Blackberry was seeing hella cash leave the company, which just underscores software is a more profitable business than hardware. 2021 projections indicate Cash Flow could increase at the largest YoY rate in Blackberry's history \\(albeit from it's near-zero base\\). Nevertheless, if revenue growth booms like I think it will, FCF metrics are gunna look pretty green in 2022+.](https://preview.redd.it/ja112d95xd371.png?width=1234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d56e1feaa214463cd5b3b518e9b1c6171368f65b)\n\n# My Strongest Convictions on BB\n\nWell apes, thanks for enduring my BB nut. Now time for you to swallow:\n\n* I don't believe BB is \"just a meme.\" To the tards that made fuckloads of money on BBBY, KOSS, SNDL, and even AMC (not GME, PM me if you want to debate what I would call GME) to an extent in these \"not-exactly-the-future\" businesses with high amounts of short interest- kudos to you, here's your \ud83d\udc51, King. But the tough truth is I'm skeptical that \"squeezing\" is always going to work. For starters, you think the hedgies are really that fucking stupid? I mean, come on, Chancellor/Emperor Ken Griffin had to extend Melvin $5B in credit, lather up Vlad, and testify in front of Congress. Don't exactly think continuous losses and Congressional subpoenas are exactly what the hedgies want either... I'm sure their risk management committee have been popping Addies daily since January to make sure they aren't overfuckingextended in one bet. \\*Cough\\* \\*Bill Hwang\\* Cough\\*\n* No, I truly believe Blackberry Ltd is the 2016 version of AMD in the 2021 cybersecurity market. Back then, AMD's legacy business was flailing, and the entire chip market was dominated by Intel. They went into the changing room, made themselves up, and reorganized. Capturing 1%, then 2%, then 3% of the market share seems so little nominally, but means so much for the top line, bottom line, and the share price when you go from 0 to 1. 1 to 10 may seem like a big jump, but it's launching from the ground (a baseline of 0) that is most lucrative- and that is *exactly where Blackberry (BB) sits right now*. Capturing 2% of the global cybersecurity market would send BB flying, and we'd be soaring back to $140. If BB is actually as innovative as I think, who knows?\n* Unfortunately, if you think this is a short squeeze, I'm sorry, get out. I actually kinda like seeing closes like today (plummeting down 15%), because we shake out the weak hands and I can buy more cheap shares. No one's forcing you to buy this stock, I just like it. Facts &amp; numbers don't lie either. Short interest is 9% on roughly 500M shares outstanding, so we would likely need Jay Powell, Cathie Wood, Elon, and Chamath to hop in if there was actually to be a \"squeeze\" overnight.\n* But to contradict myself somewhat, I also think June 2021 (right now) could be one of the most preferential entry points into BB ever. Data indicates 40% of the shares are owned by institutions (similar numbers to GME), indicating 60% is retail, many of them apes. The suits may scream \"overvalued reeeee,\" and they have a point, BB stock isn't exactly cheap. As it trades at roughly 8X forward sales, BB is valued as a fast growing company, but not beyond the likes of PLTR &amp; SNOW (yes different industries, but valuations that are multiple times higher) or competitors like Palo Alto Networks or Cisco. As a graduate student attempting to be not completely rarted with my limited capital, I love the risk-reward for BB, especially considering they report earnings on June 22. I suspect these numbers will come in far stronger than the St is saying, and at least they will start to lift future guidance in a significant way (both catalysts for a 50-100% move in BB IMHO). I guess we'll see how the financials reward BB's transition, but I am truly convinced this is the AMD of cybersecurity.\n* This last part is a mixed-bag (but suspicious if we dive deeper), and I'm sure a lot of apes will downvote me and possibly completely avoid BB with this knowledge, but I want to share facts since they are evidently so hard to find. We got the usual mutual funds (Vanguard, Fidelity, TD, etc) who own BB (roughly 25%) and two woke funds who invest in \"innovative trends\" own the other 15%. But data does indicate nasty little Ken (Citadel) reported buying 1.3M shares of BB in Q1. BB was heavily shorted pre-GME (like 30%+), and Citadel/gey bears almost definitely bought shares to cover. The question I'm wondering was did Citadel actually buy BB b/c they were so worried about a squeeze since it is a legitimate growth stock or b/c he shares my sentiments about its turnaround? Regardless, both seem like positive catalysts for the stock, and hopefully Ken answers my question.... oh wait...\n\n[Self-explanatory.](https://preview.redd.it/w33d8rdaxd371.png?width=1886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab406b459250bc6669c79e67c65c145f9b879709)\n\nObligatiory: BB to the moon.",

But perhaps more importantly, formerly deeply out-of-favor speculative growth stocks, many of them associated with Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK funds, have begun to rebound.\n\n### SPECULATIVE TECH\n\n**SPECULATIVE TECH** **SINCE MAY 12** **ZOOM VIDEO-up 15% ROKU-up 11% SHOPIFY-up 11% SPOTIFY-up 8% TELADOC-up 6%**\n\n## The changing market narrative\n\nWhat\u2019s going on?\n\nThe market narrative is changing. The first quarter storyline was that the reopening would be very strong, bond yields would move up, and inflation may be an issue later in the year.\n\nThis was only partially correct. The reopening has been strong, but bond yields have come down, not up, as investors have come to believe 1) that inflation and supply-chain issues may indeed be \u201ctransitory,\u201d or temporary, as the Federal Reserve has insisted, and 2) that the second and third quarter is the top in earnings and economic growth.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe value trade is unwinding, and the growth bulls are winning,\u201d Alec Young, chief investment officer at Tactical Alpha, told me. \u201cBond yields are a proxy on the growth outlook,\u201d he added, noting that bond investors see moderating inflation and a slower rate of growth (though still positive) in the second half of the year.\n\nThe result: Investors are staying in the market, but they are rotating into defensives (health care) and growth (technology). Formerly crowded trades like cyclicals and banks that are associated with the \u201cvalue trade\u201d are now retreating.\u00a0\n\nWhy would investors rotate into growth stocks if growth is slowing?\n\n\u201cValue is a more economically sensitive sector because value is weighted toward industrials, energy, materials, and small caps,\u201d Young said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cEarly in the economic cycle, coming out of a recession, there is more earnings leverage from value stocks, so they are a better investment,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that everything has been compressed,\u201d Young said.\u00a0\u201cWe went into a recession really fast, and we came out of it fast, partly due to all the stimulus. Growth stocks now offer more reliable growth and are less subject to the vagaries of the economic cycle.\u201d\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Goldman Sachs\u2019 Ben Snider and David Kostin agreed. \u201cHistory, valuations, positioning, and economic deceleration indicate that most of the rotation \\[from growth to value\\] is behind us,\u201d they said.\n\nBecause this was a \u201ccrowded\u201d (overweight) trade, Goldman suggested that many players are likely caught offsides. \u201cMutual funds are overweight Value to a larger degree than any time in our eight-year data history,\u201d they said. \u201cHedge funds remain tilted toward Growth, but that tilt has recently fallen sharply and now ranks as the lowest in over five years.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Below is a breakdown of a recent WSJ article about 5G in the US. I added some bullets throughout the article  based on some research.  Even though I disagree with a few of the author's points, I think it's a solid article and helped me understand 5G a bit more. \n\nAt the end, I included some of my own opinions. Hopefully this helps everyone better understand what is going on right now. I have a large position in one of these companies. I have decided to keep it out of this sub, but if you check my post history I am sure you can figure it out. \n\n**The U.S. Is Back in the 5G Game**\n\n*By* Stu Woo*,* May 26, 2021 12:00 pm ET\n\nThe U.S. government has upended the **$35 billion-a-year cellular-equipment industry**, ushering in a new era of competition and giving U.S. companies a shot at re-entering a sector they vacated years ago.\n\n\u00b7 The $35 billion number they reference here only refers to the US. 2020 estimates the industry in the mid $400 billion range and most projections see this industry growing to the mid $500 billion range by 2023 and mid $700 billion range by 2027. \n\nIn the past five years, only China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co., Sweden\u2019s Ericsson and Finland\u2019s Nokia Corp. captured more than a 20% share of revenue in the wireless-equipment market, according to Dell\u2019Oro Group, a research firm. **No other competitor consistently cracked even 10%.**\n\n\u00b7 Huawei: 2020 revenue was $136.7 billion, not publicly traded so no market cap, 180,000+ employees\n\n\u00b7 Ericsson (ERIC): 2020 revenue of $25.3 billion, market cap of $44.4 billion, valuation of 1.75X, 100K employees\n\n\u00b7 Nokia (NOK): 2020 revenue of $24.96 billion, market cap of $29.8 billion, valuation of 1.19X, 92k employees\n\nNow that landscape is [changing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-loses-cellular-gear-market-share-outside-china-11615118400?mod=article_inline). Pushed by Washington\u2019s campaign to cripple Huawei over cybersecurity concerns, **countries representing more than 60% of the world\u2019s cellular-equipment market are considering or have already enacted restrictions against Huawei**, says Dell\u2019Oro Group. And to take advantage of that opening, the U.S. government\u2014as well as governments in the U.K. and European Union\u2014are considering financial support and other measures to boost domestic cellular-equipment makers trying to crack the three incumbents\u2019 stranglehold on the market.\n\nThe result is a newly competitive market that is reminiscent of the 1990s, when bygone industry giants such as Lucent, Motorola, Nortel, Siemens and Alcatel fought for a piece of a growing telecom-equipment pie.\n\n\u00b7 Lucent merged with Alcatel in 2006 to form Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia absorbed Alcatel-Lucent in 2016. \n\n\u00b7 Motorola split into Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions in 2011. Google acquired Motorola Mobility which, focuses on phones, in 2012 which was then sold to Lenovo in 2015. Motorola Solutions (MSI) 2020 revenue of $7.4 billion, market cap of $35.2 billion, valuation of 4.76X, 18K employees.\n\no MSI appears to focus on smaller, private networks especially in public safety. \n\n\u00b7 Nortel: Went bankrupt in 2009 and Ericsson purchased most of its telecommunication assets over the next few years. \n\n\u00b7 Siemens (SIEGY): 2020 revenue of $69.4 billion, market cap of $140.6 billion, valuation of 2.03X, 293k employees (manufactures switchboards and 5G routers)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got a Wild West feel to it,\u201d says Bill Plummer, a former Nokia and Huawei executive now working at JMA Wireless, a Syracuse, N.Y., 5G company. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen this since probably the eve of the dot-com bust\u2014this dynamic and thriving competitive environment in wireless.\u201d\n\nThat new environment could benefit everyone\u2014other than, of course, Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia. It will give a host of competitors a chance to win business that only a couple of years ago seemed out of reach. And the new competitive fervor should increase innovation and lower costs for wireless carriers, which could pass on savings\u2014and the fruits of those innovations\u2014to customers.\n\nAmerican officials further say the new competitive landscape is crucial to U.S. efforts to counter China\u2019s influence in developing 5G technology, **the next generation of wireless technology that will serve as the building blocks for all sorts of future technologies\u2014whether in robot-run factories, heart-rate monitors, or any number of industries and products. The country that dominates 5G will be well-positioned to lead the technology industry in terms of profits and talent in the years ahead.**\n\n**The 3G days**\n\nAfter a vibrant start to the 3G era in the 2000s, when manufacturers throughout North America, Europe and Asia competed, equipment manufacturers started consolidating amid pressure from Huawei and another Chinese company, ZTE Corp. which were both selling increasingly competitive hardware at lower prices. In 2016, Nokia\u2019s acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent, itself a merger of French and American companies, created today\u2019s three-giant oligopoly.\n\nThe Trump administration began loosening the trio\u2019s grip on the market in 2018 when it started urging allies to blacklist industry leader Huawei over national-security concerns. **The campaign worked: Huawei lost market share outside China to both Ericsson and Nokia last year**, according to Dell\u2019Oro Group, as governments enacted or considered restrictions on Huawei\u2019s equipment.\n\n\u201cThe big change over the past couple of years is pressure on Huawei,\u201d says James Barford, a telecom analyst for Enders Analysis. \u201cEven in countries where there is no formal ban, you\u2019re going to be thinking twice\u201d about using equipment from the Chinese company.\n\nThe stranglehold of the big three was further weakened by Nokia\u2019s blunder in procuring expensive chips for its 5G equipment\u2014a mistake that resulted in its equipment costing more upfront, as well as consuming more power. That\u2019s an issue for wireless carriers, which can spend roughly 20% of operating expenses on energy. Nokia says it has since moved to cheaper, power-efficient chips, but damage was done: Some carriers looked elsewhere for supplies.\n\n\u00b7 This appears to still be up in the air, but Pekka Lundmark, Nokia\u2019s CEO, seemed adamant in an interview after Q1 that chips are no longer an issue for Nokia. We shall see. \n\nWith both Huawei and Nokia under pressure, that left Ericsson as the market leader outside China. But that, in turn, made wireless carriers\u2019 executives wary. They say they want more competition to increase innovation and reduce costs.\n\nThe result has been an opening for a whole new generation of competitors\u2014and the Wild West environment.\n\n**The open gambit**\n\nSome carriers are turning to Samsung Electronics Co. , the South Korean smartphone giant that is a relative newcomer to the wireless-infrastructure industry. It ranked fifth behind the three giants and China\u2019s ZTE in 2020, but won a major victory last year when Verizon Communications Inc. switched suppliers from Nokia to Samsung.\n\n\u00b7 ZTE: 2020 revenue of $15.86 billion, market cap of $21.84 billion, valuation of 1.38X, 74k employees (traded on Hong Kong and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges)\n\n\u00b7 Samsung: 2020 revenue of $212 billion, market cap of $500 billion, valuation of 2.36X, 109k or 284K employees (traded on Korean Stock Market)\n\nBut it\u2019s the possibility of buying 5G equipment using open-standards software that has the most potential for roiling the competitive order.\n\nTo understand why, consider that the cellular equipment that transmits signals to phones consists of three parts: the antenna, hardware that sits on a pole directly under the antenna, and more hardware at the pole\u2019s base. **Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia currently sell all three parts in a bundle, and they aren\u2019t interoperable**. For instance, a Huawei antenna doesn\u2019t work with Ericsson electronics under the antenna.\n\nIt would be like buying a Dell laptop that works with only a Dell monitor and Dell printer. And it means customers have limited options on price, quality and features.\n\nEnter a new technology based on open standards, dubbed **Open RAN**, or radio access network. Companies making equipment based on these standards **allow wireless carriers to mix and match the antennas with different under-antenna hardware and centralized electronics**. That gives carriers more options for cost and quality.\n\n\u00b7 Huawei: Does not believe in the use of Open RAN.\n\n\u00b7 Ericsson: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\n\u00b7 Nokia: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\n\u00b7 ZTE: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\n\u00b7 Samsung: working on Open RAN, part of the O RAN Alliance.\n\nThe U.S. government is a major backer of the open-software efforts, which officials say could boost both U.S. national security and business. It potentially can help U.S. businesses by creating openings for new players, and because these new efforts rely less on hardware (where the U.S. has fallen behind) and more on software (where companies such as [**Microsoft**](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT) **Corp**. and [**International Business Machines**](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IBM) **Corp**. can potentially play a role).\n\n\u00b7 Microsoft: Partnership with Ericsson focuses on the auto industry. Partnership with Nokia focuses on cloud solutions for enterprise. Dealings with Huawei appear to be smartphone based, not 5G. \n\n\u00b7 IBM: Has partnered with Ericsson in the past, but appears to be working more closely with Nokia and Samsung recently. \n\n\u201cWe may be able to increase security, reduce our exposure to any single foreign vendor, lower costs and push the equipment market to where the United States is uniquely skilled\u2014in software,\u201d Federal Communications Commission Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in March.\n\nIf U.S. companies do indeed become major players in 5G equipment, then they can also play a bigger role in setting global standards for telecom equipment. That\u2019s an arena where China has made great strides. U.S. officials prefer that companies in the U.S. and allied democracies set wireless standards, which they believe would lead to greater, less hackable security.\n\nPresident Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide last month agreed that the U.S. and Japan would collaborate to advance open 5G networks \u201cby fostering innovation and by promoting trustworthy vendors and diverse markets,\u201d the White House said. Congress this year enacted a law to establish a Commerce Department fund that would award grants to support the use of such open-standards equipment in the U.S. A bipartisan group of lawmakers backing the bill requested $750 million for the fund in fiscal year 2022.\n\nIn the U.K., a government-appointed task force to help British wireless carriers transition away from Huawei equipment recommended that new equipment makers, or those using open-standards software, represent 25% of the country\u2019s wireless infrastructure by the mid-2020s. The task force recommended government incentives for wireless carriers buying such equipment, and for suppliers to locate research facilities in the U.K. The European Union this year started examining similar options.\n\n**The focus of newcomers**\n\nSeveral smaller U.S. companies\u2014such as [Airspan Networks](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AIRO), Altiostar, Mavenir, JMA and Parallel Wireless\u2014are focused on 5G equipment using open software. Ericsson and Nokia are also shifting to using some open-standard software.\n\nThe new challengers have signed deals with some big carriers. [AT&amp;T](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/T) Inc. is testing open-standards equipment and plans to gradually introduce it, while newcomer wireless-carrier [Dish Network](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DISH) Corp. has said its entire network would rely on such infrastructure.\n\n\u00b7 [Airspan Networks](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AIRO) (AIRO): 2020 revenue was $54.7 million, market cap of 11.9 million, valuation of 0.22X, 900 employees\n\n\u00b7 Altiostar: 2020 revenue was $10-50 million, not publicly traded so no market cap, 359 employees, they are pre IPO and Qualcomm is an investor\n\n\u00b7 Mavenir (MVNR): 2020 revenue was $462 million, market cap of $1.72 billion, valuation of 3.72X, 4,200employees\n\n\u00b7 JMA: 2020 revenue was $369 million, not publicly traded so no market cap, 1,000 employees\n\n\u00b7 Parallel Wireless: 2020 revenue was $75 million , not publicly traded so no market cap, 450 employees\n\n\u00b7 Dish Network Corp: Rumored to be trying to become the 4th major US network behind Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile. Partnered with Nokia on 5G software. Has worked with Ericsson in the past, but has been working closer with Mavenir and Qualcomm lately. \n\n\u00b7 AT&amp;T: Has 5 year deal with Nokia for 5G services. Also has a deal with Nokia on 5G software. Partners with Ericsson on Private 5G Networks. Appears to be trying to move away from Huawei, but still works with them outside of US. \n\nDell\u2019Oro Group predicts that equipment using open standards, from both newcomers and incumbents transitioning into the new market, **will capture 10% of the market by 2025**.\n\n\u201cThe operators say, \u2018We need choice, we need a strong ecosystem,\u2019 \u201d says Thierry Maupil\u00e9, a former Motorola and [Cisco Systems](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CSCO) Inc. executive who now works at Altiostar, which provides software for open-standards 5G equipment. **\u201cYou have a playing field that has been reduced to a few companies.\u201d**\n\nStill, **open-standards equipment remains in its early stages**, and it is too soon to know whether it will be a major player. Wireless carriers say their tests of open-standards equipment show some drawbacks. The new technology can be less energy-efficient than today\u2019s conventional systems. And while the open-standards equipment can be used in rural areas, its performance isn\u2019t yet up to snuff in densely populated urban areas.\n\n**But wireless carriers expect the open-standards equipment to be on par with Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia equipment in three or four years.**\n\n\u201cFor us, it is critical to maintain competition in our vendor system,\u201d says Michael Trabbia, chief technology officer at French carrier Orange SA. **\u201cWe cannot end up with only two players.\u201d**\n\n\u00b7 The two players are of course Nokia and Ericsson with Huawei more and more out of the picture with more than 60% of the world\u2019s cellular-equipment market are considering or have already enacted restrictions against them. Similar bans are being placed on ZTE so Nokia and Ericsson should continue to gain market share. This could also help Samsung, but I feel like their focus is elsewhere as a company. \n\n\u00b7 I\u2019ve kept things fact based up until now and will close with an opinion. Nokia and Ericsson appear to have an establishing duopoly in an industry that the US government has now twice admitted is massively important to the future technological success of all countries. \n\n\u00b7 So much so that they are looking to spend money to try to help US based competitors of Nokia and Ericsson. The new competitors this article mentions are all small and well behind what the tech giants provide. Even with US funding they are not too worrisome. Mavenir seems like the most legitimate threat, but they already have a valuation multiple higher than Nokia and Ericsson. I don\u2019t really see a fund of $750 million dollars split across 5 companies making much of a difference at the end of the day either. \n\n\u00b7 Open RAN may be the future, but that is long ways away. This article suggests that a move to Open RAN in the US will hurt Nokia and Ericsson and help the smaller guys. I do not believe that will be the case. The tech giants will stay ahead of the smaller guys the same way they have done with hardware. And even if they do not the article states that it should make up only 10% of the market by 2021.",

        "selftext": "(CSE:DIGI), (OTC: DBKSF)\n\nWith Digicyrypts recently officially rebranding itself to DigiMax recently I thought it would be a great time to share some DD and overall a brief summary of what these guys are doing and why I like them so much. So without further ado...\n\nDigimax is a Canadian company that focuses on AI and predictive tech. They have got a great team behind them and have several different services that they offer using this advanced technology. These services stretch into several sectors like financial, HR, crypto, and logistics, and all use a similar, constantly improving AI engine. Personally, I'll never get over just how cool AI as a concept is, what once seemed to be the stuff of sci-fi films is now very much so a reality. This engine is extremely effective at completing different types of analysis and predicting trends without the need for human influence or intervention.\n\nTheir first service I want to highlight is DataNavee. This is an engine for commercial business use and helps analyze trends in several factors associated with running a large or small business. These factors and indicators include sales, revenues, and supply chain quantities, all figures that are key to running a smooth business. DataNavee takes companies existing figures and extrapolates and interprets them allowing business owners to choose the best course of action based on the AI's highly advanced projections.\n\nFor anyone who is a big fan of crypto investments, they have their Crypto tracking and predicting service known as CryptoHawk. Once again using an advanced AI, it is able to track the prices and trends of Bitcoin and Etherium and make projections about future fluctuations. This service, in particular, is getting a huge improvement in the near future as Digimax brought on Delphi Anlaytics' crypto division to improve the accuracy of analysis and add other cryptocurrencies. This service generates SAAS revenue and has seen some impressive demand. In the same vein as crypto, they also look to open their own crypto fund which will be supported by their acquisitions of Kirobo and Barberton Fund this year.\n\nI am super impressed with the different revenue streams DigiMax and I still haven't even mentioned Darwin Ecosystem, a system that uses a projected personality interpreter to make hiring decisions. This particular project was made with IBM Watson and is currently used by 17 law enforcement agencies.\n\nWith the upcoming summer launch of their Crypto fund along with advancements in their other projects, DigiMax is looking to take the tech world by storm and offer industry-topping services. While this may be a big vision for a company with a $0.17 stock price, I definitely think it's within the realm of what's possible and for that reason, they are on my list!\n\nDisclaimer: DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, this ain't investment advice!",

        "selftext": "mCloud Technologies (Ticker: MCLDF) is a 10 bagger in the making. mCloud has identified a niche opportunity to optimize energy assets for all businesses to contribute to higher ESG scores and overall energy savings. Bank of America (TICKER: BAC) **HAS ALL 3,300 of their branches connected to their software and SAVED roughly $40,000,000 through improved efficiencies (5). The savings they generated EXCEEDED the amount paid for the subscription.** \n\nQuick facts:\n\n*  WILL BE CASH FLOW POSITIVE by mid Q3 2021.\n* Quick Ratio well over 1\n* Price-to-Sales below 2\n* Gross Margins of 61%\n* SaaS company with 273% Net Dollar Retention and ZERO attrition currently serving an untapped market (Unbelievable)\n* Currently have 60,000 subscribers (Connect assets) which include blue-chip customers like McDonalds (Ticker: MCD), Planet Fitness (Ticker: PLNT), Starbucks (Ticker: SBUX), Telus (Ticker: T.TO) , Longyuen (Largest wind farm in China), etc (AND GROWING).\n* Comparables: Aspen Technologies (Ticker: AZPN), Honeywell (Ticker: HON), C3AI (Ticker: AI).\n* Stock price is down because COVID-19 restricted them from going to clients and connecting them. HUGE tailwinds as resections lift. \n* Five days ago (May 27th, 2021) Jack Vander Aarde from Maxim Group reiterated a \"BUY\" rating with a **price target of $5 (242% upside).** His recommendations have generated a 110% return while being a tracked analyst on TD Ameritrade with a success rate of 74%, ranking 13th out of 7,533 tracked analysts... No fluff here just facts.\n\nThe first component of the *AssetCareTM* foundation (Their SaaS product) is the IoT sensors that are attached to client\u2019s assets (HVAC Systems, Wind Turbines, Electrical Transformers, Nuclear Power Plants, Heat Exchangers, etc.). The same way IoT sensors in an Apple Watch track the distance and speed you've ran or your sleeping patterns and heartbeat, mCloud's IoT sensors track real time asset data in buildings, oil and gas facilities, and wind farms. Some examples of the data points tracked are Kilowatt/hour usage (HVAC), outdoor temperature (HVAC), heating and cooling effectiveness (HVAC), system run-times (HVAC), heat transfer and viscosity (Oil and Gas), control systems (Oil and Gas), blade speed (Wind), etc. All of the respective information is collected, combined, and stored in the cloud where analytics are applied and correlations are made to directly decrease operating costs and provide better insight on the assets overall health (As oppose to traditional \"straight-line\" deprecation methods). These sensors years ago were very expensive and could not feasibly be used in providing a price-conscience product to consumers. With new advances in technology, the price of these sensors have dropped dramatically and the accuracy of the data they can accumulate has improved significantly. \n\nThe next foundational piece to their product is the cloud. In the 20th century companies had hardware that took up the size of entire rooms to store a fraction of data/information that can be stored today in a victual cloud. Now in the 21st century, big cloud providers such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and IBM viciously compete for customers, driving the price of storage down exponentially. With mCloud sensors tracking data 24/7/365, they now have a place to store and analyze it cheaply for its current 60,000 connected assets (and growing). The amount of storage needed for this *AssetCareTM* product was non-existent years ago and not available at a viable cost.\n\nLastly, with the cloud able to store all the data generated 24/7/365, data and analytics can now viably be applied to the entire data set. Traditionally in the late 20th century and early 21st century, organizations were only able to take a sample of the data available and come up with limited conclusions. Now with a place to store all data, companies like mCloud can provide an extremely more accurate analysis on the performance and health of any asset by identifying immensely more accurate anomalies and trends.\n\n**Summary**\n\nmCloud is unlocking the untapped potential of energy intensive assets with AI and analytics, curbing energy waste, maximizing energy production, and getting the most out of critical energy infrastructure. Through mCloud's AI-powered AssetCare\u2122 platform, mCloud offers complete asset management solutions for commercial buildings, renewable energy, healthcare, heavy industry, and connected workers. IoT sensors bring data from connected assets into the cloud, where AI and analytics are applied to maximize their performance.",

The suit comes as GlobalFoundries works with banks on an initial public offering that could value the chipmaker at about $30 billion.\n\n\u201cThis action arises out of what seems to be a misguided and ill-conceived effort by IBM\u2019s law department to try to extract an outlandish payment,\u201d GlobalFoundries said its complaint.\n\nIBM agreed in 2014 to pay GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion for GlobalFoundries to acquire the unit. As part of the deal, GlobalFoundries became IBM\u2019s exclusive provider of certain power processors for the next 10 years, in exchange for access to IBM\u2019s intellectual property. GlobalFoundries acquired manufacturing facilities in East Fishkill, New York, and Essex Junction, Vermont.\n\nGlobalFoundries is backed by Abu Dhabi sovereign fund Mubadala Investment Co. The chipmaker is coming to market as numerous industries complain they can\u2019t get enough semiconductor supply and governments across the globe gear up to provide financial support for expansions in production.\n\nA call and email to IBM wasn\u2019t immediately returned.\n\n\u2018Highly Suspect\u2019\n\nIn its lawsuit, GlobalFoundries said IBM\u2019s request for damages is \u201chighly suspect\u201d as it follows news of the potential IPO. GlobalFoundries also said that IBM \u201chas yet to provide any substantive explanation\u201d to its claims over the alleged breach.\n\nGlobalFoundries said in its lawsuit that it invested billions of dollars to develop cutting-edge chip-making technology, but that it decided not to pursue IBM\u2019s \u201cfailing strategy\u201d and notified IBM in 2018.\n\nAccording to the filing, development of the chip-technology was more challenging and expensive than initially anticipated, causing delays in the project\u2019s targeted milestones. GlobalFoundries says it spent more money to catch up but still fell behind competitors including Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. It also alleges IBM was \u201cwell aware\u201d of delays and the switch to Samsung was beneficial for the company as it was cheaper and faster than GlobalFoundries would have been able deliver.\n\nIBM didn\u2019t complain about GlobalFoundries\u2019 actions until news of its potential IPO broke, and it now seeks \u201ca quick payday,\u201d GlobalFoundries alleges.\n\nThe case is GlobalFoundries v. IBM, New York Supreme Court, New York County.\n\n(Updates with details of complaint)\n\nMore stories like this are available on [bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/)\n\n[Subscribe now](https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/67obqkd5zdp5lj8/?utm_source=yahoo_usn) to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone, \n\nI believe that $AMD is on the verge of experiencing a catalyst that will push the stock to a new ATH. As many of us know $AMD has been trading sideways and down for the past year (with some noise) since last October. I feel fairly certain that that is about to change.\n\nLast October $AMD announced a merger with $XLNX. The two giant companies have been working it out since that time. Recently, both companies share holders overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger. \n\nTo summarize what this merger means to $AMD we're talking about increased revenue, increased profit margin, better synergy and heading towards better products. The number 1 thing $AMD is going to get out of this? A better shot at taking down $INTC for the cloud market. A company with a market cap of roughly 225 billion compared to $AMD's 100 billion. So this is a David vs Goliath moment.\n\nThere's plenty of articles written out there on how this changes the financials and prospects for $AMD but I know you guys aren't going to read it if I re-write it here. To put it simply: This is a big deal. If you felt bad about missing $NVDA's stocksplit run, this is the potential chance of catching the 'next' big chip manf. movement.\n\nSo why am I writing this now instead of last October? Well, it's because things changed last week. We know who the customer is now: $GOOG.\n\nThat's right. A 1.67T company is taping $AMD over intel to help support their cloud.\n\nProof: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm\\_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm\\_medium=feed&amp;utm\\_campaign=article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article)\n\nSo we know they picked up $XLNX. Now we know they are teeing up for $GOOG. This is freaking huge. Not to mention they also acquired business from $TSLA, another 600B+ company. \n\nProof: [https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/](https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/)\n\nSo, let's list them out...\n\nCatalysts:\n\n1. $XLNX Merger\n2. $TSLA contract\n3. $GOOG partnership\n\nThis is clearly a big picture strategy on $AMD's part to push $INTC's weakening cloud business straight into the grave and take it's spot. I believe if $AMD is succcessful they will eventually reach a valuation closer to 200-300 billion dollars within the next 1-2 years. That's a 200-300$ share price. \n\nSo what am I suggesting?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I believe that post merger the fair value of $AMD is closer to 120-160 a share\n2. Without the merger $AMD has a value of about 120 a share                                                             \n(due to new contracts and overall market conditions. Just look at $NVDA's recent 50% run. Staying neck to neck as a competitor puts them at 120. But they have new business to justify it instead of black magic stock splits)\n\nIs there TA to support this? You bet there is. I use 2D time frames to wash out noise. I made some small crayon circles to give the picture some scope. You can use a 1W time frame and the analysis is the same. The stock's slow moving averages have begun to move higher and are approaching a cross, moving the stock towards positive. In simple terms: Gaining share value on average, every 2 days. And that rate is growing. The OBV is increasing meaning that **someone** 'aka Wall Street' is secretly scooping up shares and holding onto them. They are doing all of this while keeping the stock suppressed well below it's ATH. I believe they are intentionally gathering as much as they can before the catalysts combine and create a giant bull run. This is a long term run that could make a lot of people rich. The moment when $AMD sprints after $INTC and $NVDA. We all know as gamers and redditors that $AMD has become much much stronger and better in recent years. It's been amazing to watch their progress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$AMD 2D time Frame](https://preview.redd.it/ueoex1s30q671.jpg?width=2448&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cae96daec77945f519f2c1a112456ec06399e2b3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere on the 1 week you can see the faintest flicker of bullish life. This is due to the recent contract developments and the quickly approaching date of the merger. As I wrote above, **the catalyst is incoming**.\n\n[1 week time frame](https://preview.redd.it/9f80a7ur0q671.jpg?width=2440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31722579984b09e8fa30bcf913e22b2d41a96c5c)\n\nSo. When is the merger? I am sure you want some dates and some juicy possible plays. Here you go...\n\nWe've got 3 approvals that have to happen. \n\n1. EU - Believed to have no problems and will probably be approved end of June, end of July at the latest.\n2. UK - July 6th Deadline. Also rumored to have 0 problems\n3. CCP - This one there's no rumored date, but CCP supposedly has no issues as well.\n\nWhat is Wall Street doing? They are both shorting the stock while sweeping July calls as well as 2 year leaps. Take a look at July:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou've got 19498 calls purchased for July 16th at a 90$ strike. That sure sounds like Wall Street betting on it hitting 90$... after something happens. But we know what that is. It's the merger. \n\n[Unusual Option Chain July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/s3ez29jl2q671.jpg?width=942&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae8892e1f6a9a53eef3d2dc7a56f57c5a60926be)\n\nHow is this unusual? Take a look at the week prior:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[You could sum this up and it's barely even the volume for the 90$ strike on July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/53uatc9r2q671.jpg?width=944&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42bc7cd9650553fe2f3f34107f10c29c8a5e7ad6)\n\nSo how to interpret this? Well, I read this as Wall Street ***knowing*** what's about to happen. I believe they know the status of the merger, and approximately how far it's going to take the stock. I believe we're looking at $AMD pushing above 90$ by Mid July. This is a potential 10 bagger. Especially with them trying to push down $AMD's price today, now is a good opportunity to get in.\n\nSo what's the play? The easiest one is the 7/16/21 90$ strike. Go alongside wall Street and when you're happy with the profit--sell it. The merger could be announced any day so buying to at least that date is wise (IMO -- but I am just a degenerate not a financial expert). \n\nBuying longer could potentially let you capture more of the run if things play out the way I think it will. You could also take advantage of the current low to grab leaps and sit back and watch how this story unfolds over the next 2 years. Either way, there's real potential here in something most people are considering dead in the water.\n\nI am currently holding 119 contracts. A large portion are for the 7/16/21 90$. So yes, my money is on this play and continues to be what I pursue. This is my YOLO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy recommendations: Buy shares, Buy calls for mid july. Buy leaps. If you buy shares wait for the catalyst to occur. When it reaches an apex, start selling $CCs because the IV is going to grow. \n\nAs a disclaimer, I am not a financial expert. I am just a retail stock trader. I love to do TA as a hobby. I truly believe that $AMD is being suppressed as Wall Street 'fattens' their positions. You know what I say? Fuck 'em. They think they are hiding what they are doing but I definitely see it. They are preparing and we can too. And, if we're right, we can make more than them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck out there. I hope you enjoyed my DD. I don't post DD often on WSB, but I hope y'all enjoyed the read. You guys are great and I love you all.",

        "selftext": "AMD's latest financial reports blew all estimates out of the water... and their latest guidance for 50% growth (up from 37%) is conservative. Here is why:\n\nFUNDAMENTALS: IT'S ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT\n\nIn a post COVID-19 world, people will continue to flock towards entertainment.\n\nAs  confirmed by both TESLA and AMD recently, the latest Model X and S will  bring AMD silicon (GPU &amp; APU). This is HUGE, because this feature  will eventually trickle down as an optional to the Model 3 and rest of  the Tesla fleet. Why is this important? Just listen to Elon Musk drool  over PS5 performance on road trips with autonomous driving. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl\\_-bFNRJaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_-bFNRJaw)\n\nBut that IS NOT ALL, as Valve will be launching a new portable handheld. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA)\n\nIn essence PS4, PS5, XBOX X &amp; S and Valve are all going FULL AMD.\n\nWho do you think Ford, GM, Chrysler, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Renault/Nissan will go with?\n\nENTERTAINMENT IS KEY and AMD is all over it.\n\nThis  is also HUGE as entertainment software will be tailored to AMD's  processing pipeline. Unreal Engine 5 is the perfect example, which  ALREADY performs better on a 6800XT than it does on a RTX3080 (up to 12%  better, as per Digital Foundry's performance benchmark - see screenshot  and video link below).\n\n[AMD 6800XT on left with 61fps - Nvidia RTX3080 on right with 56fps](https://preview.redd.it/eruzko9mwy471.jpg?width=1289&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fcbb478a1bcc940bd8c564b5d6b6ace551aa401)\n\n(digital foundry's benchmarks) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0)\n\nUnreal  Engine 5 (with Lumen) will make Nvidia Ray Tracing a thing of the past.  This software solution is much more efficient at managing illumination,  making it available for non-RTX hardware.\n\nIn  addition, enthusiasts are really pumped with AMD's latest presentation  at Computex, where they presented Fidelity FX SuperResolution. It aims  to provide up to 2x performance while super sampling images up to 4K.  And the kicker is that this solution will be available to ALL.\n\nIntel's  Raja Koduri (Head of Intel GPU, formerly an AMD employee) has already  confirmed they are looking into AMD's Fidelity FX SR (as per his twitter  post days ago): [https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nSo yeah, AMD is the future of GAMING.\n\nBut on the stock analysis front, AMD has also begun its climb towards previous highs.\n\nIt has made a huge recovery since my latest post, when it was trading in the low $70's.\n\nJust imagine that AMD is trading at a Price/Earnings multiple of 34, with a market cap of $98.7B\n\nNvidia is trading at a P/E of 84 (over twice as much), with a market cap of $444B (over 4 times more).\n\nBut when you look at the financials, the differences shrink.\n\nOn Revenue, AMD has sales of $9.7B and net profits of $2.5B. Nvidia sold $16.6B for a net $4.3B.\n\nHow does that support Nvidia being over 4 times more expensive than AMD? It just doesn't.\n\nIf AMD were to trade at the same multiples: EPS of 2.38 \\* NVIDIA's P/E of 84.28 = $200 per share.\n\nAt $200 per share, AMD's market cap would be $243B... STLL HALF OF NVIDIA!!!! (WTF?!?!).\n\nThink about it, it is bound to close the distance towards $200 per share in the next 12 months.\n\nThe reasons are simple: Tesla, Valve, Unreal Engine 5, Ryzen 3D stacking and 50% growth for 2021.\n\nThe Xilinx deal WILL CLOSE in the next 6 months. THE BREAKOUT is IMMINENT!!!\n\nTo summarize, the product pipeline is AMAZING, not to mention the leaks on RDNA3 and Ryzen 4.\n\nThe new clientele is incredible: TESLA and Valve, added to Microsoft and Sony.\n\nJust imagine Xilinx FPGA accelerators integrated to AMD's Intellectual Property. Fuel the rockets!!!\n\nREMEMBER: In a matter of months you will be kicking yourself for ignoring this post!\n\nThe MOON is for amateurs.... WE'RE GOING TO MARS BABY!!!... with TESLA AND AMD!!!\n\nMARS - THE RED PLANET... WITH LISA AND ELON. PRIMATES AND APES TO COLONIZE IT IN 2022!!!\n\n..... ALL ABOARD!!!!",

        "selftext": "\n**Basics**\n\nAs long as you haven't been living under a fucking rock for the last decade, you know that AMD is a major player in electronic devices. While it has a minority hold in its markets, it still has a considerable market share AND has a hand in both GPUs and CPUs. It's versatile.\n\nWhile the silicon shortage is still big and doesn't show any signs of slowing, AMD is still most likely making a shitload of profit from the continuous buyouts of graphics cards for mining and the continuous selling of CPUs.\n\n**EPS/Financial history**\n\nAMD has been continuously crushing quarterly earnings targets for at least the past year, and shows no signs of slowing. It has consistently maintained a steady and rising profit.\n\n[Constantly winning](https://preview.redd.it/qz0qs58rh9571.png?width=332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d615f35e833c3563f23d4de50afe3956f490d61b)\n\nOn top of this, the company has a total cash balance of 3.12 billion and a total debt of only 551 million, which is fucking great.\n\n[It's doing great with managing its debt and total cash to say the least](https://preview.redd.it/vh2sh5xai9571.png?width=422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61451edd2ef36120f80b83aefbfbce123fe2813e)\n\nNot made up your mind yet? If not, I have even more great news for you! The company has been constantly underestimated/undervalued despite all these great numbers. The past 6 months have been shit which isn't to say it's been terrible in the long run which it definitely has not, but for a company that holds so much market in two major component categories at both the business and consumer level it's ridiculous for the stock to be consistently falling.\n\n[Constantly going down](https://preview.redd.it/j2pavto0j9571.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26816d6c905488484879bc98f527d8ac15accef9)\n\n**Shorts and shares**\n\nThe company is decently shorted with around 7% of the shares being shorted for a company with a solid background, which could be a disaster waiting to happen. Again, it's not heavily shorted by any means but I don't think 7% is something to scoff at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zk34ou1sl9571.png?width=427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6215e701d1970588345fb0c063ae217516419a0c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Memeablility**\n\nNow that we've gone over all the boring numbers, let's talk about the memability of the company. It's a fucking computer parts company. Computers=gaming, gaming=memes. It's simple logic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**More general points**\n\nAMD has a solid community reputation, and while the performance its components put out is not on par with that of nvidia and intel, the products are generally more user/consumer friendly and cheaper, plus not everyone is looking to buy an RTX 6090 with liquid shit cooling built in for the unaffordable price of a kidney. AMD is geared more towards the average consumer which makes up a large portion of the computer market. Not only this but AMD chips are appearing more and more in laptops and pre-built computers. Another small point is that Microsoft is using AMD chips in their new generation of Xbox.\n\nAgain, all of this is speculation and I'm not telling anyone what decision to make, this is just my take on it.",

Dr. Lisa Su is still thumbs up!\n\nRecent events provide a **HIGH degree of certainty** that AMD\u2019s **MISSION will be successful**.\n\nNamely:\n\n**1- AMD Genoa (Zen 4) to have 128 cores (256 threads) winning the DATACENTER (INTEL admits)**\n\nAMD was already taking market share from Intel in the datacenter, but the latest leak (from the reputable Jim of AdoredTV / **HE's BACK!!!**) has Intel\u2019s own internal presentations **admitting AMD will EXTEND the LEAD** in the Datacenter (screenshot below).\n\n[Leak from the reputable Jim of AdoredTV - The Scottish king is BACK!!!](https://preview.redd.it/aajw3pq5bw571.jpg?width=1299&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3bcd4f06a39c9bdae4c233fe7fb2e2c1ee81d1a)\n\nWatch his latest video analysis here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNs432VgxmQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNs432VgxmQ)\n\nHis confirmation tweet here: [https://twitter.com/AdoredTV/status/1405161144843739148](https://twitter.com/AdoredTV/status/1405161144843739148)\n\nIn  essence, one should expect that if core count is going up for Zen 4  (from 64 to 128), at the VERY least, consumer chips will go from 16 to  24. Furthermore, Threadripper **Zen 4 will be a BEAST**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2- AMD 6900XTX LC (liquid cooled) spotted.**\n\nAMD already achieved the #1 World RECORD in FireStrike last month, breaking 3300MHz in a 6900XT.\n\n[https://www.techpowerup.com/282216/radeon-rx-6900-xt-overclocked-to-3321mhz-breaks-firestrike-world-record](https://www.techpowerup.com/282216/radeon-rx-6900-xt-overclocked-to-3321mhz-breaks-firestrike-world-record)\n\nHowever,  that is NOT their BEST chip. Thanks to better bins, there\u2019s the 6900  XTX which is liquid cooled, with faster memory, higher clock speeds and higher TDP. **A MONSTER!!!**\n\n[Latest super bin model spotted 6900XTX... a RECORD BREAKER for sure!!!](https://preview.redd.it/74prhnfabw571.jpg?width=1154&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02bc05241e25485be5db87fa98c24ed94ce5a290)\n\nThis new model is expected to **BREAK ALL GPU** **WORLD RECORDS** once again.\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xtx-reappears-in-a-custom-pc-as-rx-6900-xt-lc](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xtx-reappears-in-a-custom-pc-as-rx-6900-xt-lc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3- AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution to launch with 44 game developers.**\n\nLatest leak from Vegeta (@Broly\\_X1) published by videocardz.com has AMD launching FX SR on 7 games **next Tuesday**,  with 12 games coming SOON and 44 game studios CONFIRMING to support  AMD's FX Super Resolution (Capcom, Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Warner  Bros., Valve, etc.).\n\nThis is **AMAZING** news.\n\nIn essence, ADOPTION is **already a SUCCESS**. Software developers will push AMD FX SR to GPUs, APUs, Consoles and mobile phones (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S22).\n\n[44 developers already backing AMD FX Super Resolution!!!](https://preview.redd.it/lufh7pwfbw571.png?width=1309&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af3cb2219e4ca6071d681d04fc24db0633db79a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4- Xilinx acquisition update: UK regulator to respond within 3 weeks.**\n\nThe  Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) of the UK is planned to provide  a phase 1 decision on July 6th in connection to AMD\u2019s acquisition of  Xilinx.\n\n[https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/advanced-micro-devices-inc-slash-xilinx-inc-merger-inquiry](https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/advanced-micro-devices-inc-slash-xilinx-inc-merger-inquiry)\n\nAs per Jim Cramer\u2019s Mad Money Lighting Round **YESTERDAY** (see video below) he expects the acquisition to trigger the stock to breakout and keep soaring.\n\nWatch video here: [https://youtu.be/QT5YDHmDpGk?t=140](https://youtu.be/QT5YDHmDpGk?t=140)\n\n[YESTERDAY - Jim Cramer confirms expectation AMD to SOAR after Xilinx](https://preview.redd.it/7kj8xnfjbw571.jpg?width=1272&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f87b2c5ebce97700f0b35c488154ac25334821f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5- AMD AM5 platform to launch Mid-2022 (3D cache CPU\u2019s by end of 2021):**\n\nAs reported by RedGamingTech, AM5 is expected in Q2 and AM4 B660 in Q1.\n\n[https://youtu.be/u2UWG-vE9cQ?t=195](https://youtu.be/u2UWG-vE9cQ?t=195)\n\nIn  essence, the AM4 will be the most successful platform in modern desktop  consumer history, with a new chip coming, with up to 15% performance  BOOST vs. AMD's AMAZING Zen 3 (5000 series).\n\nBut THAT'S NOT ALL, as in Mid-2022 Zen 4 is expected.

        "selftext": "To start off I do have a position in NVIDIA but nonetheless the reason for this DD is strictly information not persuasive. I truly believe NVIDIA is *undervalued* currently. ***I believe NVDIA will reach 800 pre-split (200 post 4-1 split) with the current momentum going for the stock along with a shift to tech soon.***\n\n\u00a0If you didn't know already, NVIDIA designs graphics processing units for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units for the mobile computing and automotive market.\u00a0\n\n*EARNINGS*\u00a0\n\n**NVIDIA recently had its earnings report in which they reported $3.66 earnings per share for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $3.28 by $0.38.** They recorded revenue of $5.66 billion, up 84 percent from a year earlier and up 13 percent from the previous quarter, with record revenue from the company\u2019s Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization platforms. Gaming revenue of $2.76 billion, up 106 percent from a year earlier. Record Data Center revenue of $2.05 billion, up 79 percent from a year earlier.\u00a0\n\n## Quarterly Earnings Surprise Amount\n\n**Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported | Earnings Per Share\\*| Consensus EPS\\* Forecast | % Surprise**\n\n**Apr 2021.                    05/26/2021                  3.13                                     2.62**                                **19.47%**\n\n**Jan 2021                      02/24/2021                  2.58                                      2.2                                  17.27%**\n\n**Oct 2020                     11/18/2020                   2.41                                     1.92                                25.52%**\n\n**Jul 2020                       08/19/2020                  1.67                                     1.63                                 2.45%**\n\nAs you can see over the past four quarterly earnings NVDIA has beaten each of the projected forecasts easily for the most part. With a gross margin of 64.11% for this quarter, and an average quarterly gross margin of 60.96% over the past 5 years, NVDIA is primed to continue its dominance for the future. Also it is important to note that **NVDIA beats out its main competitors Intel and AMD in gross margins on average over the past 5 years and over the last quarter.**\u00a0\n\n## NVDIA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years\n\n**Minimum 54.74% Jan 2019**\n\n**Maximum 65.06% Apr 2020**\n\n**Average 60.96%**\n\n## AMD Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years\n\n**Minimum 4.51% Sep 2016**\n\n**Maximum 46.07% Mar 2021**\n\n**Average 37.34%**\n\n## Intel Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years\n\n**Minimum 53.13% Sep 2020**\n\n**Maximum 64.50% Sep 2018**\n\n**Average 59.65%**\n\nNow onto reasons why I think NVIDIA is a strong buy.\u00a0\n\n1. **Price targets**\n\nNVDIA is still undervalued with multiple price targets very much higher than the current price of what NVDIA is trading at currently along with multiple buy ratings. One example in specific, **Bank of America recently upgraded NVDIA price target to $900 from $800 and reiterated its Buy rating.** The bank said its takeaway is that \"rising AI adoption, expanding use-cases across cloud, enterprise, edge, telco can help NVDA double its content and triple its data center sales over the next few years.\" Bank of America said it expects NVIDIA's data center business to grow at a 35% compounded rate to become its largest segment by year-end 2025. Other notable price targets include 854- Jefferies, 800- Robert W Baird, 800- Rosenblatt Securities.\u00a0\n\n1. **Acquisition of ARM**\n\n\u00a0ARM can\u2019t stay independent for long, even the CEO thinks so. Arm CEO Simon Segars\u00a0made the case that if it stays independent, Arm wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the increasing demands of its customers for more complex chips that can perform a wider variety of functions. The simple solution? Getting acquired by another company. NVIDIA seems to be in the lead to acquire ARM and other rivals are terrified. They have a good reason to be, as NVDIA already a strong leader wants to spend $40 billion to acquire U.K. chip technology provider Arm Holdings. This acquisition will reshape the industry entirely. NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang said the acquisition of ARM is an opportunity to create a company that can generate even more new ideas, and bring more innovation to its customers in the form of intellectual property. A quote in specific, \u201cThe benefit to the market, and to the Arm customers will be more IP, better IP, more accelerated road maps and hopefully taking Arm to the far reaches of what is becoming \u2026the diversity of computing that is literally going in every single direction,\u201d Huang said. \u201cYou\u2019re covering everything from cloud, to edge, to \\[internet of things\\], to high performance computing, to microprocessors, to accelerated computing\u2014everything.\u201d\n\n2. **Internet currency ( Not allowed to say actual word so replaced it with internet)**\n\nGPU\u2019s can be used for internet currency and its mining purposes. It\u2019s possible to blame the graphic card shortage on these miners but nonetheless, the usage of them is highly prevalent today. NVIDIA's releases of processors specifically used for mining poses a huge boost to its revenue and to the internet currency world. **NVIDIA booked $155 million in revenue from CMP cards in its fiscal first quarter.** While internet money is gaining traction around the world, we can expect NVIDIA to continue its dominance and reliability in mining purposes.\u00a0\n\n3. **Stock split**\u00a0\n\nOn May 21st, NVIDIA announced a 4-1 stock split which would take place on July 19th. So for every one share you own, you will own four instead as the stock splits its price valuation by four. On the day of the news, NVIDIA\u2019s stock price closed at $599.67. **Since then, the price of NVIDIA\u2019s stock has gone up around 24% to $743.75**. Not even one month has passed and the stock is up 24%! With one full month until the split **I predict NVDIA to hit $800 or/and above by the time of the official split**. Call options and shares in my opinion are the way to go for the next month as this could be a great opportunity to invest in a fast growth company.\u00a0\n\n4. **Growth**\u00a0\n\nNVIDIA has been a great growth tech stock to own recently with the numbers backing this statement up.\u00a0\n\n**NVIDIA RETURNS**\u00a0\n\nYTD: +223.35 (+42.77%)\n\n1 Year: +376.83 (+102.20%)\n\n6 Months: +214.67 (+40.44%)\n\n1 Month: +184.92 (+32.98%)\n\nNow for the returns on NVIDIA compared to AMD and INTEL.\u00a0\n\n**NVIDIA RETURNS**\u00a0\n\nYTD: +223.35 (+42.77%)\n\n1 Year: +376.83 (+102.20%)\n\n6 Months: +214.67 (+40.44%)\n\n1 Month: +184.92 (+32.98%)\n\n**AMD RETURNS**\n\nYTD: -7.06 (-7.70%)\n\n1 Year: +30.61 (+56.64%)\n\n6 Months: -11.27 (-11.75%)\n\n1 Month: +10.21 (+13.72%)\n\n**INTEL RETURNS**\n\nYTD: +5.85\u00a0 (+11.74%)\n\n1 Year: -4.41 (-7.34%)\n\n6 Months: +8.21 (+17.30%)\u00a0\n\n1 Month: +0.83 (+1.51%)\n\n**NVIDIA beats Intel and AMD in every single category growth wise showing complete dominance with its stock price.**\u00a0\n\nConcluding I believe NVIDIA is a must buy presplit and the risk is minimum. The stock shows solid uptrend with extreme growth to come. NVIDIA is a strong buy in my personal opinion and an amazing company to be invested in.\u00a0",

        "selftext": "It was a generational changing of the guard this year for Ita\u00fa Unibanco. \n\nThe biggest financial services company in Brazil welcomed new CEO Milton Maluhy Filho. Just 44 years old, Maluhy took over from retiring Candido Bracher, and becomes the youngest bank boss in Brazil.\n\n\nDespite their tremendous market power, Brazil's giant banks did not move to take advantage of the rapid spread of broadband internet and smartphones across the continent in the early 2010s.\n\nThat is all about to change.  Ita\u00fa has now launched app adapted for the M1 chip.  Since the first Macs with an M1 chip hit the market, Ita\u00fa customers were basically unable to access their accounts from their computer using the app \u2014 having to use only the iOS app or, of course, the browser. **This week, the bank released a version of the App Ita\u00fa no Computer duly adapted for Apple.**  (For Macs, two independent versions of the app are available for download: one for Intel (compatible with macOS 10.12 Sierra or higher) and one for M1 (compatible only with macOS Big Sur 11).\n\nMOREOVER:  Ita\u00fa has partnered with fintech Rappi to provide greater access to financial services and products for retail and mass affluent clients in Chile. The agreement will allow customers to access the Brazilian bank and asset manager\u2019s investment strategies digitally through Rappi\u2019s phone app. \n\n\nMAINTAINING CONTROL OVER SMALL BUSINESS MARKET CAP: In Brazil, Ita\u00fa and Omie launch support platform for small and medium-sized businesses.

The bank is eying deals with companies in sectors such as payments and investments, he added, which will complement the portfolio of Brazil\u2019s largest lender. Itau\u2019s chief financial officer, Alexsandro Broedel, said that despite fierce competition, the bank sees its net interest income growth accelerating by year-end, with trading gains reaching the upper part of the outlook range, close to 6.4 billion reais ($1.26 billion).\n\n\nWHO IS MILTON?  Milton Maluhy Filho became a director on January 1, 2019.  Previously, he was CEO of Rede S.A.

        "selftext": "Intel may see its market share fall to a new low next year, in large part thanks to Apple's decision to move away from using Intel processors in its Mac computers and instead use Apple silicon.\n\nAs a result of the four Macs with \u200cM1\u200c and upcoming releases, Intel this year will lose 50% of its orders from Apple, and eventually, losing all orders from the Cupertino tech giant will lead to Intel's market share falling below 80% in 2023, according to DigiTimes.\n\nHowever, Apple's in-house developed Arm-based processor series is expected to play the key role in taking a major chunk from Intel's share in the upcoming year, the sources said.\n\nIntel is expected to lose nearly 50% of its orders from Apple in 2021 and will eventually obtain no orders from the client. Losing Apple's 10% market share and seeing AMD staying firmly with another 10%, Intel's share in the notebook market is likely to slip below 80% in 2023, the sources noted.\n\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/18/intel-market-share-falling-apple-silicon/",

        "selftext": " \n\n**Why Intel ($INTC) is undervalued**\n\nThis is my first ever stock analysis, any tips will be appreciated. \n\nDISCLOSURE: I do not own any shares of Intel at the time of writing. \n\nIntel is a chipmaker who has been beaten down by the ongoing global chip shortage. Intel is down from it\u2019s high and has a relatively low P/E value. I am currently bullish on Intel. AMD is currently expensive and overvalued at the moment. AMD has had no availability in the consumer market for quite some time. Intel is finally the more affordable option again (in terms of consumer parts) due to AMD having very limited availability. In terms of stock, Intel is currently down from it\u2019s high and has potential to go back up. \n\n**Finances**\n\nFirst things first, let\u2019s get into Intel\u2019s financials. Over the past few years, Intel has had steady revenue growth:\n\n2017: 62.76B\n\n2018: 70.85B\n\n2019: 71.97B\n\n2020: 77.87B\n\nIntel has also been steadily buying back outstanding shares, declining in numbers every year:\n\nIn 2018, Intel had 4.701B outstanding shares, a 2.77% decrease from 2017.\n\nIn 2019, Intel had 4.473B outstanding shares, a 4.85% decrease from 2018.\n\nIn 2020, Intel had 4.232B outstanding shares, a 5.39% decrease from 2019.\n\nIn March 2021, Intel had 4.096B outstanding shares, a 5.01% decrease from 2020.\n\n**Competition/Growth Potential**\n\nIntel has a P/E ratio of 12.80. This is low, compared to the average P/E ratio of 22.69 for the rest of the industry. Intel is also still down from it\u2019s stock price high of \\~$68 in April at \\~$57 right now. The global chip shortage has been the main cause of Intel being down, along with fierce competition from AMD. As chip production begins to pick back up, Intel\u2019s stock should begin to go up as well. AMD has been hurt greatly from this chip shortage as well, giving Intel a chance to possibly undercut AMD and lead to growth. \n\nIntel also plans to build more production plants so that they can keep up with the ever-increasing demand for chips. Intel is still ahead of AMD in market share as well. Intel\u2019s new 11th Gen processors are back on top in terms of speed, especially in laptops. A subsidiary of Intel has also landed a deal with Toyota ($TM) to produce radar technology for Toyota. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nIntel seems to be using the chip shortage as a way to come back from their drought. They seem to have been benefiting from it greatly.\n\nIntel is not out yet. They still have the market share and resources to compete with AMD. Intel is undervalued and has the capability to bounce back strong from the chip shortage and also has a chance to finally come out on top as the primary choice in the chip market. \n\nWhat are everyone else\u2019s thoughts? I personally believe that Intel is due for a breakout in the next months, but what does everyone else think? I was also wondering about Qualcomm ($QCOM), what does everyone think about that?",

        "selftext": "Intel is currently trading in the mid 50's at a pe ratio of 12.5,  intel is a matured company and no one is looking for a multibagger here and recently it has lost ground to Amd in the consumer cpu market. Now semiconductor shortages has hit everyone hard and won't be reasonable to expect quick turnarounds.\n\nBut the thing is there are not many players in the market and there is no technological threat, the infrastructure and research requirements to even make a cpu, set the entry barrier pretty high but this has breed incompetence at intel  imo. \n\nNow Intel processors are still at least competitive unlike the past years when amd was beaten to the ground by intel. Now this could be the beginning of the downward road for intel if it can't compete with next few launches  but as of today it is simply lagging behind a bit.\n\nNow intel has had a shaddy / unethical reputation with regards to going to extreme ways to win market share, such as designing to perform on specific benchmarks, poaching competitive talent and anti competitive policies and perhaps is not the best place to work. Current management may also be dragging the stock's perceived value, when you look at Lisa su she has been a revelation at amd. \n\nTalking about the stock it also pays a decent dividend, but paying such amounts of dividend when the company has such a huge debt is questionable. Like why won't there be much better use of the money being paid? Also the interest will pile on like this makes no sense?\n\nI think a structural change at intel is the one thing which can revive the stock and the company else amd might do what intel once did to amd, kinda what goes around comes around. What's your take?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Personally I would go no where close to an intel cpu to build a pc/ gaming laptop, perhaps this is the jist which the price reflects.",

        "selftext": "Quick DD.  A few days ago, rumors started popping up that Intel is looking into buying chipmaker SiFive.  SiFive is a designer of chips that are based on the RISC-V architecture, an attempt to bring open-source standards to semiconductor design making it cheaper and accessible to customers.  This would give Intel an opportunity to keep pace with Nvidia, which is in the process of acquiring Arm(could potentially be blocked by regulators).  SiFive is currently valued at 500 million, while Intel has 22.375 billion in cash on hand.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason this interests me is the options activity today, specifically the $62 strike expiring July 2.  As of last Friday, the open interest was sitting at 223.  Today, the volume at that strike and date was almost 59,694.  That's a huge increase in interest.  The 7/9 $62 strike had an open interest of 134 from Friday, and a volume of 1,750 today.  There is also a shitload volume and open interest(40,000 for 7/16 $62.50) for each strike from $50-75 strikes for July 16.  All in all, there are 263,557 call contracts open vs 26,969 puts.  IV is around 25% for most of these contracts as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1yskugpq0c571.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fa94df3038ee170e68929da7c361d4284f1c32c\n\nThe daily chart shows its been stuck in the $56-58 range since May 21, and just broke through that $58 resistance today.  There is also a big fucking gap from $59-62 that needs to be filled.  This looks extremely promising to me, and if it is confirmed that Intel is planning to acquire SiFive in the next few days or next week, I think we could see some significant upside very quickly, and if that happens, those calls expiring in 2-3 weeks will go in the money and this fucker will fly when market makers buy shares to hedge.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice, do your own DD.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 3, 2021**\n\nStocks dipped today, with the three major indexes pulling back after a recent run of gains in the last two weeks. Seems like after the recent run of gains we are seeing some profit taking across the board. I see no real reason for the dip given that new economic data released today was overwhelmingly positive. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for May\u2019s Job Report slated to be released tomorrow.\n\nAmid negotiations with Republican lawmakers regarding the proposed infrastructure bill, today, the Washington Post reported that President Biden was open to reconsidering his previous proposal to raise the corporate tax rate to from 21% to 28%. This proposed increase has been one of the main sticking points during negotiations. Now it is reported Biden would recommend a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. \n\nWe got two pieces of good news in the labor market today. On one hand, according to a report by payroll processing firm ADP, the private sector added 978,000 jobs in May, well ahead of consensus estimates of 650,000. On the other hand, according to the Labor Department\u2019s Weekly Jobless claim report, showed 385,000 new jobless claims, roughly in-line with 387,000 estimate and a fresh pandemic low, a great sign that the labor market is improving as the economy continues to recover. \n\nThese reports set the stage for the official May Jobs Report set to be released tomorrow by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which will be critical in determining the pace of economic recovery and whether the Federal Reserve will consider tapering monetary support in the near future. The April Job Report was extremely disappointing, showing only 266,000 jobs added compared to the 1 million expected, and marking a sharp deceleration compared to March. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Extremely volatile trading continued in AMC, which saw it\u2019s stock price recover from roughly 30% down to more than 10% up and only to dip again towards the end of the day. Other \u201cmeme stocks\u201d traded in similar patterns after rocketing up in the last few days. \n* AMC issues and additional 11 million shares today, with the company taking advantage of its surging stock price. \n* Boeing Co Chief Executive Dave Calhoun on Thursday pointed to potential \"supply constraints\" beginning in the summer after a \"more robust\" recovery from the coronavirus-related downturn than he had imagined, another sign that demand is catching up in many industries faster than supply as the economy roars back from the coronavirus-induced recession.\n* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue\n* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. \n* Jack Ma's Ant Group has been approved to run a consumer finance company, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said Thursday. This is one of the first step of Ant's forced restructuring after China pulled the plug on its $35 billion IPO in October 2020. It also means the company will be regulated more like a traditional financial entity, giving authorities more oversight over company operations\n* **\\*\\*Please note that the current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes.\\*\\***\n* Cigna[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CI&amp;src=cashtag_click)(CI)target raised by Morgan Stanley from $254 to $321 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "President Biden\u2019s $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal includes $620 billion in transportation spending with $174 billion invested in the electric vehicle (EV) market. Biden\u2019s plan will enable automakers to spur domestic supply chains from raw materials to parts, retool factories and give consumers point-of-sale rebates and tax incentives to buy affordable American-made EVs. This will establish grant and incentive programs for state and local governments and the private sector to build a national network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030.\n\nAutomakers such S Ford, General Motors and Nikola are competing with big tech companies like Amazon, Alphabet, Intel Corporation, and Nvidia Corporation to get in the EV game.\n\nAnd one company stands to gain from all of this... WKSP (Worksport Ltd). \n\nWorksport is a globally recognized designer and producer of truck bed covers. They are a disruptive innovator thanks to their mobile solar technology \u2014 the TerraVis.\n\nTheir technology provides solar power to over 50 million light trucks currently on the roads today and is a major source of clean energy to recharge upcoming EV trucks. The TerraVis can provide up to 30% or more of the power needed for the average daily commute.\u00a0\n\nThe TerraVis system is a first-of-its-kind mobile solar power generation system, generating up to 1kWh of mobile power off-grid. The TerraVis Cor battery system takes power from the cover and stores it in modular battery packs \u2014 storing 1.5 kWh of energy in up to 4 batteries that can be transported in the truck bed using the mounting system.\n\nThe TerraVis Cor can also act as a standalone consumer product \u2014 which makes it available for purchase even if you\u2019re not a truck owner. The system will allow the same level of freedom from a power grid, being chargeable via any wall outlet, solar panel or 12V power source.\n\nWorksport has the early mover advantage and is leveraging the TerraVis system and its position as a Tier 1 original equipment manufacturer to secure future partnerships and distribution of its conventional truck bed tonneau covers. They\u2019ve already secured a partnership with Nissan. \n\nThanks to their partnership with Ontario Tech University Worksport has access to the world-class ACE Testing facility, collaborating with the OTU research team. \n\nWorksport will complete validation and fine-tuning for TerraVis pre-launch in Q4 of this year, and accelerate toward full manufacturing in 2022 (if not sooner). \n\nTerraVis Cor has already entered the production prototype phase with the first pre-production prototype expected to be ready by early Q3 2021. The prototype system(s) will be fully operational and is expected to mirror the commercial model.\n\nFinally, in April the CEO announced that Worksport had filed for listing on the NASDAQ and will be issuing a common stock and warrant offering as part of that listing... which would make them available on the NASDAQ in 2021.\n\nWKSP is currently trading at $0.64/share over the counter; after a $0.20 increase in share price today.\n\nHappy investing!",

        "selftext": "Novice investor here, 22 years old, stable job with spare capital every month for investing. Been thinking about this strategy for about a year now and have tested it out with minor success, wanted feedback and the potential whys of how this could go wrong before I go heavily into it. This is also gonna be alot so I\u2019ll put a TLDR below.\n\nMain point of this strategy, a robinhood covered call wheel, is it is very low risk (focusing on mostly blue chips), with potentially very high returns, especially if you are willing to never sell at a loss. The only catch is that this strategy will work best in a slightly bullish market, not too bullish and not too bearish, or alternatively with only stocks that have a slightly bullish trend. \n\nIf you are not too familiar with how options and covered calls work you may have a hard time following and I apologize in advance but I will try my best.\n\nI will discuss the mathematics part momentarily and why the returns can be potentially very high (as high as 20-40% annually). \n\n*** Skim this next part if you are already familiar with selling covered calls ***\n\nThe basic premise is selling short term covered calls, for anyone who was in the same boat as I was and not too familiar with options, is I would buy 100 shares of a company I believe will have a slightly bullish trend for at least the next few weeks or months, and then the same day I buy those 100 shares, sell an option for someone to buy those shares at let\u2019s say 5% above what I paid for it, they receive the option to buy my shares if it hits that strike price at lets say 2 weeks from now, I immediately receive the premium. \n\nNot ideal case #1: So I just sold the covered call for 2 weeks from now, the only way I can lose money now is if the stock price drops in the next 2 weeks more then amount of money I made from getting the premium. Even so, I keep the 100 shares, and when that option expires I sell another covered call, always above what I paid for. In that case, I keep raking in premiums (though they will diminish if the stock continues to fall in price) and I keep the shares. I will never sell at a loss, and I just repeat the process.\n\nNot ideal case #2: I sell the covered call 2 weeks from now, the stock soars above the call\u2019s strike price I set. I have to sell those 100 shares, but I\u2019m still selling above what I paid for, and I still keep the premium. I lost out on potential gains by having to sell, but I secured gains and I can move onto a different stock now, or wait for that stock to drop to a price im comfortable buying back in at and repeat.\n\nIdeal case: I sell the covered call for 2 weeks from now, the stock stays the same price throughout those 2 weeks or jumps sightly up in value, but doesn\u2019t hit the strike price. Perfect, I now keep the premium, keep the 100 shares, and after researching the stock and making my prediction for what it will be at, sell another covered call 2 weeks from now. I repeat this for as long as possible until one of the two cases above happens.\n\nSo there is the main premise for my strategy. The variables are the following:\n- Finding the ideal slightly-bullish stock\n- Finding the right strike price to sell the covered call\n- Finding stocks that aren\u2019t too volatile but have high valued option prices\n- Acquiring the capital needed to make the biggest returns (I will explain this below)\n\nBefore I am judged for using Robinhood, consider the Robinhood Gold margin rate. 2.5% annually. That is the most competitive margin rate on the market, compared to Fidelity\u2019s 7%, Schwabs starting 8%, and most other financial institutions around the same rate. \n\nThis is why I pick Robinhood, despite it\u2019s controversies. I can effectively double my money for only 2.5% interest, and because this is such a low risk strategy because it is primarily using bluechips, there is very little risk of losing money and owning a debt to Robinhood. \n\nNow, time for the good part, the math, and why I like this strategy so much. I like to use excel to pick various blue chips and see how much I can potentially make and how much capital is required to do so.\n\nFor this example I will use the bluechip IT company Intel (INTC). \n\n*** EXAMPLE ***\nINTC is as of now currently trading at 55.67 a share, for simplicity I will round it up to 56. After doing my research, I feel like this stock fits my strategy well, so I want to buy 100 shares of it to start the wheel process. It will cost $5,600, but by using margin I only put in $2,800. I now analyze their options that expire a week from now. I pick the $58 strike price option which is going for about $.30 a share. I sell the option, collect the premium (100 x $.30 = $30.) And now I wait. 1 week later, Intel price remained about the same. I keep the $30 and I sell another call for next week, and rinse and repeat. I just made $120 safely in a month, from an initial investment of $2800. That is a 4% return in a month. Do that for a year and you can see why earlier I made those return predictions of 20-40%. \n\nAnyways, that pretty much wraps up my strategy. The past few months I have made a safe few hundred already on blue chips just from an initial investment of about $5000. \n\nI would love to hear any other investors thoughts, expertise, criticisms, or feedback on this.\n\nTLDR; using Robinhood\u2019s 2.5% margin to sell blue chip covered calls for relatively high profit and low risk returns in a slightly bullish market.",

It is considered a solid play due to its consistent and predictable geology and recoveries relative to drilling and completion costs. Long story short, it is not a risky play in terms of exploration coming up unsuccessful, which is a plague in the industry, and on a energy company's books.\n\n**Marcellus Shale**\n\n[Map from USGS.Gov ](https://preview.redd.it/3t7p5l7rvw471.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33338104ed93cad1c534b25d3c246bef9b1eab0a)\n\n**As of year-end 2020, AR had the following assets in the Marcellus Shale:**\n\n\\-515,000 net acres located primarily in northern West Virginia, which is strategically located bordering near Ohio and PA.\n\n\\-Operation of 1000 producing horizontal wells\n\n\\-17.6 Tcfe (trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent) of net proved reserves.\n\n\\-1,877 undeveloped core drilling locations.\n\n**UTICA SHALE**\n\n[Map from USGS.gov](https://preview.redd.it/prvb7y0zvw471.jpg?width=497&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db938aaa349215dcde90aada176653f08cec5724)\n\nNow on to the Utica Shale, which is located a few thousand feet below the Marcellus Shale. Think of the Utica Shale as that girl in High School that you knew was going to be a smoke show but she hung out with the Drama Club and was a lil too quick witted for you at the time. Yes, we all know that this was mostly due to the amount of bong hits you did in your buddy's Honda Accord when out for lunch. I digress. Back to the Utica Shale and the great state of Ohio, where Antero has 91,000 net acres, 200 horizontal wells currently producing, 2.0 tcfe (here I'll write it again but remember it this time, trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent), and 494 *undeveloped* drilling locations. I italicized undeveloped because AR knows how big of a play Utica will be down the road. Also, touching on the critical importance of location, location. location, AR's acreage is located bordering West Virginia and PA. To emphasize the importance of their foothold, here are links showing AR's locations in reference to a map of heat spots for natural resources.\n\n[Antero Resources Corp.

This executive order would require major suppliers to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and related risks. With this being put into play and the goal of net-zero emissions goal by 2050, as well as cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, Antero is in a very good position.\n\nIt is my belief that with AR planning on being net-zero by 2025, and being positioned geographically where they are in the U.S. they will somehow benefit from the Infrastructure Plan if/when it goes through. According to Forbes, prior to the pandemic, the economic boom that kicked off in SE Ohio at the Utica Shale around 2011 resulted in $86B in new capital investments and created over 200,000 new jobs for Ohio citizens by the end of 2019. Unemployment rates that had stood as high as 15.5% in 2009 dropped into the 5-6% range ten years later. It seems to me that the NG Industry, if done correctly in terms of the environment, could be a major benefactor from an administration looking to create a ton of jobs.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n[5 Year Chart](https://preview.redd.it/6zca80bixw471.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48b46d66afc5871acd596af68dbaa9be016a7c6b)\n\n\\-AR is reducing debt on the balance sheet\n\n\\-A current leader in the industry in terms of Environmental, Social &amp; Governance \n\n\\-Notorious for keeping expectations low and over-performing also known by another term, described by John Beckwith in  [Wedding Crashers](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/f45a8bb4-c30d-4a9b-97e7-223cab02bc4d)\n\n**Positions:**\n\nLong Shares &amp; January 21, 2022 $20c @ $1.20\n\n*Not Financial Advise as I am on beer number 5.*",

        "selftext": "Everyone loves money and the casino is shutting off some games.\n\n**Key words to understand:**\n\n**Inflation-** Things cost more, the purchasing power of the dollar is less. You probably already notice that  materials have cost more. Inflation as mentioned by the FEDs is temporary and here to stay, for now. Think materials like stock, people hoard, lack of supply, lumber hits $1000 per 1000 ft. The overestimated inflation is now coming back to to find a midpoint. Because inflation is here we need to take a look at the return on investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;!Inflation short term, it's already here! Commodities are dumping from being over inflated. !&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interest Hike** \\- Everyone is talking about whether or not JPOW is going to raise interest rates to counter inflation. By raising rates you would make people spend less because you get more of a return from savings than spending. If people spend less, then demand goes and deflation will occur.\n\n&gt;!Interest rate hikes adjust from 2024 to 2023. More inflation?! Possibly, but the 5 year yields are going up and the 30 year yields are going down. More return on investments for 5 year vs 30 year. What does this mean?! Borrowing short term money will cost you more than borrowing long term money. The 5 year and 30 year. Growth is slowing so you get punished for not growing.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reverse Repo-** June just provided the highest reverse repo of all time. Reverse repo is the buying of securities or equities and and promising to only sell them at a higher price. Think stocks now. Where will money go if you are guaranteeing you'll only sell at a higher price.\n\n&gt;!Repos and reverse repos are short term borrowed money. With such high reverse repos, better make sure you beat that increased short term rate.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TOUR OF CASINO**\n\nYou walk into the casino, the thermostat is set at a mild temperature. Maybe a little too warm. The lights turn on. There is suddenly a halt and an announcement that there are table staff changes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's take a tour of the casino and look at the systems in the casino and see where we are positioned.\n\n**Slots** (&gt;!Dividend Stocks!&lt;): People tend to like dividend stocks because the companies pay you for holding the shares. Dividends generally pay 2-4%. The issue here is that in an economic slow down, companies may see a reduced revenue and the dividend payout might not beat the interest rates. If you get 2% in a savings account, why risk the biscuit for the dividend?\n\n**Roulette** (&gt;!Defense Pharma &amp; Research Heavy Stocks!&lt;): To save money during inflation, there are generally budget cuts to stop spending. This affects the defense sector in many ways. Future grants are generally pulled and R&amp;D is usually cut.\n\n**Craps** (&gt;!ETFs, recovery, inelastic holdings!&lt;): Now sure what to hold, want to be safe, let someone else do it for you. ETFs generally hold some form of dividend stock or businesses that stay flat for stable growth. At times like this where there are still better investments on the table like hiked treasuries, foreign investments, and growth stonks. Who likes watching money burn?\n\n**Blackjack (**&gt;!Meme stocks, trenders!&lt;**):** Memes don't last forever, but we will forever remember the meme. The come and go, that's just the way it is. Big money, small money, no money, doesn't ever want to bag hold. Just here to win it and make a killing. With money moving away from the stock market going out, volume will be a lot less. It's one on one with the dealer. How many hands do you want to play?\n\n**Poker (**&gt;!Growth Stocks!&lt;**):**  So you're telling me growth stocks don't need to spend much on R&amp;D?! YES! Let's narrow down the list that has shown exceptional growth. Got dealt two aces, might as well push everyone else out. Ace 1( Growing Revenue YoY), Ace 2 (Growing footprint YoY)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich game do you want to play? Seems like the casino is shutting down some of it's services and the others don't have many players.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I can't bluff well:**\n\nYou start playing **slots** and accumulate into year 2030. &gt;!You're finally at your breakeven point, the bullmarket starts. Oh the joy of saving and making null.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Roulette** baby, here we go! Yolo is the only way of life, either get rich or die trying. &gt;!You died!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThrow ten darts and land three, win some lose some. It's only money. **Craps**, time to roll the dice. You start winning, then you start losing. Then you win some more. &gt;!Radioshack bled out by accident. Fuck my life.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlackjack. Man, I don't really want to play alone, let's find a crowd.&gt;! You find a good seat with a lot of players. The table suddenly goes out of service. You panic and rush to the nearest one and go all in. You died.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAh.... you chose (**Poker)**\n\nNot a bad choice. Fun game.\n\nLet's look at what growth stocks there are that are generating great income and expanding the foot print.\n\nThere's large caps like: &gt;!SQ, FB, NFLX, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN!&lt;\n\nThere's small and mid caps like: &gt;!FVRR, ETSY, PINS!&lt;\n\nThere's proven foreign growth investments like: &gt;!BABA, JD, TSM!&lt;\n\nThere's semis who can't meet current demand: &gt;!AMD, NVDA!&lt;, &gt;!oops \\~\\~INTC drank one too many drinks \\~\\~!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n14 choices!? So many to choose from! Takes step back. (**over 9000 tickers**)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I'll buy the dip, no worries**....  &gt;!who says there will have to be a dip for growth stocks?!&lt;",

        "selftext": "The global semi-conductor shortage, aka chip shortage, has been crippling many industries. Demand for chips is continuing to outstrip supply and the car industry is longer the only one feeling the pain. Many auto-makers are actually limiting the amount of cars produced in 2021, including Ford recently who announced they will be canceling weeks worth of production of the F-150.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThere are a few factors at play giving analysts the impression that this shortage may last until early 2022. There\u2019s a few KEY points that come to mind:\n\n* Most chips are produced overseas: Covid-related delays in shipping ports have effected supply coming into the United States.\n* China has been stock-piling chips: Chinese businesses have bought an absurd amount of chip-producing equipment (roughly $32 billion) in an effort to protect themselves from further US sanctions.\n* Demand for electronic products have soared.\n* Often over-looked, consumers don\u2019t realize the amount of chips it takes to build cars in 2021. The trend is continuing in the same direction as many analysts expect the automative industry to begin predominantly developing cars with network connectivity.\n\nThis leaves an opportunity for those willing to look past the hardship some of these companies are experiencing of being unable to meet demand. The semi-conductor industry is expected to grow at CAGR of roughly \\~9% over the next 7-8 years. I see this as a relatively conservative number and it is my opinion that we are heading into a super-cycle of chip upgrades, processing power, and memory devices. Here are a few reasons:\n\n1. We are already seeing noticeable shift in demand and the way consumers are interacting in a new digital world.\n2. These electronics are becoming faster and more powerful, which simply requires a larger quantity &amp; quality of chips.\n3. More and more devices rely on connectivity and the car industry is now making it\u2019s way onto a similar path.\n4. Following Nvidia\u2019s earnings call we are seeing a large rise in trends for AI and machine-learning which is leading to increased demand for the required components.\n5. The rise of crypto mining will also play a role in the increased demand.\n\n**The Players**\n\nMany of the chip-related plays have already seen convincing growth over the last 12 months. However, several names have recently followed the markets to the downside and currently pose a potential good entry point. This secular trend in semi-conductor demand over the next several years is here to stay.\n\nMy semis watchlist is holding some familiar names: Applied Materials (AMAT), ASML Holdings (ASML), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Nvidia (NVDA), Intel (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM).\n\nThe ones that make my shortlist are the following: NVDA, AMD, TSM, and AMAT. Here\u2019s a look at the 2-year chart for the 4 tickers mentioned above.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xr0kge6rq2371.png?width=2380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4beece1276b8c383ed5a2c0cca07bf40f42da11\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is clear the secular trend in computer chips and processors have contributed greatly to the growth of these companies. Let\u2019s take a look at a shorter time-frame. Here\u2019s the 3-month chart for the same list of tickers.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pip83wxqq2371.png?width=2388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b353b714f1958233646a57ee5680bf2385ee2a3d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at it from another angle we see AMD and TSM have been lagging behind the performance of AMAT and NVDA, who are on a nearly identical path. TSM is a leading manufacturer of chips and actually supplies most of AMD\u2019s chips. They are based in Taiwan and there have been some concerns over the potential invasion of China. Setting those concerns aside these companies may still experience strong growth. My plays right now are in AMD and TSM and I will feel comfortable adding to any of the names I mentioned in this article if the right entry point shows itself.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nI would love to say here\u2019s why \u201cx\u201d company is in a better financial position than company \u201cy\u201d, but in this case I believe the high demand for semiconductors will benefit most names participating in this industry. Of course, not every company is made equal so please do your own research before investing in any stocks. In my opinion, this industry is in an upward secular trend and demand remains in-tact, providing tailwinds to the participants.\n\nKeep an eye on earnings reports and financial data of companies that BUY these products. Look at phone, tablet, computer manufacturers (Apple), cloud server providers, Google server expansion (also server chip REPLACEMENT rates, which is a thing), and AI/Machine learning projects (autonomous driving, video analysis, big-data processors). It may be years before the growth slows in this industry and these players will stand to largely benefit.",

This would be earlier than announced by the Federal Open Market Committee this week. The committee's consensus outlook was for up to two hikes in 2023.\n\n\"We're expecting a good year, a good reopening. But this is a bigger year than we were expecting, more inflation than we were expecting,\"\u00a0Bullard told CNBC. \"I think it's natural that we've tilted a little bit more hawkish here to contain inflationary pressures.\"\n\nNasdaq, S&amp;P 500 Fall\n\nThe Nasdaq was faring better than the other major indexes, but still fell around 0.6%.

        "selftext": " To understand the history\u00a0of MP Materials (Mountain Pass), you need to study its past history. Most casual observers never quite made the correlation, but if you live in Southern California and have driven to Las Vegas you\u2019ve driven over Mountain Pass. It's the last mountain range in the Mojave\u00a0Desert that you drive over on highway\u00a015 just before you reach the state line of Nevada. Mountain Pass is the current only rare earth mining and processing site in the western hemisphere.\u00a0\n\n**About rare earth metals** \n\nWhat are rare earth metals?\u00a0They are a group of 17 elements: lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium all found in rare deposits. The thing about these \u201crare\u201d metals is that they are actually quite common in the earth\u2019s crust. However, the difficulties in the extraction process of these metals is what gives them their name. These metals are used in just about anything electronic, rechargeable batteries, magnets, computers, lasers, fiber optics, superconductors and vehicles. Not only are they used in electric vehicles in batteries and motors, but they are also used in catalytic converters. Over the last 5-6 years prices of rare earth metals have risen because they are \u201crare\u201d, but they are also very costly to refine in environmentally\u00a0friendly ways. This has also spurred the growth of catalytic\u00a0converter theft which has become a growing nuisance.\u00a0Recyclers have been paying up to $250 per unit to almost anyone that's\u00a0willing to supply them. Nearly 60% of rare earths metals that were imported in 2018 were [used for catalytic converters](https://geology.com/articles/rare-earth-elements/).\u00a0\n\nThe majority of the global \u201crare metal\u201d supply is owned by China, thus they control most of the supply chain. Due to China\u2019s dominance in this sector the United States, along with the rest of the world, is very susceptible to China\u2019s pricing or supply disruption (tariffs/export ban/pricing pressure). According to this [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-rareearth-explainer/explainer-u-s-dependence-on-chinas-rare-earth-trade-war-vulnerability-idUSKCN1T42RP), \u201cThe United States imported $160 million of rare earth compounds and metals in 2018, up nearly 17% from 2017. Around 60% of it was used in catalysts for oil refining and in vehicle engines.\u201d\n\n**The SP@C merger**\n\nOn November 17, of 2020 Fortress\u00a0Value Acquisition\u00a0Corp (FVAC) closed a SP@C\u00a0merger deal with [$345 Million in cash in trust and a $200 Million](https://investorintel.com/markets/technology-metals/technology-metals-intel/us-rare-earths-industry-comeback-begun-mp-materials-announces-nyse-listing-via-merger-fvac/?print=print) PIPE led by the SP@C King himself Chamath Palihapitiya. The combined company was set at a valuation of $1.5 Billion with over $500 million in cash to fund the growth strategy and was labeled\u00a0MP Materials.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Government\u2019s acceptance of clean energy and strengthening supply chains**\n\nOver the term of the Trump presidency the trade war with China had intensified leaving companies with tariffs\u00a0and questionable supply chains. This economic\u00a0race had set the stage for MP Materials. With tariffs on imports and unfavorable pricing from China on rare earth materials it leaves a very volatile question mark for US manufacturers and other related companies. Flash forward to 2021 with the Biden administration, not only is the government trying to turn the table on [strengthening its own supply chains](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/24/fact-sheet-securing-americas-critical-supply-chains/), it's also trying to eliminate\u00a0its vulnerabilities. The pandemic has shown us the necessities of medicine, essential goods and things like semiconductors\u00a0should be made in the United States and this was reinforced by the executive order signed by President Biden in February. \n\nOn the list of critical goods to be evaluated within the first 100 days was specifically rare earth metals. This clearly demonstrates how MP Materials being the only miner and refiner of these materials in the United States could profit. The other larger mention on the executive\u00a0order was large capacity batteries such as those used in electric cars. I would highly recommend reviewing the order as there are so many industries that were mentioned that all use rare earth metals related to MP Materials.\n\nA long term investor may see the importance of rare earth metals in terms of being a critical factor to the US economy. After the 100 day review is completed somewhere around the beginning of June there is no doubt MP Materials will be listed as a critical\u00a0company and will have an overwhelming support of the US Government. Not only will this secure MP Materials as a local monopoly, but it will solidify local business supply chains for years to come. Also, with a critical infrastructure bill in the works the company could be on the list to receive subsidies to level the playing field with China. MP Materials\u2019 rare earth concentrate product represents [15% of the world\u2019s supply](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200715005276/en/MP-Materials-Leading-Producer-Rare-Earth-Materials).\u00a0\n\n**Expected increase in demand of rare metals**\n\nWith the rise of electric vehicles starting to enter the manufacturing plants of US automakers the demand of rare earth metals will be growing *exponentially*. If you take a moment to look at the slide deck of the investor presentation from MP Materials, the business is currently in early days of stage 2. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMP Materials is mining NdPr materials (mainly Neodymium and Praseodymium), which power the **strongest types of rare earth magnets**. These magnets are used to power EVs (electric vehicles) and many industrial processes. This is why the mining of these rare earth metals play a vital role in the EV market. After mining these materials, MP Materials then **ships them to China** (they rely on plants in China to actually process the mined materials) while incurring a VAT tax and tariffs to be refined and is still turning a profit. MP Materials is set to open the largest NdPr separation facility in the world in 2022 and are putting stage II into motion. NdPr is an essential piece used in magnets especially in EV motors. Stage III shows they are looking to actually produce NdPr magnets onsite sometime past 2025 which would make them even more vertically\u00a0integrated.\n\nDemand from electric vehicles, wind turbines, and other technologies is hitting an inflection point. The shift in clean energy and electrification of transport, globally, will be an important theme *over the next decade*. The demand for rare earths will rapidly outpace the current levels of production and supply. Take a look at the forecasted price of NdPr over the next several years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the MP Materials investor presentations, we\u2019ve pulled some of the charts where they forecast demand for electric vehicle magnets due to the high demand of EV sales compared to regular vehicle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is clear that this is not just a \u201crare earth metal\u201d play, but they will be particularly focused on NdPr which will be driven by clean energy industries, and more specifically electric vehicles.\n\n**Potential Risks**\n\nA company that entails rare earth mining, such as MP Materials, will be subject to typical risks that surround commodities. Right now we are in a \u201csuper-cycle\u201d, but how long will that last? Since China also supplies up to 80% of the world\u2019s rare earth materials there is also the potential of risks associated with the pricing pressure. Lastly, there are some advancements in synthetically creating materials that replace these rare metals, but not enough conclusions have been drawn in the validity of this topic.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nNow like any SP@C it's hard to give accurate projections more than 3 years out, but the rare earth metal market has had prices nearly double this year which has led to a pretty sharp increase in the stock price already. Not to mention, unlike some SP@Cs this is a company that is already generating products and profits. The most recent analyst coverage has near term price targets between $37 and $57. In the last 3 weeks there has been a rise in the 10 Year yield and that has made the technology sector and SP@Cs become unfavorable. Like several other stocks, it appears MP Materials is the baby being thrown out with the bathwater, the stock has retraced from its $51.77 52-week high significantly. Now the company did report an\u00a0excellent 4th quarter surpassing expectations on March\u00a018th. More recently the company announced it wanted to raise 600 million in a senior debt offering that would not come due until 2026. There was some concern that this could dilute the stock when it comes due, but this is over 5 years from now. This free cash will allow MP Materials to speed up its timeline and reduce costs by operating its own NdPr separation facility. With the speculation of a commodity\u00a0super cycle and rising inflation coming the\u00a0price of rare earth metals will continue to strengthen. This appears to be a potentially great value investment, and the upcoming 100 day review in June from the Biden administration will only further strengthen the importance of MP Materials in the US Economy.\n\nHaving said that, the company\u2019s original valuation in the merger was set to 1 billion dollars (1.5 billion minus 500 million to fund expansions). At the moment of writing, the company\u2019s market cap is sitting at roughly 6 billion. We want to determine if the current valuation is pricing the company at fair value, given the potential the company has. This is not an easy task given the complexities of the rare earth metal industry and also the lack of \u201ccompetitors\u201d. This is not a \u201cgrowth stock\u201d, nor is it strictly a commodity play. In my opinion we can look at it as a play on Neodymium and Praseodymium (NdPr) which is where the pricing outlook and largest growth expected over the next 10 years is very strong. It is my opinion that MP Material\u2019s growth will be somewhat reflected by the demand of the EV market as well as the progression of other clean energy industries where the use of these metals is critical. If the EV market were to increase tenfold, I think MP Materials would also benefit greatly by proxy.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\n1. China currently has somewhat of a monopoly on rare earth materials, currently providing about 80% of the world\u2019s supply. This allows them the capability to create pricing pressure (which they have done in the past) and control the supply to hurt their competitors.\n2. At this moment in time, MP Materials is currently mining the materials, then sending them off to China for processing all while still maintaining a profit. MP Materials will eventually be processing these rare earth materials in their own processing plants. The company is working on vertical integration for the entire process from start to finish.\n3. The most significant of these metals is NdPr, which power some of the strongest magnets used specifically in the electric vehicles and wind turbines (clean energy).\n4. MP Materials stock price is already trading at a hefty valuation relative to what the stock price was post-merger. However, this company\u2019s revenues will also be reflected by the strong demand (and trend) driven by the increase in EV sales.\n5. Considering these metals will play a vital role in many tech industries moving forward, they may receive substantial support from the government. The Biden administration has already put in motion a plan to strengthen it\u2019s own supply chains to remove vulnerabilities. Rare earth metals are specifically on this list.\n\nPositions: Long MP in common stock",

        "selftext": "What am I missing here about the semiconductor stocks?\nSo Intel had a recent earnings call where they said manufacturing will not be able to meet demand for at least another two years which dropped the prices instantly but you would think they would go up because of price increases. Also they announced they will be buying back a large number of stocks so they dropped the stock price in order to buy them back at a cheaper price and nobody is talking about it. These stocks are undervalued in my opinion (Intel, Nvidia, AMD) because the United States Taxpayers are also going to invest heavily in them in the next 5 years. The main points I find is the substrates they need to manufacture the chips are hard to get now but they should just be passing that price down so idk what's keeping the stocks down and I cannot find any discussion on this.",

        "selftext": "Everyone has probably heard about ENZC. \n\nIf you haven't it's a biotech company that just really started in its **current state** just over 6 months ago. It's essentially a merger between two companies Immunotech &amp; Bioclonetics which the details are beyond the scope of this post but you can read about in their filings on the OTCMarkets website.\n\nThere was a MASSIVE run to its ATH (All time high) earlier this year (along with most of the market) which also resulted in a correction and created a bunch of bag holders and brought out a lot of bears/shorts spewing a lot of nonsense (*in a lot of tickers and not just ENZC*).\n\nFairly recently **Intel** (*The company that make the processors and stuff*) **co-authored** a white paper with Enzolytics and you can easily find it on their website.\n\nThere is also a video available on YouTube hosted by James Hicks (Sr. Partner Solutions Engineer @ Dell) which is Part I of a series that features Gaurav Chandra (*COO/VP of AI &amp; R&amp;D for Enzolytics*) Clifton Roberts (*Global Director of Governments, Market &amp; Trade / Global Business Acceleration @ Intel*), &amp; Nikhil Deshpande PhD (*Director of Security / High Performance Computing &amp; Graph Analytics*). They talk about the white paper, the AI, and the science behind Enzolytics as well as hinting at the future potential.\n\nThe stock has been trading sideways for quite some time after hitting bottom a few weeks ago and has for the past week shown a trend reversal on the daily chart. In fact we have 6 days of steady upward trend with a ton of catalysts coming up and that can arrive literally any day. \n\nTwitter &amp; StockTwits have recently been going absolutely nuts the past several days and as far as I can tell, **there are a lot of new eyes on this thing**. \n\nAlso, there are several catalysts all the way through the end of the year including animal trials, and milestone related partnerships.\n\nI don't want to overwhelm anyone so I'll leave it at that, but there is far more going on if you care to research further.\n\nCheers!",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 4, 2021**\n\nStocks rose today as investors digested the May Job Report, which showed non-farm payrolls rise by less than expected for the second straight month. Market participants seem to be interpreting the back-to-back miss in job gains for two consecutive months as meaning the Federal Reserve will keep the current accommodative monetary policy in place until the labor market shows robust signs of improvement.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s May Job Report showed the economy gained 559,000 non-farm payrolls, a substantial increase compared to April but still below estimates of 650,000. For months, the Federal Reserve has consistently reiterated it wants to see a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports, like the one in March, before policy adjustments are seriously considered. This is why technology and growth stocks, which would be affected the most by potential adjustments in policy, outperformed today. Former Chase Chief Economist Anthony Chan said, \u201cWhat I see here is somewhat of a \u2018goldilocks\u2019 overall economy. I see that employment is increasing. With regard to the reason why the market is excited, it's because it's telling us that the economy is not blistering hot, that it's actually going to be opening up pretty gradually. I think that's important.\" \n\nRecent economic data has been good overall. A stronger-than-expected ADP private payrolls report and weekly jobless claims report released Thursday each underscored firming rehiring trends across the economy, with a smaller share of individuals becoming newly unemployed for pandemic-related reasons. Another wave of vaccinations has taken place, reopenings have picked up, and businesses have been scrambling to bring back workers to keep pace with surging demand. \n\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said that the economy was \"still quite a ways off from maintaining the substantial further progress we\u2019re really looking for in terms of adjustments to our asset purchase program.\"\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Marqeta Inc. (MQ), plans on IPOing soon at a valuation of $12 billion offers card-issuing technology that lets businesses build out these functions. The company\u2019s largest client is Square (SQ), which accounted for roughly 70% of revenue last year.\n* Square (SQ) is considering making a hardware wallet for bitcoin, CEO Jack Dorsey, said in a tweet. (Jack Dorsey is also the CEO and co-founder of Twitter)\n* GE CEO Larry Culp says the deal to combine its jet-leasing unit and GE Capital Aviation Services with rival AerCap (AER) remains on track to close later this year or early next year. \n* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue\n* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. \n* Sorry, no price target upgrades today",

        "selftext": "**tl;dr:** LRCX will benefit tremendously from the US push to produce semiconductors. Buy shares and LEAPS. \n\n**Position:** 103x LRCX shares with DRIP (dividend reinvestment) and 1x 1/2023 $500c.\n\n**The DD:** \n\n* The push within the US to produce semiconductors (microchips) inside American borders has encouraged companies like INTC, TSMC, and Samsung to commit to building multi-million dollar fab plants (semiconductor factories). \n* The semiconductor shortage in general indicates there is demand for more semis.\n* The 5G and IoT rollouts means semiconductor demand will remain high and manufactories are likely to expand further.\n\nLRCX is well-positioned to make money off this. LRCX builds the machines and does the research that these other companies need to make microchips. Without LRCX, there are no manufactories. And after the fab plants are built, the machines need maintenance. LRCX provides this maintenance at 30%+ margins.\n\n**Fundamentals:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Beats Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/t67m821yap471.png?width=407&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37ee8d9b94a3a0f5bfcb12d1fb6317bb5747c0fa)\n\nLRCX has beat earnings 4/4 of the last quarters. It has the growth potential to continue beating earnings.\n\nAt a 27 P/E ratio, its valuation is average in its industry and has room to climb.\n\n**Technicals:** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Up and to the right](https://preview.redd.it/xwr8epatap471.png?width=559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc38dae385b63dcd764d4509061508a2cf9206ed)\n\nLRCX goes up and to the right. It has the fundamental backing to continue. Demand for shares increases as the stock gets down to $600.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[RSI, MACD, Moving Averages](https://preview.redd.it/85xb9jk9bp471.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e471b714290c3175f09ac20a21b391f4e2ea7b88)\n\nMACD looks like shit, but RSI is positive and LRCX travels along its 50-DMA pretty well. Look to start DCAing into shares around this level and buy more shares or LEAPS as we approach $600.\n\n**Competition:**\n\nAMAT competes with LRCX in most industry segments. However LRCX stands out as the best wafer developer. If you cannot afford LRCX at $600, AMAT is $136. AMAT is also more diversified and is a good alternative choice.\n\nThere are some others including a Dutch company, but AMAT and LRCX are the main competitors in this industry, and they both have a wide moat.",

        "selftext": "Why I think BB is legit\n\nHonest View on BB\n\nApe Research Analyst Report on BB: To the Moon\n\nWhat's up apes, I know the last couple weeks have been life-changing for some of us. As a grad student who grew up on the lower end of the middle class, I recognize how pumped some fo you must feel and commend everyone's brass balls- it's never easy to make money in a casino as heavily manipulated as the free market that is the USA. But turning to BB: it was never meant to be just some squeeze (although its end result could technically be called that if you really wanted too)- it's a retooling company embedded in a crucial sector to the modern global economy.\n\nAnd so while some of us have become capable of retirement in recent weeks, I want to talk about a name that is on the cusp of a resurrection.\n\n# For BB Holders, it's been tough lately.\n\nMany people have harsh memories of Blackberry: it was on the cusp of bankruptcy as recently as 2015. Revenue growth sunk from $20B at its peak in 2011 (82% hardware sales) to under a $1B in the 2010s; $BB stock sunk from a peak of $146 in 2008 to single digits, thanks to negative cash flows and rapidly declining top line growth.\n\n[Not surprising BB ate shit for so long- this useless Etch-a-Sketch was 82&amp;#37; of their revenue in 2011!](https://preview.redd.it/w7dt7c4bwd371.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80e0a1b70f7bad3078d8bb3d3982d69b1d12f1bb)\n\n[It's been a long, tough run for Blackberry shareholders since they ended hardware production\\/sales. The stock has been largely irrelevant for years, falling from a peak of $146 in May 2008 to single digits \\&lt; $5B market cap. But its transition into a cybersecurity company is only beginning to pay fruit, which I believe the market will catch on to very soon. Times are a-changing!](https://preview.redd.it/f5zqz58dwd371.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=763644f3ae3cc922a25d1e06d7d0a295ae5d5ed9)\n\n# A Rebranded Business for the Digital Economy\n\nLike we've seen with the Chads in Gamestoink, successful companies are the ones willing to renounce their fading legacy businesses and embrace initiatives and industries that sit on the cusp of the digital age. Enter Blackberry. Now we all remember Blackberry's legacy business- the handheld pagers that looked like shit, but only quirky people embraced (POTUS and CEOs used Blackberry pagers over iPhones for the longest of times, until Blackberry discontinued its hardware line).\n\nHowever, the primary focus for Blackberry has never changed. Blackberry was always security-centric, and with the installation of CEO John S. Chen in 2013, Blackberry pivoted towards software- a trend that was always going to happen given Apple's prowess in manufacturing superior smartphones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[John S. Chen's my homie. If you're scared about holding BB bags, just reassure yourself that that chin can hold both yours and his. But seriously, he's an innovator, having been credited with \\\\\"Saving Blackberry\\\\\"- pay attention, his vision doesn't end with subsistence.](https://preview.redd.it/l39tl9rfwd371.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91ee66024cfba9e04ea1566f5690aeb57ecd2497)\n\nBut like Ryan Cohen with Gamestop/Chewy, Blackberry recognized it needed to adapt to survive, and that's exactly what it has done under Chen's stewardship. A glimpse at Blackberry today is far different than the pioneer that once controlled 20%+ of the mobile hardware market.\n\n[Revenues have intuitively followed a similar trajectory as Blackberry's market cap. But the transformation under Chen's leadership so far is tangible: after hardware sales alone accounted for 82&amp;#37; of revenue in 2011, the company made a wide U-turn. After establishing \\(and meeting\\) a goal for fiscal 2020 revenue to top $1B again, hardware has fallen to just \\~3&amp;#37; of sales. Enterprise software \\(44&amp;#37;\\), Licensing &amp; IP \\(31&amp;#37;\\), and Technology Solutions \\(22&amp;#37;\\) now dominate BB's topline as of 2020, cementing its push and admittance to the cybersecurity market.](https://preview.redd.it/u9mg373iwd371.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c8790440834c2d2f933eb88018fa6971d95ce0e)\n\n# So what does Blackberry actually do now?\n\nTo be clear, the only people walking around with Blackberry \"phones\" nowadays are old junkies trying to revive some 2000s nostalgia. Blackberry doesn't make that archaic crap anymore. All you need to remember are three phrases when thinking about the new Blackberry: **enterprise software, licensing IP,** and **technology solutions**.\n\n* **Enterprise software** is one of the fastest growing components of BB's cybersecurity offering. It includes products like the Blackberry Enterprise Mobility Suite, which provides endpoint management and BlackBerry AtHoc, a secure communications platform.\n* **Licensing IP** is the segment responsible for the monetization of the Company\u2019s global patent portfolio as well as the mobility licensing operations, which license the BlackBerry brand and device software to handset vendors.\n* **Technology Solutions** is the business that includes BlackBerry QNX embedded software as well as several emerging businesses such as the BlackBerry Radar fleet management solutions.\n\nExciting Partnerships, Soaring Ambitions\n\n*\\*\\*You should really take a look at some of Blackberry's partnerships in the last 2 years- this is not a company that makes shitty pagers anymore, it's the company that embodies \"digital transformation.\"*\n\nTake a look at some of the companies Blackberry is sleeping with and tell me your smooth gorilla brain doesn't swell:\n\n* **Baidu** has an extensive partnership with BB in its autonomous vehicle unit, dating back to 2018. In January 2018, the two companies announced they would [partner](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) to utilize Blackberry QNX's OS as the backbone of Baidu's autonomous system. Blackberry also agreed to help Baidu integrate smartphone integration software for Chinese connected cars (CarLife), conversational AI (DuerOS), and HD maps. In January 2021, these two [expanded](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) their relationship: Blackberry's QNX Neutrino Real-Time OS is being utilized for all future EV models produced with the EV branch of GAC (Guangzhou Automotive Group, yes the C isn't a typo). Pretty exciting stuff to say the least..\n* **Motional**, which is a Hyundai backed AV startup, [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform) in February 2021 its intentions to use BB's Black Channel communications technology for all of Motional's future AVs. A very integral input for Motional and impressive win for Blackberry, being able to ensure safe data communication exchanges within vehicle safety systems is essential for AVs' successful integration in society... otherwise where is the trust in accepting that ride? Not to mention that Apple (*the Tim Apple*) was chirping around with Hyundai and Kia, talking about making a \"smart car,\" *earlier this year!* I guess all the ape memes about Blackberry being a legitimate competitor to Apple shouldn't be sneezed at by Wall St equity research analysts and BB \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs...\n* **AWS**, yes Amazon Web Services (!), is another credible player lining up with Blackberry. Although not quite as exciting as building actual AVs, the work they do is still essential to ensure this dream can actually be realized. In December 2020, the two Chads [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform) a multi-year partnership to develop BB's IVY platform (Intelligent Vehicle Data, yes the \"Y\" is weird, but makes sense for ape leadership), allowing automakers to read sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from the data both in the vehicle and in the cloud.\n\nTake it from Amazon's new CEO, Andy Jassy himself: *\u201cAWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user\u2019s needs and preferences. Through this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.\u201d*\n\n[These geniuses love Blackberry, starting with their most intelligent, scalable business: AWS! Shouldn't you apes like BB as well?](https://preview.redd.it/ktha1d7nwd371.png?width=1218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892b2415869531f1cf47f9c54b6d6e668c252877)\n\nBut why should I stop there? I'm tired of seeing fear-mongering Wall Street hedge funds, investment bankers, and research analysts attempting to push their positions (BB's primary competitors are IBM, Microsoft, VMware, and Mobile Iron, the former 3 of which are all significantly owned by \"institutions\" - &gt;75%) and allege Blackberry is a dying business that makes crappy hardware.\n\n* **Microsoft** (Yes its rival!) even realizes its budding competitor is crafting innovative solutions, announcing a partnership in [October 2020](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management) for Microsoft Teams! Microsoft plans to integrate Blackberry AtHoc, which will allow organizations on Teams to contact, alert, and account for all members of their group directly through Teams should some calamity transpire. Especially as we witness more cyber attacks (the digital economy's biggest threat will stem from this), it will be an all hands-on-deck effort to safeguard the integrity of our software. BB's partnership with Microsoft (and [ServiceNow](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-athoc-and-servicenow-partner-to-deliver-secure-and-re) for incident response management) not only grounds its strong advance to cybersecurity industry disruption, but its diverse agility to penetrate various sectors, ranging from AV/EV, CRM software, IoT, 5G, and so much more.\n* If the corporate pedigree isn't enough for you, I'll end with the **U.S. Air Force**. No, unlike what bulge bracket banks may lead you to believe, BB's revenue stream is well-diversified, as the USAF [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/the-united-states-air-force-chooses-blackberry-spark-for-secure-productivity) a partnership in September 2020. Blackberry Spark, utilized for UEM and UES, will help the Air Force with their secure productivity needs, enabling virtual work environments whilst ensuring premium security. As we face more threats in the cyber space and continue pivoting towards a \"work-from-home environment\" regardless of the permanent trends form Covid, BB's wide-ranging partnerships, from Fortune 500 tech companies to the U.S. military prove it is an essential cog in the 21st century digital economy. Not to mention consistent ARR is exactly what investors (the suits) should be looking for, so what gives with the nasty financial press?\n\n# Blackberry's Financial Trajectory (Revs, Bottom Line, CF)\n\nWe have to take a look at Blackberry's financials, after all that is what this casino allegedly runs on. Luckily, if we ignore what the \"experts\" in Battery Park are shilling, we'll notice Blackberry is not the capsizing Titanic all the research analysts make it out to be. I'll take you into a deeper dive into the top &amp; bottom line with just the facts and my brilliant takes, and y'all can make your own decision on whether BB stock is seriously a pile of rat shit or an emerging growth stud.\n\n[As you might expect, Blackberry's overall top line consistently declined until roughly 2020+ \\(when every single one of these dope partnerships was announced\\). As BB wound down its legacy hardware, handset, and related service products, sales declined nearly $400M over the course of final two years, a marked decline from the near $20B struck in 2011. This trend seems to be on the reverse though: the new partnerships in 2020\\/21 have certainly underscored BB's transition into a software company, a trend even Wall St has had to acknowledge by lifting growth targets for fiscal year 2021. IMO, the $1.2B projected top line figure for '21 is conservative, and I think these figures could start to double, triple, and \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 in 2024+. Let me explain why with more charts:](https://preview.redd.it/3pq5gyspwd371.png?width=874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1a643492be05c1ec2f4830bd0b66b180276b6b3)\n\n[All those dope corporate and military partnerships I highlighted earlier? They mainly fit into BB's Enterprise software\\/services revenue stream, which is now 44&amp;#37; of overall revenue. This is the first component that I believe is going to drive revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and tendies for us and BB in the years to come. We'll first notice that growth in this space really picked up in 2020 for BB, similarly to when their overall topline reversed trend- because this is the soul of 2021 Blackberry! And no, this doesn't even really include the innovative AV\\/EV partnerships, these are just institutional clients like Microsoft, ServiceNow, or Salesforce who want to buy one of Blackberry's SaaS established offerings. Think of the potential addressable market in the years to come: work from home, AI, 5G, IoT, we can keep going- all of these things need to be protected, without security, there is no system- every software, hardware, and appliance company under the sun is going to be lining up because they have no choice. You are adapt or go extinct. I expect BB to continue driving this aspect of its growth in a gargantuan way: think 25-50&amp;#37; growth YoY.](https://preview.redd.it/m106ixxswd371.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59e12724037bc3b9f099ab2859bea4b6608f00ee)\n\n[If Enterprise Software is to be Blackberry's Patrick Mahomes, Technology Solutions will be Blackberry's Tom Brady. Since 2017, this aspect has doubled as a portion of overall BB revenue, from roughly 10&amp;#37; in '17 to over 22&amp;#37; projected in '21, reflecting BB's successful ongoing foray into innovative technologies. In this segment we see BB's partnerships with Motion\\/Baidu reflected, cutting-edge technology projects that will enable unfathomable innovations in the future. We could say autonomous vehicles, or drones or anything that will be automated- they will all need to be securitized, whether with each other or on the cloud. BB's deep partnerships with global leaders like Baidu indicate John Chen has been playing 4D Chess since 2013: intensive capital expenditures to transform a company's creative intelligence don't just happen with the snap of your fingers. Put simply, you don't just go from making pagers to making AVs overnight- it's a lengthy process that will affect your growth\\/profitability, as evidenced by Blackberry's fall from grace. But if my instincts are right, Enterprise Software and Technology Solutions will drive BB's revenue growth\\/profitability, propelling it back to $100B market cap in the not-so-distant future.](https://preview.redd.it/1h96psxuwd371.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=595d7f66d80d079394875a718984ee589b593bcc)\n\n[BB earns a decent amount of revenue from Licensing\\/IP, which is quite frankly a pleasant surprise to me. Essentially this component comprises BB's monetization of its global patent portfolio and licensing operations, which do things like license the Blackberry brand\\/device software to various vendors \\(a lot of handset\\). It is somewhat impressive that it's currently 31&amp;#37; of BB's top line, but then again not too surprising. Considering the Enterprise Software\\/Technology Solutions streams are at really nascent stages of growth, it makes sense that this more \\\\\"legacy\\\\\" revenue stream is so prominent. But then again, this component jumped over 20&amp;#37; in 2020 \\(what seems to be BB's turning point\\), so it's not like I'm going to argue with more revenue either. I'd say this the Matt Stafford component of BB: a reliable and solid contributor, but not something I would be betting the bank on either. But if it produces \\(which is certainly not out of the question\\), I won't complain either \\(unless I'm from Detroit\\).](https://preview.redd.it/fx1ebhmxwd371.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06730b56ca47298cd1347a8c090542c1e90eae96)\n\n[I think we've established hardware\\/handsets are a legacy business for Blackberry. Why do I talk about it? B\\/c Wall Street does, and WSB often falls prey to their fear-mongering. DON'T PAY ATTENTION. It's like Mitch Trubisky- yeah that ish was dope in 2015-2016, but we all know it's washed now and the only reason we keep talking about is because shillers want to use it to keep diverting from the real gold.](https://preview.redd.it/j0fszgu0xd371.png?width=896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4b2250478ab2cb6ad49956d4b2f4f89560fc56c)\n\n[I'm not going to hammer earnings to crazy... to actually say with strong conviction that you can accurately forecast that out YoY is bullshit, and anyone from Wall St telling you they can is likely doing the same thing. Never the less, we see a clear trend: great profitability growth when Blackberry pagers led the mobile handset market, awful declines from 2012-2018 as BB closed hardware operations and invested in software\\/cybersecurity ambitions, culminating in the mixed bag we've been seeing in 2018 and beyond. Wouldn't be surprised to see this earnings churn to continue until \\~2023-2025, after all, you have to invest\\/incur losses if you want long-term profitability. I'm going to stay watching the 3 primary components of BB's revenue growth for now.](https://preview.redd.it/voaefw43xd371.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71f9cc1c63d585f57e3b88e20803c7f0f3ab4d79)\n\n[I care about Cash Flow far more than net income. Yeah, it's nice to look profitable, but how much money is actually coming in to your company? We see... a slow pick-up after 2020 \\(\\*pinch me\\*\\), when BB's resurrection appears to have started. Even in its legacy days, Blackberry was seeing hella cash leave the company, which just underscores software is a more profitable business than hardware. 2021 projections indicate Cash Flow could increase at the largest YoY rate in Blackberry's history \\(albeit from it's near-zero base\\). Nevertheless, if revenue growth booms like I think it will, FCF metrics are gunna look pretty green in 2022+.](https://preview.redd.it/ja112d95xd371.png?width=1234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d56e1feaa214463cd5b3b518e9b1c6171368f65b)\n\n# My Strongest Convictions on BB\n\nWell apes, thanks for enduring my BB nut. Now time for you to swallow:\n\n* I don't believe BB is \"just a meme.\" To the tards that made fuckloads of money on BBBY, KOSS, SNDL, and even AMC (not GME, PM me if you want to debate what I would call GME) to an extent in these \"not-exactly-the-future\" businesses with high amounts of short interest- kudos to you, here's your \ud83d\udc51, King. But the tough truth is I'm skeptical that \"squeezing\" is always going to work. For starters, you think the hedgies are really that fucking stupid? I mean, come on, Chancellor/Emperor Ken Griffin had to extend Melvin $5B in credit, lather up Vlad, and testify in front of Congress. Don't exactly think continuous losses and Congressional subpoenas are exactly what the hedgies want either... I'm sure their risk management committee have been popping Addies daily since January to make sure they aren't overfuckingextended in one bet. \\*Cough\\* \\*Bill Hwang\\* Cough\\*\n* No, I truly believe Blackberry Ltd is the 2016 version of AMD in the 2021 cybersecurity market. Back then, AMD's legacy business was flailing, and the entire chip market was dominated by Intel. They went into the changing room, made themselves up, and reorganized. Capturing 1%, then 2%, then 3% of the market share seems so little nominally, but means so much for the top line, bottom line, and the share price when you go from 0 to 1. 1 to 10 may seem like a big jump, but it's launching from the ground (a baseline of 0) that is most lucrative- and that is *exactly where Blackberry (BB) sits right now*. Capturing 2% of the global cybersecurity market would send BB flying, and we'd be soaring back to $140. If BB is actually as innovative as I think, who knows?\n* Unfortunately, if you think this is a short squeeze, I'm sorry, get out. I actually kinda like seeing closes like today (plummeting down 15%), because we shake out the weak hands and I can buy more cheap shares. No one's forcing you to buy this stock, I just like it. Facts &amp; numbers don't lie either. Short interest is 9% on roughly 500M shares outstanding, so we would likely need Jay Powell, Cathie Wood, Elon, and Chamath to hop in if there was actually to be a \"squeeze\" overnight.\n* But to contradict myself somewhat, I also think June 2021 (right now) could be one of the most preferential entry points into BB ever. Data indicates 40% of the shares are owned by institutions (similar numbers to GME), indicating 60% is retail, many of them apes. The suits may scream \"overvalued reeeee,\" and they have a point, BB stock isn't exactly cheap. As it trades at roughly 8X forward sales, BB is valued as a fast growing company, but not beyond the likes of PLTR &amp; SNOW (yes different industries, but valuations that are multiple times higher) or competitors like Palo Alto Networks or Cisco. As a graduate student attempting to be not completely rarted with my limited capital, I love the risk-reward for BB, especially considering they report earnings on June 22. I suspect these numbers will come in far stronger than the St is saying, and at least they will start to lift future guidance in a significant way (both catalysts for a 50-100% move in BB IMHO). I guess we'll see how the financials reward BB's transition, but I am truly convinced this is the AMD of cybersecurity.\n* This last part is a mixed-bag (but suspicious if we dive deeper), and I'm sure a lot of apes will downvote me and possibly completely avoid BB with this knowledge, but I want to share facts since they are evidently so hard to find. We got the usual mutual funds (Vanguard, Fidelity, TD, etc) who own BB (roughly 25%) and two woke funds who invest in \"innovative trends\" own the other 15%. But data does indicate nasty little Ken (Citadel) reported buying 1.3M shares of BB in Q1. BB was heavily shorted pre-GME (like 30%+), and Citadel/gey bears almost definitely bought shares to cover. The question I'm wondering was did Citadel actually buy BB b/c they were so worried about a squeeze since it is a legitimate growth stock or b/c he shares my sentiments about its turnaround? Regardless, both seem like positive catalysts for the stock, and hopefully Ken answers my question.... oh wait...\n\n[Self-explanatory.](https://preview.redd.it/w33d8rdaxd371.png?width=1886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab406b459250bc6669c79e67c65c145f9b879709)\n\nObligatiory: BB to the moon.",

        "selftext": "Why you Need to Watch out for this new EV Player in 2021\nMentioned:\tAAPL AMZN F GM GOOGL INTC NKLA NSANY NVDA TSLA WKSP\nPresident Joe Biden's $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal is packed with an ambitious green agenda for the U.S.\n\nIncluded in the plan is $620 billion in transportation spending with $174 billion invested in the electric vehicle (EV) market. The plan will enable automakers to spur domestic supply chains from raw materials to parts, retool factories and give consumers point-of-sale rebates and tax incentives to buy affordable American-made EVs.\n\nMoreover, it will establish grant and incentive programs for state and local governments and the private sector to build a national network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030.\n\nTraditional automakers including Ford (NYSE: F), General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) are competing with tech companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Google's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) to get a piece of the EV pie.\n\nRecently, reports about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) joining the EV bandwagon have surfaced. According to The Korea Times, Apple is close to signing an agreement with LG Magna e-Powertrain (KRX: 066570). If the agreement with LG Magna is reached, the two parties will then jointly establish the precise details for the production of the Apple car, and a prototype might be teased in early 2024.\n\nOne company that stands to benefit from this spectacularly is Worksport (OTC: WKSP).\n\nDisruptive Innovation\n\nFounded in 2011, Worksport is a globally recognized designer and producer of tonneau or truck bed covers. The Canadian-based company is a disruptive innovator with its mobile solar technology \u00e2?? the TerraVis\u00e2?\u00a2.\n\nThe technology provides solar power to over 50 million light trucks on the roads today and is a key source of clean energy to recharge upcoming EV trucks. The TerraVis\u00e2?\u00a2 can provide up to 30% or more of the power needed for the average daily commute.\n\nThe TerraVis\u00e2?\u00a2 system is a first-of-its-kind mobile solar power generation system. It can generate up to 1kWh of mobile power off-grid. The TerraVis\u00e2?\u00a2 Cor battery system takes power from the cover and stores it in modular battery packs \u00e2?? storing 1.5 kWh of energy in up to 4 batteries that can be transported in the truck bed using the mounting system.\n\nThe TerraVis Cor can also act as a standalone consumer product \u00e2?? making it available for purchase even if you're not a truck owner. The system will allow the same level of freedom from a power grid, being chargeable via any wall outlet, solar panel or 12V power source.\n\nEarly Mover Advantage\n\nWorksport will leverage the TerraVis\u00e2?\u00a2 system and its position as a Tier 1 original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to secure future partnerships and distribution of its conventional truck bed tonneau covers.\n\nThe company has already forged OEM supply partnerships with 2 EV truck nameplates \u00e2?? one of which is in partnership with Nissan (OTCMKTS: NSANY)\n\nApart from the tonneau cover market, Worksport finds itself in the pickup specialty equipment market \u00e2?? $12 billion as a whole \u00e2?? with the EV market ($162 billion) and the battery storage system market ($2.9 billion).\n\nWorksport is now in an enviable position as it stands to support a plethora of EV giants and traditional automotive makers that are committing to electrification.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nOn June 1, 2021, Worksport forged a working relationship with Ontario Tech University (OTU) that will start as a 2-year contract. With this partnership, the company will get access to the world-class ACE Testing facility, collaborating with the research team that is supervised by Professor Sheldon Williamson, Ph.D.\nWorksport plans to finish prototyping the TerraVis solar truck bed cover system by the end of Q3 2021. OTU and Worksport will complete validation and fine-tuning for TerraVis pre-launch in Q4 2021, and accelerate toward full manufacturing in 2022.\nTerraVis Cor\u00e2?\u00a2 has entered the production prototype phase with the first pre-production prototype expected to be ready by early Q3 2021. The prototype system(s) will be fully operational and is expected to mirror the commercial model available at the turn of 2022.\nOn May 27, 2021, Worksport decided to take advantage of its recent opportunities in raising capital to onboard several new hires: 2 full-time industrial engineers, 1 industrial designer with specialties in 3D modeling and interactive preparation, and 2 advisory engineers.\nWorksport currently has $10 million in cash and cash equivalents with no long-term debt.\nTo learn more about Worksport, you can visit its website here.\n\nWorksport is a partner of Benzinga.

Its consumer products are marketed under the brands Crucial and Ballistix. Micron and Intel together created IM Flash Technologies, which produces NAND flash memory.\u00a0Their current market cap is\u00a0$88.97 billion.\n\nMicron remains firmly positioned in a memory market as more products require chips that are experiencing a shortage right now. Many see the company's situation as a big reason why you should be buying their shares.\u00a0The shortage could particularly benefit Micron in the DRAM memory market, where South Korean chipmakers Samsung and SK Hynix are its only competitors. DRAM made up about 68% of Micron's revenue in 2020. Additionally, the company claimed about 23% of the global DRAM market.\u00a0The NAND sector is a bit more diversified thanks to the presence of Western Digital and its SanDisk subsidiary. However,\u00a0Micron is one of the largest suppliers in this segment as well.\n\nMicron's earnings for the first quarter of 2021 showed little difference from what the analysts were expecting.\u00a0They reported earnings per share of $0.98, which is 3 cents more than the consensus estimate. They reported a slight beat of revenue estimates as well. Their Q1 2021 revenue came in at $6.24 billion compared to the estimated $6.23 billion.\u00a0Their next earnings report is scheduled for **Jun 30, 2021**.\n\nAnalysts from **Deutsche Bank**\u00a0estimate Micron's stock to reach\u00a0$110 in the next 12 months. The analysts at\u00a0**Wells Fargo**\u00a0also have high expectations for this stock with a price target of\u00a0$115. Out of 24\u00a0analysts, 18\u00a0have\u00a0given Micron a BUY rating and 6 a HOLD rating.",

        "selftext": "Chances are that you have heard of a stock that goes by the ticker [$CCIV \u2013 Churchill Capital IV](https://utradea.com/stocks/CCIV), and if you haven\u2019t I would suggest reading this report to see what all the hype is about. In this report I will provide you (the reader) with all the information you need to know about the upcoming merger, as well as Lucid\u2019s plans to be a top EV competitor in the future. If you would like to keep updated on some more hype stocks in a report style similar to this one, follow my account [here.](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/WallStreetWhale)\n\n**Company Overview:**\n\n*Churchill Capital IV:*\n\nChurchill Capital IV ($CCIV) is a blank check company that was formed for the purpose of completing a merger (or other business combination) with Lucid Motors (Ticker: $LCID, post-merger). Churchill Capital was founded by Michael Klein, who is expected to stay a part of the company (Lucid Motors) post-merger to create long-term value for the business.\n\n$CCIV completed their blank-check IPO on August 3rd, 2020, in which they sold 207M shares at $10/share, generating proceed of $2.07B, which will be used later to fund the merger. Furthermore, Churchill Capital raised another $42.85M by selling 42.85M warrants for $1/warrant, this money will also be used to fund the merger.\n\nThe acquisition is said to have a pro-forma acquisition value of $11.75B and is said to be completed (in their investor presentation) by early Q3, 2021.\n\nOn February 22nd, 2021, Churchill Capital entered into an [Agreement and Plan of Merger](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-026358/) with Lucid Motors. This business combination will be consummated after a vote for the approval of the shareholders.\n\n*Lucid Motors:*\n\nLucid Motors was founded in 2007 in Newark, California, at this time their company was named \u201cAteiva\u201d rather than Lucid Motors. Ateiva was originally a company that developed and sold their electric batteries and powertrains to other electric vehicle manufacturers.\n\nBy 2013, Ateiva was a recognized and respected producer of battery packs, and electric powertrains, and started to entertain the idea of developing their own electric vehicle(s). It was at this time, that the now CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson joined the company.\n\nIn 2014, Lucid secured their first round of funding to develop their own vehicle. At this point Lucid was not putting too much thought into the design but managed to make their own 900 Horsepower (HP) vehicle that went 0-60 (MPH) in 3 seconds, and with good range.\n\nIn October of 2016, Ateiva officially decided to rebrand and change their name to Lucid Motors and started to take their vision of becoming an all-electric luxury vehicle maker very seriously. They started out of the gate very quickly, as they announced their plans to break ground in Casa Grande, Arizona and started to construct their $700M, 590-acre factory (AMP-1) in November 2016 (just one month later).\n\nFast forward 4 years to November 2020, and we see Phase 1 of this factory being [completed](https://www.prnewswire.com/ae/news-releases/lucid-motors-completes-construction-on-first-greenfield-electric-vehicle-factory-in-north-america-commissioning-process-underway-for-spring-2021-production-start-of-lucid-air-301182337.html), which is enabling them to produce 34,000 of their Lucid Air vehicles (1st production vehicle) annually. Furthermore, Lucid is preparing to start the 2nd phase of their factory build, which will allow them to manufacture their upcoming Gravity SUV and increase production from 34,000 vehicles per year to 90,000 vehicles per year. This phase is expected to start as soon as late 2021 and be completed by the summer of 2023.\n\n**Investment Information:**\n\n*Termination information:*\n\nThis merger deal can be terminated under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. There is a mutual agreement between Churchill Capital IV and Lucid Motors that they want to both terminate the deal.\n2. The merger is not consummated by October 22nd, 2021\n3. Any government entity ordering/taking action to prohibit the merger.\n4. If there is a breach of contract by either of the companies (Churchill and Lucid), then the other company can choose to terminate the deal.\n5. If Churchill\u2019s shareholders vote against the consummation of the merger.\n\nIf the acquisition falls through for any of the conditions as listed above, then Churchill Capital will gather all of their capital into a trust account and redistribute it to their existing shareholders, if this were to happen shareholders will likely receive $10/share owned. However, if Churchill gets sued, and the lawsuit is successful, then Churchill Capital is required to pay out these claims before their shareholders, which will result in a shareholder payout of less than $10 per existing share.\n\n*PIPE (Private Investment into Public Equity) Information:*\n\nChurchill Capital agreed to sell $2.5B worth of Class A common stocks to their PIPE investors. These shares were sold to the PIPE investors at a price of $15/share, which means that PIPE investors bought 166.667M shares. This is important because the $15 level that PIPE investor bought in at can be seen as a potential bottom for the stock, implying a downside (pre-merger) of 41.18%.\n\nUnder Churchill\u2019s [subscription agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811210/000110465921026358/tm217491d2_8k.htm) (outlining the terms for the PIPE investors), it notes that the PIPE investors are not allowed to liquidate their shares until 90 after the completion of the merger (if the SEC decided to not review the registration statement) or 150 days (if the SEC reviews the registration statement). This is very important because the PIPE investors will sell at least some of their shares the second they are legally able to, because they need to reduce their risk and diversify into other investments. Knowing this, we can expect Lucid\u2019s share price to fall on this date due to large amounts of selling.\n\n*Experienced Management Team:*\n\n* 12 of Lucid\u2019s 20 management team member have worked at a variety of car companies (both electric and non-electric) including Tesla, Rivian, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Audi, Volkswagen, Mazda, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lotus, and Ferrari.\n* Peter Rawlinson (the CEO and CTO), previously worked as the Chief Vehicle Engineer of the Tesla Model S, which helps to speak on his knowledge and experience primarily in the electric vehicle space.\n* Furthermore, the non-vehicle centered management members have worked on the management teams of Apple, Siemens, Intel, PayPal, Magna, eBay, Cisco, and Pillsbury previously to working at Lucid.\n\n***Lucid\u2019s Battery Technology:***\n\nAs we know, Lucid (formerly Ateiva) used to solely manufacture battery packs and electric powertrains for electric car manufacturers. Furthermore, Ateriva (which is now Lucid\u2019s technology wing) has been producing battery packs for Formula-E racing cars for 6 seasons, which displays the history and high level of performance that Lucid\u2019s batteries can achieve.\n\nAdditionally, Lucid\u2019s battery has been ranked as the most efficient battery (in terms of miles/kWh), ranking at 4.5 miles/kWh, compared to Tesla\u2019s Model S, which ranked 2nd with 4.0 miles/kWh). This higher efficiency enables Lucid\u2019s customers to enjoy longer range, faster charging times, and lower cost battery packs.\n\nThe Lucid Air Grand Touring model has a 500-mile range, a top speed of 168 mph and a 0-60 speed of 3.0 seconds, making it very competitive with Tesla\u2019s Model S long range edition. Lucid\u2019s Air Grand Touring has a price tag of $139,000 compared to Tesla\u2019s Model S Long-Range Edition\u2019s price of $73,000. This is because Tesla has been able to achieve economies of scale to reduce their manufacturing price, whereas Lucid has just started to manufacture their vehicles. However, in 2020 Lucid plans to release their Air Pure model at a competitive price of $77,400, which will be more comparable to the prices offered by Tesla.\n\n***Lucid\u2019s Charging Infrastructure:***\n\n* **Electrify America:** Lucid has announced their partnership with Electrify America, which is the second mover in the charging space (behind Tesla). Electrify America also allows 900Vcharging, which is optimal for Lucid vehicles as it allows them to charge at their fastest speeds. Electrify America currently has 600 charging stations with over 2,600 individual chargers across America. Electrify America is also growing very quickly, and a map of their reach can be found [here](https://insideevs.com/news/504444/electrify-america-opens-600th-charging-station/).\n* **Other Partnerships:** Lucid has also stated that their cars will be able to receive charging from other aggregators and station owners such as ChargePoint and EVgo.\n\n***Forward Technology:***\n\n* Lucid ID Profiles  \n\n   * Facial Recognition automatically recognizes driver profiles and adjusts to their preferences.\n* Predictive Analytics  \n\n   * Improves the car-driver relationship by using AI to learn driver behaviours and automatically adjusts to fit these behaviours.\n* Sensor Suite  \n\n   * Lucid has integrated 32 onboard sensors, which is the most among production vehicles.\n* Autonomous Driving  \n\n   * Lucid is planned to launch their Level 2 Autonomous Driving functionality and is able to undergo software updates through the cloud.\n   * This is not yet close to Tesla\u2019s autopilot; however, it is only the start of Lucid Autonomy, and is already better than many of their other competitors.\n* Mass Production ready  \n\n   * Although Lucid has not yet started to mass produce their cars, they have designed their cars to be readily available for mass production when the time comes in order to have a smooth transition and leverage their economies of scale.  \n\n      * An example of this is their \u201cbrick\u201d injection mould which is designed to be manufactured in the millions and be integrated into any of their cars in a single operation.\n\n***Proprietary Technology:***\n\n* **Wunderbox Boost-Charge Technology:** Wunderbox is the first bi-directional system on the market that is capable of withstanding 900V, which enables their 300kW fast charging.  \n\n   * Their charging speed is approximately 6.67 minutes/100 miles of charge, compared to Tesla\u2019s speed of 7.5 minutes/100 miles.\n* **Lucid has applied or been issued 407 patents:** Approximately 338 of these patents have been issued to Lucid and the other 69 are still in the application process. This is good news for Lucid as they grant Lucid with a competitive edge, depending on the nature of their patents.\n* **Micro Lens Array (MLA) Lighting:** Lucid\u2019s MLA lighting allows their headlights to adapt to driving and weather situations to provide optimal visibility to ensure driver safety.  \n\n   * An example would be if it were foggy, the car would gradually adapt to the level of fogginess to ensure the best visibility at any given time.\n\n***Market Outlook:***\n\n* **Luxury Vehicle Market:** The global luxury car market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% over the next 5 years, growing into a $733.2B industry by 2026. This presents an opportunity for Lucid to potentially capitalize on, especially with increased government mandates and incentives, and the consumers increased demand for EV\u2019s.\n* **Total Addressable Market:** Currently, Lucid expects to capitalize on 2% of their TAM, through their Lucid Air Sales in 2021/2022. This is a very reasonable estimate and would represent 34,000 vehicles sold. In 2023, Lucid is looking to capitalize on 2-3% of their TAM, which would be 80-90k vehicles sold. Lastly, in 2030 Lucid is expecting to capitalize on 4% of their TAM, which would translate into 600,000 vehicles sold in 2030.\n* **Total Annual Deliveries:** Lucid is forecasting a total vehicle delivered CAGR of 88.22% between 2022-2026, which will result in 251,000 cars delivered by 2026.\n* **Total Revenue:** Lucid id forecasting a revenue CAGR of 78.95% between 2022-2026, which would translate into $22.76B in revenue for the year of 2026.\n\n***Market Strategy:***\n\n* **Pre-Orders:** Lucid opened their Air models to pre-orders, where customers can reserve the car for a fee of $300-1000. Lucid opened this up in Q1 of 2021 and judging by the existing reservations, Lucid is expecting $800M in anticipated sales. However, these reservations can be cancelled, so it would be illogical to assume all of these pre-orders will translate into sales.\n* **Showrooms:** Lucid has a direct sales strategy so that their customers can experience the car before making their decision to ensure interactions are on-brand, and pressure-free. Lucid currently has 6 showrooms in large cities across North America that are open for the public, and Lucid is planning to expand these showrooms into Europe in late 2021.\n* **Lucid Digital Journey:** Customers can engage with Lucid via their app, website, configurator and much more. There has not been a lot of information released about this yet, but this is what they have released.\n\n***Future Application Possibilities:***\n\n* Passenger Vehicles\n* Busses\n* Helicopters and other Aircrafts\n* Heavy Equipment and Agricultural Equipment\n* Energy Storage Systems\n\nInvestment Valuation:\n\n*Valuation:*\n\nSince, $CCIV is just a shell company, and Lucid (the company becoming public) has not had to make their financial reports available to the public, it is very hard to determine any sort of price estimate or use any valuation techniques that I have learned. Also, since they are pre-revenue, it is even harder to estimate the fair value off this stock.\n\nTh only way in which I can make any sort of valuation is to use the free cash flow forecast information that they provided in their investor presentation.\n\nIn this DCF model I arrived at a fair value per share of $29.86, which implies a share price increase of 17.02%. However, this DCF model is likely not all that accurate due to the lack of available information about Lucid\u2019s financial position.\n\n**Catalysts:**\n\n* **Merger Date Announcement:** Churchill Capital investors have been anxiously waiting on the news of the merger date to be dropped. Once this happens it could serve as a catalyst for the stock heading up to their merger date.\n* **Autonomous Driving:** If Lucid announces that their level 3 or level 4 autonomous driving has more autonomous features and mimics that of Tesla\u2019s autopilot, there will be excitement amongst investors, and people might buy more shares. This is especially true if you look at the EV space as a \u201ctechnology race\u201d like many others do.\n* **Future Improvements to their Battery Technology:** Lucid has already highlighted that their battery is the most efficient and compact, however if they continue to improve upon their battery technology, then more people might find their cars useful and be willing to purchase them. If this happens their revenues might outperform, and their stock price may jump.\n* **Partnerships:** As we know, Lucid has already partnered with many companies like Electrify America, EVgo, ChargePoint, LG etc. If the news breaks that Lucid is partnering with more companies that can help them increase their product and reach, then their stock price is likely to be affected.\n* **Updates on Factory Production:** If Lucid is able to finish the construction of their Phases on time, or even sooner than anticipated, they will be able to produce more vehicles quicker than before thought. This should signal to investors that they are ahead of schedule and that earnings are likely to be good, causing investors to buy in.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n* **No Operating History and Revenues:** The lack of public information on Lucid as a company may scare off some potential investors. Additionally, Lucid is a pre-revenue company, which bears a lot of uncertainty for the future. Furthermore, if future financial information comes out, and it is not near where Lucid projected it to be, then some investors will sell due to their valuations being off.\n* **Merger is Never Consummated:** If the merger is terminated, or if they merger does not happen by October 22nd,2021, then the potential losses will be at least 60.82% (based on the current price of $25.52), and losses might even be more than that.\n* **The exercising of Warrants:** As previously mentioned there are 42.85M warrants, these warrants can be converted into common stock upon expiry, which has the potential to dilute existing shares by up to 20%. This is not favourable for current shareholders.\n* **PIPE Investor Liquidation:** Once the PIPE investors are able to liquidate their shares, Lucid\u2019s stock is likely to have a massive sell off, which will hurt the share price in the short term. However, if you are bullish on this stock this may be less of a risk and more of a buying opportunity.\n* **Chip Shortage:** The ongoing chip shortage is likely to have adverse impacts on the Lucid\u2019s production estimates, and if Lucid is not able to meet their targets, investors may worry and potentially panic sell. Also, this will affect the DCF model that I built out and Lucid may not be undervalued due to their heightened estimates.",

It is considered a solid play due to its consistent and predictable geology and recoveries relative to drilling and completion costs. Long story short, it is not a risky play in terms of exploration coming up unsuccessful, which is a plague in the industry, and on a energy company's books.\n\n**Marcellus Shale**\n\n[Map from USGS.GOV](https://preview.redd.it/6frdji2alu471.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3788b15537904285ae3f4863d07673add644f45a)\n\n**As of year-end 2020, AR had the following assets in the Marcellus Shale:**\n\n\\-515,000 net acres located primarily in northern West Virginia, which is strategically located bordering near Ohio and PA.\n\n\\-Operation of 1000 producing horizontal wells\n\n\\-17.6 Tcfe (trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent) of net proved reserves. \n\n\\-1,877 undeveloped core drilling locations.\n\n**UTICA SHALE**\n\n[Map from USGS.gov](https://preview.redd.it/e26trv3vku471.jpg?width=497&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=916d7280721a2e645b777cc8669e494c73205bd6)\n\nNow on to the Utica Shale, which is located a few thousand feet below the Marcellus Shale. Think of the Utica Shale as that girl in High School that you knew was going to be a smoke show but she hung out with the Drama Club and was a lil too quick witted for you at the time. Yes, we all know that this was mostly due to the amount of bong hits you did in your buddy's Honda Accord when out for lunch. I digress. Back to the Utica Shale and the great state of Ohio, where Antero has 91,000 net acres, 200 horizontal wells currently producing, 2.0 tcfe (here I'll write it again but remember it this time, trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent), and 494 *undeveloped* drilling locations. I italicized undeveloped because AR knows how big of a play Utica will be down the road. Also, touching on the critical importance of location, location. location, AR's acreage is located bordering West Virginia and PA. To emphasize the importance of their foothold, here are links showing AR's locations in reference to a map of heat spots for natural resources.\n\n[Antero Resources Utica Shale Locations](https://preview.redd.it/3na88rd9ku471.png?width=379&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4df23d878fee9f6a0c010ca1db8ea6c83a5455d9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\(Photo Above\\) Antero Resources Marcellus Shale Locations](https://preview.redd.it/4l8qbu9cmu471.png?width=619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=166b32c42be108dded44eeb01857ed881fe1913a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\(Photo Above\\) United States Geological Survey Results of where Total Organic Carbon \\(TOC\\) was high.](https://i.redd.it/zh0lnkifmu471.gif)\n\nThe United States Geological Survey's mean estimates of undiscovered, technically recoverable resources, indicate that the Utica Shale contains about 38 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, about 940 million barrels of oil and 208 million barrels of NGL. \n\n**Natural Gas Futures:**\n\n\\-Rallied to eight month highs as of Friday 6/11/21 at the Market close\n\n\\-July NG (NG1:COM) was up 4.7% to nearly $3.296/MMBtu (Metric Million British Thermal Unit), which was the highest front-month contract settlement since 10/30/20.

This EO would require major suppliers to disclose their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and related risks. With this being put into play and the goal of net-zero emissions goal by 2050, as well as cutting GHG emissions by 2030, Antero is in a very good position. \n\nIt is my belief that with AR planning on being net-zero by 2025, and being positioned geographically where they are in the U.S. they will somehow benefit from the Infrastructure Plan if/when it goes through. According to Forbes, prior to the pandemic, the economic boom that kicked off in SE Ohio at the Utica Shale around 2011 resulted in $86B in new capital investments and created over 200,000 new jobs for Ohio citizens by the end of 2019. Unemployment rates that had stood as high as 15.5% in 2009 dropped into the 5-6% range ten years later. It seems to me that the NG Industry, if done correctly in terms of the environment, could be a major benefactor from an administration looking to create a ton of jobs. \n\n**TLDR**\n\n\\-AR is reducing debt on the balance sheet \n\n\\-A current leader in the industry in terms of ESG \n\n\\-Notorious for keeping expectations low and over-performing also known by another term, described by John Beckwith in [Wedding Crashers](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/f45a8bb4-c30d-4a9b-97e7-223cab02bc4d)\n\n[5 Year Chart of AR](https://preview.redd.it/hszgx4zzbv471.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d96591d2b36d198b12bb0565ef947c97533cdd14)\n\n**Positions:** \n\nShares &amp; January 21, 2022 $20c @ $1.20\n\n*Not Financial Advise as I am on beer number 2.*",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 3, 2021**\n\nStocks dipped today, with the three major indexes pulling back after a recent run of gains in the last two weeks. Seems like after the recent run of gains we are seeing some profit taking across the board. I see no real reason for the dip given that new economic data released today was overwhelmingly positive. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for May\u2019s Job Report slated to be released tomorrow.\n\nAmid negotiations with Republican lawmakers regarding the proposed infrastructure bill, today, the Washington Post reported that President Biden was open to reconsidering his previous proposal to raise the corporate tax rate to from 21% to 28%. This proposed increase has been one of the main sticking points during negotiations. Now it is reported Biden would recommend a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. \n\nWe got two pieces of good news in the labor market today. On one hand, according to a report by payroll processing firm ADP, the private sector added 978,000 jobs in May, well ahead of consensus estimates of 650,000. On the other hand, according to the Labor Department\u2019s Weekly Jobless claim report, showed 385,000 new jobless claims, roughly in-line with 387,000 estimate and a fresh pandemic low, a great sign that the labor market is improving as the economy continues to recover. \n\nThese reports set the stage for the official May Jobs Report set to be released tomorrow by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which will be critical in determining the pace of economic recovery and whether the Federal Reserve will consider tapering monetary support in the near future. The April Job Report was extremely disappointing, showing only 266,000 jobs added compared to the 1 million expected, and marking a sharp deceleration compared to March. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Extremely volatile trading continued in AMC, which saw it\u2019s stock price recover from roughly 30% down to more than 10% up and only to dip again towards the end of the day. Other \u201cmeme stocks\u201d traded in similar patterns after rocketing up in the last few days. \n* AMC issues and additional 11 million shares today, with the company taking advantage of its surging stock price. \n* Boeing Co Chief Executive Dave Calhoun on Thursday pointed to potential \"supply constraints\" beginning in the summer after a \"more robust\" recovery from the coronavirus-related downturn than he had imagined, another sign that demand is catching up in many industries faster than supply as the economy roars back from the coronavirus-induced recession.\n* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue\n* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. \n* Jack Ma's Ant Group has been approved to run a consumer finance company, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission [said Thursday.](https://www.cbirc.gov.cn/branch/chongqing/view/pages/common/ItemDetail.html?docId=987949&amp;itemId=2005&amp;generaltype=0) This is one of the first step of Ant's forced restructuring after China pulled the plug on its $35 billion IPO in October 2020. It also means the company will be regulated more like a traditional financial entity, giving authorities more oversight over company operations\n* **\\*\\*Please note that the current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes.\\*\\***\n* Cigna[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CI&amp;src=cashtag_click)(CI)target raised by Morgan Stanley from $254 to $321 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "President Biden\u2019s $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal includes $620 billion in transportation spending with $174 billion invested in the electric vehicle (EV) market. Biden\u2019s plan will enable automakers to spur domestic supply chains from raw materials to parts, retool factories and give consumers point-of-sale rebates and tax incentives to buy affordable American-made EVs. This will establish grant and incentive programs for state and local governments and the private sector to build a national network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030.\n\nAutomakers such S Ford, General Motors and Nikola are competing with big tech companies like Amazon, Alphabet, Intel Corporation, and Nvidia Corporation to get in the EV game.\n\nAnd one company stands to gain from all of this... WKSP (Worksport Ltd). \n\nWorksport is a globally recognized designer and producer of truck bed covers. They are a disruptive innovator thanks to their mobile solar technology \u2014 the TerraVis.\n\nTheir technology provides solar power to over 50 million light trucks currently on the roads today and is a major source of clean energy to recharge upcoming EV trucks. The TerraVis can provide up to 30% or more of the power needed for the average daily commute.\u00a0\n\nThe TerraVis system is a first-of-its-kind mobile solar power generation system, generating up to 1kWh of mobile power off-grid. The TerraVis Cor battery system takes power from the cover and stores it in modular battery packs \u2014 storing 1.5 kWh of energy in up to 4 batteries that can be transported in the truck bed using the mounting system.\n\nThe TerraVis Cor can also act as a standalone consumer product \u2014 which makes it available for purchase even if you\u2019re not a truck owner. The system will allow the same level of freedom from a power grid, being chargeable via any wall outlet, solar panel or 12V power source.\n\nWorksport has the early mover advantage and is leveraging the TerraVis system and its position as a Tier 1 original equipment manufacturer to secure future partnerships and distribution of its conventional truck bed tonneau covers. They\u2019ve already secured a partnership with Nissan. \n\nThanks to their partnership with Ontario Tech University Worksport has access to the world-class ACE Testing facility, collaborating with the OTU research team. \n\nWorksport will complete validation and fine-tuning for TerraVis pre-launch in Q4 of this year, and accelerate toward full manufacturing in 2022 (if not sooner). \n\nTerraVis Cor has already entered the production prototype phase with the first pre-production prototype expected to be ready by early Q3 2021. The prototype system(s) will be fully operational and is expected to mirror the commercial model.\n\nFinally, in April the CEO announced that Worksport had filed for listing on the NASDAQ and will be issuing a common stock and warrant offering as part of that listing... which would make them available on the NASDAQ in 2021.\n\nWKSP is currently trading at $0.64/share over the counter; after a $0.20 increase in share price today.\n\nHappy investing!",

        "selftext": "Which semiconductor companies will be most likely to receive funds after the bill is signed into law? Here are my thoughts and assumptions. Please correct any mistakes. Disclaimer: I own positions in Intel, Micron, and Applied Materials.\n\nMy understanding is that the bill is largely meant to support and consolidate semiconductor manufacturing and semi cap manufacturing in the U.S. Thus, U.S.-based companies with facilities in the U.S. that want to develop their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. will be the most likely to receive funding from this law as well as future support from the U.S. government which is aligned with rare bipartisanship to address and neutralize the threat of China\u2019s growing global technological dominance. Those companies will have a competitive advantage in the marketplace after receiving these funds, regardless of other fundamental or technical factors.\n\nHowever, the funds will come in the form of grants and tax credits. My understanding, and here's where I'm making big assumptions, is that companies must apply to receive the funds and that this is an involved and competitive process. The law won\u2019t be signed until toward the end of this year at the earliest. Then companies will apply for grants to fund projects to build fabs, improve supply chains, etc.\n\nINTC and MU seem like clear favorites to receive funds because they\u2019re U.S.-based IDMs with facilities primarily in the U.S., and they\u2019re often included in news stories related to the bill. TSM and Samsung are outside the U.S., though that doesn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t hypothetically receive funds to build a fab in the U.S. But if grants are competitive, then how likely would TSM or Samsung be to receive funds to build a new fab if they were competing with Intel or MU for the same funding, based purely on the intent of the law being to support U.S.-based semiconductor business?\n\nAMAT also seems like a favorite to receive funds even though ASML has a monopoly on the most advanced semi cap equipment. ASML is based in the Netherlands and only has two facilities in the U.S. Also, I speculate that AMAT could use funds from the law to put toward R&amp;D to compete with ASML, but my knowledge in that area is lacking.\n\nIt won\u2019t be until next year before companies can even start applying for funds. There probably won\u2019t be any winners for projects until at least a year from now.\n\nCatalysts:\n\n* Bill gets signed by the end of this year.\n* Companies submit applications for projects and winners are announced.\n* Winners start receiving funds and investing them in projects.\n\nThis isn't advice. I'm not a financial advisor.",

        "selftext": "AMD's latest financial reports blew all estimates out of the water... and their latest guidance for 50% growth (up from 37%) is conservative. Here is why:\n\nFUNDAMENTALS: IT'S ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT\n\nIn a post COVID-19 world, people will continue to flock towards entertainment.\n\nAs  confirmed by both TESLA and AMD recently, the latest Model X and S will  bring AMD silicon (GPU &amp; APU). This is HUGE, because this feature  will eventually trickle down as an optional to the Model 3 and rest of  the Tesla fleet. Why is this important? Just listen to Elon Musk drool  over PS5 performance on road trips with autonomous driving. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl\\_-bFNRJaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_-bFNRJaw)\n\nBut that IS NOT ALL, as Valve will be launching a new portable handheld. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA)\n\nIn essence PS4, PS5, XBOX X &amp; S and Valve are all going FULL AMD.\n\nWho do you think Ford, GM, Chrysler, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Renault/Nissan will go with?\n\nENTERTAINMENT IS KEY and AMD is all over it.\n\nThis  is also HUGE as entertainment software will be tailored to AMD's  processing pipeline. Unreal Engine 5 is the perfect example, which  ALREADY performs better on a 6800XT than it does on a RTX3080 (up to 12%  better, as per Digital Foundry's performance benchmark - see screenshot  and video link below).\n\n[AMD 6800XT on left with 61fps - NVIDIA RTX 3080 on right with 56fps](https://preview.redd.it/wgykwgfhty471.jpg?width=1289&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f2c5a018dfb47c628f1ce1d2650a138e1be0267)\n\n(digital foundry's benchmarks) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0)\n\nUnreal  Engine 5 (with Lumen) will make Nvidia Ray Tracing a thing of the past.  This software solution is much more efficient at managing illumination,  making it available for non-RTX hardware.\n\nIn  addition, enthusiasts are really pumped with AMD's latest presentation  at Computex, where they presented Fidelity FX SuperResolution. It aims  to provide up to 2x performance while super sampling images up to 4K.  And the kicker is that this solution will be available to ALL.\n\nIntel's  Raja Koduri (Head of Intel GPU, formerly an AMD employee) has already  confirmed they are looking into AMD's Fidelity FX SR (as per his twitter  post days ago): [https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nSo yeah, AMD is the future of GAMING.\n\nBut on the stock analysis front, AMD has also begun its climb towards previous highs.\n\nIt has made a huge recovery since my latest post, when it was trading in the low $70's.\n\nJust imagine that AMD is trading at a Price/Earnings multiple of 34, with a market cap of $98.7B\n\nNvidia is trading at a P/E of 84 (over twice as much), with a market cap of $444B (over 4 times more).\n\nBut when you look at the financials, the differences shrink.\n\nOn Revenue, AMD has sales of $9.7B and net profits of $2.5B. Nvidia sold $16.6B for a net $4.3B.\n\nHow does that support Nvidia being over 4 times more expensive than AMD? It just doesn't.\n\nIf AMD were to trade at the same multiples: EPS of 2.38 \\* NVIDIA's P/E of 84.28 = $200 per share.\n\nAt $200 per share, AMD's market cap would be $243B... STLL HALF OF NVIDIA!!!! (WTF?!?!).\n\nThink about it, it is bound to close the distance towards $200 per share in the next 12 months.\n\nThe reasons are simple: Tesla, Valve, Unreal Engine 5, Ryzen 3D stacking and 50% growth for 2021.\n\nThe Xilinx deal WILL CLOSE in the next 6 months. THE BREAKOUT is IMMINENT!!!\n\nTo summarize, the product pipeline is AMAZING, not to mention the leaks on RDNA3 and Ryzen 4.\n\nThe new clientele is incredible: TESLA and Valve, added to Microsoft and Sony.\n\nJust imagine Xilinx FPGA accelerators integrated to AMD's Intellectual Property. Fuel the rockets!!!\n\nREMEMBER: In a matter of months you will be kicking yourself for ignoring this post!\n\nThe MOON is for amateurs.... WE'RE GOING TO MARS BABY!!!... with TESLA AND AMD!!!\n\nMARS - THE RED PLANET... WITH LISA AND ELON. PRIMATES AND APES TO COLONIZE IT IN 2022!!!\n\n..... ALL ABOARD!!!!",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 4, 2021**\n\nStocks rose today as investors digested the May Job Report, which showed non-farm payrolls rise by less than expected for the second straight month. Market participants seem to be interpreting the back-to-back miss in job gains for two consecutive months as meaning the Federal Reserve will keep the current accommodative monetary policy in place until the labor market shows robust signs of improvement.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s May Job Report showed the economy gained 559,000 non-farm payrolls, a substantial increase compared to April but still below estimates of 650,000. For months, the Federal Reserve has consistently reiterated it wants to see a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports, like the one in March, before policy adjustments are seriously considered. This is why technology and growth stocks, which would be affected the most by potential adjustments in policy, outperformed today. Former Chase Chief Economist Anthony Chan said, \u201cWhat I see here is somewhat of a \u2018goldilocks\u2019 overall economy. I see that employment is increasing. With regard to the reason why the market is excited, it's because it's telling us that the economy is not blistering hot, that it's actually going to be opening up pretty gradually. I think that's important.\" \n\nRecent economic data has been good overall. A stronger-than-expected ADP private payrolls report and weekly jobless claims report released Thursday each underscored firming rehiring trends across the economy, with a smaller share of individuals becoming newly unemployed for pandemic-related reasons. Another wave of vaccinations has taken place, reopenings have picked up, and businesses have been scrambling to bring back workers to keep pace with surging demand. \n\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said that the economy was \"still quite a ways off from maintaining the substantial further progress we\u2019re really looking for in terms of adjustments to our asset purchase program.\"\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Marqeta Inc. (MQ), plans on IPOing soon at a valuation of $12 billion offers card-issuing technology that lets businesses build out these functions. The company\u2019s largest client is Square (SQ), which accounted for roughly 70% of revenue last year.\n* Square (SQ) is considering making a hardware wallet for bitcoin, CEO Jack Dorsey, said in a tweet. (Jack Dorsey is also the CEO and co-founder of Twitter)\n* GE CEO Larry Culp says the deal to combine its jet-leasing unit and GE Capital Aviation Services with rival AerCap (AER) remains on track to close later this year or early next year. \n* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue\n* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. \n* Sorry, no price target upgrades today",

        "selftext": "Wassup shitheads,\n\nThis isn't financial advice or investing advice at all.\n\nIt's time to grab some freeze-dried bananas cause we are about to go to the fucking moon and you can't have conventional bananas up there.\n\nSoFi is an all-in-one digital banking app. What started as a student loan financer has developed quickly into a one-stop-shop for your financial needs. Want to invest in stocks? SoFi's app allows you to do that. Need a personal loan because you YOLO'd your life savings and just got margin called? Okay, you degenerate. SoFi's got you covered. Debit Cards? Credit Cards? Yep. Yep. \n\nOkay so now that we got through what the app is, let's get into the nitty-gritty of their performance.\n\n**The Good**\n\nNet Revenue saw 151% YoY growth\n\nMember growth is seeing it's 7th consecutive quarters of accelerating YoY Growth. \nCurrently, they are at 2.2 Million users **with a 110% YoY growth**\n\nTotal Products saw a **121% YoY growth, their financial service products saw a 273% YoY growth.**\n\nIf you're too smooth-brained to understand so far, they are gaining a shit ton of people and those people are using their products and printing their money. \n\nGalileo Accounts saw a **130% YoY growth**\nWhat are Galileo accounts? I'm so fucking happy you asked you beautiful smooth brain\n\nSoFi acquired Galileo, which is a really fucking nerdy SaaS that handles transactions. They handle direct deposits, transfers, bill paying, checking balances, etc. \nMeaning not only is SoFi acting as a fintech for consumers, but they are also a SaaS for businesses. Fuck Robinhood, but they are one of Galileo's customers. \n\nThey are EBITDA positive!?\n\n**The Leadership Team**\nI would be remiss to not mention the leadership team.\nCEO - Anthony \"motherfuckin\" Noto\nA quick breakdown of that guys life.\nGoldman Sachs associate turned partner because of his understanding of the internet industry.\nInterim CFO of the NFL.\nCOO of Twitter.\nCEO of SoFi.\nThink about it, the COO of twitter is now the CEO of a fintech that has the EXACT SAME DEMOGRAPHICS AS TWITTER.\nTHIS GUY FUCKS.\n\nChief Marketing Officer - Lauren Webb\nPreviously the Marketing VP at Intuit - Intuit owns TurboTax, Mint, and Quickbooks \nBefore that she was the Senior Brand Manager for COVERGIRL\n\nHead of Brand Strategy previously worked at a brand strategy firm, where he was the lead brand strategist for taco bell and PlayStation.\n\n**Previous Valuations**\n2015 - 1B Valuation from Softbank\n2019 - 4.6B Valuation from Qatar Investments\n2021 - 8.6B Valuation from Social Capital. Yes, I know about Chammath and we will talk about that.\n\n**The Bad**\nWith every bull there is as bear that wants to take your lunch money. In this case, there are actually a bunch of bears.\n\nThere are currently no short shares available because of how much this stock is shorted. It's fucking nuts so proceed with extreme caution. I'm not stupid though so I am not going to tell you a short squeeze, even though last Friday there was a 260% short interest rate. There won't be a short squeeze tho cause dilution and all that shit.\n\nChamath - Look I hate this guy as much as the next but think about it. CLOV was a company that needed to go public through a SPAC. I honestly think that SoFi didn't need to go through a SPAC. and honestly SPCE is cool but this is the only actual investment worth investing in with Chamath's portfolio. Again this is not investing advice.\n\nTL;DR\nThe short bus is leaving, get in while you can. SoFi is legit\nPositions \n34 Shares\n20c 6/4\n22.5 c 7/16\n20c 1/21/22",
