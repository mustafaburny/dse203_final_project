        "selftext": "I'm going to be brief with this one because it's pretty simple.\n\nHPQ has created a new way of manufacturing silicon~~e~~ for less money.  Why is this important?\n\n1. Silicon~~e~~ is expensive to make.\n2. Silicon~~e~~ plays a big part in EV batteries.  The cheaper it gets, the more it gets used in battery tech.  Leading to longer charge times, higher quality components, etc...\n\nSee where this is going?\n\nCome December, HPQ will begin construction on this new machine.  If it works, and the science says it will, they will be able to scale up Silicone production and provide it at a fraction of the cost of their competitors.\n\nStock is currently LOW.  Look for a bounce off of 47-50 cents. Great buying time right now during this lull time between production of the machinery, and its launch next year.\n\nI believe in these guys long term.  Do your DD and research them.  Also never listen to me or take any of my advice. GL FAM. ;p\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  AM  A MORON.  MEANT SILICON",

        "selftext": "I purchased HPQ at $20.61 the other day, and yep, it's dropped a little since then. I'm new to investing, but my thought process feels logical, and I fully plan to put more into this stock, and here are my thoughts.\n\nI initially purchased positions because they are announcing their Q4 earnings on the 24th, and I believe they've done really well this last quarter with sales of laptops from everyone working from home, as well as prolonged lockdowns being announced and less opportunity to begin working in shared spaces. Those who didn't already have a work laptop, definitely do now. To me, HP screams student/business compared to Dell, and other competitors that give off more of a casual use appeal (like Chromebooks).\n\nAfter purchasing, I stumbled across news that HP is supplying Shutterfly with 60 new digital presses that will use HP Software. I believe more than ever that Shutterfly has seen a boost in revenue because people are holding onto any good memory they can have during this pandemic. You better believe people have opted to print pictures of family members and display them around the home if they don't already, because of limited to no contact. \n\nShutterfly also offers a photo album creation service that our family has personally used during Christmas two times now, with amazing results and memories that will last forever. The service is perfect during this pandemic.\n\nIt seems to me the stock is undervalued, based on the last few years. It hasn't had a problem staying above $21 up until the pandemic. Even from the pandemic dropping HPQ to $13, the stock recovered quickly back up to $20 as of November. \n\nThat's all I got. Do your DD, I'm trying to do mine!",

        "selftext": "Because I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gnwgj4/the_phun_just_wont_stop_it_took_a_huge_dive/) among many but it has [this reply to it which made me curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gnwgj4/comment/frelygf). **SO TO THE FACTS:**\n\nAfter writing already June 14 that a deal Phunware (NASDAQ:PHUN) announced was suspicious, I asked a journalist to look into that deal, with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NASDAQ:HPE) which Phunware announced May 20.\n\nCaused its stock to jump from 0.67 to 1.57 after announcing this, *getting them above the Delisting Notice from NASDAQ they received April 17*.\n\n**IT'S FAKE. SOURCE:**\n\n[It's in the article linked to in my Tweet in my Thread here](https://twitter.com/olejonbj/status/1328789813378551809?s=19) or [read it directly here](https://www.miamiherald.com/article247234629.html).\n\nWhat would the market &amp; company situation have been for Phunware if investors knew back then?\n\nAfter e.g. [Honeywell confirmed the partnership Phunware claimed they have gotten with them was FAKE](https://twitter.com/honeywell/status/1313952992991870982?s=19), asking Phunware over a month ago to take it down, *but they don't*, getting a similar answer from HPE would be much bigger.\n\nThis is kind of a follow-up to an [article in The New Yorker I was a main source to](https://www.newyorker.com/news/campaign-chronicles/the-trump-campaigns-mobile-app-is-collecting-massive-amounts-of-voter-data), published September 13 (yes I have clearance to take credit in public as my name was supposed to be there - it accidentally was taken out), but the *Actual News Outlet behind this article*, has obviously, well, more resources. I've been contacted because of my Thread by journalists, though can't say which ones, but I do help out wherever I can. \n\nMy Thread was really just going to look into the app, but Phunware popped up immediately and had to be looked into. A lot outside my knowledge there, so little by little in the Thread, with help from some anonymous sources and journalists. As you may know, Twitter Threads can't be edited later, so, *better look from the Last to the First Tweet in the Thread*.\n\n*DISCLAIMER: I'm not an investor, not a US Citizen, although Phunware thinks so, that I am 2 actually, with my skills it's not that hard. Reason for posting here: I kept getting results from this subreddit on certain searches when searching basics.*",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks may continue to struggle Thanksgiving week amid Covid-19 outbreaks  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/stocks-may-continue-to-struggle-thanksgiving-week-amid-covid-19-outbreaks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks could continue to struggle with the twin themes of the spreading virus and a potentially robust recovery, once a vaccine is deployed next year.\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, the restrictions the spreading virus is imposing on the economy will be clear, when many Americans choose to stay at home over the Thanksgiving Day holiday and partake in much smaller celebrations.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn the Covid side, there will be more lockdowns, but I think the message is loud and clear. \u2018People: Don\u2019t be cavalier around Thanksgiving,\u2019\u201d said Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat. Thanksgiving traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season, an important time of the year for the economy which could be hobbled by Covid. The U.S. reported 182,000 new cases Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Lee said the market will continue to feel the push pull of the drag from the pandemic against the promise of recovery, seen in the rebound of cyclical stocks. Cyclical sectors industrials and materials were both up about 1% for the week, and financials were up a half percent. But tech and communications, both big tech and growth sectors that benefited from the stay-at-home trade, were lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think stocks are kind of consolidating and maybe it\u2019s going to go on for a couple of days,\u201d Lee said. He added that stocks could start to perk up late in the week, and investors are expecting stocks to head higher into year end. \u201cThe cyclicals have held up like champs, and the small caps, and value have been really holding up,\u201d Lee said.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 slightly lower, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%. The Russell 2000 was the star performer, with a gain of 2.4% for the week. The Russell is up 16% since the beginning of October.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P shot up sharply on Nov. 9 when Pfizer announced its vaccine as 95% effective, but it never regained that intraday high of 3,645 and has since traded in a sideways pattern. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 3,557 Friday, down 0.8% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan economists warned Friday that the \u201cwinter will be grim\u201d and they forecast that the restrictions due to the virus will drag on the economy, resulting in a negative first quarter. They expect a strong rebound in the second and third quarter, once the vaccine is distributed and an anticipated fiscal stimulus program takes hold.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s hard for some investors to look over that period and see the recovery. I think this is where we are now,\u201d said Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management CIO. She said the concern is how much damage the restrictions will do as the virus spreads at a record rate. \u201cThis is happening and with exponential force right now. It\u2019s just shocking to see the numbers and how state and local authorities are trying to deal with it in a variety of ways.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Nixon said she\u2019s very positive on the market longer term, and the economy will heal once the vaccine becomes available. She said fiscal stimulus from Washington would help.\n*****\n&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled he would again discuss a package with Democrats, and that funds that were being used for Fed programs could be diverted to a fiscal package.\n*****\n&gt; The Treasury Thursday indicated it would not continue five of the Fed\u2019s emergency program from when they expire at year end, surprising some in the markets. The Fed objected, but the markets took the development in stride, as traders expect the programs to be reinstated if financial conditions warrant it.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed releases the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and that could be important as traders are watching to see if the central bank reveals any detail of discussions on potential changes to its asset buying program. There is widespread speculation the Fed could tweak its $80 billion Treasury buying program at the December meeting to include more longer duration notes and bonds, a move that should hold down already low long-term rates.\n*****\n&gt; Also in the week ahead, there is some key data including personal income and spending and durable goods on Wednesday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Wednesday. There are also a few Fed speakers, who will be watched closely for any comments on the expiring programs.\n*****\n&gt; Any word on fiscal stimulus talks will get market attention, though there is skepticism anything will before next year. If a package is not passed, the unemployment benefits going to 12 million Americans will end at the end of December, and mortgage forbearance will end. Bank of America economists said if there is no stimulus package to prevent these things, there would be a 1.5 percentage point drag on first quarter growth.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe biggest thing we need to do is prevent bankruptcies and prevent unemployment from rising,\u201d Nixon said. She said the labor market has stalled, and it is important to avoid the deep scarring from bankruptcies.\n*****\n&gt; She said it is not too late for investors to get in on the rotation into growth,and some investors are worried they didn\u2019t get in on time. \u201cValue has so much to go to catch up on growth,\u201d she said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Dt851zw.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/z0QkpJg.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/C6pCv7E.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/oZTJQHz.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cvWS8RF.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8Ne631r.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zxKBLlJ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7rkxdbu.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oc4y8Xg.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Cr8W4RY.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZLXSTFW.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/6y6L8lt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Thanksgiving Trade\n\n&gt; Trading around Thanksgiving has a bullish tendency perhaps buoyed by the \u201choliday spirit.\u201d First published in the 1987 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&amp;P 500 decline was in 1964.\n\n&gt; Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 33 years since 1987, there have been 9 declines and 24 advances. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness on Monday or Tuesday of Thanksgiving week and selling into any subsequent rally by the end of Thanksgiving week. But as COVID-19 cases are on the rise again remain nimble as exogenous events like Greece\u2019s debt crisis in 2011 or 2018\u2019s fourth quarter rout can cancel Thanksgiving on Wall Street.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b5ce4af9292059c4d14b95baeef02b2c/d8ddf7af01919e17-07/s1280x1920/c4a8ff5b8e431b28dd3e24654e98204861afd94d.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Also of note is the change in the yearend rally. Prior to 1987, from the close of trading on the Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend, the S&amp;P 500 rallied only 20 times in 35 years. As Thanksgiving bullishness lost steam in 1987, the rally afterwards occurred more frequently. Since 1987, S&amp;P 500 has logged gains in 25 of 33 years from the close on Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Noteworthy Charts To Watch As Stocks Soar\n\n&gt; First, the big economic data point this week was retail sales. Although the headline number was a little light at 0.3% versus an expected 0.5% gain month-over-month, it still hit another new all-time high along the way (source: US Census Bureau). \u201cThe miss could be a sign the consumer is finally starting to slow amid record COVID-19 cases and more restrictions, with restaurant sales dipping for the first time since April,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; The good news is retail sales has hit a new high for five consecutive months, and the economy has never been in a recession after three consecutive new highs\u2014yet another sign the recession may be over, even if it hasn\u2019t been called officially.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; How strong has the recent rally been? Well, as of Tuesday\u2019s close, the S&amp;P 500 Index was on pace to have its second-best month of November ever. November isn\u2019t over yet of course, but this could open the door to a potential late-month snap back lower after a huge move, which would be perfectly normal and healthy.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; After Monday\u2019s record close, the S&amp;P 500 now has 24 new all-time high closes in 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The surge after the election was historic in many ways. The number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 recently making new monthly highs caught our attention. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, previous surges in new monthly highs opened the door for near-term weakness, but the weakness was a nice buying opportunity. In fact, a year after previous major breadth thrusts saw stocks higher every single time, not something we want to ignore.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, more than 85% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 recently were above their 200-day moving average\u2014another sign of impressive participation in this recent market strength. Once again, future results would suggest this extreme strength is a sign of potential future strong performance and weakness could be used as a buying opportunity.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Slow\n\n&gt; The October Retail Sales report missed expectations this morning on both a headline and core basis. In addition to the weaker than expected reading for October, September's report was also revised lower.\n\n&gt; Breadth in this month\u2019s report was also negative for the first time since April. Of the thirteen sectors tracked in the report, just five showed growth while eight declined. On the positive side, Non-Store retail was the main bright spot with m/m growth of 3.11%. That\u2019s the last thing every traditional retailer wants to hear and could be indicative of another wave of retrenchment on the part of consumers as the weather gets colder and case counts rise. Electronics and Appliances also reported strong sales growth likely aided by the launch of the iPhone 12. On the downside, Clothing and Sporting Goods both saw m/m declines of over 4%, while sales at General Merchandise retailers dropped 1.1%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-retail-by-category.png))**\n\n&gt; While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Finally A New High for Small Caps\n\n&gt; It only took over two years, but the Russell 2000 finally put in a new all-time high on Friday. As shown in the charts below, Friday marked the first all-time high on a closing basis since August 31st, 2018; a total of 553 trading days between highs. As shown in the second chart below, since the index began trading in the late 80's, that makes for the third-longest stretch without a new high. The only two longer periods were from March 10th, 2000 through April 2nd, 2004 and from July 16, 2007 through April 26th, 2011. Both of those streaks were nearly twice as long as the past two years' streak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-R2000.png))**\n\n&gt; The Russell 2000 is up another 2% to more fresh highs this morning, but the recent move to new highs has left the index very overbought. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, at Friday's close small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) are two of the most overbought major index ETFs after having seen some of the strongest performance over the past five days. Granted, as other large-cap indices like the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) were quicker to return to all-time highs earlier this year making them some of the stronger performers on the year, small caps have been laggards on a year to date basis. In other words, this year's weakest performers have been a factor in recent strength.

Stock returns so far this month have been extraordinary, and what makes the gains even more impressive is the fact that they came not from a starting point of a depressed bear-market environment but instead from a level that was already pretty close to record highs. Within the Russell 3000, which encompasses stocks with market caps of all sizes, the average MTD performance of stocks in the index is a gain of over 15%. Even in the large-cap S&amp;P 500, the average stock in the index has rallied more than 13.5% so far this month! Keep in mind too that these are just averages, and plenty of individual stocks are up multiples of that.\n\n&gt; In the Russell 3000, there are 51 stocks that are up over 50% so far in November. We don't have enough room to list them all, but the first table below shows the twenty top performers. Topping the list is Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX), which has rallied more than 349% this month! That's years worth of returns in sixteen days. Behind FPRX, there are two other stocks - Cooper Standard (CPS) and Revlon (REV) - which have both more than doubled. Many of the names listed below are unknown small caps, but a handful of names like Transocean (RIG), Coty (COTY), and Lyft (LYFT) are very well known.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-RAY-MTD.png))**\n\n&gt; In the large-cap S&amp;P 500, the gains haven't been as gaudy but are still impressive. As shown in the table below, the twenty top-performing stocks in the index are all up over 30% MTD. One sector well represented on this list is Energy with eight of the twenty names listed coming from that sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-SP-MTD1.png))**\n\n&gt; While just about every stock in the S&amp;P 500 is up this month, 18 stocks have managed to trade lower. Of these 18 stocks, only two - Hanesbrands (HBI) and NortonLifeLock (NLOK) - are down more than 5%. What's really interesting about this list, however, is that while Energy dominates the list of S&amp;P 500 winners, no sector dominates the list of losers as it's a diverse set of stocks spanning ten of the eleven GICS sectors. The only sector not represented is Industrials.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Worst-SP-MTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Long Term Averages Taken Out\n\n&gt; With equities having another strong day yesterday, a large number of stocks closed above their 200-DMAs. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, nearly 90% of the index closed above their long term moving averages. That was the highest percentage for the broad index since July 3rd, 2014. As equities pullback today, that reading is lower at 86.56% as of this writing which is still in the 90th percentile of readings since 1990.\n\n&gt; As shown in the charts below, the same applies on a sector by sector basis as well. Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Financials, Industrials, and Materials all currently boast readings above 90%. For Consumer Discretionary, there have been a few similarly high readings since the start of the month, and these have all been the highest on record since at least 1990. For other sectors, recent readings have similarly been at multi-year highs. Levels for Communication Services, Health Care, and Materials, are all their highest since September or late August, but for others, it has been much longer since we saw similar readings. For example, the last time Industrials saw as high of a percentage of stocks above their 200-DMA was way back in May of 2013, and for Consumer Staples, the last higher reading was in October of 2013. The sector that has the weakest number of stocks above their 200-DMAs is unsurprisingly Energy. Whereas yesterday exactly half of the stocks in the Energy sector finished above their 200-DMA, today less than a third remain above that level. Granted, that is far better than the end of October when not even 5% were above.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-200-Day.png))**\n\n&gt; In the table below, we show a list of the S&amp;P 500 Energy sector's components showing how far each is above/below their 200-day moving average as well as the MTD and YTD performance. Baker Hughes (BKR), Halliburton (HAL), and Marathon (MPC) are all the most elevated, currently above their 200-DMAs by double-digit percentages. TechnipFMC (FTI) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) have been the top performers in the sector, but they both still sit a few percentage points below their 50-DMAs even after rallies of more than 40% this month. The only Energy sector stock to have fallen in what has been a remarkably strong month is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is one of the best performers YTD with a decline of just 2.4%. Still, its recent decline leaves it as one of the furthest below its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-200-DMA-table2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks Flying Around the Globe\n\n&gt; Since bottoming on the last trading day of November, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has had a banner month so far this November rising 10.61% month to date. While there is still nearly two weeks left in the month, SPY is on pace for its best month since April. That is also in the top 1% of monthly moves of the past two decades. Other than April, the only month of the past 20 years that has seen a larger gain was October of 2011.\n\n&gt; Looking across the various country ETFs in our Global Macro Dashboard, there similarly have been some massive moves so far this month. Several of these have risen over 20% and only two, India (INDA) and China (MSHI), have risen by single-digit percentages. Spain (EWP), Italy (EWI), France (EWQ), Mexico (EWW), Norway (ENOR), and the UK (EWU) are all on pace for their best month of the past twenty years. Every other country ETF is also seeing monthly moves in the top decile of their respective 20-year ranges. For some of these, like Singapore (EWS) or Switzerland (EWL), this month has been the best month in over a decade.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111820-Country-ETF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 20th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a82SBTM16bw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.22.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VITapmanzRc))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$NIU** \n&gt; * **$DKS** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$DQ** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$TWST** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$BZUN** \n&gt; * **$DE** \n&gt; * **$SJM** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$A** \n&gt; * **$ICLK** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$JWN** \n&gt; * **$URBN** \n&gt; * **$NTNX** \n&gt; * **$DELL** \n&gt; * **$DSX** \n&gt; * **$WMG** \n&gt; * **$GPS** \n&gt; * **$AMWD** \n&gt; * **$FRO** \n&gt; * **$BLRX** \n&gt; * **$AMBA** \n&gt; * **$HPQ** \n&gt; * **$AEO** \n&gt; * **$ONE** \n&gt; * **$KFY** \n&gt; * **$ARWR** \n&gt; * **$PSTG** \n&gt; * **$CBT** \n&gt; * **$J** \n&gt; * **$TITN** \n&gt; * **$EV** \n&gt; * **$CHS** \n&gt; * **$DY** \n&gt; * **$CMCM**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/oc4y8Xg.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQbUx7g.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BMoOMlV.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/36x74Ed.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/l4A2Jya.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NDGIEPk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9El1A8i.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

The Dow ended in positive territory at (+1.53%)\n* The best performing sector was Energy(+5.14%) while Real Estate(-0.05%)was the worst performer.\n* Specifically, the General Services Administration said it will release funds to help the Biden administration transition into office, Wells Fargo (WFC 28.60, +2.30, +8.8%) was double upgraded to Outperform from Underperform at Raymond James, and numerous retailers reported better-than-expected earnings reports. \n* Dollar Tree (DLTR 111.35, +13.74, +14.1%) shares rose 14% following its earnings results, but truthfully, most of the earnings reactions weren't that great since the news may have already been priced in. Shares of Best Buy (BBY 113.54, -8.50, -7.0%) fell 7% despite beating top and bottom-line estimates. \n* There were also semblances of greed and froth in the market. For example, shares of Tesla (TSLA 555.38, +33.53, +6.4%) surged 6% on no specific news to bring the company's market capitalization to over $500 billion. Hedging interest remained relatively suppressed with the CBOE Volatility Index (-1.02, -4.5%) closing at 21.64. \n* Looking ahead, investors will receive a massive amount of data on Wednesday, most notably the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, New Home Sales for October, Personal Income and Spending for October, and the FOMC Minutes from the November meeting.  \n## Index Summary\n **S&amp;P 500 :** (+1.61%); **NasDaq :** (+1.43%); \\\n**Russell 2000 :** (+1.88%); **Dow :** (+1.53%); \\\n**Vix :** 22.66 (-4.5%); [-4.71%]; {-7.72%} \n## Sectors Summary \n_Three highest sectors for today were -_ \n **Energy:** (+5.14%); **Financials:** (+3.5%); **Materials:** (+2.49%)\n _Three lowest sectors for today were -_\n **Real Estate:** (-0.05%); **Health Care:** (+0.29%); **Consumer Staples:** (+0.68%)\n ## Commodities/Futures \\\n_**Top 5 Highest Commodity % Changes \u2013 -**_ \\\n\n1\\.
