        "selftext": "Coda code of conduct\n\n1)\tBuy calls on the best companies in the world 5-10% OTM six months or more until expiration.  FAANG, MSFT, TSLA, NIKE, WMT, JPM, PYPL, AXP, BABA, NVDA, AMD, SBUX, CRM.  Or ETF\u2019s like MGK, FNGS, and SOXX if you don\u2019t have the capital to get in on single equity options.\n\n2)\tHold for at least half of the 6 months until expiration.  \n\n3)\tThe long term goal is to buy and hold shares.  This is what rich people do.  Hard assets that can\u2019t quickly evaporate like options can.  Same choice of companies as above.  Just the good shit. Hold assets that slowly grow. Cash gang = chicken coop.\n\n4)\tIn order to protect your winnings, make sure half of your account is shares.  \n\n5)\tUse margin sparingly.  Less than half of what they are offering you.\n\n6)\tIf you need to do a weekly just to have a little casino thrill in your life it should be less than a grand.  Weeklies are not how real wealth is built.  But it\u2019s ok if you see a strong trend but don\u2019t YOLO your whole stack.  That\u2019s just dumb.\n\n7)\tSmoke weed every day.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSee, I got up to six figures buying puts in mid-march. But then I lost like 3/4\u2019s of my stack staying short when the market bottomed on March 23rd.  So I needed to come up with a system to protect my gains.  Hence, the Coda code of conduct.\n\nFor example, I started with $75k but now I have around $162k in shares.  So, no matter what happens I\u2019ll likely be ahead of where I started.  I\u2019m slightly out of balance because I have more options than shares.  $196k in calls vs $162k in shares.  So I\u2019m like $34k out of balance, somewhat breaking my own rule.  So I\u2019m living a little dangerously until 9/18 at which time I\u2019m going to execute 4 apple calls and 2 msft calls.  Which will bring my share total up like $65k.  I might have to sell some options so I have the buying power in my account to get this done.  At that point, I will have more shares than options so I\u2019ll be green lit to buy more calls.  This is how I enforce discipline on myself to not get to overextended.  Leverage, but not too much leverage.  Good luck to us all!",

        "selftext": "https://nathantankus.substack.com/p/the-stock-market-is-less-disconnected\n\nIf you're not following Nathan Tankus by now, you're missing out on key, relevant economic commentary. \n\n&gt;There is one big area you can say that the stock market is disconnected from the economic outlook\u2014 size. By definition, it tends to be bigger companies which are on the stock market. So inevitably the stock market can\u2019t capture the thousands of small businesses that are failing. Yet, even here, disaggregation of the S&amp;P tells us a lot. Again, there is a wide and sharp dispersion right now, with average returns for large firms a lot higher than smaller firms. This wasn\u2019t the case in February. More than half the companies in the index have less than $25 billion in market capitalization, and the average year-to-date return for all these companies (equally-weighted) is negative.  \n\n&gt;Once returns are broken down by sales growth, we see dramatic differences based on sales growth and decline. Returns are in fact highest for companies with the strongest year-over-year sales growth. Among those with sales growth greater than 20% are familiar companies like Amazon and Netflix, but also much smaller companies like Nvidia and Paypal. In other words, tech stock returns are being driven by tech sales.\n\n&gt;This does not mean that stocks, especially the ones that have really run up in price, are avoiding overvaluation. However, that is a different question. If there are overvalued stocks, it is likely caused by companies that have seen the biggest sales growth leading to overoptimistic expectations of future sales growth. Overconfidence reflects the economy and beliefs about the economy, while none of us know the future. But this is a generic point, not an argument for setting aside consideration of the stock market. Stocks with the highest valuation, as measured by forward price to earnings ratio, have in fact gained the most year-to-date.",

        "selftext": "Listen idiots, when the market goes full retard and becomes this volatile, you don't have to become a retard with it. Instead of throwing thousands on hourlies or on retarded OTM FDs expiring this friday, buy 1-2 long term calls or LEAPS. No, your fucking 10/16 or 9/20 calls aint LEAPS. LEAPs are options contracts with expiration dates that are longer than one year. Don't go all in at once. Shit is expensive but much much safer. LEAPS have a juicy delta and theta will be on your side. I know, this is unheard of on this sub but it's a thing. I'd recommend buying a LEAP as close to ATM as possible. Why? So you can sell weekly OTM calls on green days and profit off your fellow retards. You are basically converting your LEAP into a vertical spread and your long leg will act as collateral if shit goes wrong. If this is too technical for you, and are too retarded to google Options 101, just buy OTM 2022 LEAPs. There's a lot of shit on discount right now; $PYPL, $MSFT, $NVDA, $BA, etc. Since we are living on retarded times, be ready to average down when the market is period-red.

        "selftext": "I see Microsoft, Amazon, and Alibaba as the 3 best \"big tech\" stocks out there today in terms of safety vs upside potential. With that said, I am struggling to pick which one I like more, and was wondering if you guys could give me your opinion. I have provided my assessment of each below-\n\n**Alibaba-** \n\nThe \"Amazon &amp; PayPal of China\", Alibaba is growing even faster than Amazon and yet has a Microsoft-level PE ratio of 30. Propped up by the Chinese government and tied to the future of China, which I see as more than likely continuing to grow into a global superpower. \n\nWith that said, it carries obvious risks. Americans need to buy on the Hong Kong exchange or else they risk owning fake shares. Alibaba could be cooking their books and we would have little legal protection/suing power. \n\nThe Chinese economy could slow down or have a Japan-type economic collapse, though that's unlikely in my opinion due to their superior ability to protect themselves militarily from US economic sabotage like we did to Japan with the Plaza Accords \n\nI see Alibaba as clearly the highest risk-highest reward of the 3 stocks listed here. The risks are extreme, but the fact remains that if it was priced like Amazon, BABA would be 300% higher than it is right now. The upside is higher than practically any tech company out there right now...but so is the downside.\n\n**Amazon-** \n\nAmazon has massive and sustainable revenue growth from its eCommerce business, but this is a relatively low margin business in the short term. However, with automation and an improving supply-chain strategy (where they own the entire supply chain and cut out UPS/Fedex), they are gonna start improving margins and revenue growth will turn into actual gross profit. \n\nAWS will continue to grow alongside the broader cloud market, though they will have to contend with stronger competition from Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud going forward. \n\nI see advertising as a very strong future growth driver as well.\n\nThis is one of the fastest growing companies on Earth in terms of revenue and I see them as a potential world conqueror ala Genghis Khan. \n\nBiggest risk factors going forward are political ones, the CEO is a little too vocal for his own good and he has a target on his back from progressive politicians due to his immense wealth. I don't see any near-term risks facing them, but could easily see them growing to old Microsoft/AT&amp;T monopoly levels and then needing to be broken up. \n\n**Microsoft-** \n\nProbably the most stable big tech company there is. Strongly diversified revenue between gaming industry, cloud, office suite, etc. It would take a meteor striking the Earth for Microsoft to go bankrupt, and maybe even that might not be enough, with how intertwined it is with global b2b and government  contracts. Larger than Amazon, but seems to have no targets on its back politically. \n\nAdditionally, actually offers a decent dividend, and valuation is a little more down to Earth than Amazon's (30 P/E vs 120). Azure is growing rapidly, and they are trimming the fat of their business (such as their retail locations) indicating they want to focus on their winners instead of trying to salvage their losers, something I see as a positive. \n\nWith that said, their actual revenue growth (22%) isn't as hyperbolic as Amazon's (40.23%). In general, they are less imperialistic than Amazon (which sometimes actually serves in their favor regarding avoiding political targeting and allowing for relationships with big companies like Walmart). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR- I see Alibaba as an amazon-esque tech company with ludicrous upside potential, hindered by equally significant geo-political risk factors. \n\nAmazon as an imperialist juggernaut of the tech industry which more than likely has an incredibly bright future ahead of it, but that carries with it heightened risk of political targeting and general risk from having such a high p/e ratio. \n\nMicrosoft has strong growth prospects and a relatively reasonable valuation for a big tech player. However, upside is not as strong as Alibaba or Amazon. I see them as virtually risk free, but at the cost of that aforementioned lower upside.\n\nWhat do you guys think about my assessment? Do you have any opinions on which of these 3 I should go long on, or do you think I should just mix all of them or something along those lines? \n\nCurrently positions relating to these stocks- long Microsoft 20 grand, retirement accounts are split 50/50 between VGT (heavy Apple/Microsoft weighting) and QQQ.",

        "selftext": "Yes,  NKLA seems shady as hell.  When I first heard of Nikola, It reminded me  of J. K. Rowling's agent declining to read the Harry Potter manuscript.  \"The title tells me all I need to know.\"  He said.\n\nThe  name Nikola screams \"Me too! Me too!\"  And when I heard it was Hydrogen  powered, I closed that book. Anyone who's done the energy equation on  hydrogen power knows it's not a compelling technology.\n\nBut,  NKLA surprised me. It's no small feat to get a company listed on the  exchange. Maybe there's something happening here after all.\n\nI'm  sure we've all heard the joke about the guy who looks at his loser son  and realizes he has to do something. So he calls Bill Gates and says,  \"your daughter is going to marry my son.\"\n\nBill gates says, \"No she's not.\"\n\nSo the man says, \"But he's the president of the world bank.\"\n\nBill says, \"ok.\"\n\nThen the man calls the world bank and says, \"My son is going to be the president of the world bank.\"\n\nThey say, \"No he's not.\"\n\nAnd the man says, \"But he's married to Bill Gates' daughter.\"\n\nSo the world bank says, \"ok.\" And everyone lived happily ever after.\n\nI  can't help but wonder if Trevor has something like that going on with  NKLA. The name is a good marketing gimmick. He's pulled off an  impressive operation so far. He probably wishes we'd all shut up so he  can get there, like Molly Ringwald in that movie The Pickup Artist.  (Y'all seen that movie, Right? Classic.)\n\nI'm  sure bigger long-shots have paid off in the past, probably only because  no one was looking too hard at it.

        "selftext": "TLDR: \nSalesforce (CRM) is the perfect company to buy during a tech bubble and is riding the COVID wave.  Their e-commerce platform, which is has about 3x the market share of the closest CRM competitor, is benefiting from the shift from Brick and Mortar to online sales.  Humana is now using Salesforce to deliver telemedicine.  The recent inclusion of CRM in the Dow is going to force buying.  Salesforce has a tech focused investment fund that is making big tendies.\n\nCRM 1/22/21 250c\n\nImagine the typical Black Friday.  Crowds shoulder to shoulder to get the best deals.  Thanks to COVID that\u2019s not happening this year.  Those sales are shifting online.  Salesforce (CRM) has a 21% share of Customer Relationship Management market, which among other things, is the e-commerce platform for online retailers.  Salesforce is taking a tiny % of online sales from each retailer.  You know there\u2019s going to be a crazy amount of emails sent out this holiday season.  Guess who gets paid based on volume of emails?\n\n\nSalesforce was just added to the Dow.  The Dow is weighted by share price.  As CRM increases, reweighing of the Dow caused forced buying.  \n\nAlso in the same link ATT and PayPal are recent new customers.\n\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/salesforce-was-just-added-to-the-dow-jones-industrial-average-and-its-q2-update-shows-why\n\nSalesforce (CRM) has a technology focused investment fund.  During a tech bubble, you want to own a basket of smaller tech companies, especially if there\u2019s IPOs and acquisitions.  CRM made a bunch of money from the NCNO and ZM IPOs.\n\n\u201cWe're the leader in cloud computing helping others to become the same. Since 2009, we've funded over 400 entrepreneurs building the next generation of enterprise technology.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.salesforce.com/company/ventures/portfolio/\n\nSalesforce is working with Humana to deliver telemedicine.  COVID has forced doctors and insurance companies to get comfortable with telemedicine.  That should jumpstart the trend going forward.\n\nhttps://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Humana-Selects-Salesforce-to-Deliver-Connected-Personalized-Healthcare/default.aspx\n\nApparently CRM was 1 of 7 tech stocks that were included in a $1 billion option purchase.\n\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/markets/whats-behind-last-weeks-meltup-vix-citadel-explains\n\nI want to own CRM for the Q3 earnings announcement in December.  E-commerce is having a big quarter.  The internal investment fund should be strong.  Headlines will be full of stories about online retail.  The stock is taking a breather after the huge post earnings run up.  I bought today and intend to hold through Q3 earnings.  During a bubble, I think the market cap could inflate from the current $250 billion to a $1 trillion.",

The goal is to consistently invest and hold. No panic sells.

        "selftext": "Okay fellas. I'm sick of seeing the same shit here. You guys turned into Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, and Amazonbets. Here's a nugget of gold for you that most of you will ignore. Alibaba's financial/payment platform, Ant financial, spun off years ago. What's so great about them? Imagine purchasing shares in Visa and PayPal simultaneously. Theyre virtually the only game in town in China. Theyre seeking more than 30 billion in their IPO, making this the largest IPO in history with way more upside than Aramco ( 2nd largest IPO ever). They've filed for an IPO but they've refused to list on the NYSE. How do you buy? Thats a two-fold answer....if you only have Robinhood or Webull than you're fucked (sorta). You need a legitimate platform like Etrade or Charles Schwab. If you give a shit, you'll figure it out. Whats the second way to buy you ask? Alibaba has a 30% stake in Ant and they're destined to rise alongside Ant. Pick a call and strike date at least 90 days out. Your upside using option 1 is much higher buy option 2 will still make you a solid return. Please post the gain porn if you follow my advice. I'll do the same.\n\nTLDR: Read it fuckface",

        "selftext": "Square shares are up 146% in 2020 so far, and analysts at Oppenheimer think the stock can still go higher.\n\nOn Thursday, Oppenheimer upgraded Square ([SQ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ?p=SQ&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) to outperform, with a price target of $185. (The all-time high was $166 on Sept. 1; shares were trading at around $152 on Thursday afternoon.) The upgrade is based on the growth of Square\u2019s Cash App, and on the company\u2019s opportunity to help merchants transition to e-commerce.\n\nBut really, the note is a post-pandemic vote of confidence.\n\nAs Oppenheimer writes, the COVID-19 pandemic has initiated a \u201cmassive shift in digital commerce, requiring merchants to rapidly adopt omni-channel solutions.\u201d Of course, it was already obvious before the pandemic that the retail landscape was barreling toward e-commerce, but the pandemic has sent the trend into hyperdrive. [Walmart, Target, and Best Buy reported enormous surges](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-and-target-huge-ecommerce-gains-are-a-blaring-siren-to-brickandmortar-retail-192709224.html) (100%+) in digital sales in Q2; online-only retailers [Etsy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/etsy-ceo-on-huge-q-2-etsy-is-becoming-much-more-mainstream-181632322.html) and [Wayfair](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wayfair-stock-is-up-250-this-year-193131685.html) blew out their Q2 earnings; [Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods is thriving](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dicks-sporting-goods-is-wildly-outperforming-amid-the-pandemic-195504143.html) thanks to a combination of online sales and curbside pickup.\n\nAll of those are big retail names. Square\u2019s bread and butter are SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses), which also need to immediately prioritize their e-commerce presence, if they didn\u2019t already. Hundreds of thousands of small business have shut down due to the pandemic, but those that have survived will need to beef up their digital presence.\n\nOppenheimer believes Square is well-suited to serve those small businesses coming out of the pandemic, positioning Square \u201cfor outsized share gains as economic activity normalizes.\u201d\n\nOppenheimer pegs Square\u2019s TAM (total addressable market, [the \u201cit\u201d tech stat of the moment](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/what-cannabis-and-fake-meat-have-in-common-right-now-180741286.html)) at $160 billion, and within that, puts Cash App\u2019s TAM at $63 billion, noting that \u201cby reinvesting profits from prior Cash App cohorts, combined with its seller ecosystem, Square can develop significant network effects and products that will be challenging for other neo-banks to replicate in the digital wallet space.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Square has an advantage over banks in the mobile payments race.\n\nOppenheimer also notes the \u201cimpressive volume and gross profit growth\u201d of Cash App\u2019s bitcoin trading feature. Square [enabled bitcoin trading within Cash App in 2018](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-square-embrace-bitcoin-brilliant-182530364.html). It reaped $875 million in bitcoin revenue in the second quarter, up 600% year over year, and $17 million in bitcoin gross profit, up 711% year over year. ($17 million is small for a company with $4.17 billion in revenue in 2019, but the growth is the point.) Oppenheimer cites the growth in bitcoin revenue as proof of \u201cthe scalability in the Cash App business model.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has been a noted (and [some believe problematic](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-dorseys-love-of-bitcoin-could-be-a-problem-for-square-122742500.html)) obsession of CEO Jack Dorsey.\n\nSquare has always touted that it serves both sides of the small business equation: sellers (i.e., businesses, through its point of sale hardware, payroll software, and Square Capital loan business) and shoppers (consumers paying with Square devices and/or using Cash App). Oppenheimer writes that this \u201ctwo-sided network\u201d will make Square \u201ca structural winner during the recovery.\u201d\n\nOf course, there\u2019s an obvious downside case against Square: \u201cEconomic pressures persist longer than anticipated\u201d if the pandemic drags on or even worsens, hitting small businesses harder; \u201ccompetitive responses dampen growth,\u201d and Square certainly has big competitors, including FIS (which acquired Worldpay last year), PayPal, ShopKeep, and Shopify; and if \u201cnew product launches and adoption slow,\u201d which will be up to Dorsey and Square\u2019s own pace of innovation.\n\nOppenheimer sees Square profit growing at a 37% annual rate from the end of 2020 through the end of 2022. Square was [Yahoo Finance\u2019s Company of the Year in 2018](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/square-yahoo-finances-2018-company-133124167.html).\n\n\u2014\n\n**Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance and closely covers fintech and payments.

        "selftext": "Position: FEZ Jan15'21 42 PUT\n\nIt's time to get bearish boys. I will never bet against America because it's the greatest fucking country on earth, but our Euro brethren are fair game. \n\nThe Eurostoxx index have largely traded equally or somewhat better than the SNP thus far. I have taken a short position against the Eurostoxx due to the following reasons:\n\nHard Brexit: Two weeks ago prime minister Johnson introduced a bill that is in direct contradiction to previous agreements. His defense was basically that Europe can go eat shit, no reason needed. Germany is Europe's enforcer, however the COVID pandemic has lead to a dry run of a hard brexit and German exports largely survived. This time around they will be much less likely to fight against a hard Brexit seeing as how it's been in place for the majority of the year in any case.\n\nBanking scandals: Obvious reason. The EU economy is heavily reliant on it's banking sector. This sector is terrible and will continue lower.\n\nCOVID peeking it's ugly head again: The seven day MA of new covid cases are at all time highs in EU countries. I could give a shit about COVID, but our EU brethren are likely to implement another round of lockdowns, much more so than the USA.  American case counts are down but Europe has steadily been ticking higher.\n\nNo tech: No Amazon, no Adobe, no PayPal to save their market.\n\nCurrency: In a time of severely limited economic growth countries cannot afford to let their currencies rally, we've seen this before. I causes severe deflation and weakened financial asset prices.\n\nLack of fiscal stimulus: As usual the EU will be late to the party with further fiscal stimulus.\n\nThe timing seems perfect to open this position and option volatility on FEZ is still low.

        "selftext": "Just recently started trading back seriously back in June of this year.   I brought a few stocks just based on hype, high dividend yield,  and even brought a few stocks at their highs.  As you would guess,  dividend cuts,  all time lows,  and in the red.

I have a few that I did do dd on and the are doing well.  \n\nWhat I really want to do is consolidate down to maybe 4-6 of my stocks that I feel are the future in terms of post pandemic.  SQ,  PYPL,  DOCU, TDOC, etc.  Trying to keep up with 12 stocks is too much right now.  \n\nMy only issue with selling the positions I currently have that I brought for reasons other than my own research is I may miss out on gains if they go up in a few months or years.  The other side of it is telling me sell and take on more shares of stocks that holds my interest after extensive research.  I feel the latter is a better decisions because I feel it\u2019s guaranteed growth regardless of speculation?  \n\nAny suggestions?",

        "selftext": "Yes, NKLA seems shady as hell.  When I first heard of Nikola, It reminded me of J. K. Rowling's agent declining to read the Harry Potter manuscript. \"The title tells me all I need to know.\"  He said. \n\nThe name Nikola screams \"Me too! Me too!\"  And when I heard it was Hydrogen powered, I closed that book. Anyone who's done the energy equation on hydrogen power knows it's not a compelling technology.  \n\nBut, NKLA surprised me. It's no small feat to get a company listed on the exchange. Maybe there's something happening here after all. \n\nI'm sure we've all heard the joke about the guy who looks at his loser son and realizes he has to do something. So he calls Bill Gates and says, \"your daughter is going to marry my son.\"  \n\nBill gates says, \"No she's not.\" \n\nSo the man says, \"But he's the president of the world bank.\"  \n\nBill says, \"ok.\"\n\nThen the man calls the world bank and says, \"My son is going to be the president of the world bank.\" \n\nThey say, \"No he's not.\" \n\nAnd the man says, \"But he's married to Bill Gates' daughter.\"\n\nSo the world bank says, \"ok.\" And everyone lived happily ever after.\n\nI can't help but wonder if Trevor has something like that going on with NKLA. The name is a good marketing gimmick. He's pulled off an impressive operation so far. He probably wishes we'd all shut up so he can get there, like Molly Ringwald in that movie The Pickup Artist. (Y'all seen that movie, Right? Classic.) \n\nI'm sure bigger long-shots have paid off in the past, probably only because no one was looking too hard at it. Paypal, for instance...",

And CEO Dan Schulman has indicated PayPal is also interested in launching its own tap-to-pay service.\n\nSquare, which has seen tremendous usage growth for its Cash App in recent months, could also conceivably launch a tap-to-pay service if it gains access to iPhone NFC chips. Square could both integrate the service with its Cash App and -- given that its card readers already support Apple Pay and Google Pay -- push a software update to its mobile point-of-sale (POS) apps that allows the many businesses that use Square\u2019s POS platform to support a Square tap-to-pay service.",
