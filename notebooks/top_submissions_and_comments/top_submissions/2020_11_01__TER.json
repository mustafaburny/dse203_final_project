I see that the one with the lowest TER is Lyxor (0.12%) and the iShares is one of the highest (0.50%).\n\nI see that a lot of people around me buy iShares. I assume that sometimes the broker does not offer Lyxor and so people would buy iShares, and probably the broker gets a kickback. But it appears that a lot of times the broker offers both and people sometimes go for iShares.\n\nI was wondering if there is ever a good reason in the example above to go for the more expensive TER product (iShares) instead of Lyxor?\n\nThank you all :)",
